The BMA is the national professional\u000a        organization for doctors and medical students in the UK with over\u000a        150,000 members. Its Medical Ethics committee is regarded as one of the\u000a        leading authorities on ethical issues in medicine nationally and\u000a        internationally, setting standards and giving ethical advice to\u000a        practising clinicians, contributing to the formation of BMA policy and\u000a        producing materials to shape public debate and policy.\u000a      the Medical Research Council's Stem Cell Bank Steering Committee\u000a        (on which he has served since 2002). The committee oversees the work of\u000a        the UK Stem Cell Bank and is responsible for approving all use of stem\u000a        cell lines in the UK. This includes developing and monitoring the\u000a        implementation of a code of practice governing the use of the Stem Cell\u000a        Bank and of stem cell lines, reviewing on a case by case basis all\u000a        applications to deposit and use embryonic stem cell lines, and providing\u000a        briefings at least annually on this work to Government ministers.\u000a        Research approved by the committee has led to the development of stem\u000a        cell therapies to treat certain forms of cancer as well as early-stage\u000a        clinical trials of stem cell therapy for those recovering from strokes.\u000a      the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists' Ethics\u000a          Committee (on which he has served since 2000, with his appointment\u000a        renewed in 2010). The RCOG seeks to advance medical training as well as\u000a        producing clinical guidelines and reports relevant to its field on\u000a        issues such as abortion, cloning and sex selection. Its Ethics Committee\u000a        advises the RCOG's Council on ethical and legal issues, provides\u000a        guidance for the College's members, reviews coverage of ethical issues\u000a        in training and educational materials produced by the RCOG, and advises\u000a        on the RCOG's relationships with industry.\u000a      the Nuffield Council on Bioethics (on which he has served\u000a        since 2009). The Council is an independent body funded by the Nuffield\u000a        Foundation, the Wellcome Trust and the Medical Research Council which\u000a        has an internationally recognized profile for its work in advising\u000a        policy-makers and promoting public understanding of key issues in\u000a        bioethics through the production of reports, briefing papers and other\u000a        educational materials.\u000a    \u000a    In addition to their standard, on-going work, Gill's active participation\u000a      in these committees during this period has involved him in:\u000a    \u000a      the detailed re-drafting of the third edition of the BMA's Medical\u000a            Ethics Today (published 2012), the Association's handbook on\u000a        dealing with ethical and legal dimensions of medicine, which is regarded\u000a        as a primary source of guidance for medical practitioners in the UK. In\u000a        particular, Gill made substantial contributions to the chapters on\u000a        `contraception, abortion and birth', `assisted reproduction', `caring\u000a        for patients at the end of life' and `euthanasia and physician assisted\u000a        suicide' (see source #2).\u000a      a BMA working party on organ donation which influenced legislation on\u000a        organ donation opt- out with safeguards that was adopted\u000a          by the Welsh Assembly on 2 July 2013, and whose report Building\u000a            on Progress: Where Next for Organ Donation in the UK?\u000a        (published 2012) has been widely cited in national media and policy\u000a        debates (see source #2)\u000a      contributing to the writing of the British Medical Association's Ethical\u000a            Decision-Making for Doctors in the Armed Forces: A Tool-Kit\u000a        (published 2012), which is used to train medical professionals before\u000a        their deployment to war zones (see source #2).\u000a      developing guidance by the RCOG on female cosmetic genital surgery and\u000a        premature, neo-natal care (see source #3).\u000a      the review of more than a hundred applications to the MRC to store and\u000a        use embryonic stem cell lines (see source #4).\u000a      the Nuffield Council on Bioethics Working Party on biofuels which\u000a        published its report, Biofuels:\u000a            Ethical Issues, in April 2011. Authoring the sections of the\u000a        report on the common good (which drew on Gill 2002), he argued that\u000a        whilst biofuels are of comparatively little value to society today it is\u000a        still important to develop them now in the interests of the common good\u000a        of future generations and the environment more widely. The report itself\u000a        was widely reported in national media (see source #1). It was\u000a        subsequently strongly endorsed by the Chair of the Commons Select\u000a        Committee for Energy and Climate Change, Tim Yeo MP, and its core\u000a        arguments were closely reflected in the Government's UK Bioenergy\u000a          Strategy published in April 2012 (see source #5). The notion of\u000a        the common good introduced by Gill into this report was subsequently\u000a        adopted and used in Nuffield Council reports on Human\u000a            Bodies: Donation for Medicine and Research (2011) and Novel\u000aTechniques\u000a            for the Prevention of Mitochondrial DNA Disorders: An Ethical Review\u000a        (2012), for which he was a member of the consultative sub-group.\u000a        Gill has since been appointed to the Nuffield Council's working party on\u000a        Children and Clinical Research.\u000a    \u000a    Testimonial evidence clearly demonstrates these committees' recognition\u000a      of Gill's distinctive contribution as a theological ethicist, drawing on\u000a      his areas of research expertise (see sources #2- #5).\u000a    For example, Dame Suzi Leather, chair of the RCOG ethics committee,\u000a      writes that `Robin [Gill] has tremendous impact on the committee. He\u000a      speaks with wide knowledge and authority commanding the attention and\u000a      respect of all members. He articulates ethical perspectives clearly, drawn\u000a      from his own research in ethics and theology (using concepts such as the\u000a      common good and compassion), enabling him to carry clinical committee\u000a      members effortlessly through a complex argument towards a well thought\u000a      through conclusion.'\u000a    Rob Buckle, Head of Regenerative Medicine at the MRC, has written: `Robin\u000a      [Gill] has worked on behalf of the Committee since its establishment in\u000a      December 2002, and, as a theologian, has provided an important\u000a      contribution to the breadth of view needed to provide effective oversight\u000a      for this field of medical research. For example, [he] has helped ensure\u000a      that due consideration is given to the views of those who have principled\u000a      objections to embryonic research, while also speaking up for those with\u000a      serious disabilities who might eventually benefit from this research.\u000a      [...] His measured and thoughtful contributions are well respected by the\u000a      other Committee members, and his ability to lucidly present a theological\u000a      viewpoint in the context of largely technical discussions has led to him\u000a      being one of the longest serving members of the Committee.'\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Drawing on his longstanding research in theology and medical ethics,\u000a      Robin Gill has been an active member of four of the most important\u000a      national health-care ethics and bioethics committees in the UK (the\u000a      British Medical Association's Ethics Committee, the Medical Research\u000a      Council's Stem Cell Bank Steering Committee, the Nuffield Council on\u000a      Bioethics, and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists\u000a      Ethics Committee). Through this work he has produced the content of some\u000a      of the most widely-used ethical guidance and training by medical\u000a      practitioners in the UK, contributed to a working group that has led to\u000a      the Welsh Assembly establishing an opt-out organ donation system in Wales\u000a      (the first part of the UK to do so), been an active member of the\u000a      committee which determines what forms of stem cell research are authorized\u000a      in the UK, and shaped major policy reports on bioethics. Given the scale\u000a      of his contribution and the influence of the organizations with which he\u000a      has worked, this has arguably made Gill one of the most important\u000a      influences on professional medical ethics and bioethics in the UK from the\u000a      field of theology and religious studies during this REF cycle.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Political","Institution":"\u000a    University of Kent\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Kent (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Kent","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007150}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000aGill, R.

In contrast to the\u000a      work of Stanley Hauerwas and John Milbank, he has argued that there are\u000a      empirical and theological grounds for believing that worshipping\u000a      communities foster distinctive virtues through their particular traditions\u000a      and practices which can also be found more generally in pluralist\u000a      societies. This argument provides an important basis for considering how\u000a      theological accounts of moral virtues can engage in a critical and\u000a      sympathetic dialogue with moral discussions in secular contexts, in which\u000a      theological ethics becomes a potential resource for stimulating moral\u000a      reflection in contexts beyond faith communities and not merely a critique\u000a      of secular moral life.\u000a    The relevance of this wider argument to medical and bioethical contexts\u000a      was subsequently examined in his monograph Health Care and Christian\u000a        Ethics (2002), which built on his earlier work on euthanasia and\u000a      gene therapies in Gill (1997, 1998). In Health-Care and Christian\u000a        Ethics, Gill drew on healing narratives in the Synoptic Gospels to\u000a      argue that Christian ethics should emphasize four core moral virtues in\u000a      framing approaches to health-care and bioethics: compassion, care, faith\u000a      and humility. Recognizing that these virtues can also be found in other\u000a      religious and humanistic traditions, Gill argued that the Christian\u000a      tradition clarifies moral virtues which could form the basis for ethical\u000a      reflection on health-care and bioethics from a range of religious and\u000a      secular perspectives. Furthermore, such attention to moral virtues,\u000a      grounded in these traditions, could enrich ethical secular reflection on\u000a      health-care and bioethics. Without this, he argued, secular perspectives\u000a      are hampered by the limits of secular rationality, the lack of a wider\u000a      cosmos of meaning in which to situate moral claims, and the challenge of\u000a      accounting for how self-interested moral agents find the capacity to\u000a      undertake moral action. In Healthcare and Christian Ethics, Gill\u000a      went on to demonstrate the significance of these four core moral virtues\u000a      in framing responses to a wide range of issues, including health-care\u000a      rationing, euthanasia, genetics and gene therapy, stem cell research,\u000a      withholding and withdrawing nutrition from patients in a persistent\u000a      vegetative state and new forms of biotechnology. For example, Gill argued\u000a      that the moral virtue of humility should play an important role for the\u000a      discussion of new developments in stem cell research and biotechnologies,\u000a      in which ethical positions should be found that avoided both\u000a      over-confident and ungrounded scientific assertions of the benefits of\u000a      such work as well as hyperbolic religious claims about their potential\u000a      risks. In Healthcare and Christian Ethics, Gill also argued that\u000a      the concept of `the common good', drawn from Catholic social ethics, could\u000a      make a significant contribution to both bioethics and environmental\u000a      ethics, for example in the context of debates such as climate change where\u000a      `benefits' were designed largely for future rather than current\u000a      generations. Gill has since demonstrated the relevance of these core moral\u000a      virtues (along with common good arguments) in relation to global\u000a      health-care responses to HIV\/AIDS (see, e.g., Gill 2007).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"964","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Impact activities:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Ten articles were written by Gordon Lynch for print and on-line media\u000d\u000a        with national and international profiles:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a   \u000d\u000a      a) `Phone\u000a          hacking and sacrilege' was uploaded onto the Guardian\u000d\u000a        Comment is Free website on 8 July 2011, and reprinted in the Saturday\u000d\u000a        print edition of the Guardian on 9 July 2011 (250,000 copies\u000d\u000a        sold).

The\u000d\u000a        journal is available online as well as being circulated to its 27,000\u000d\u000a        Fellows who are based in 80 countries around the world.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Reach of impact:\u000d\u000a    The extent of public engagement with these impact activities is indicated\u000d\u000a      by the following:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The print version of the `Phone hacking and sacrilege' article and\u000d\u000a        seven articles for the Guardian Comment is Free website alone\u000d\u000a        are likely to have had a minimum of 150,000- 200,000 readers.\u000d\u000a      Truetube estimate that by 31 July 2013, around 57,000 Keystage 3 and 4\u000d\u000a        students in the UK had watched the films on the sacred (sources #2).\u000d\u000a      By 31 July 2013 the film of the `Power of the Sacred' lecture had been\u000d\u000a        viewed 9,878 times on the RSA's Youtube channel with 107 `likes'.\u000d\u000a      In addition to first viewings of this material, on-line articles and\u000d\u000a        films were re-circulated by users through other sites. Details of the\u000d\u000a        articles in the Comment is Free `How to Believe' series were, for\u000d\u000a        example, posted 271 times on to individual Facebook pages and 232 times\u000d\u000a        on individual Twitter accounts. In one instance, the third blog in this\u000d\u000a        series, on sacred ritual, was tweeted by Sonali Ranade in India to her\u000d\u000a        35,537 followers, with her describing it as a `searing insight' into\u000d\u000a        morally-charged public protest in the context of the mass protests in\u000d\u000a        response to the Dehli rape case in December 2012 (sources #3).\u000d\u000a      These figures suggest that a minimum 250,000-300,000 people are likely\u000d\u000a        to have read or viewed one or more of these impact materials on the\u000d\u000a        cultural sociology of the sacred.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Significance of impact:\u000d\u000a    The overall aim of the impact activities was to encourage more widespread\u000d\u000a      use of a cultural sociological understanding of the sacred to interpret\u000d\u000a      contemporary social life. This change was evident in audience responses\u000d\u000a      that indicated that this framework was understood and perceived as\u000d\u000a      interesting, useful and worthy of serious discussion:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The online films produced in conjunction with Truetube were named\u000d\u000a        `Humanities resource of the week' in the 17 February 2012 issue of the Times\u000a          Educational Supplement, with the editor writing that the `films\u000d\u000a        are fascinating and explore how the sacred can be both profound and\u000d\u000a        problematic' (see sources #4).\u000d\u000a      In an evaluation of the Truetube films with Year 10 GCSE Religious\u000d\u000a        Studies students, respondents commented that they had learned from\u000d\u000a        watching and talking about the films that the `sacred is not all about\u000d\u000a        God and religion', `it allows you to critically think about \"religion\"\u000d\u000a        and \"sacred\" and compare what the two mean and whether sacred should\u000d\u000a        always be linked to religion', `it helps us to see what is important in\u000d\u000a        our lives', it made `us question what is important, sacred to us', and\u000d\u000a        that `the sacred can be used to describe a thought or feeling not just\u000d\u000a        an object' (see sources #5).\u000d\u000a      Material produced through impact activities (i-iii) above was\u000d\u000a        circulated and re-used on other websites. Lynch (2012a) was cited as a\u000d\u000a        key text on a\u000d\u000a          resource page on the sacred on the website Philosophy Talk.Org, a\u000d\u000a        public out-reach programme of Stanford University. The RSA film, `The\u000d\u000a        Power of the Sacred', was also adapted as an\u000a          educational resource on the leading American educational website,\u000d\u000a        TED-ED.com. Two of the Guardian `How to Believe' articles on\u000d\u000a        Durkheim were reproduced\u000a          in full on the website for the Ash Center for Democratic\u000d\u000a        Governance and Innovation at Harvard University which circulates\u000d\u000a        resources for policy-makers and policy advisers.\u000d\u000a      Lynch (2012a) was described as a `lucid reconsideration of the term\u000d\u000a        \"sacred\"' by Bernice Martin in the Times Literary Supplement\u000d\u000a        (see sources #6). The Truetube films were described as `intriguing and\u000d\u000a        explore how the sacred can be both profound and problematic [in ways\u000d\u000a        that are] accessible for a teenage audience' by the national religious\u000d\u000a        education magazine, SACRE News (vol. 12, p. 13; see sources #6)\u000d\u000a        and as `an excellent resource to kick-start debates in lessons and\u000d\u000a        perhaps unexpectedly bring together the subjects of RE, PSHE and\u000d\u000a        Citizenship by taking a modern approach to asking the question, \"what is\u000d\u000a        sacred?\"' by bee-it.co.uk,\u000d\u000a        a leading website for the use of technological resources in the\u000d\u000a        education sector.\u000d\u000a      Positive comments about impact materials and activites were also made\u000d\u000a        by other readers. On his blog (19 August 2011), the journalist Mark\u000d\u000a        Vernon wrote\u000a          that `Gordon Lynch has penned an excellent piece for Open\u000d\u000a          Democracy on the riots and the habits of virtue', and tweeted this\u000d\u000a        comment to his 497 followers on Twitter. Comments on `The Power of the\u000d\u000a        Sacred' film left on on Youtube also indicated that many viewers had\u000d\u000a        understood and welcomed this analytical framework. As one respondent\u000d\u000a        wrote, `the video shows how important the sacred is to our very secular\u000d\u000a        lives. [It] is the unconscious of society.'\u000d\u000a      Stuart Porter, Director of Innovation and Development at Truetube, has\u000d\u000a        written that `the subject matter of the sacred films was extremely\u000d\u000a        interesting to us, and we felt that it would be a strong addition to the\u000d\u000a        RE section of our site. The films took a sideways look at religion and\u000d\u000a        religious behaviour that was a refreshing departure from the usual\u000d\u000a        knowledge-based films we have for Religious Education. The films\u000d\u000a        encourage higher-level thinking in pupils, in terms of understanding the\u000d\u000a        content, in reflecting upon it, and applying it. Pupils sometimes\u000d\u000a        question why they are studying a religion they don't believe in, but\u000d\u000a        seeing the world in terms of what is deemed \"sacred\" and what is thought\u000d\u000a        of as \"profane\" helps teachers to explain the importance of deeply held\u000d\u000a        beliefs whether they are religious or secular, and how they might affect\u000d\u000a        a person's or a society's behaviour' (see sources #7). Neil McKain, Head\u000d\u000a        of Religious Studies and Philosophy at John Hampden Grammar School in\u000d\u000a        High Wycombe, similarly commented that the films `ask profound questions\u000d\u000a        about whether or not religion is the same as sacred and whether or not\u000d\u000a        religions `own' sacred anymore. The tone of the film on children as\u000d\u000a        sacred clearly engaged my class and, though entertained by it, they came\u000d\u000a        up with some incredibly thoughtful responses afterwards' (see sources\u000d\u000a        #8).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Through a range of media and educational activities, Gordon Lynch has\u000d\u000a      developed public understanding of the importance of morally-charged\u000d\u000a      visions of the sacred and the profane for contemporary society. In his\u000d\u000a      work, the sacred refers not necessarily to traditional forms of religious\u000d\u000a      belief, but to whatever people collectively experience as unquestionable\u000d\u000a      moral realities, whose profanation evokes reactions of outrage, disgust\u000d\u000a      and the search for restitution and renewed moral solidarity. In articles\u000d\u000a      for newspapers, blogs for influential websites, and on-line films for use\u000d\u000a      in secondary schools, he has introduced public audiences to this way of\u000d\u000a      thinking about the sacred and shown its relevance for making sense of\u000d\u000a      contemporary cases involving strong public moral emotion. These have\u000d\u000a      ranged from the UK phone-hacking scandal to public responses to the mass\u000d\u000a      murders committed by Anders Behring Brievik.

Through this, Lynch has produced a theoretical framework\u000d\u000a      for understanding the sacred, influenced in particular by the `strong\u000d\u000a      programme' of cultural sociology, and has explored its analytical value\u000d\u000a      for interpreting contemporary society through different case studies.\u000d\u000a      Cases explored through his work have included the role of sacred meanings\u000d\u000a      of the nation and childhood in relation to public scandals over the abuse\u000d\u000a      of children within the Irish industrial school system and the\u000d\u000a      morally-charged controversies over the refusal by the BBC to broadcast a\u000d\u000a      Disasters Emergency Committee appeal for Gaza in 2009.\u000d\u000a    In his work, Lynch defines the sacred as that which people together take\u000d\u000a      to be timeless moral realities which present an unquestionable moral claim\u000d\u000a      over the conduct of social life. The sacred is thus understood as a\u000d\u000a      communicative structure that makes possible the collective experience of a\u000d\u000a      morally-boundaried society. Understanding sacred forms as comprising\u000d\u000a      symbols, thought, emotion, action and social groups, Lynch has explored\u000d\u000a      the ways in which these elements of sacred forms interact. His work has\u000d\u000a      also addressed the ways in which sacred meanings relate to institutional\u000d\u000a      structures, including different forms of institutional power, as well as\u000d\u000a      the ways in which they can serve to mobilize and legitimize public action.\u000d\u000a      Within this, attention has been paid to how visions of the evil-profane\u000d\u000a      evoke public reactions of abhorrence and disgust, and legitimize public\u000d\u000a      responses that seek moral restitution. He has also argued that public\u000d\u000a      media should be regarded as a key site for public engagement with sacred\u000d\u000a      meanings. He has presented a broad historical narrative of the changing\u000d\u000a      nature of sacred forms from classical societies to late modernity, in\u000d\u000a      which he argues that the dominant sacred forms of modernity are focused\u000d\u000a      around the nation and humanity. Lynch has argued for the need for a\u000d\u000a      reflexive approach to the sacred, which challenges the assumption that\u000d\u000a      acting out of deeply-felt moral certainties necessarily produces moral\u000d\u000a      action and invites a more complex understanding of moral sentiment. This\u000d\u000a      reflects a wider understanding of this cultural sociological approach as a\u000d\u000a      form of `cultural psychoanalysis', which seeks to establish the nature and\u000d\u000a      significance of sacred meanings in social life, in order to encourage\u000d\u000a      greater reflexivity about the ways in which these can have both positive\u000d\u000a      and harmful consequences.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3710","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1282988","Name":"Nepal"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Overall, the Vernarcular Religion project has contributed to\u000a      public discourse around questions of\u000a      Nepali identity both for Nepalis themselves and within the larger contexts\u000a      of Great Britain and the\u000a      globe. In an era of great cultural change across the world, where the\u000a      relationships between\u000a      minority communities and their host countries are being contested in every\u000a      country and context,\u000a      analysing the case of a nation as remarkably internally diverse and\u000a      globally mobile as Nepal\u000a      serves to remind interlocutors at every level - Nepalis in Nepal and\u000a      abroad, as well as European\u000a      local governments learning how to accommodate diversity in their own\u000a      backyards - of the multiple\u000a      ways difference and integration may be handled and addressed. The Vernacular\u000a        Religion project\u000a      also reminds such interlocutors of the importance of recognizing\u000a      multiplicity and the possibilities of\u000a      multiple belonging in the area of religion, as well as in the arena of\u000a      every other identity category.\u000a    This AHRC-funded research on the religious practices of Nepali\u000a      populations in the UK and Belgium\u000a      (as well as back in Nepal) has both been conducted by and contributed to\u000a      discussions of\u000a      community and social organization within the Nepali community itself, in\u000a      Great Britain and globally.\u000a      The project began its quantitative component drawing from a survey that\u000a      had been conducted by\u000a      the Centre for Nepal Studies-UK, an organization run by Nepali social\u000a      scientists for the benefit of\u000a      Nepalis living in Britain. The work that CNS-UK did in reaching out to the\u000a      Nepali community was\u000a      conducted largely on a volunteer basis, and through community fundraising\u000a      efforts. The collective\u000a      will within the Nepali community to support social science about their own\u000a      numbers within Great\u000a      Britain was evident in the support and funding that was raised internally\u000a      (and an awareness was\u000a      developed early on about the difficulties in researching a migrant\u000a      community, some members of\u000a      whom wished to stay under the radar).\u000a    The process of pursuing the initial CNS-UK survey further developed an\u000a      interest about the\u000a      demographics of the Nepali community within the diaspora population: the\u000a      project has built upon,\u000a      and in turn contributed to, this deep interest within the community, with\u000a      a particular focus on\u000a      religion. A number of political issues were at stake, including, as just\u000a      two examples, whether\u000a      Nepalis would be named as a minority population in the census of Great\u000a      Britain, and the religious\u000a      demographics of the Gurkha forces, which until 2008 had only employed\u000a      Hindu pandits or priests\u000a      for its Nepali regiments, consistent with the designation of Nepal as a\u000a      Hindu state. In the context\u000a      of a new location like Great Britain, religious and ethnic breakdowns of\u000a      the Nepali population\u000a      constituted an information base in unknown terrain that had implications\u000a      for issues of\u000a      representation both in Nepal and in the diaspora: reliable information\u000a      about religious organizations\u000a      and practices could be brought to bear both on the emerging relationship\u000a      between a newly arrived\u000a      minority population and its host country, and also upon the internal\u000a      politics of representation\u000a      pertaining to religious specialists, festival events, and local temples.\u000a      Social science was made real\u000a      for the subjects of the research themselves, who have welcomed CNS-UK's\u000a      efforts to gain\u000a      information, at first prior to and now through the work of the Vernacular\u000a        Religion project.\u000a      As a result, the project has consistently been called upon to contribute\u000a      information on the\u000a      breakdowns of Nepali religious identification and practice in Great\u000a      Britain.\u000a    In a time of vocal public debate and discourse about migration and\u000a      migrant communities, the\u000a      information gathered by the Vernacular Religion project has been solicited\u000a      at many levels, and for\u000a      many reasons. For Nepalis in Britain working to build a diverse array of\u000a      ethnic, religious, regional,\u000a      professional, and military social groups, data collected by the project\u000a      has justified certain claims of\u000a      presence within the diaspora. For Nepalis in Nepal working to build\u000a      relationships with diaspora\u000a      community members and wishing to keep track of religio-political movements\u000a      across the world,\u000a      information from the project has helped to build bridges and information\u000a      networks between\u000a      research and activists. For the British government, and in particular the\u000a      local borough councils of\u000a      Rushmoor and Surrey Heath concerned to facilitate community integration,\u000a      museum personnel\u000a      wanting to reflect the changing nature of the local community, and\u000a      organizations wishing to better\u000a      provide social services (health care, English classes, funeral\u000a      arrangements) for minority or under-\u000a      represented populations in general and for their famed Gurkha forces in\u000a      particular, the project's\u000a      material has provided accounts of a legitimate - if newly arrived -\u000a      population of Great Britain.\u000a    Three particular non-academic outcomes of the project thus far are of\u000a      note:\u000a    1) A CNS-UK publication, Nepalis in the UK: An Overview (K.\u000a      Adhikari, ed. CNS-UK 2012).\u000a      Closely supervised by Hausner, who also co-wrote a chapter for public\u000a      information, Nepalis\u000a        in the UK has been disseminated far and wide, to the Nepali\u000a      community in Great Britain, to\u000a      journalists, activists, and policymakers in Nepal (including ethnic and\u000a      political leaders) - as\u000a      well as to public libraries - and to people interested in the dynamics of\u000a      Nepali history and\u000a      life in the diaspora, including the Mayor of Rushmoor and members of the\u000a      Rushmoor\u000a      Borough Council. In Surrey, the book was given to the Mayor of Surrey\u000a      Heath at the\u000a      opening of an exhibition of Nepali Connections, a collection of\u000a      Nepali and Gurkha objects at\u000a      the Museum of Surrey Heath (Surrey Heath, April 20 2012) [i].\u000a    2) Community integration programmes (e.g. Best of Both, Aldershot, Feb 4\u000a      2012). In parts of\u000a      Britain where large densities of Nepalis have settled in the last decade\u000a      (due to a new law\u000a      allowing Nepali Gurkha residency and citizenship), particularly in the\u000a      areas surrounding\u000a      Gurkha barracks, such as Aldershot and Ashford, English residents have\u000a      felt a dramatic\u000a      shift in the demographics in their cities; in some cases resentment\u000a      against Nepali migration\u000a      has started to build. In Aldershot (Greater Rushmoor Borough, Hampshire),\u000a      Hausner was\u000a      asked to address the crowd of 500 (in English and Nepali) with a summary\u000a      of their project\u000a      during a programme called `Best of Both', designed to bring the two\u000a      communities together\u000a      in a day of festivities, performance, and local craft; the Mayor was also\u000a      in attendance [see\u000a      sources ii &amp; iii, in which the Mayor of Rushmoor commends the\u000a      publication of Nepalis in the\u000a        UK: An Overview as `a timely contribution, which explores and\u000a      analyses the pathways to\u000a      integration']. Similarly, in Wembley, Hausner was asked to address the\u000a      Non-Resident\u000a      Nepali organization about the research, in order that leaders of the\u000a      Nepali community\u000a      worldwide would have information about the dynamics of Nepalis in Britain.\u000a    3) Feedback session (Aldershot, April 28 2012). The project invited key\u000a      informants and\u000a      respondents - including leaders of religious organizations and community\u000a      representatives,\u000a      as well as specialist religious practitioners - to a session where it\u000a      presented its findings and\u000a      invited further discussion. The event was unique insofar as rarely have\u000a      these multiple\u000a      strands of religious activism engaged with each other in person about\u000a      beliefs, practices,\u000a      and the dynamics of their engagement; in the context of a session\u000a      organized by a team\u000a      researching the multiplicity of Nepali religions, they were able to place\u000a      themselves and their\u000a      practices in a larger context, with a number of shamans comparing notes! A\u000a      special\u000a      bilingual edition of CNS-UK's newsletter was published for dissemination\u000a      in connection with\u000a      this event [iv][v].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Sondra Hausner's AHRC-funded project, Vernacular Religion, grew\u000a      out of her existing work with\u000a      Nepalis around the world, and especially in the UK.

Nepalis were under-reported in the 2001 census, which\u000a      recorded fewer than 6,000 UK\u000a      residents born in Nepal. A nationwide survey conducted by the Centre for\u000a      Nepal Studies UK (CNS-\u000a      UK, a partner organisation in this research) in 2008 determined that over\u000a      70,000 Nepalis lived in\u000a      the UK. It is estimated that the current figure is well over 100,000.\u000a    The Vernacular Religion project, funded by a Large Grant from the\u000a      AHRC-ESRC Religion and\u000a      Society Programme, is the only one of its kind. It looks at both\u000a      individual and collective forms of\u000a      religious practice, and examines the lived religious experience of Nepalis\u000a      in Britain under three\u000a      separate headings: (1) attempts to build different forms of community and\u000a      communal forms of\u000a      religion; (2) personal spirituality; and (3) the propitiation of gods and\u000a      spirits for help with worldly\u000a      problems (e.g. illness or other misfortunes). The assumption in\u000a      Judaeo-Christian traditions is that\u000a      these three types of religiosity will normally be provided by a single\u000a      system, but in many Asian\u000a      contexts, different ritual and ideological systems provide for each of\u000a      these three aspects of religion.\u000a      This research has found considerable religious pluralism even within the\u000a      community of Nepalis in\u000a      the UK: Nepalis have created hundreds of political and community\u000a      organizations in this country in\u000a      the last 15 years, and household shrines show an enormous diversity of\u000a      personal religious\u000a      practice.\u000a    The project included a survey of 300 households and extensive\u000a      ethnographic fieldwork in people's\u000a      homes and at community events. The Vernacular Religion team asked\u000a      people about their\u000a      education, work, migration history, involvement in community events and\u000a      organizations, and their\u000a      religious practices both inside and outside the home. One key finding is\u000a      that, while there are some\u000a      groups who have a clear Hindu or Buddhist identity (e.g. most Bahuns and\u000a      Chhetris are clearly\u000a      Hindu; Sherpas and Tamangs are definitely Buddhist), many other groups\u000a      (e.g. Magars, Newars,\u000a      Limbus, Rais) enthusiastically combine multiple forms of religious\u000a      belonging.\u000a    What the team has found, therefore, is that multiple religious belonging,\u000a      although by no means\u000a      normative or universal for South Asian or Nepali religions, is a viable\u000a      and coherent stance, with\u000a      deep historic roots, taken up by many Nepalis in Britain. Nepalis in\u000a      Britain take up this stance in full\u000a      consciousness of what they are doing; they are usually aware how such a\u000a      position relates to Nepali\u000a      history and how it counters British public discourse. Religiosity is a\u000a      central aspect of their identity,\u000a      and they deal with the modern cultural expectation that people should have\u000a      a singular religious\u000a      identity by quite deliberately choosing to adhere to more than one.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4913","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"163843","Name":"Syria"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aIn 2008, Professor Biggar's work attracted a &#163;250k benefaction from the former deputy Chief of\u000d\u000aStaff in President Carter's White House to establish the McDonald Centre for Theology, Ethics, and\u000d\u000aPublic Life.

As a member of the Committee on Ethical Issues in\u000d\u000aMedicine of the Royal College of Physicians, Biggar has used his work to help persuade the\u000d\u000aCollege not to adopt a position of neutrality on the legalisation of PAS in the UK.\u000d\u000aInfluencing public policy\u000d\u000aProfessor Biggar has frequently been approached to provide information and advice to a range of\u000d\u000apolicy makers, government officials, and practitioners. In November 2009, under the auspices of\u000d\u000athe Wyndham Place Charlemagne Trust, Professor Biggar delivered a lecture, \"To Intervene or Not\u000d\u000ato Intervene: Ethical and Religious Reflections on Military Intervention for Humanitarian Purposes\",\u000d\u000ato a London audience of serving and retired civil servants [vii]. At the invitation of the Higher\u000d\u000aCommand Staff Course at the UK Defence Academy, Shrivenham, he also spoke to forty senior\u000d\u000aBritish and foreign army, navy, and air force officers about just war on 15 February 2010 - and\u000d\u000aagain on 21 February 2011.\u000d\u000aIn the wake of his piece \"Do not be so sure Invading Iraq was Immoral\", Biggar was commissioned\u000d\u000ato write a 4,000 word article (\"Iraq: What are the Morals of the Story?\") for the in-house journal of\u000d\u000athe Royal Institute for International Affairs (Chatham House), International Affairs (January 2011)\u000d\u000a[viii]. Biggar was then invited to debate the justice of the Iraq war with Dr David Fisher, former\u000d\u000asenior civil servant in the Ministry of Defence and recent author of The Morality of War (OUP,\u000d\u000a2011) at Chatham House. Introduced by the renowned military historian Michael Howard, this\u000d\u000adebate took place on 22 March 2011 before an audience of two hundred, which included a number\u000d\u000aof Members of Parliament and high-ranking civil servants from the time of the lead-up to the war.\u000d\u000aThis exchange between Biggar and Fisher was subsequently published as \"Was Iraq an Unjust\u000d\u000aWar?\" in International Affairs (May 2011) [ix].\u000d\u000aBiggar's work on war has been further directly communicated through discussion with various\u000d\u000asenior members of UK and international Government departments and intelligence services via a\u000d\u000aseries of annual colloquia on ethical issues in international affairs, which is co-sponsored by the\u000d\u000aMcDonald Centre for Theology, Ethics, and Public Life in Oxford, and by Chatham House in\u000d\u000aLondon. To date this series has included meetings on:\u000d\u000a(1) National Interest and Foreign Policy (5 February 2010), which included senior members of the\u000d\u000aForeign &amp; Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence.\u000d\u000a(2) The Ethics of Intelligence Gathering (16 February 2011), which included senior members of the\u000d\u000aUK and US intelligence services.\u000d\u000a(3) The Ethics of Humanitarian Intervention in the Wake of the Libyan Crisis (10 February 2012),\u000d\u000awhich included senior members of the FCO and MoD, together with experts on the Middle East.\u000d\u000a(4) The Ethics of Remote Weaponry (1 February 2013), which included American, German, and\u000d\u000aDutch experts.\u000d\u000aAfter attendance at these meetings, participants have made the following comments. John\u000d\u000aMcLaughlin, former Deputy Director and Acting Director of the Central Intelligence Agency of the\u000d\u000aUSA: \"conferences I attended...were enormously valuable in my work in Washington, which\u000d\u000ainvolves service on various government advisory boards and teaching graduate students at Johns\u000d\u000aHopkins University, many of whom are heading for important positions in the American\u000d\u000agovernment... The spirited debate among them...has already informed my teaching and influenced\u000d\u000athe advice I offer to our national security community in the United States\" [1]. John Lloyd,\u000d\u000aContributing Editor at the Financial Times, and columnist at Reuters.com and at La Repubblica:\u000d\u000a\"The McDonald Centre at Oxford has, to my knowledge as a participant in several of its events,\u000d\u000aheld high level seminars\/conferences on the national interest... I believe it has made, and should\u000d\u000acontinue to make, a difference to the national conversation on all of the matters it has tackled\" [2].\u000d\u000aEdwina Moreton, OBE, formerly Diplomatic Editor and Deputy Foreign Editor, The Economist: \"I\u000d\u000ahave found the McDonald Centre series hugely and directly helpful in my work, which in reporting\u000d\u000aand editorial writing requires me to address a wide range of difficult yet topical issues... The quality\u000d\u000aof my own thinking, analysis and writing on these and other subjects benefited directly as a result\"\u000d\u000a[3]. The importance of this series of meetings has been attested to by Iain Mathewson, CMG,\u000d\u000aformerly of the UK's Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office: \"This continues as a unique series of\u000d\u000acolloquia, which were not available to government until the McDonald Centre launched them.\u000d\u000aChatham House's continuing support is itself evidence of their value and impact. After a career in\u000d\u000aforeign intelligence collection followed by five years as an associate fellow at Chatham House's\u000d\u000aInternational Security Programme I know only too well how important a gap existed before the\u000d\u000aMcDonald Centre began to fill it in 2010\" [4].\u000d\u000aProfessor Biggar's work has also proved of direct influence to Members of Parliament and the\u000d\u000aHouse of Lords. On 31 January 2011, in the House of Commons' debate about Iran's potential\u000d\u000anuclear weapons, the Rt. Hon. Dennis MacShane, MP for Rotherham, encouraged the secretary of\u000d\u000astate \"to read the article in the current edition of International Affairs [January 2011] by Professor\u000d\u000aNigel Biggar\" and expounded on the arguments therein [x]. In a July 2013 discussion in the House\u000d\u000aof Lords in relation to the Syrian conflict, Baroness Falkner of Margravine stated her gratitude for\u000d\u000athe thoughtful discussions she had had with Professor Biggar [xi].\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aNigel Biggar's recent research has developed novel Christian ethical analyses of a range of\u000d\u000aoverlapping issues of public concern regarding the ethics of killing - specifically physician-assisted\u000d\u000asuicide and war.

He is also a member of\u000d\u000athe Royal College of Physicians' Committee on Ethical Issues in Medicine. Part of his recent\u000d\u000aresearch has sought to establish a legitimate place for religious ethics in the public deliberation of\u000d\u000aliberal societies, which should aspire to be responsibly plural rather than speciously neutral.\u000d\u000aOn the basis of this principal contention, Biggar has proceeded to develop detailed Christian\u000d\u000aethical analyses of a range of practical issues bearing on public policy and law. Among these are\u000d\u000atwo kinds of killing: euthanasia &amp; physician-assisted suicide (PAS), and war.\u000d\u000aBiggar's major publication on euthanasia &amp; PAS (Aiming to Kill: The Ethics of Suicide and\u000d\u000aEuthanasia) appeared in 2004, but he has since continued to develop his thinking and to\u000d\u000adisseminate it publicly. His argument is an unusual combination of liberal and conservative\u000d\u000aelements. Against ethical conservatives he concedes that some forms of human life are probably\u000d\u000anot worth living; but against ethical liberals he argues that the fostering of humanist social norms\u000d\u000amilitates against making voluntary euthanasia or PAS legal.\u000d\u000aBiggar's research on war has developed over the past decade: in several book-chapters (an\u000d\u000aelucidation of the Church of England's views in Gerechter Krieg &#8212; Ja oder Nein? [2003], a\u000d\u000acontribution to Ethics and Weapons of Mass Destruction [2004], a study on the reception of just\u000d\u000awar doctrine in British churches in The Price of Peace [2007], an essay on theology and atrocity in\u000d\u000aThe Religious in Responses to Mass Atrocity [2009], and an account of the authority of Christian\u000d\u000ajust war reasoning in The Just War Tradition: The Practice of Authority and Authority in Practice\u000d\u000a[2013]); in a pair of articles on the New Testament and violence (in the peer-reviewed Studies in\u000d\u000aChristian Ethics [2009, 2010]); and in another pair of articles on the Iraq war (in International\u000d\u000aAffairs, a leading journal of international relations [January and May 2011]). Biggar's work on this\u000d\u000atopic culminated in the publication in September 2013 of a 300-page monograph by OUP under the\u000d\u000atitle In Defence of War. Even prior to publication the manuscript of this book was the subject of two\u000d\u000aconferences in the US (University of Notre Dame, September 2009:\u000d\u000ahttp:\/\/kroc.nd.edu\/events\/upcoming\/2009\/09\/24\/570 ); University of Virginia, April 2012:\u000d\u000ahttp:\/\/artsandsciences.virginia.edu\/religiousstudies\/people\/ctm9d.html).\u000d\u000aAs the provocative title of his monograph implies, Biggar's position on the ethics of warfare is\u000d\u000aunfashionable. Against pacifisms religious, secular, and virtual, against legal positivism and liberal\u000d\u000aindividualism, and recovering the early Christian just war tradition running from Augustine to\u000d\u000aGrotius, he argues that peace is not simple, that not-war stands in need of justification quite as\u000d\u000amuch as war, that just war is basically a punitive response to grave injustice, that its paradigm is\u000d\u000anot self-defence but humanitarian intervention, that the estimation of consequences is significantly\u000d\u000aspeculative, that therefore the prudential criteria of just war must be secondary, and that Britain's\u000d\u000aprosecution of war against Wilhelmine Germany in 1914-18 was justified, as was the invasion of\u000d\u000aIraq in 2003.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"6390","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"149590","Name":"Tanzania"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2328926","Name":"Nigeria"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Form of Global Conversations: Continuing Indaba\u000a    As a direct result of the Global Faith Networks project, following an\u000a      interdisciplinary research day in Leeds in 2010 at which findings were\u000a      presented to academic and non-academic audiences, Sadgrove was invited to\u000a      act as an advisor and evaluator for the global Anglican consultation\u000a      process \"Continuing Indaba\" (CI) in its pilot stage (2009-2011). CI\u000a      enables conversations and listening about human sexuality and other\u000a      globally contentious issues; its distinctive emphases include awareness of\u000a      local context and forming relationships of trust. Following success at the\u000a      pilot stage, CI has been adopted for wider use by numerous Anglican\u000a      provinces including the Church of England (b). CI's pilot stage involved\u000a      dioceses from Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas. Its evaluation\u000a      (involving Sadgrove) was funded by the Morehouse School of Medicine with a\u000a      view to developing new approaches to inter-contextual conversations about\u000a      controversial subjects in a range of contexts, including other worldwide\u000a      denominations.\u000a    The findings and research methods of Global Faith Networks contributed\u000a      directly to the design and the evaluation of CI. The Anglican Consultative\u000a      Council's (ACC's) Facilitator of CI describes how the Leeds research \"was\u000a      significant in initial process design...

He was also invited to respond to the major consultation\u000a      commissioned by the House of Bishops of The Episcopal Church USA (TEC) on\u000a      same-sex marriage; his response was presented with the consultation\u000a      documents to the House of Bishops in 2011 (a) to form the basis for future\u000a      discussions about TEC policy and practice on sexuality. In 2011 Ward\u000a      addressed a conference of new Anglican Bishops (from India, Melanesia,\u000a      USA, Australia, NZ, Tanzania, Ghana, Nigeria) on the sexuality debate, and\u000a      gave several talks for Changing Attitude, an Anglican group\u000a      arguing for more acceptance of LGBT people.\u000a    Form and Content of Local and National Conversations\u000a    The research process had impact on individual participants and\u000a      congregations. The project involved six Anglican congregations (two each\u000a      in UK, USA and South Africa). More than 140 people participated in\u000a      interviews, and many more in discussions and Bible studies. The process\u000a      provided the opportunity to speak about experiences that are hard to voice\u000a      (see respondents' comments, Sexuality and Global Faith Networks,\u000a      reference 6 above, p. 7: \"I have avoided too many open discussions...\u000a      there are people who discuss the issue, but they're small in number\"; p.\u000a      10 \"It's hurtful to those of us that are gay and lesbian... to have the\u000a      church say... we'll hide you\"). Congregations report lasting effects on\u000a      attitudes and practice, for example having \"become more aware of our need\u000a      to give extra support to gay asylum seekers who are unable to return to\u000a      their home countries because of their sexual orientation\" (f).\u000a    Ward, Sadgrove and others led a study day on sexuality for the Diocese of\u000a      Ripon and Leeds in 2010 for around 40 clergy and laity. This was followed\u000a      by talks by Ward to groups within the diocese, including an address to the\u000a      diocesan synod in 2011. Ward is a member of the Human Sexuality Task Group\u000a      of the Diocese, which has prepared a study guide for parishes, drawing\u000a      extensively on Ward's research; the leader of a Lent group advertised\u000a      across the diocese commented that the course led to \"increasing awareness\u000a      of difference and diversity and ability to speak freely, in a 'safe\u000a      space', with respect\" (e).\u000a    Following British Quakers' 2009 decision to celebrate same-sex marriages,\u000a      Muers produced a paper, drawing on her ongoing research on sexuality and\u000a      Quaker ethics, to help Quakers to explain the decision and understand\u000a      other churches' concerns.

Theology and Religious Studies at\u000a      Leeds, as an interdisciplinary team with a strong focus on religion and\u000a      public life and distinctive expertise in African religion, is well placed\u000a      to contribute to this fast-developing field. This case study highlights\u000a      the work of Kevin Ward (Senior Lecturer, Leeds 1995-present), Joanna\u000a      Sadgrove (PDRA, Leeds 2008-2010) and Rachel Muers (Lecturer &amp; Senior\u000a      Lecturer, Leeds 2007-present).\u000a    Ward has long-established research interests in East African\u000a      Christianity, the Anglican Communion, and debates about homosexuality\u000a      within Christianity. He critically evaluated the stereotypes circulating\u000a      about African views on homosexuality, and demonstrated how the 1998\u000a      Lambeth Conference framed the global Anglican debate on sexuality in terms\u000a      that failed to reflect the complex local negotiations of teaching and\u000a      pastoral practice around sexuality in East Africa - including the\u000a      paradoxical importance of evangelicalism on the development of modern East\u000a      African homosexual identities (1). Subsequent articles developed the\u000a      implications of these findings for a global church communion in a\u000a      post-colonial context (2).\u000a    Sadgrove's Leeds-based research was part of the project on `Sexuality and\u000a      Global Faith Networks', 2008-2010, a collaboration with the School of\u000a      Geography (University of Leeds). Recent debates within the worldwide\u000a      Anglican Communion and the media about the ordination of gay clergy and\u000a      the recognition of civil partnerships provided the immediate context for\u000a      the research. The aim was to collect new information in the UK, USA, and\u000a      South Africa on how individuals and congregations viewed such debates and\u000a      what they thought about the future direction of the Church. As part of the\u000a      project the researchers interviewed key stakeholders, observed national\u000a      conventions (e.g. Lambeth Conference 2008, General Convention of the\u000a      Episcopal Church 2009) and hosted an advisory group of clerical and LGBT\u000a      experts (3).\u000a    In six parish case studies in New York, Leeds and Pietermaritzburg, the\u000a      researchers were able to document the ambiguities over sexuality expressed\u000a      by ordinary church goers in three very different locations (4). The\u000a      research contributed to deconstructing established notions of a simple\u000a      dichotomy between the Western world and the Global South - the latter\u000a      often being erroneously constructed in the West as consistently\u000a      \"anti-homosexual\". A key theme of the research findings was the importance\u000a      of location in conversations about sexuality and global communion; both\u000a      \"sexuality\" and \"Anglican Communion\" can best be understood as in each\u000a      case local church issues, approached through complex local\u000a      negotiations of a community's mission. This has significant implications\u000a      for how progress can be made in global conversations.\u000a    Muers' work on sexuality and gender in theological tradition uses\u000a      feminist and gender-critical approaches to question established &#8212; or newly\u000a      fashionable &#8212; theological justifications of heteronormativity (5). She has\u000a      also produced overviews of the shape and implications of modern\u000a      theological debates on gender and sexuality for major textbooks. Ongoing\u000a      research links this work on sexuality, particularly the theological\u000a      grounds for challenging heteronormativity, specifically to Quaker\u000a      traditions of theological ethics and to current and recent debates on\u000a      same-sex marriage.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6391","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The need for better articulation, in public debates around\u000a      religion and the state, of the complex diasporic character of religious\u000d\u000a      communities in Britain &#8212; as well as Knott's research leadership in this\u000d\u000a      area &#8212; was reflected in her invitation to be a keynote speaker in the\u000d\u000a      Westminster Faith Debates in February 2012. She presented an overview\u000d\u000a      based on Leeds research of Britain's experience of living with religious\u000d\u000a      diversity since the 1970s, to a high-profile audience from politics, the\u000d\u000a      public and third sector, think-tanks and faith communities. She was quoted\u000d\u000a      extensively in national media debate as the representative of a new\u000d\u000a      perspective on religious identity in Britain, sparking discussion of how\u000d\u000a      to move beyond established arguments about \"multiculturalism\" (a).\u000d\u000a    In this context of wider interest in the complexities of British\u000d\u000a      religious identities, Leeds research on the specificities of these\u000d\u000a      identities has changed public representation and understanding through\u000d\u000a      work with national museums. On the basis of his earlier\u000d\u000a      Leeds research, McLoughlin was commissioned in 2011 by the British Museum\u000d\u000a      (BM) to work on British Muslims' experience of Hajj, for the major\u000d\u000a      exhibition \"Hajj: A Journey to the Heart of Islam\" (January-April 2012).\u000d\u000a      His contribution was a key determinant both of the exhibition's\u000d\u000a      representation of British Muslims and their engagement with it.\u000d\u000a    McLoughlin's ethnographic research, building on his earlier publications,\u000d\u000a      supplied materials for a discrete panel in the exhibition, and an audio\u000d\u000a      loop of interviewees; he was an adviser to the curating team (g),\u000d\u000a      supported the development of educational material, and promoted public\u000d\u000a      engagement. He spoke at a study day for the BM's members and the public on\u000d\u000a      10th March 2012, and the \"Arabia Late\" public event on 9th\u000d\u000a\u0009  March. A sustained web presence for the ethnographic research was\u000d\u000a      constructed at Leeds, and received coverage in Hajj-related online forums\u000d\u000a      (b). McLoughlin also provided the introduction, and advised on the\u000d\u000a      structure and format, for short films on Hajj produced by Leeds Museums\u000d\u000a      Discovery Centre, a BM regional partner. Research undertaken for the\u000d\u000a      exhibition forms the basis of an article for the Public Spirit\u000d\u000a      online forum for researchers, policymakers, politicians and practitioners\u000d\u000a      (June 2013, promoted as a special feature to coincide with Hajj &#8212; October\u000d\u000a      2013).\u000d\u000a    The BM Hajj exhibition was a noted success, attracting 140,000 visitors\u000d\u000a      (almost double its target) of whom two-thirds were from Black and Minority\u000d\u000a      Ethnic communities (c). The BM's Assistant Curator confirmed that\u000d\u000a      McLoughlin's contribution was \"integral to the success of the exhibition\",\u000d\u000a      not only in ensuring \"rigour\" and \"balance\" in the exhibition itself, but\u000d\u000a      also, through the research process itself, raising awareness of the\u000d\u000a      exhibition in Muslim communities across the UK (e). The Project Curator\u000d\u000a      commented \"Muslims felt involved... which is illustrated by the fantastic\u000d\u000a      visitor numbers and feedback we received\" (f).\u000d\u000a    Working with McLoughlin's anthropological approach represented a new\u000d\u000a      departure for the BM and there are specific plans to draw on this\u000d\u000a      experience for future practice, most immediately in a redisplay of the\u000d\u000a      Islamic galleries (e). The BM's Digital Learning Programmes Manager\u000d\u000a      commented \"The audio recordings and accompanying transcripts of British\u000d\u000a      Muslims collected by Se&#225;n [McLoughlin]'s team were incredibly useful for\u000d\u000a      the Education Team in building a mobile learning application for the\u000d\u000a      exhibition.

Research by\u000d\u000a      McLoughlin, Knott and Tomalin (grant 2, above) is used to frame\u000d\u000a      discussions of religion and diaspora and to focus on Muslim and\u000d\u000a      British-Asian communities. Targeted at KS3 and 4 for Citizenship goals on\u000d\u000a      `Identity and Diversity', the site was trialled by Knott with school\u000d\u000a      groups as part of the Runnymede Trust's project Generation 3.0.\u000d\u000a      The learning resources have been publicised by the TES, Historical\u000d\u000a      Association, Geographical Association and Citizenship Foundation (f).

Leeds has led research on the\u000d\u000a      interactions between religious communities and state actors, and the\u000d\u000a      development of conceptual frameworks for interpreting the\u000d\u000a      interrelationships of religion, ethnicity, class, locality, state\/nation\u000d\u000a      and diaspora. Religion has been neglected as a category in diaspora\u000d\u000a      studies, while the study of religion has been slow to engage migration and\u000d\u000a      diaspora; this mutual neglect is redressed in Leeds research. Key\u000d\u000a      researchers are Kim Knott (Leeds 1976-2012, PhD researcher, Senior\u000d\u000a      Lecturer, Professor), Se&#225;n McLoughlin (Leeds 2000-present, Senior\u000d\u000a      Lecturer), and Emma Tomalin (Leeds 2002-present, Senior Lecturer).\u000d\u000a    Building on seminal ethnographies of religious communities in Leeds, the\u000d\u000a      CRP's agenda developed from the late 1990s to address emerging public and\u000d\u000a      civic concerns on religious diversity. The importance beyond the academy\u000d\u000a      of this research is demonstrated in successive commissioned\/partnership\u000d\u000a      projects, including `Inter-religious social action in Leeds' (Leeds Church\u000d\u000a      Institute [LCI], 1996-1998); `Leeds Pilot Faiths Consultation Exercise'\u000d\u000a      (Home Office\/LCI, 2004); and the `British Hinduism Oral History Project'\u000d\u000a      (Heritage Lottery Fund\/Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies, 2000-4).\u000d\u000a    From the 2000s, Leeds produced innovative research in the study of\u000d\u000a      religion across disciplinary boundaries especially in terms of theories of\u000d\u000a      location, space and diaspora. Knott is an internationally leading\u000d\u000a      researcher on religious plurality and religion and spatiality (1, 2). In\u000d\u000a      recognition of her research leadership in this area, in 2005 Knott was\u000d\u000a      appointed Director of AHRC's `Diasporas, Migration and Identities'\u000d\u000a      Programme (DMI; www.diasporas.ac.uk); she was often commissioned to speak\u000d\u000a      on the basis of her research contribution, engaging the study of religion\u000d\u000a      in Europe with issues relating to diasporas, migration and identities. In\u000d\u000a      2010 Knott was awarded an AHRC `Impact Fellowship' to bring the research\u000d\u000a      findings of the DMI Programme to a wider audience.\u000d\u000a    Alongside McLoughlin's theoretical work on religion and diaspora,\u000d\u000a      an ongoing focus of his ethnographic research has been trans-national or\u000d\u000a      global Islamic identities -as reflected in his recent work which is the\u000d\u000a      first to examine British Muslims' experience and practice of Hajj\u000d\u000a      and its transformation in diaspora (4). Tomalin and McLoughlin's\u000d\u000a      interdisciplinary project `Writing British Asian Cities' (6) refined a new\u000d\u000a      approach to the history of British Asian settlement developed by\u000d\u000a      McLoughlin (5). In workshops held in community spaces and involving local\u000d\u000a      writers, politicians and cultural workers, it examined previously\u000d\u000a      unassembled archives documenting how five cities have been `written' by\u000d\u000a      different constituencies, juxtaposing discordant texts across scholarly\u000d\u000a      ethnography, oral history, literary\/cultural production and official\/media\u000d\u000a      reports.\u000d\u000a    Knott and McLoughlin's co-edited volume (3) brings together the\u000d\u000a      theoretical reflection on diasporas that arises from and increasingly\u000d\u000a      shapes Leeds research. Original case studies of diasporas worldwide are\u000d\u000a      featured, testing the usefulness of `diaspora' for analysing the\u000d\u000a      complexity of contemporary transnational lives. McLoughlin's chapter on\u000d\u000a      Islamic consciousness tests distinctions usually made in diaspora studies\u000d\u000a      between universal and ethnic traditions, and explores how religious\u000d\u000a      imaginaries can provide a focus for new homing desires.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"8845","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The Oxford Prophecy Project proved a catalyst for the Panacea Society's\u000d\u000a    surviving members to re- orientate their aims as a funding body towards\u000d\u000a    greater public engagement. Members of the Oxford Faculty of Theology played\u000d\u000a    crucial advisory and practical roles in this process of re-orientation.\u000d\u000a    Former members of the Prophecy Project, Jane Shaw, Christopher Rowland, and\u000d\u000a    Gordon Allan, were each appointed as trustees by the then surviving members,\u000d\u000a    on the basis of working relationships established during the research\u000d\u000a    project and their proven interest in the history of The Panacea Society and\u000d\u000a    its antecedents. As trustees, Dr Shaw, Prof. Rowland and Mr Allan have since\u000d\u000a    aided the evolution of the Panacea Society into a modern charity (now The\u000d\u000a    Panacea Charitable Trust) with a deliberate concern to engage in grant\u000d\u000a    awards for projects with social and health benefits to wider society, in\u000d\u000a    addition to research in higher education [i]. Allan and Lockley have\u000d\u000a    been central to a further initiative to open up the historic site of the\u000d\u000a    Panacea Society in central Bedford to the general public by turning several\u000d\u000a    buildings into a permanent museum exhibition (The Panacea Museum) explaining\u000d\u000a    both the history of the Society and wider millennial and utopian religion to\u000d\u000a    a public audience [ii].\u000d\u000a    A foundation of the Oxford research project was the organizing and\u000d\u000a      opening of the vast archives of the Panacea Society's own history, and its\u000d\u000a      substantial materials relating to other modern religious movements.\u000d\u000a      Through cataloguing these archives, distinctive themes in the Society's\u000d\u000a      story and elements of its preceding tradition were brought to prominence.\u000d\u000a      These not only informed the academic works produced in the Prophecy\u000d\u000a      Project, but, through the influence and encouragement of project members,\u000d\u000a      provided a thematic basis for the Society's choice of new funding purposes\u000d\u000a      as a charitable body. One such theme is mental health. Mabel Barltrop, the\u000d\u000a      founder of the Panacea Society, had once campaigned for greater compassion\u000d\u000a      and openness in the treatment of mental health patients, following her own\u000d\u000a      experience in an Edwardian asylum. Since December 2010, the Panacea\u000d\u000a      Charitable Trust has established a unique policy of block grants to the\u000d\u000a      Bedford Council for Social Services with a particular concern for mental\u000d\u000a      health services. These have been administered by the Bedfordshire and\u000d\u000a      Luton Community Foundation (BLCF), whose chief executive states: \"BLCF\u000d\u000a      feels that this programme has been highly successful to date...The\u000d\u000a      Foundation feels that it has been allowed the flexibility to make awards\u000d\u000a      to groups that support mental health issues that other funders may not see\u000d\u000a      as being in that category....We feel that the return on investment where\u000d\u000a      almost 2,500 people have been supported to date is of great benefit to the\u000d\u000a      town of Bedford and its residents.\" Examples of how funded groups have\u000d\u000a      assisted individuals include: a teenager with a rare disability and\u000d\u000a      trouble with expressing his feelings and frustrations overcoming\u000d\u000a      depression and gaining confidence through a theatre project; and building\u000d\u000a      the self- esteem and social skills of a bullied school refuser who, after\u000d\u000a      being absent from school for three years, now has aspirations of going to\u000d\u000a      university. Another instance involved a new mother dealing with grief and\u000d\u000a      post-natal depression who had also recently fled domestic violence. Her\u000d\u000a      referral was urgent and the service co-ordinator was able to offer\u000d\u000a      intensive support immediately thanks to this funding [1].\u000d\u000a    Materials discovered in the Panacea Society Archives, together with the\u000d\u000a      broader academic research findings of the Oxford Prophecy Project, each\u000d\u000a      directly informed the most significant initiative for public engagement\u000d\u000a      undertaken by the Panacea Charitable Trust: the Panacea Museum. While the\u000d\u000a      Panacea Society has long been part of the modern culture of Bedford, its\u000d\u000a      history and activities have been largely unknown. Even though millennial\u000d\u000a      religious movements and wider apocalyptic sentiments are phenomena well\u000d\u000a      recognised in public discourse, they are frequently misunderstood in\u000d\u000a      theological, sociological, and historical terms. Indeed, the insights of\u000d\u000a      academic research in this field are only rarely communicated to audiences\u000d\u000a      outside academia, thus proliferating misconceptions. In the period 2010 to\u000d\u000a      2012, under the guidance and expertise of the named members of the Oxford\u000d\u000a      Faculty of Theology, the Panacea Charitable Trust sought to rectify both\u000d\u000a      these situations. In addition to its other funding programmes, the Trust\u000d\u000a      established a permanent exhibition seeking to inform and educate a general\u000d\u000a      audience in the variety of apocalyptic and millennial forms of\u000d\u000a      Christianity in the modern period.\u000d\u000a    The Museum opened on the site of the original community campus of the\u000d\u000a      Panacea Society in August 2012. It combines a series of rooms and\u000d\u000a      buildings restored to their appearance in the 1930s &#8212; when the religious\u000d\u000a      community was in its heyday &#8212; with an extensive exhibition presenting the\u000d\u000a      research of the Oxford Prophecy Project. All the text panels and many\u000d\u000a      exhibit labels were written by Philip Lockley, as was the museum guide\u000d\u000a      book, complemented by comments by other members of The Prophecy Project [iii].\u000d\u000a      The museum explores not only the role of prophecy and millennial\u000d\u000a      expectations in the Christian religion, but also claims to religious\u000d\u000a      experience, psychological responses to faith and doubt, and the role of\u000d\u000a      symbol, ritual, textual interpretation and charisma in religious groups.\u000d\u000a    The Museum opening has received significant coverage in the local press.\u000d\u000a      Several articles, such as those in `Bedfordshire on Sunday' [iv]\u000d\u000a      and the `Castle Quarter' [v] recognize the extent to which the\u000d\u000a      Panacea Society has been a long-standing `mystery' for Bedfordians, and\u000d\u000a      now pay tribute to this mystery being `revealed' in the museum. The museum\u000d\u000a      was also reviewed on the Religion in Museums website, being described as \"a\u000a        fascinating new museum of religion\" with some \"most remarkable\u000d\u000a        exhibits\" [vi]. The new Panacea Museum is now recognized to\u000d\u000a      form a part of Bedford's `cultural quarter', so called because the Bedford\u000d\u000a      Museum, the Cecil Higgins Gallery, and the John Bunyan Museum all face the\u000d\u000a      same street. Negotiations have now begun with these institutions and the\u000d\u000a      Bedfordshire Museums Outreach Officer to secure accreditation for the\u000d\u000a      Panacea Museum. In line with its charitable educational aims the Trust\u000d\u000a      has, since 2011, contributed to a grant supporting the first professional\u000d\u000a      curator at the next-door John Bunyan Museum and Library [vii].\u000d\u000a    The Museum is staffed entirely by volunteers, and is therefore only open\u000d\u000a      by appointment or on advertised open days. In the first 12 months, the\u000d\u000a      museum has attracted 23 pre-booked visits from community groups and held 7\u000d\u000a      open days.

Comments written in\u000d\u000a      the Visitors' book or recorded elsewhere indicate a strong level of\u000d\u000a      interest, a sense of surprise at learning so much, and appreciation for\u000d\u000a      how complex ideas are presented in an accessible way.

Centred on beliefs in direct divine inspiration and an\u000d\u000a      imminent millennium, Southcottianism evolved a complex theology and\u000d\u000a      attracted thousands of adherents in Britain, Australia, New Zealand and\u000d\u000a      the United States. As a tradition, it exhibits abundant features common to\u000d\u000a      forms of utopian and apocalyptic religion found across diverse centuries\u000d\u000a      and historic contexts. Movements of this kind often guard their most\u000d\u000a      dearly-held beliefs from the uninitiated, leaving few public records of\u000d\u000a      their identities, social experiences, or complex theological developments.\u000d\u000a      As a religious culture of this kind which was discovered intact, with a\u000d\u000a      vast archive of manuscript and rare print material spanning two hundred\u000d\u000a      years, the Panacea Society offered a rare opportunity to examine the\u000d\u000a      dynamics of religious formation and affiliation in microcosm, and explore\u000d\u000a      aspects of how heterodox religions spread, evolve, divide and decline.\u000d\u000a    Dr Jane Shaw, then of the Oxford Faculty of Theology, first visited the\u000d\u000a      Panacea Society in 2001 with an interest in researching their history. The\u000d\u000a      Society had been established in 1919 by a group of women led by a messiah\u000d\u000a      figure, Mabel Barltrop, and developed into a sizeable religious community\u000d\u000a      anticipating the apocalypse in the turmoil of interwar Britain. Following\u000d\u000a      their messiah's death in 1934, the Society sustained its communal life for\u000d\u000a      decades, yet by 2001 was no longer recruiting members. Initial dialogue\u000d\u000a      between the Society and Dr Shaw involved access to their archives. Once\u000d\u000a      the scope and condition of this historic material became apparent,\u000d\u000a      negotiations led to the Oxford Prophecy Project, funded by the Society for\u000d\u000a      the purpose of cataloguing, preserving and researching the archives.\u000d\u000a    The Oxford Prophecy Project was convened by Dr Shaw and Prof. Christopher\u000d\u000a      Rowland in the Oxford Faculty of Theology, 2003-2010. Dr Shaw's research\u000d\u000a      in the history of religious experience and feminist theology led to her\u000d\u000a      biographical study of the Panacea Society itself, centred on their female\u000d\u000a      messiah Mabel Barltrop, known as `Octavia'. Prof. Rowland drew on his\u000d\u000a      diverse interests in early Christianity and interpretations of the Book of\u000d\u000a      Revelation to explore comparative aspects of millennial religion, while\u000d\u000a      also preparing a theological study of Joanna Southcott's contemporary, the\u000d\u000a      visionary engraver William Blake. Besides these lead researchers, the\u000d\u000a      project included:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Dr Deborah Madden (on project 2003-08 as postdoctoral researcher), who\u000d\u000a        produced the first intellectual history of the popular radical prophet,\u000d\u000a        Richard Brothers.\u000d\u000a      Dr Philip Lockley (on project 2004-09 as research assistant and\u000d\u000a        doctoral student), who undertook the task of cataloguing the extensive\u000d\u000a        Panacea Society archives and produced studies identifying their\u000d\u000a        significance in revising existing historical and theological\u000d\u000a        understandings of nineteenth-century millennial religion.\u000d\u000a      Dr Susanne Sklar (on project 2003-07 as doctoral student), who\u000d\u000a        provided an innovative reading of the theology of William Blake in the\u000d\u000a        light of visionary religious traditions.

The underpinning research explores the\u000a      nature and\u000a      implications of SR; it has now been put into practice in these varied\u000a      contexts. The flow is not simply\u000a      one-way, however: reflection on the experience of SR in these contexts\u000a      feeds into on-going\u000a      research and shapes extension of SR to new audiences. In this way, diverse\u000a      audiences are drawn\u000a      into SR practice, and into the process by which SR theory and practice are\u000a      refined and extended.\u000a    Examples include:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aSchools and young people. Following discussions with\u000a        Ford and CIP, London-based\u000a        inter-faith group, The Three Faiths Forum, developed (from 2008) a form\u000a        of SR aimed at\u000a        schools: `Tools4Trialogue', drawing on Islamic, Christian and Jewish\u000a        texts on themes\u000a        relevant to school children. Their most popular programme is `Bling!\u000a        Beauty, Modesty and\u000a        Clothing'. They reach c. 5000 children in 70 schools each year, in 17\u000a        London boroughs and\u000a        some districts beyond. The programme's effectiveness was confirmed by an\u000a        independent\u000a        team from the University of Warwick's Religions and Education Research\u000a        Unit, led by Julia\u000a        Ipgrave; she found that `contrary to common assumptions about the lack\u000a        of appeal of\u000a        sacred texts to young people', the programme enabled teenagers to\u000a        `engage in detail with\u000a        the texts' in ways that interested them and facilitated dialogue\u000a        (Ipgrave, 2011, 8 [4]).\u000a      \u000aMedical practitioners in Israel\/Palestine. CIP has\u000a        funded a project by the Middle East\u000a        branch of The Three Faiths Forum. In 2010, following discussions with\u000a        Ford and CIP, 10\u000a        Scriptural Reasoning groups, each comprising 20 to 40 doctors, nurses\u000a        and medical\u000a        students from Israel and the Palestinian territories, were created in\u000a        Hadassah Hospital, Ein\u000a        Karem, and Kaplan Medical Centre, Rehovot (with a similar level of\u000a        activity in subsequent\u000a        years). The impact of the activity is described in (Feldman-Kaye, 2011\u000a        [2]). As one\u000a        participant summarised it, `I have never studied Torah with Christians\u000a        and Muslims, even\u000a        though they are good friends of mine. It was difficult but in the end\u000a        eye-opening,\u000a        challenging ... I am now rethinking the way I view others in Israel, and\u000a        my interactions with\u000a        them in hospital when I become a doctor ... it was completely new,\u000a        enjoyable, and\u000a        surprising - every student should do this.' Stephen Shashua, Director of\u000a        the Three Faiths\u000a        Forum, said that SR was `highly innovative as a model for engagement and\u000a        pushes\u000a        participants to explore areas that oftentimes they have never explored\u000a        before.'\u000a      \u000aLocal communities.

Ford is now the leading UK\u000a      researcher writing about\u000a      Scriptural Reasoning, and directs the Cambridge Inter-faith Programme, the\u000a      main seedbed\u000a      internationally for research related to Scriptural Reasoning. The research\u000a      explores how a practice\u000a      of shared reasoning can be developed between participants who have been\u000a      formed in, and remain\u000a      loyal to, religious traditions with different sources of authority and\u000a      reasoning practices, without\u000a      requiring prior commitment to a supposedly neutral account of the\u000a      possibility or process of such\u000a      shared reasoning. It is a contribution to inter-faith research, and more\u000a      broadly to accounts of the\u000a      nature of reasoning in the secular and religious public sphere.\u000a    Ford argues that the most important resources for inter-faith engagement\u000a      are people who\u000a      appreciatively inhabit their own tradition or community, whether religious\u000a      or secular, whilst\u000a      recognising that it is not without problems. Ford and his team have sought\u000a      to establish:\u000a    \u000a      a conception of religious tradition which challenges arguments\u000a        postulating the irrationality\u000a        or stability of religious thought;\u000a      a recognition that different religious traditions need to understand\u000a        their own ethical\u000a        positions as part of a process of development involving ongoing\u000a        disagreements, rather\u000a        than a stable unchanging morality;\u000a      the utility of public discourse especially in so far as it requires\u000a        learning each other's\u000a        patterns of disagreement. (Nicholas Adams, Habermas and Theology.\u000a        Cambridge\u000a        University Press, 2006)\u000a    \u000a    The practical outcome of these lines of research exercises impact most\u000a      directly on cultural life\u000a      (interpreting cultural capital, especially strategies for reading sacred\u000a      texts) and public discourse. It\u000a      crystallises as inter-faith engagement which occurs amongst those seeking\u000a      in their own tradition\u000a      resources for the exploration and transformation of that tradition, and\u000a      the transformation of the\u000a      relation between that tradition and others; and amongst those committed to\u000a      exploring partnerships\u000a      of difference with other traditions for the sake of such transformation.\u000a      Scriptural Reasoning groups\u000a      provide a context for such engagement to take place. Ford argues that such\u000a      engagement leads to\u000a      a fourfold deepening, as participants are drawn deeper into their own\u000a      tradition, into the traditions of\u000a      others, into the common good of creation and humanity, and into\u000a      partnerships of difference.\u000a    Ford edited (with Chad Pecknold, Research Associate and Postdoctoral\u000a      Fellow in the Faculty,\u000a      2004-2006) and contributed to The Promise of Scriptural Reasoning\u000a      (2006), the first book-length\u000a      treatment of Scriptural Reasoning; he has recently discussed Scriptural\u000a      Reasoning in relation to\u000a      Christian theology in chapters in Christian Wisdom (2007), Shaping\u000a        Theology (2007) and The\u000a        Future of Christian Theology (2011). In these and other\u000a      publications, Ford has explored the\u000a      possibility that Scriptural Reasoning can function as a form of\u000a      collaborative pursuit of wisdom for a\u000a      secular and religiously plural world. He argues that it allows the deep\u000a      sources of authority and\u000a      reasoning within differing religious traditions to be drawn on for the\u000a      sake of their own flourishing\u000a      and of the world they share, without differences between those traditions\u000a      being erased or elided.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"9235","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1522867","Name":"Kazakhstan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    A. Impact on Public Discourse\u000d\u000a    Perceptions of the English Reformation have been transformed by Duffy's\u000d\u000a      work in recent years, in circles well outside those of professional\u000d\u000a      scholars and higher education institutions. Duffy's major published works\u000d\u000a      have been reviewed not only in academic journals, but publications such as\u000d\u000a      the London Review of Books (including a review of Fires of\u000d\u000a        Faith by popular historical novelist Hilary Mantel, 24th\u000d\u000a      September 2009), the Spectator (17th June 2009), the Tablet\u000d\u000a      (29th May 2009) the BBC History magazine (10th\u000d\u000a      August 2009), the Guardian (27th July 2012), the\u000d\u000a      Independent (19th June 2009) the Daily Telegraph\u000d\u000a      (14th June 2009) and the Belfast Telegraph (17th\u000d\u000a      September 2010). Such exposure both testifies to and promotes wider\u000d\u000a      engagement with Duffy's research. His work is also frequently cited in\u000d\u000a      Church debates and discussion on the cultural and aesthetic impact of\u000d\u000a      Christianity in British culture [1].\u000d\u000a    Duffy has given many public lectures on his research, frequently in\u000d\u000a      association with major exhibitions and commemorative events. These include\u000d\u000a      talks on: (i) \"The Cardinal and the Queen: Restoring Catholic England\u000d\u000a      under Mary Tudor\" (Corpus Christ Church, New York, 17th\u000d\u000a      November 2008). (ii) \"The Cult of King Henry VI\" (St George's Chapel,\u000d\u000a      Windsor, 7th October 2009); (iii) \"Praying with Images in the\u000d\u000a      Middle Ages\" (Norwich Cathedral, 6th May 2010); (iv) \"King\u000d\u000a      James Bible: Dead or Alive?\" (the University of Bristol, 14th\u000d\u000a      November 2011) (v) \"Sacred Monarchy in Medieval England\" (the British\u000d\u000a      Library, 13th January 2012); (vi) \"Latin for Lay People:\u000d\u000a      Medieval Prayer Books\" (Lambeth Palace, 10th May 2012); (vi)\u000d\u000a      \"Saints, Sacrilege &amp; Sedition: Religion and Conflict in the Tudor\u000d\u000a      Reformation\" (the 12th Aldeburgh Literary Festival, 3rd\u000d\u000a      March 2013). He has also been involved in a public debate (\"From the World\u000d\u000a      of the Reliquary to the King James Bible\") at the British Museum (23rd\u000d\u000a      September 2011). All of the above events were to capacity audiences of\u000d\u000a      several hundred people.\u000d\u000a    B. Impact on Cultural Life\u000d\u000a    Duffy's successful promotion of the material culture of late-medieval\u000d\u000a      religion has contributed to a new interest in this area at crucial\u000d\u000a      contact-points between the public and historical scholarship. The Victoria\u000d\u000a      &amp; Albert Museum touring exhibition \"Object of Devotion\" showcased the\u000d\u000a      Museum's collections of English alabaster devotional sculpture, in a dozen\u000d\u000a      North American museums and galleries between December 2010 and September\u000d\u000a      2013 (as of 4th April 2013 c. 57,000 visitors had been to the\u000d\u000a      exhibition [2]). Duffy's research had helped alert the public to the\u000d\u000a      significance of these alabasters, and he was asked to contribute a chapter\u000d\u000a      to the accompanying book, hailed by the Wall Street Journal (11th\u000d\u000a      January 2012) as \"deserv(ing) to become a popular reference book on this\u000d\u000a      genre of Medieval art\" [3].\u000d\u000a    Duffy's influence is also evident in the planning and execution of the\u000d\u000a      University of York's interactive DVD-Rom, The English Parish Church\u000d\u000a        through the Centuries, a heritage resource for clergy, colleges,\u000d\u000a      schools and the general public. Its longest item is an eighteen minute\u000d\u000a      video by Duffy, exploring the material culture of Ranworth Church in the\u000d\u000a      Norfolk Broads: this video has circulated widely through official channels\u000d\u000a      and independently on You-tube [e.g. 4].\u000d\u000a    The Voices of Morebath has also generated engagement from many\u000d\u000a      different groups. In Morebath itself, where an English Heritage sign now\u000d\u000a      marks the road to the village, the church visitors' book testifies to the\u000d\u000a      hundreds of people prompted to visit after reading the book [5]. Programme\u000d\u000a      5 of the former cabinet minister Anne Widdicombe's 2009 Television series\u000d\u000a      Christianity, a History illustrated the impact of the reformation\u000d\u000a      on the people of rural England by focussing on Morebath, and featured an\u000d\u000a      interview there with Duffy: similarly, programme 5 of the BBC 2 2012\u000d\u000a      series The Great British Story, a People's History, featured\u000d\u000a      Morebath centrally in its reformation episode. A popular historian and TV\u000d\u000a      presenter has stressed the importance of Duffy's work for other recent BBC\u000d\u000a      TV series, In search of Shakespeare, and The Story of England,\u000d\u000a      as well as A People's History, and notes that \"in talking to the\u000d\u000a      villagers about the story told in Voices of Morebath, it was clear\u000d\u000a      that Professor Duffy's book had had an extraordinary impact on the\u000d\u000a      community itself, and on the people's view of their shared past: a lovely\u000d\u000a      example of how history can feed back into people's lives, firing their\u000d\u000a      imaginations\" [6].\u000d\u000a    Duffy's work has also had a significant impact on public perception of\u000d\u000a      Tudor England in the field of drama and other performing arts. The RSC\u000d\u000a      Shakespeare productions demonstrate a new awareness of religious culture\u000d\u000a      in early modern England. Their 2010 production Romeo and Juliet\u000d\u000a      featured a programme article by Duffy [7], relating English Protestant\u000d\u000a      attitudes towards Catholicism to the imagery of Shakespeare's text. For\u000d\u000a      the RSC's 2011 production of Macbeth, Duffy wrote a programme\u000d\u000a      essay [8] on the impact of iconoclasm on Shakespeare's England. Each\u000d\u000a      programme sold c. 25,000 copies [9]. In 2011, the RSC produced Written\u000d\u000a        on the Heart, an original play by David Edgar, marking the\u000d\u000a      quarto-centenary of the King James translation of the Bible. The entire\u000d\u000a      cast read Duffy's Stripping of the Altars as part of their\u000d\u000a      preparation for the play, and Duffy conducted a workshop for the actors on\u000d\u000a      the impact of religious change and iconoclasm in Tudor England [10].\u000d\u000a    Duffy was also invited to provide the historical programme notes for the\u000d\u000a      2008 and 2010 choral tours of the well-known choir The Sixteen,\u000d\u000a      and for the subsequent CDs, highlighting the historical and religious\u000d\u000a      context of the sacred music they performed [e.g. 11]: he was one of the\u000d\u000a      main speakers at the 2008 \"insight day\" for the general public organised\u000d\u000a      by the Sixteen and of the National Centre for Early Music at the Royal\u000d\u000a      Naval Hospital at Greenwich [12].\u000d\u000a    C. Impact on Education\u000d\u000a    Duffy's research has impacted significantly on history teaching in\u000d\u000a      schools. The Stripping of the Altars is recommended by AQA as 'the\u000d\u000a      best book for creating the picture of Catholic England'. Duffy's study of\u000d\u000a      Morebath has been made the basis for a pioneering history syllabus\u000d\u000a      designed for year 8 students in Cambridgeshire schools, and now being\u000d\u000a      promoted by the department of Education at Cambridge University for use in\u000d\u000a      schools nationally [13]. It is has also had international impact: the book\u000d\u000a      is currently being used to introduce teachers of history there to the\u000d\u000a      importance of micro-historical studies in the teaching of history as far\u000d\u000a      afield as Kazakhstan [14].\u000d\u000a    Duffy's work on historic Catholic practices and beliefs has affected\u000d\u000a      thinking about modern religious and pastoral practice, as shown for\u000d\u000a      example by the invitation to him to be a keynote speaker at the study day\u000d\u000a      on Death and Dying, organised for clergy, and laity (especially doctors\u000d\u000a      and palliative care-workers) by the Centre for Catholic Studies at Durham\u000d\u000a      University in March 2013 [15].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Eamon Duffy has made a major contribution to the rediscovery of the lived\u000d\u000a      experience of traditional religion in the fifteenth and sixteenth\u000d\u000a      centuries, enabling a re-assessment of the role of Catholicism during the\u000d\u000a      English Reformation.

This research was carried out from\u000d\u000a      the early 1990s to date, while Duffy was in post successively as Lecturer,\u000d\u000a      Reader and, from 2002, Professor of the History of Christianity in the\u000d\u000a      Faculty of Divinity in the University of Cambridge.\u000d\u000a    This work has made a major contribution to the rediscovery of the lived\u000d\u000a      experience of traditional religion in the fifteenth and sixteenth\u000d\u000a      centuries, enabling a re-assessment of the role of Catholicism during the\u000d\u000a      English Reformation. Duffy's use of material culture has characterised\u000d\u000a      this work and its original contribution to the field: this includes close\u000d\u000a      examination of church architecture, of artefacts such as books of hours,\u000d\u000a      and of the records of the construction, use and destruction of religious\u000d\u000a      objects.\u000d\u000a    This research was first embodied in The Stripping of the Altars,\u000d\u000a      published in 1992 with a substantially revised second edition in 2005.\u000d\u000a      This was followed by four more books: The Voices of Morebath\u000d\u000a      (2001), Marking the Hours (2006), Fires of Faith (2009)\u000d\u000a      and Saints, Sacrilege and Sedition (2012). These form an unfolding\u000d\u000a      body of research in which Duffy has developed his insights through\u000d\u000a      microhistory (examining the impact of the Reformation in a particular\u000d\u000a      English parish), through examining the readership and reception of late\u000d\u000a      medieval personal devotional books, and through a major re-assessment of\u000d\u000a      the reign of Mary I (1553-1558) and the reception of her religious policy.\u000d\u000a      Other essays and articles supplemented these main research outputs.\u000d\u000a    Duffy's research has focussed on: (i) The now (following his lead) widely\u000d\u000a      adopted concept of \"traditional religion\", that is, religious culture as\u000d\u000a      rooted in shared and inherited beliefs and symbols. Within Duffy's\u000d\u000a      research, this became a way of describing late medieval\/early modern\u000d\u000a      religion while avoiding misleading dichotomies between 'popular religion'\u000d\u000a      and 'elite' religion; (ii) re-assessment of the relationship between the\u000d\u000a      English and their Church on the eve of the Reformation. This has both\u000d\u000a      demonstrated, and emphasised, the alertness of the institutional Church to\u000d\u000a      the aspirations of members of society, and the level of engagement of\u000d\u000a      parishioners with orthodox religion; (iii) carrying this insight forward,\u000d\u000a      Duffy re-evaluated the response of Catholic leaders to the Reformation, in\u000d\u000a      particular during the reign of Mary I and discovered their ability to\u000d\u000a      harness the power of popular religious culture; (iv) achieving major\u000d\u000a      historical re-interpretation through examination, both broad and deep, of\u000d\u000a      the material culture of religion and the documentary records thereof,\u000d\u000a      across all levels of society.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11835","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact of Cook's work has arisen from his extensive engagement with\u000d\u000a      psychiatric professionals across the UK. He worked part-time as a\u000d\u000a      consultant psychiatrist until 2012 (and remains an honorary consultant),\u000d\u000a      was chair of the Royal College of Psychiatrists' Spirituality Interest\u000d\u000a      Group 2009-13, and is an advisor to the World Psychiatric Association's\u000d\u000a      Section on Religion, Spirituality and Psychiatry. Through (i) his\u000d\u000a      engagement with professional debates and practice on a broad front, he has\u000d\u000a      (ii) shaped local initiatives more systematically, and (iii) directly\u000d\u000a      formed a new national policy framework.\u000d\u000a    (i) Professional Debate. Since the Durham Project for\u000d\u000a      Spirituality, Theology and Health was established in 2005, Cook has\u000d\u000a      lectured widely on spirituality and psychiatry in the UK and abroad,\u000d\u000a      speaking at well over 50 conferences and similar events. Delegates have\u000d\u000a      typically included healthcare professionals and\/or chaplains\/clergy, as\u000d\u000a      well as academics from various disciplines. One key event was the 2010\u000d\u000a      Durham Conference on Spirituality, Theology and Mental Health, which was\u000d\u000a      unique in bringing together theologians with academics and professionals\u000d\u000a      from diverse other disciplines. The resulting edited volume (Cook 2013)\u000d\u000a      was published for an audience of clergy and health professionals. This\u000d\u000a      conference activity has been further consolidated and underpinned by the\u000d\u000a      publications cited in section 3, which are written for professional as\u000d\u000a      well as academic readers and which aim to stimulate professional debate,\u000d\u000a      in part by engaging with issues across traditional disciplinary boundaries\u000d\u000a      &#8212; in particular, by introducing psychiatrists to relevant research in\u000d\u000a      theology and the humanities. For example, an `In Debate' article in the British\u000a        Journal of Psychiatry (Poole and Cook 2011), on whether prayer can\u000d\u000a      be a legitimate part of good clinical practice, provoked a lively\u000d\u000a      correspondence in the journal: ten further contributions were published\u000d\u000a      over a three-month period.[1] These debates have had the beneficial effect\u000d\u000a      of engaging the thinking of the professionals concerned and, therefore,\u000d\u000a      influencing their treatment of their patients and of clients in the mental\u000d\u000a      health services. A leading Irish professor of psychiatry has commented\u000d\u000a      that `Professor Cook's work has contributed greatly to a nuanced\u000d\u000a      understanding of the role of spirituality\/religion in people's lives with\u000d\u000a      particular reference to mental illness\/health.' [2]\u000d\u000a    (ii) Clinical Service Initiatives. In 2008, Cook was instrumental,\u000d\u000a      with clinical and chaplaincy colleagues, in establishing a spirituality\u000d\u000a      working group within Tees, Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust. The\u000d\u000a      creation of this group, which includes mental health service users,\u000d\u000a      clinical staff and managers, was largely facilitated by the Durham Project\u000d\u000a      for Spirituality, Theology and Health, and Cook continues to provide input\u000d\u000a      on the research evidence base for policy and good practice. Under Cook's\u000d\u000a      leadership, the group developed its own working definition of spirituality\u000d\u000a      in the clinical setting, and based on that a spirituality care pathway\u000d\u000a      (Cook et al 2012). Cook also contributed to this group's development (with\u000d\u000a      the aid of professional graphic design) of a practical tool to assist\u000d\u000a      patients and carers in the assessment of spiritual needs, which takes the\u000d\u000a      form of a `flower'.[3a] The `flower' has been piloted in selected\u000d\u000a      in-patient services within the Trust: an adult psychiatry ward, a ward for\u000d\u000a      the elderly, and a learning disability service.[3b] It is under\u000d\u000a      consideration by the Clinical Governance Committee for adoption more\u000d\u000a      widely across the Trust as a whole. The spirituality pathway represents a\u000d\u000a      significant and (to our knowledge) unique innovation which has positively\u000d\u000a      influenced staff who had been doubtful about the importance of\u000d\u000a      spirituality in clinical practice. A nurse working with people with\u000d\u000a      learning disabilities (himself a professed atheist) has written that:\u000d\u000a    [The] guiding principle of aiming to help a person be able to flourish is\u000d\u000a      why I got involved with the spirituality pathway and the work developed by\u000d\u000a      Chris Cook. I consider the development of the spirituality flower a\u000d\u000a      powerful and relevant tool. [3c]\u000d\u000a    The group's work on this care pathway has been presented at conferences\u000d\u000a      including a 2011 national conference in London, convened by RCN\u000d\u000a      Publications and attended by c. 200 nursing professionals. It provides an\u000d\u000a      example of research-based good practice which both sets professional\u000d\u000a      standards and also provides benefit in terms of improved spiritual care\u000d\u000a      for mental health service users.[4]\u000d\u000a    (iii) National Policy. In 2004 Cook was invited to join the\u000d\u000a      Executive Committee of the Spirituality and Psychiatry Special Interest\u000d\u000a      Group of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, the body responsible for\u000d\u000a      setting professional standards for psychiatrists in the UK. His standing\u000d\u000a      in the field led to his appointment as that group's chair in 2009. In this\u000d\u000a      role, he drafted a Position Statement, later entitled Recommendations\u000d\u000a        for Psychiatrists on Spirituality and Religion, which was submitted\u000d\u000a      to the Royal College's Policy Committee. Following revisions by Cook in\u000d\u000a      response to the College's peer review process, this document [5] was\u000d\u000a      adopted by the College as its official policy in 2011. As such, it is to\u000d\u000a      `be followed by members' of the College, and provides the benchmark for\u000d\u000a      good practice with regard to spirituality and religion for psychiatry in\u000d\u000a      the UK.\u000d\u000a    The document explains the need for a statement on spirituality in\u000d\u000a      relation to existing General Medical Council and Royal College policies;\u000d\u000a      sets out the evidential base; and presents the practical issues that arise\u000d\u000a      in relation to matters of spirituality and religion in clinical\u000d\u000a      psychiatric practice. It is organised around Cook's 2004 definition of\u000d\u000a      spirituality (quoted in full on p. 4), and is closely informed by his Spirituality\u000a        and Psychiatry (Cook, Sims and Powell 2009) and `The Faith of the\u000d\u000a      Psychiatrist' (Cook 2011). It concludes with detailed recommendations both\u000d\u000a      for individual practitioners and also for organisational policy, including\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The need to consider spirituality when taking patients' personal\u000d\u000a        histories\u000d\u000a      Respect and sensitivity towards patients, families and carers, and\u000d\u000a        colleagues\u000d\u000a      Neither proselytizing mental health users nor undermining their faith\u000d\u000a      The need to work with chaplaincies and wider faith communities\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    For the first time in UK mental health practice, this policy affirms a\u000d\u000a      positive place for addressing spirituality and religion. It provides\u000d\u000a      guidance to protect both professionals and patients from potential abuses\u000d\u000a      in clinical practice, such as proselytising. It also aims to ensure that\u000d\u000a      spiritual aspects of care are not neglected (for example, due to fear of\u000d\u000a      accusations of proselytising) where they might be clinically significant.\u000d\u000a    The policy also requires that these principles be integrated into\u000d\u000a      psychiatric training and continuing professional development (CPD).\u000d\u000a      Accordingly, the Spirituality and Psychiatry Special Interest Group has\u000d\u000a      submitted formal recommendations to the College's Curriculum Review\u000d\u000a      Working Group [6]. The first CPD event in this field to be organised\u000d\u000a      through the College's own conference centre took place in London in March\u000d\u000a      2013, with 65 professionals attending. 96.2% of respondents rated Cook's\u000d\u000a      opening plenary as relevant or highly relevant to their needs. Many\u000d\u000a      attendees commented that the conference `boost[ed] my confidence' or made\u000d\u000a      them `more confident about asking about spiritual needs of my patients',\u000d\u000a      encouraging them to be `more proactive in addressing my patient's\u000d\u000a      spiritual needs'. One experienced practitioner declared an intention to\u000d\u000a      `enquire specifically about S\/R of patients as a routine part of initial\u000d\u000a      assessments. ... This would change my previous practice.' [7]\u000d\u000a    Beyond these specific impacts, the new policy has fed back into wider\u000d\u000a      professional discourse. The current president of the Royal College of\u000d\u000a      Psychiatrists comments that the document has given rise to `a rigorous,\u000d\u000a      open, non-biased debate'. In particular she commends the clear guidelines\u000d\u000a      it has brought to `an enormous[ly] important topic', which has in the past\u000d\u000a      repeatedly produced allegations of professional misconduct. `There were\u000d\u000a      lots of rumblings, lots of debates, lots of disagreements.... Instead of\u000d\u000a      talking about it [Cook] got it to the point of being delivered.' [8] A\u000d\u000a      former President of the Royal College welcomed the policy's\u000d\u000a      recommendations as `highly significant for the better practice of\u000d\u000a      psychiatry ... they are already moulding practice.' [9] The debate has now\u000d\u000a      moved on to the World Psychiatric Association, where proposals by Cook and\u000d\u000a      a Dutch colleague for a formal Consensus Statement on this subject are now\u000d\u000a      being actively debated and are the subject of lively controversy. [10]\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Professor Christopher Cook's research on the role of spirituality in\u000d\u000a      psychiatric care has had a wide-ranging effect on professional debate,\u000d\u000a      policy and practice amongst psychiatrists in the UK and beyond. His\u000d\u000a      argument that psychiatry should undertake a constructive and nuanced\u000d\u000a      engagement with spirituality, defined broadly, has sparked widespread\u000d\u000a      debate within the profession. His work with an NHS trust since 2008 has\u000d\u000a      produced a set of new clinical service initiatives, and his wider\u000d\u000a      influence led the Royal College of Psychiatrists to commission him to\u000d\u000a      produce its first formal policy statement on spirituality and religion,\u000d\u000a      adopted in 2011.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Health","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    Durham University\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Durham (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Durham","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"North East","UKPRN":10007143}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a1.

In\u000d\u000a      addition to recognition over recent decades of the relevance of social and\u000d\u000a      psychological factors, the psychiatric importance of spirituality and\u000d\u000a      religion is now increasingly acknowledged. Cook has played a large part in\u000d\u000a      this change. A growing evidence base suggests that spirituality and\u000d\u000a      religion can affect treatment outcomes for a variety of physical and\u000d\u000a      mental disorders, as well as being important for `whole person' care.\u000d\u000a      However, in the pluralistic and secular context of modern healthcare,\u000d\u000a      `spirituality' is a controversial concept, open to varying definitions.\u000d\u000a      Its place in professional healthcare practice is beset with ethical and\u000d\u000a      practical problems. In particular, questions arise as to how spirituality\u000d\u000a      might be defined in such a plural context, and whether and how such a\u000d\u000a      definition might then be applied in clinical practice. Durham University\u000d\u000a      has one of the few centres in the world to have engaged in serious\u000d\u000a      theological contribution to these debates.\u000d\u000a    Cook is both a consultant psychiatrist and an Anglican priest, with\u000d\u000a      research doctorates in medicine and theology, and with extensive pastoral\u000d\u000a      and clinical experience. His research focuses on the relationships between\u000d\u000a      spirituality, theology and health. He became a Professorial Research\u000d\u000a      Fellow at St Chad's College, Durham University, in 2003, and since 2005\u000d\u000a      has been based in the Department of Theology and Religion. In that year he\u000d\u000a      established the Durham Project for Spirituality, Theology and Health, of\u000d\u000a      which he is Director. Its stated aims are: 1. To promote interdisciplinary\u000d\u000a      and collaborative research and teaching in the subject areas of\u000d\u000a      spirituality, theology and health. 2. To contribute to discussion and\u000d\u000a      policy processes both in churches and other religious communities and also\u000d\u000a      within health and social care services. Since its inception, the Project\u000d\u000a      has involved collaboration with the University's School for Medicine and\u000d\u000a      Health, with local NHS trusts and with relevant professional bodies.\u000d\u000a    Cook's extensive qualitative study of the clinical and research\u000d\u000a      literature on addiction gave rise to an integrative and inclusive\u000d\u000a      definition of `spirituality', which he argues is a more open and universal\u000d\u000a      term than `religion'. In this definition spirituality is\u000d\u000a    a distinctive, potentially creative and universal dimension of human\u000d\u000a      experience arising both within the inner subjective awareness of\u000d\u000a      individuals and within communities, social groups and traditions. It may\u000d\u000a      be experienced as relationship with that which is intimately `inner',\u000d\u000a      immanent and personal, within the self and others, and\/or as relationship\u000d\u000a      with that which is wholly `other', transcendent and beyond the self. It is\u000d\u000a      experienced as being of fundamental or ultimate importance and is thus\u000d\u000a      concerned with matters of meaning and purpose in life, truth and values.\u000d\u000a      (Cook 2004; Cook 2009)\u000d\u000a    Cook's definition has been cited by a series of other scholars, for\u000d\u000a      example by contributors to M. Galanter and L. A. Kaskutas (eds), Research\u000a        on Alcoholics Anonymous and Spirituality in Addiction Recovery (New\u000d\u000a      York: Springer, 2008). Further research by Cook has clarified the nature\u000d\u000a      and dynamics of spirituality in relation to addiction and other mental\u000d\u000a      disorders, and to psychiatric treatment:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      In Alcohol, Addiction and Christian Ethics (Cook 2006) it is\u000d\u000a        demonstrated that a theological model of addiction which is compatible\u000d\u000a        with scientific models illuminates the spiritual nature of the dynamics\u000d\u000a        of addictive disorders. This enables an integrative approach to\u000d\u000a        treatment which incorporates the best of scientific and more purely\u000d\u000a        religious \/ spiritual approaches (such as Alcoholics Anonymous).\u000d\u000a      Using Cook's definition of `spirituality' as a starting point, Spirituality\u000a          and Psychiatry (Cook, Sims and Powell 2009) is the first serious\u000d\u000a        evidence-based attempt by a group of British psychiatrists and care\u000d\u000a        professionals to address the place of spirituality in clinical practice\u000d\u000a        in psychiatry. It demonstrates that a better understanding in\u000d\u000a        psychiatric practice of the nature and place of spirituality in human\u000d\u000a        wellbeing fosters a better understanding both of mental disorder, and of\u000d\u000a        mental health service users.\u000d\u000a      `The Faith of the Psychiatrist' (Cook 2011) analyses the extent of\u000d\u000a        current published evidence for the so-called `religiosity gap' between\u000d\u000a        mental health professionals and their patients, a gap which has adverse\u000d\u000a        effects upon the doctor-patient relationship and consequently undermines\u000d\u000a        clinical care. The Royal College of Psychiatrists' policy (see 4.iii\u000d\u000a        below) seeks to address this problem by promoting more sensitive and\u000d\u000a        affirmative clinical enquiry.\u000d\u000a      \u000aSpirituality, Theology and Mental Health (Cook 2013) argues\u000d\u000a        that good professional practice properly incorporates spirituality, and\u000d\u000a        indeed cannot realistically exclude it. It further uses the theological\u000d\u000a        concepts of transcendence and immanence to explain both the importance\u000d\u000a        of spirituality in mental health, and also the controversies around the\u000d\u000a        subject.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    In numerous conference presentations and publications, Cook has\u000d\u000a      demonstrated the importance of interdisciplinary engagement as a means of\u000d\u000a      understanding the emerging significance of spirituality in healthcare\u000d\u000a      research and practice (eg Cook et al 2011). This work explains some of the\u000d\u000a      current professional controversies concerning the place of spirituality\u000d\u000a      within psychiatry. It also explains why mental health service users tend\u000d\u000a      to affirm spirituality as an aspect of the care that they wish to receive\u000d\u000a      much more unambiguously than the professionals who provide that care. It\u000d\u000a      provides a basis for a more active incorporation of spirituality into\u000d\u000a      clinical assessment and treatment planning.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11836","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Murray's research has facilitated the resumption and redirection of the\u000a      stalled process of\u000a      engagement between Christian churches. The value of RE is that it does not\u000a      aim to produce\u000a      dramatic formal agreements or doctrinal shifts. Rather, its purpose is to\u000a      change the way in which\u000a      ecumenical conversations are pursued at every level; and thereby to\u000a      promote change within\u000a      particular traditions, through receiving and learning from other\u000a      traditions. Its impact can be\u000a      evidenced principally at two levels:\u000a    1: International ecumenical bodies\u000a    (i) The Pontifical Council for the Promotion of Christian Unity.\u000a      The PCPCU is the Vatican body\u000a      responsible for ecumenical matters. The PCPCU President participated in\u000a      the 2006 colloquium and\u000a      wrote a preface to Murray 2008b, stating that `I am convinced that it [RE]\u000a      will contribute to a new\u000a      start ... within the ecumenical movement'; in 2008 he described RE as `a\u000a      decisive step' in\u000a      ecumenism. [1] The report of an extraordinary PCPCU colloquium in February\u000a      2010 identified RE\u000a      as a key ecumenical technique, emphasising how RE can `help [ecumenical]\u000a      dialogues to be\u000a      sensitive to issues of culture and local realities'. [4] Since then, the\u000a      PCPCU has introduced RE to a\u000a      range of local Catholic contexts (see below, 4.2.ii). The PCPCU officer\u000a      responsible for relations\u000a      with Anglicanism and Methodism worldwide, stated in mid-2013: `Receptive\u000a      Ecumenism has had a\u000a      considerable influence on the function and method of current ecumenical\u000a      dialogue in which this\u000a      Pontifical Council is engaged'. [1b]\u000a    (ii) World Council of Churches (WCC). An international colloquium,\u000a      `Receptive Ecumenism and\u000a      Ecclesial Learning' (Durham, January 2009) attracted 200 participants\u000a      including the twenty senior\u000a      ecumenical officers from the UK's denominations (in lieu of their own\u000a      annual meeting), and the\u000a      director and both assistant directors of the WCC's Faith and Order\u000a      Commission. Consequently, the\u000a      WCC invited Murray to be a consultant to the 2009 decennial meeting of the\u000a      Faith and Order\u000a      Commission, the principal global forum for ecumenical engagement. At the\u000a      director's invitation,\u000a      Murray prepared one of three documents for pre-circulation to all\u000a      participants. The director's\u000a      covering letter introduced RE as a `significant development ... in the\u000a      contemporary Ecumenical\u000a      Movement'.[3] Those influenced by this introduction include the Professor\u000a      of Canon Law and\u000a      Kirchenrecht at Erfurt University, who has since lectured on RE to leading\u000a      ecumenical groups in\u000a      Germany, and through whom RE was in 2013 introduced to the newly started\u000a      Vienna dialogue\u000a      between the Community of Protestant Churches in Europe and the Roman\u000a      Catholic Church.[10]\u000a    (iii) Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC). RE\u000a      is central to the third phase\u000a      of ARCIC, the highest profile English-language bilateral ecumenical\u000a      dialogue. Historically, the\u000a      methods pioneered by ARCIC have shaped all other bilaterals. ARCIC's first\u000a      and second phases\u000a      (1970-1981, 1982-2005) eventually reached an impasse in the face of\u000a      apparently irreconcilable\u000a      and growing differences of doctrine and practice. A long hiatus followed\u000a      the conclusion of ARCIC\u000a      II, symptomatic of a general recognition that the process had stalled.\u000a    The emergence of RE therefore proved timely. A month after the 2009 RE\u000a      colloquium, the\u000a      Cardinal-Archbishop of Westminster addressed the Church of England's\u000a      General Synod, stating\u000a      that `I see the ecumenical landscape between our two Churches in this\u000a      intermediate time as a kind\u000a      of receptive ecumenism'. In the debate that followed, the Anglican bishops\u000a      of Guildford and\u000a      Durham explicitly praised RE as an approach, the latter paying particular\u000a      tribute to Murray and\u000a      adding that when he had first heard of RE, `I thought it was a\u000a      breath-taking and wonderful way of\u000a      approaching the ecumenical task'. [2] RE was thus endorsed as a method for\u000a      ecumenism by senior\u000a      representatives of both partners in the ARCIC process.\u000a    In 2011, a third phase of ARCIC was launched, and Pope Benedict XVI named\u000a      Murray as one of\u000a      the Commission's nine Roman Catholic members, specifically in order to\u000a      bring RE to bear on\u000a      ARCIC's work. At the Commission's inaugural meeting in May 2011, it\u000a      received a paper from\u000a      Murray and then formally recognised RE as the fresh methodology which it\u000a      needed. The official\u000a      communique cites Murray 2007 and states: `In considering the method that\u000a      ARCIC III will use, the\u000a      Commission was particularly helped by the approach of \"receptive\u000a      ecumenism\". ... ARCIC is\u000a      committed to modelling the receptive ecumenism it advocates.' [5a] One of\u000a      ARCIC's co-chairs\u000a      described Murray's paper for ARCIC as `a serious and prophetic text,\u000a      unlocking doors we might not\u000a      have even thought were there'.[5b] The Anglican Commmunion's director of\u000a      Unity, Faith and Order\u000a      singled out the use of RE as ARCIC III's primary innovation.[5d]\u000a    ARCIC's agenda and methods have thus fundamentally changed from its\u000a      previous iterations.\u000a      Rather than aiming to produce agreed statements on controversial points,\u000a      ARCIC III is now\u000a      working to produce documents containing parallel statements from the two\u000a      denominational parties,\u000a      in which each engages in self-criticism in the light of the other's\u000a      practices. In accordance with RE's\u000a      focus on cultures of knowledge, the theme of the first phase of ARCIC III\u000a      is the underpinning\u000a      problem of `how our two Communions approach moral decision making, and how\u000a      areas of tension\u000a      for Anglicans and Roman Catholics might be resolved by learning from the\u000a      other'.[5a]\u000a    In summary, while the work of ARCIC continues, RE has already provided a\u000a      means of restarting\u000a      this globally significant ecumenical process and profoundly shaped its\u000a      proceedings. As one ARCIC\u000a      member observed in 2013: `We are starting from a different place than\u000a      ARCIC I which thought that\u000a      finding common language might lead us to unity. ... We began with\u000a      receptive ecumenism.' This has\u000a      not been uncontroversial: another member has expressed concern that `we\u000a      are putting all our\u000a      methodological eggs in the receptive ecumenism basket'.[5e] But the effect\u000a      is clear. As a senior\u000a      bishop and officer at the PCPCU commented in 2011, the adoption of RE by\u000a      ARCIC meant that\u000a      `Receptive Ecumenism has moved from a great initiative among a group of\u000a      academics and\u000a      ecumenists ... to a stated part of the methodology of the bilateral\u000a      dialogue which has shaped the\u000a      methodologies of so many other bilaterals'. [5c]\u000a    2: Local and regional churches\u000a    Endorsements by the PCPCU and WCC have fostered local interest in RE\u000a      internationally. Murray\u000a      has been invited to speak at RE-related events in ten countries on five\u000a      continents, ranging from a\u000a      full-scale conference on RE in Dublin in 2006 (organised by the Mater Dei\u000a      Institute, Dublin City\u000a      University), which brought together academic theologians and\u000a      denominational ecumenical officers,\u000a      through to practical workshops for church leaders, such as one in Rome in\u000a      2008, or the series in\u000a      Australia and New Zealand described below.\u000a    However, RE's influence now reaches well beyond Murray's own activity. A\u000a      recent survey of local\u000a      Anglican-Roman Catholic commissions across the world by the International\u000a      Anglican-Roman\u000a      Catholic Commission on Unity and Mission (IARCCUM) `indicates clearly that\u000a      Receptive\u000a      Ecumenism is a formative influence on their discussions'.[1b] Indeed, the\u000a      newly appointed\u000a      Archbishop of Canterbury has contacted Murray to discuss how RE could\u000a      inform Anglican-Catholic\u000a      relations. The cultural change effected by RE is by its nature diffuse,\u000a      but is illustrated by Murray's\u000a      personal involvement in two particular regions:\u000a    (i) North-East England. Following the programmatic statement in\u000a      Murray 2007, the Durham Project\u000a      on Receptive Ecumenism and the Local Church was launched in north-east\u000a      England in 2008, with\u000a      the involvement of Anglican, Assemblies of God, Baptist, Methodist, Roman\u000a      Catholic, Salvation\u000a      Army, and United Reformed Church (URC) representatives. The aim is for the\u000a      partners, in dialogue\u000a      with one another, each to reflect on the contingency of their own cultures\u000a      and organisational\u000a      structures. The Moderator of the URC Northern Synod comments that the\u000a      project has enabled the\u000a      URC `to explore ... a different way of expressing the unity that is a gift\u000a      of Christ', which is `rich in\u000a      terms of intra church dialogue'.[8]\u000a    The self-critical awareness which RE has generated through this project\u000a      is indicated by the\u000a      following examples. The URC is using the example of Anglican and Roman\u000a      Catholic deaneries to\u000a      review the structures of its mission partnerships, exploring the place\u000a      which `personal authority\u000a      (episcope)' might have in `a clearer more defined structure' to `help\u000a      support local churches'. The\u000a      Moderator believes that this will `enable us to live \"the priesthood of\u000a      all believers\" more fully' [8].\u000a    The Roman Catholic diocese of Hexham and Newcastle is proposing to change\u000a      the workings of its\u000a      diocesan and parochial pastoral councils, drawing on Methodist practice.\u000a      Canonically, these\u000a      councils are purely consultative; the proposal is to introduce\u000a      `deliberative modes of governance ...\u000a      providing stronger means for lay involvement' by `opening up membership'\u000a      and requiring such\u000a      councils to be formed in every parish [9].\u000a    (ii) Australia and New Zealand. In 2012 Murray was invited by the\u000a      South Australian Council of\u000a      Churches (SACC) and the other principal ecumenical bodies in Australia and\u000a      New Zealand to\u000a      lecture and advise on the application of RE for their churches. From 8\u000a      July - 30 August, he toured\u000a      both countries, addressing 25 public meetings and discussing the local\u000a      adaptation of RE with\u000a      virtually all of those in the two countries involved in formal ecumenical\u000a      dialogues.\u000a    As a result, in October 2012 SACC published an online booklet, Healing\u000a        Gifts for Wounded Hands:\u000a        The Promise and Potential of Receptive Ecumenism (since updated),\u000a      which promotes the practice\u000a      of RE at grassroots level. It states that Murray's visit `inspired ...\u000a      many people across the Church in\u000a      Australia \/ New Zealand and led to the desire of the South Australian\u000a      Council of Churches to keep\u000a      alive the \"conversation\" on the promise and potential of Receptive\u000a      Ecumenism '[6a]. As with\u000a      international bodies such as ARCIC, RE has provided fresh wind to a\u000a      becalmed ecumenical\u000a      process. The SACC President confirms that RE now has `a groundswell of\u000a      interest ... across\u000a      Australia and New Zealand'. Murray's visit `has helped harness that\u000a      interest, develop a strong\u000a      theological framework around it and given an impetus across the Church\u000a      community' [6b].\u000a    In turn, the success of the SACC booklet persuaded the British branch of\u000a      the Bible Society, the\u000a      world's leading Bible translator (working in more than 200 countries and\u000a      territories), to commission\u000a      a version for international use, bolstered by fresh material from Murray\u000a      and from the Archbishops\u000a      of Canterbury and Westminster. The Bible Society USA is also supporting\u000a      this project. The Bible\u000a      Society's head of advocacy confirms that this reflects `our commitment to\u000a      Receptive Ecumenism'\u000a      and that the Society is `investing a significant amount of both funding\u000a      and time' to produce this\u000a      resource and to disseminate it internationally.[7]\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Receptive Ecumenism (RE) is a fresh method for conducting ecumenical\u000a      dialogue, originating in\u000a      the research of Paul Murray.

While this approach has\u000a      borne fruit in various\u000a      bilateral ecumenical processes, it has also increasingly run up against\u000a      fundamental differences of\u000a      doctrine and culture. Professor Paul Murray's concept of \"Receptive\u000a      Ecumenism\" (RE) provides a\u000a      way out of this cul-de-sac. It focuses not on historic problems but on\u000a      what each community \/\u000a      tradition can with integrity learn or receive from others. That\u000a      is, each tradition is invited to focus, not\u000a      on the problems which other traditions' doctrines and practices represent,\u000a      but on an open-ended\u000a      process of self-criticism in the light of the others' doctrines\u000a      and practices. The process is one of\u000a      spiritual discernment and communal self-examination.\u000a    Murray was appointed Lecturer in Theology in Durham in 2003 (Professor\u000a      from 2009). In 2004 he\u000a      set out the key principles of RE in a book exploring the nature of\u000a      theological reasoning in a plural,\u000a      post-foundational context. At a theoretical level, RE reflects a\u000a      `committed pluralism' (Murray 2004),\u000a      influenced especially by the American pragmatist philosopher Nicholas\u000a      Rescher. This holds in\u000a      creative tension the two convictions (1) that the world we inhabit is\u000a      irreducibly plural, and (2) that\u000a      particular rooted commitment is a rational, non-relativistic response to\u000a      this plurality. The tension\u000a      between these convictions gives rise to an ethical imperative for\u000a      particularity to be open to its plural\u000a      contexts. It needs to retain its own integrity while allowing itself to be\u000a      affected by those contexts,\u000a      rather than ignoring them or seeking to subject them to itself. When this\u000a      ethic of receptivity is\u000a      applied in the context of ecumenical dialogue, the focus shifts from\u000a      critical questioning of the `other'\u000a      to critical questioning of one's own particular community in the light of\u000a      the `other'. The underlying\u000a      question becomes, `What can our own tradition learn by receiving from\u000a      another tradition?', asked in\u000a      the expectation that some aspects of Christianity will be more adequately\u000a      performed in the other\u000a      tradition than within one's own.\u000a    The conclusions in Murray 2004 and in subsequent articles (Murray 2005\u000a      &amp; 2006) drew out certain\u000a      important ecumenical and ecclesiological implications. An RE approach to\u000a      ecumenism, it is argued,\u000a      requires Christian communities to deepen awareness of their own cultures\u000a      and structures of\u000a      reasoning and decision-making, and in particular of the contingency and\u000a      fallibility of those cultures\u000a      and structures. It also requires communities to consider how their own\u000a      reasoning and decision-making recognise the contested nature of knowledge and certainty. Murray's\u000a      articles applied this\u000a      approach specifically to the Roman Catholic Church, questioning whether\u000a      Catholic decision- making is in fact and necessarily as absolutist and hierarchical as is\u000a      commonly understood. He\u000a      described structures of knowledge in Catholicism as an open web which is\u000a      in practice capable of\u000a      assimilating ideas while preserving both their and its own integrity. The\u000a      articles also explore how\u000a      formal Catholic decision-making might be restructured to reflect this.\u000a      These explorations were\u000a      summarised in a programmatic statement of the RE agenda (eventually\u000a      published as Murray\u000a      2007), around which a colloquium of 150 church-and university-based\u000a      theologians from eight\u000a      denominations and eleven countries was convened in 2006. Thirty-two papers\u000a      presented to the\u000a      colloquium were published in Murray 2008b. The power of this approach was\u000a      further recognised by\u000a      an issue of the scholarly journal, Louvain Studies 33 (2008), much\u000a      of which was devoted to RE.\u000a      Alongside Murray's discussion of the methodological shifts underpinning\u000a      RE, articles by Gabriel\u000a      Flynn (Catholic), Kallistos Ware (Orthodox) and Paul Fiddes (Baptist)\u000a      indicated how the position\u000a      outlined in Murray 2007 could be applied in diverse ecclesial contexts.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11837","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2264397","Name":"Portugal"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3057568","Name":"Slovakia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"798549","Name":"Romania"},{"GeoNamesId":"3077311","Name":"Czech Republic"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"3057568","Name":"Slovakia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    This case study turns on an intervention by Watson in a fast-moving news\u000a      story which had attracted considerable international interest. This\u000a      intervention, drawing directly on his research findings, decisively\u000a      changed the direction of the public debate. It provides a striking example\u000a      of how a well-judged online intervention by a scholar is able to disrupt a\u000a      set-piece media narrative.\u000a    The events took place in a matter of days in late September 2012. On 18\u000a      September, Dr Karen King of Harvard University held a press conference to\u000a      present a newly-discovered papyrus fragment of unknown provenance, which\u000a      she had received from an anonymous private collector. Dr King argued that\u000a      it is a 4th century text containing a Coptic translation of a 2nd century\u000a      Greek original, and that it represented the beliefs of one strand of\u000a      2nd-century Christianity. The fragment includes a phrase in which Jesus\u000a      says the words: `my wife'. This was the basis for the media interest,\u000a      which Dr King actively cultivated, and which Harvard University supported\u000a      by simultaneous online publication of the text and of King's detailed\u000a      scholarly analysis. The press conference was held in Rome;\u000a      pre-announcement interviews had been given to the New York Times\u000a      and Boston Globe [1, 2a]. A major 50-minute television documentary\u000a      had already been commissioned by the Smithsonian Channel and was scheduled\u000a      for broadcast on 30 September.\u000a    As expected, the announcement precipitated instant worldwide media\u000a      interest. Much of the initial scholarly response was cautiously welcoming\u000a      of King's claims about the fragment's origins. Predictably, however, the\u000a      pre-cultivated media storm did not dwell on her argument about 2nd-\u000a      century Christianity. Instead, the focus was on a simpler, factual\u000a      question: as the headline used by the Washington Post, the Chicago\u000a        Tribune, Fox News, CBS News, the BBC and others put it, `Did Jesus\u000a      Have a Wife?' [2b] The Smithsonian Channel's claim that this fragment was\u000a      `one of the most significant discoveries of all time' [3a] is typical of\u000a      the hyperbole that was being generated around the text, but also reflects\u000a      a widespread (if debateable) view that evidence of Jesus' having been\u000a      married would profoundly challenge or even disprove core Christian claims.\u000a      Moreover, the apparent reference to Jesus as married fitted into a series\u000a      of contemporary narratives, from the well-marketed conspiracy theories\u000a      which argue exactly that, to more widespread modern debates about\u000a      Christianity and human sexuality. King explicity distanced herself from\u000a      the conspiracy theories, but also stated that there is `no reliable\u000a      historical evidence' that Jesus was unmarried, and that `this new\u000a      gospel doesn't prove that Jesus was married, but it tells us that\u000a      the whole question only came up as part of vociferous debates about\u000a      sexuality and marriage'. [2c] Accordingly, most of the media coverage\u000a      immediately (if illogically) tied the story to the issue of clerical\u000a      celibacy in the Roman Catholic Church: the Chicago Tribune's\u000a      story, for example, contained the subheader `So can Catholic priests get\u000a      married now?' [2d] In other words, the story had given new energy to a\u000a      range of underlying arguments. As a New York Times blogger noted\u000a      on 21 September, the story took form at `the intersection of Biblical\u000a      archaeology and media sensationalism', and was formed in particular by the\u000a      `desire to refashion Jesus of Nazareth in our own image'. [3b]\u000a    On the same day (as the same NYT blogger noticed), Watson\u000a      published Watson 2012a, which used compositional analysis to argue that\u000a      the fragment was in fact a forgery. This paper was published by the\u000a      widely-used and respected NT Weblog (http:\/\/ntweblog.blogspot.co.uk\/)\u000a      of Mark Goodacre (Duke University). A summary for non-specialists (lacking\u000a      the Coptic text) was posted on 22 September, followed by Watson 2012b on\u000a      23 September. In addition, Watson wrote a 3000-word article for the\u000a      non-specialist reader, `Inventing Jesus' Wife' (posted 24 September), at\u000a      the invitation of the `Bible and Interpretation' website, which aims to\u000a      showcase Biblical scholarship for a wider public. Here and in the initial\u000a      paper, the earlier debunking of the `Secret Gospel of Mark' is argued to\u000a      be a case parallel to the new text, and reference is made to Watson 2010\u000a      as supporting evidence for the claim about compositional technique.\u000a    Watson's was the first significant voice to challenge the initial\u000a      announcement, and his interventions rapidly changed the direction of the\u000a      media storm. In the week beginning 21 September, he gave a series of\u000a      interviews which led to major articles in the Guardian, then the Boston\u000a        Globe (which had first broken the story), the Weekly Standard\u000a      (USA), Sonntagsblick (Switzerland's most popular Sunday\u000a      newspaper), and the Tovima Sunday colour supplement (Greece).[3c]\u000a      A further interview, with Reuters' Rome correspondent, featured in\u000a      Reuters' 28 September coverage of the argument that the fragment was\u000a      forged.[4a] The substance of the Guardian and Reuters articles was\u000a      widely reproduced in international coverage of the forgery claim. Coverage\u000a      has been traced in news outlets from Austria, the Czech Republic, Dubai,\u000a      France, Germany, India, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia,\u000a      Slovakia, South Korea, Spain and Turkey. In every case, Watson's argument\u000a      that the text was forged marked a decisive turning-point in the news\u000a      story. On 28 September, the Vatican endorsed the view that the fragment\u000a      was forged; but before then (and in Reuters' coverage of the Vatican\u000a      statement) the argument was traced back exclusively or primarily to\u000a      Watson.\u000a    A report from the Romanian news outlet Ziare is typical of many\u000a      others: `Recently a professor at Harvard University claimed to have\u000a      discovered a papyrus which said that Jesus Christ was married. Now an\u000a      expert on the New Testament says that this evidence is just a modern\u000a      forgery. Professor Francis Watson from Durham University has published a\u000a      paper showing that [the] fragments of papyri contain the Coptic text of\u000a      the Gospel of Thomas...'[4b]\u000a    The Austrian daily Kurier, under the headline `Text about Mrs.\u000a      Jesus only a fake? A researcher from England questions the recently\u000a      discovered papyrus', wrote: `The English scholar Francis Watson, of the\u000a      University of Durham, is convinced, however, that the papyrus is a modern\u000a      forgery. Watson claimed that all sentence fragments on the sheet are\u000a      copied and rearranged from those found in the Coptic Gospel of Thomas.'\u000a      [4c]\u000a    The online service of the Russian television station Rossiya 1\u000a      wrote: `British scholar Francis Watson has denied the authenticity of the\u000a      papyrus, which allegedly contains new details of the earthly life of Jesus\u000a      Christ. After analyzing the text, the professor at the University of\u000a      Durham has concluded that it is \"virtually certain\" that the fragment\u000a      which caused widespread debate in academic and public circles is not\u000a      genuine.' [4d]\u000a    The Italian newspaper Lettera43 had a simpler response:\u000a      `Elementare, Watson.' [4e] And by the time the Weekly Standard\u000a      published its interview with Watson on 8 October, the headline was\u000a      damning: `Jesus' Ex-Wife'. [4f]\u000a    Since the publication of Watson's papers, no significant challenge to the\u000a      forgery argument has been forthcoming. In consequence the story was\u000a      virtually dead within two weeks of the original announcement. The clearest\u000a      sign of this was that the Smithsonian Channel's planned TV documentary was\u000a      first delayed, and then, on 1 October, deferred indefinitely, with the\u000a      channel's general manager citing `the academic response to the initial\u000a      announcement'. A fresh broadcast date was promised within weeks [3a], but\u000a      as at October 2013 nothing further has been heard, beyond a credit on the\u000a      director's personal website.[5]\u000a    The impact, therefore, was a matter not only of publicly correcting a\u000a      very public scholarly error, but also of cutting the ground out from\u000a      underneath the frenzy of media speculation and misinformation which had\u000a      been built on that error.\u000a    The scale of the impact was undoubtedly global, but in its nature this\u000a      cannot be precisely quantified. Substantial articles on Watson's\u000a      intervention were carried in mass-circulation newspapers around the world:\u000a      for example, Tovima has a circulation of 130,000; Sonntagsblick,\u000a      around 250,000.[6a, 6b] The actual download figures for the online\u000a      articles are perhaps more significant. During the period 21-30 September,\u000a      when the controversy was live, Watson 2012a was downloaded 20,335 times,\u000a      and the later papers on the NT Weblog a further 4,885 times (around 100\u000a      downloads per hour); there were a further 3,900 downloads in October. In\u000a      addition, the article `Inventing Jesus' Wife' was downloaded around 4,000\u000a      times by the end of October, giving an overall figure in the region of\u000a      33,000.[6c] These figures indicate both the very high level of public\u000a      interest in a controversial new gospel fragment, and the impact of\u000a      scholarly but accessible work that showed the claims made about it to be\u000a      without foundation.\u000a    Responses within the blogosphere give a more qualitative sense of how\u000a      Watson's intervention had changed the story. His arguments did not, of\u000a      course, command universal agreement: in the world of new media such a\u000a      thing is not to be had. The responses from widely-read bloggers on\u000a      Biblical topics ranged from scepticism (`Watson appears to have built a\u000a      coalition of naysayers') to hyperbolic praise (`Watson offers a piece with\u000a      the general audience in mind ... it's brilliant. Seriously brilliant.\u000a      Inassailably brilliant'). Naturally, many bloggers hijacked the story to\u000a      suit their own pre-existing views (`Watson notes ... that this is not the\u000a      first time that fake manuscripts have surfaced that promote left-wing\u000a      politics'). [7] The point is not that Watson's intervention settled the\u000a      debate online, but that he decisively changed its terms. His argument that\u000a      the text is a forgery was acknowledged on all sides as the key question.\u000a    The overall public benefit is clear. A carefully planned campaign based\u000a      on mainstream print, broadcast and online media outlets not only\u000a      publicised a newly-discovered text, but also persuaded a worldwide\u000a      audience that that text put received views of the origin of Christianity\u000a      into question. Yet the application of appropriate scholarly procedures\u000a      showed that the text is most probably a modern forgery, and this claim was\u000a      communicated in an accessible form to a worldwide audience through the\u000a      timely use of online publication. It is a public good that misinformation\u000a      in an area of such deep concern to many should be exposed as such. More\u000a      generally, as the owner of the `Bible and Interpretation' website wrote in\u000a      personal correspondence: `It is essential that biblical scholars\u000a      disseminate their research to a public interested in biblical issues. ...\u000a      What we do and say is important to the public at large. [Watson's] article\u000a      about this fragment is a perfect example. ... We all need to maximize the\u000a      power of the internet.'\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    On 18 September 2012 a newly-discovered Coptic gospel fragment,\u000a      purportedly dating from the 4th century, was announced in Rome.\u000a      It generated worldwide publicity: for in it, Jesus refers to `my wife'.\u000a      Three days later, Professor Francis Watson posted a short paper online, in\u000a      which he used a form of compositional analysis which he has pioneered to\u000a      argue that the fragment is most probably a recent forgery. Watson's paper\u000a      was very extensively read and reported, and widely regarded as conclusive.\u000a      An imminent TV documentary on the fragment was promptly postponed\u000a      indefinitely. Watson's research transformed the way that this fragment was\u000a      perceived by an international public. As such, it prevented a serious\u000a      scholarly error from becoming lodged in the public consciousness. More\u000a      importantly, it also stymied the process by which unwarranted conclusions\u000a      about the origins of Christianity were being drawn from that error. It is\u000a      an example of the power of a timely web-enabled intervention by a scholar\u000a      in a fast-moving news story.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    Durham University\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Durham (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Durham","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"North East","UKPRN":10007143}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"4887398","Name":"Chicago"},{"GeoNamesId":"4930956","Name":"Boston"},{"GeoNamesId":"294098","Name":"Nazareth"},{"GeoNamesId":"292224","Name":"Dubayy"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

This inter-relatedness is a\u000a      well-known phenomenon within the `synoptic gospels' (Matthew, Mark, Luke),\u000a      but Professor Francis Watson's research breaks new ground in showing that\u000a      it applies equally to non-canonical gospel literature. In this respect at\u000a      least, the canonical \/ non-canonical boundary is irrelevant. Establishing\u000a      this point required careful analysis of early gospel compositional\u000a      practices, work that had been proceeding for some years and was eventually\u000a      published as Watson 2013.\u000a    Such compositional analysis played a major part in Watson's comprehensive\u000a      demonstration that the extracts from a so-called Secret Gospel of Mark,\u000a      allegedly discovered in 1958, are a modern forgery (Watson 2010). The\u000a      extracts had been composed out of genuine phrases from Mark's Gospel,\u000a      taken from their contexts and assembled collage-like to create a new\u000a      narrative. There is no clear analogy to such a compositional practice in\u000a      ancient gospel literature.\u000a    This method of analysis was not conceived with the `Jesus' Wife' papyrus\u000a      in mind, but Watson's experience meant that he was able swiftly to apply\u000a      that method to the new fragment. Watson 2012a demonstrated that in this\u000a      case a similar collage technique had been employed, and that the fragment\u000a      drew virtually its entire text from passages in the Coptic Gospel of\u000a        Thomas. Such a technique is much more plausibly attributed to a\u000a      modern writer, lacking facility in Coptic composition, than to an ancient\u000a      one.\u000a    An `Addendum' (Watson 2012b) advanced a further argument for\u000a      inauthenticity. The seven lines of the `Jesus' Wife' fragment each contain\u000a      around 19 surviving letters, the beginnings and endings of each line being\u000a      lost. Extensive sampling of 4th and 5th century Coptic gospel-related\u000a      manuscripts indicated that line-lengths normally fell within the range of\u000a      16-28 letters. If the lines of an allegedly 4th century `Jesus' Wife'\u000a      papyrus originally contained an additional 6-10 letters, this lost\u000a      material could not have sufficed to make coherent sense out of the\u000a      fragmentary sentences that remain. The text must therefore have been\u000a      composed in its present incomplete form, designed to mimic a `lost\u000a      original' that in fact never existed.\u000a    Watson took up his post at Durham University in 2008. The sections of\u000a      Watson 2013 relating to Coptic texts (especially the Gospel of Thomas\u000a      and the Apocryphon of John) were researched and drafted in\u000a      2009-10. Work on the (Greek) Secret Gospel of Mark was undertaken\u000a      in 2009. On the basis of expertise developed in preparing this material,\u000a      the research underpinning the online `Jesus' Wife' articles could be\u000a      carried out very rapidly, following online publication of the previously\u000a      unknown Coptic fragment on 18 September 2012. Watson 2012a and Watson\u000a      2012b were posted online on 21 and 23 September respectively (with revised\u000a      versions on 26 September). The speed of this response was crucial for\u000a      ensuring maximum impact.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"12153","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Bible Society, whose founders included William Wilberforce, was\u000a      established in 1804 with the\u000a      aim of providing wider circulation of the Bible. Today it is a global\u000a      organisation with over 140\u000a      international Bible Societies. It is a non-denominational organisation\u000a      which seeks to promote\u000a      understanding of the Bible not only in churches but also in the arts,\u000a      education, media, and politics.\u000a      It is therefore an obvious public engagement partner for the Department of\u000a      Biblical Studies (see\u000a      REF3a).\u000a    Since spring 2010, the Department has been collaborating with the Bible\u000a      Society and its Dean of\u000a      Studies. After initial and ongoing collaboration on dissertation awards\u000a      for undergraduates, it was\u000a      clear that this partnership could be developed as part of the departmental\u000a      research strategy, with\u000a      the Bible Society providing national and international networks for\u000a      dissemination and impact (see\u000a      below) of research carried out at Sheffield. The issue of Jesus'\u000a      `Jewishness' was deemed to be\u000a      particularly pressing for contemporary churches as high-profile scholarly\u000a      debates had failed to\u000a      make any significant impact among church audiences. This issue has been\u000a      highlighted by Jewish\u000a      scholars working in Jewish-Christian relations (e.g. A.J. Levine, The\u000a        Misunderstood Jew: The\u000a        Church and the Scandal of the Jewish Jesus [2006]), so it was deemed\u000a      to be of some urgency to\u000a      get contemporary research on Jesus and his Jewish context directly through\u000a      to a lay church\u000a      audience. In addition, the Bible Society's own investigation has shown\u000a      that there was a perception\u000a      that church leaders might be `protecting' congregations from latest\u000a      developments in scholarship\u000a      when in fact their study `has shown us that most of the time the church\u000a        probably underestimates\u000a        the openness and capacity of its people to learn and thrive on new (to\u000a        them) approaches' [S1].\u000a      This collaboration meant that research at Sheffield could directly\u000a      influence the ideas about Jesus\u000a      and Judaism held by lay audiences so that they in turn could analyse and\u000a      discuss the religious and\u000a      ethnic identity of the `founder' of the Christian faith.\u000a    The ongoing collaboration between the Department of Biblical Studies and\u000a      the Bible Society\u000a      provided an ideal opportunity to address this issue, initially in English\u000a      and Welsh churches. Biblical\u000a      Studies at Sheffield was able to provide leading research on the\u000a      historical, political and ideological\u000a      interpretation of scholarship and biblical texts whilst the Bible Society\u000a      has extensive networks\u000a      outside academia, both nationally and internationally through its\u000a      connections with church groups\u000a      and international membership in over 140 international societies. In 2011\u000a      Crossley and agreed to\u000a      collaborate on a booklet called Jesus the Jew. The collaboration\u000a      initially involved the Dean of\u000a      Studies at the Bible Society reading through Crossley's main monographs\u000a      and articles on the\u000a      historical Jesus in his first-century cultural contexts as well as his\u000a      published research on\u000a      contemporary scholarship and its uses of terms such as `Jew',\u000a      `Jewishness', `Judaism' and so on.\u000a      Crossley and the Dean co-wrote and completed Jesus the Jew in\u000a      August 2012 which was explicitly\u000a      designed for lay audiences with little, if any, knowledge of academic\u000a      research. Not every issue\u000a      raised in Crossley's research could be covered, and so the Dean and his\u000a      colleagues in the Bible\u000a      Society identified those areas of most relevance and interest for lay\u000a      church groups. Three main\u000a      aims developed from Crossley's research were outlined at the beginning of\u000a      the booklet:\u000a    \u000a      to understand Jesus as a historical figure in the context of\u000a        first-century Judaism\u000a      to provide assistance in interpretation of both the Gospels and\u000a        ancient Jewish texts\u000a      to avoid problematic stereotypes, whether from the Gospels or from\u000a        contemporary contexts,\u000a        particularly where they have led to Christian anti-Semitism\u000a    \u000a    To achieve these aims, six topics were taken directly from Crossley's\u000a      research, including:\u000a    \u000a      An overview of Jewish history, groups and literature\u000a      Jesus and the Law, with a case study on divorce\u000a      Jesus and the Law, with a case study on wealth\u000a      Jesus and prayer, with a case study on the `Lord's Prayer'\u000a      How Jesus' teachings might have been perceived by other Jewish groups\u000a      How Jesus might have perceived his own views in relation to other\u000a        Jewish groups\u000a    \u000a    Within each of these six topics a series of questions were raised\u000a      relating to the ways in which the\u000a      participants viewed given Gospel passages in light of Jewish materials.\u000a    The range and reach of the booklet was both national and international.\u000a      The Bible Society's\u000a      networks made Jesus the Jew available to 19,000 clergy in England\u000a      and Wales for use in\u000a      discussion groups for the laity (10-15 participants would be deemed\u000a      typical). To provide access\u000a      beyond church groups in England and Wales, the booklet was made available\u000a      on the website of\u000a      the Bible Society for &#163;3 to national and international audiences. By July\u000a      2013, over 2000 copies\u000a      had been sold. In terms of changing perceptions, the Dean reflected on the\u000a      collaboration and the\u000a      publication of Jesus the Jew, by pointing out that `making\u000a        accessible the research of James\u000a        Crossley and others on the Jewishness of Jesus and the way that his own\u000a        culture illuminates a\u000a        more accurate and incisive understanding of Jesus' teaching and\u000a        identity...The church in the west\u000a        is under the temptation to read Jesus inaccurately because we tend to\u000a        see him through our cultural\u000a        lens. The detailed work of scholars, like James, provides the material\u000a        to counter this effectively'\u000a      [S1]. In order to assess changing perceptions further, the views of church\u000a      educationalists and a\u000a      discussion leader were sought. The Canon theologian of Birmingham and\u000a      Guilford cathedrals (also\u000a      preacher at Canterbury Cathedral, member of the General Synod, and\u000a      Vice-President of the Bible\u000a      Society) claimed of the booklet that `This valuable course will help\u000a        Bible study groups to enter the\u000a        world of Jesus the Jew and by doing so to see the gospels with fresh\u000a        eyes.' A Baptist minister and\u000a      former principal of London Bible College, claimed that 'This guide\u000a        will lead us into understanding\u000a        Jesus in his original setting. It does so competently, clearly and\u000a        creatively and is a gift for any\u000a        group who wants to really understand Jesus.' [S8]\u000a    A specific test case was focused on the use of the booklet by an\u000a      experienced group discussion\u000a      leader and curate of St Michael le Belfrey, York [S4], whose discussion\u000a      groups average around 15\u000a      participants. To get a greater indication of changing perceptions,\u000a      feedback questions including the\u000a      following were asked: `On a scale of 1-5, where 1 is poor and 5 is\u000a      excellent, how did this booklet\u000a      help your understanding of Jesus in relation to his Jewish context?' The\u000a      group leader assessed\u000a      this as 5. A further question was asked requiring written feedback in\u000a      relation to reassessing Jesus\u000a      in relation to Jewish legal and scriptural sources raised in the booklet.\u000a      The response to this was\u000a      that the booklet helps groups to `understand Jesus' words and deeds in\u000a        a fresh way' and that it\u000a      particularly aids the `study of the scriptures by looking at Jesus in\u000a        his own context' and facilitates\u000a      `an encounter with Jesus...for today'.\u000a    Further evidence of the significance of the impact of Crossley's research\u000a      on the Jewishness of\u000a      Jesus comes from the departmental blog 'Sheffield Biblical Studies', where\u000a      the material was also\u000a      published. Between 2010 and 2013, as the collaboration over the booklet\u000a      was developing and\u000a      being completed, the Jewishness of Jesus was one of the most popular\u000a      topics on the blog,\u000a      attracting over 1000 visitors, with most of the audience coming from North\u000a      America. The\u000a      conclusions made by Crossley on one blog post were also used by Zev Garber\u000a      in his Op-Ed for the\u000a      popular American website, Bible and Interpretation [S6,S7]\u000a      (approximately 600,000 hits per month\u000a      and 1700 unique visitors daily) as an example of ways in which\u000a      preconceptions have successfully\u000a      been challenged. Garber claimed the post was an `insightful essay' and\u000a      that the overview of key\u000a      works `suggest a rejection of Jewish stereotypes and a proper depiction\u000a        of Judaism in the molding\u000a        of the scriptural Jesus' (November 2011).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The `Jewishness of Jesus' has become a scholarly clich&#233; but discussion of\u000a      the concept has been\u000a      limited outside academia, particularly in churches where related issues\u000a      are raised most frequently.\u000a      James Crossley has published both reconstructions of Jesus in relation to\u000a      Jewish contexts, and\u000a      critiques of contemporary understandings of `Jesus the Jew'.

Since coming to Sheffield in\u000a      2005, he has published on\u000a      first-century Jewish contexts of the Gospel material, such as purity, Law\u000a      and social history. He has\u000a      shown that sayings and deeds attributed to Jesus, as well as various\u000a      practices mentioned in the\u000a      Gospels, are more obviously paralleled in early Judaism than is\u000a      conventionally understood and that\u000a      the idea that Jesus did something new in relation to Judaism and\u000a      `Jewishness' is unlikely [e.g. R1,\u000a      R3].\u000a    Building on a historic research tradition at Sheffield of ideological\u000a      analysis of biblical scholarship in\u000a      relation to `Jewishness' by now retired staff (e.g. Keith Whitelam, Philip\u000a      Davies), Crossley has also\u000a      published extensively on the historical and ideological reasons for the\u000a      emergence of the positive\u000a      rhetoric concerning `Jesus the Jew' over the past 40 years, with\u000a      particular reference to shifting\u000a      attitudes towards Israel and Palestine since the 1967 Six Day War [R2, R4]\u000a      and the interaction\u000a      between ideas of multiculturalism and western liberal capitalism [R5]. He\u000a      has shown that the\u000a      superficially positive rhetoric of `Jesus the Jew' implicitly maintains a\u000a      discourse of superiority by\u000a      regularly making Jesus `transcend' or `override' key symbols of the\u000a      scholarly construction of\u000a      `Jewishness'. This is part of wider dominant cultural discourses\u000a      concerning Judaism in America\u000a      and Britain which have likewise been positive but have simultaneously\u000a      maintained implicit\u000a      superiority over Jews and Judaism. Underlying the positive and negative\u000a      constructions of `ethnicity'\u000a      and `religion' are influential discourses about multicultural tolerance\u000a      which have also embraced the\u000a      ethnic or religious `Other' but with any alien `religious' traits\u000a      perceived as too problematic for\u000a      western liberalism removed. The current dominant narratives in the quest\u000a      for the historical Jesus\u000a      are based on constructions of `ethnicity' and `religion' that merely\u000a      provide foils for cultural\u000a      superiority and require an alternative narrative to provide a more rounded\u000a      picture of Christian\u000a      origins.\u000a    Crossley has been centrally involved in one of the most significant\u000a      research projects designed to\u000a      look at historical and ideological contexts of historical Jesus\u000a      scholarship. Between 2007 and 2011\u000a      Crossley was one of two international participants in the Jesus and\u000a      Cultural Complexity Project at\u000a      the University of Oslo. The project was awarded funding by the Norwegian\u000a      Research Council for\u000a      seminars, conferences and workshops. This project looked at the ways in\u000a      which Jesus has been\u000a      constructed in a variety of cultural contexts over the past 200 years and\u000a      their intersections with\u000a      race, ethnicity, gender, nationalism, and philosophical trends. Crossley's\u000a      distinctive contribution\u000a      was to focus on the ways in which Jesus has been constructed among\u000a      scholars, intellectuals and\u000a      politicians in relation to Israel, Palestine, and British or English\u000a      nationalism. Crossley presented at\u000a      four different sessions during this period and was a co-editor (with\u000a      Halvor Moxnes and Ward\u000a      Blanton) of one of the flagship books (Jesus beyond Nationalism)\u000a      [R4].\u000a    In 2012, as part of the wider dissemination of the results of Crossley's\u000a      research on Jesus and\u000a      `Jewishness', the Faculty of Arts and Humanities Research and Innovation\u000a      Committee funded\u000a      approximately half of the production costs (&#163;400) for a booklet developed\u000a      by Crossley in\u000a      collaboration with the Bible Society which would enable Crossley's\u000a      research on `Jesus the Jew' to\u000a      have an impact on church groups throughout England and Wales.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"12154","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Sheffield's collaboration with the English Cathedrals originated in 2009\u000a      when Pyper and Crossley\u000a      began informal discussions with the 2011 Cathedral Sub-Group. There was\u000a      enthusiastic\u000a      agreement for Sheffield to provide exhibition and educational resources\u000a      based specifically on the\u000a      distinctive departmental approach to the reception of the King James Bible\u000a      rather than simply its\u000a      seventeenth-century origins. The Sub-Group and the King James Bible Trust\u000a      (www.kingjamesbibletrust.org)\u000a      were particularly enthusiastic because most English cathedrals\u000a      lacked the intellectual and financial resources for this landmark\u000a      anniversary [S2]. According to the\u000a      then new Director of the King James Bible Trust, the resources offered by\u000a      Sheffield, `gladden my\u000a        heart...I can say without hesitation that we would be grateful to make\u000a        extensive use of these\u000a        resources throughout the year - indeed, even before.' [S1]. In 2010,\u000a      Pyper and Crossley, along\u000a      with Hine, wrote the exhibition and educational resources which were then\u000a      discussed with Sheffield\u000a      Cathedral [S2] and Museums Sheffield in order to make them suitable for\u000a      the National Curriculum,\u000a      adult education and museum audiences. The Humanities Research Institute at\u000a      the University of\u000a      Sheffield provided access to their Exhibitor software package so that the\u000a      exhibition resources could\u000a      be made available as an interactive DVD.\u000a    The overtly interdisciplinary and reception-historical approaches to\u000a      Biblical Studies at Sheffield\u000a      made it possible for the exhibition and education resources to cut across\u000a      educational disciplines,\u000a      including those listed in the National Curriculum (Art, Citizenship,\u000a      English Language, English\u000a      Literature, Geography, History, Music, R.E., and Technology). The specific\u000a      research of Pyper and\u000a      Crossley was particularly shown in the following major topics in the\u000a      resources for the educational\u000a      outreach programmes at each cathedral:\u000a    \u000a      controversial texts and 'wars of translation'\u000a      the Bible and nationalism, including English and Scottish nationalism\u000a      the use of the Bible in Empire, colonization, justifications for\u000a        slavery, and even as source of\u000a        liberation\u000a      the King James Bible in the United States, and its influence on\u000a        American politics\u000a      `KJV-only-ism', Peter Ruckman and their place in American culture\u000a      the Bible in the Arts, namely its depiction and interpretation in\u000a        music, literature, sports,\u000a        visual arts, and popular culture\u000a      the ongoing use of KJV idioms\u000a      different versions of the Bible which developed and survived as the\u000a        influence of the King\u000a        James Bible was seemingly in decline\u000a    \u000a    While the exhibition was promoted in North America by the Society of\u000a      Biblical Literature, one of the\u000a      most popular biblical studies blogs, and a Knoxville newspaper [S6, S7,\u000a      S8], English cathedrals\u000a      and their visitors were the main beneficiaries [e.g. S4, S5, S9]. Telling\u000a        Tales exhibitions were\u000a      available at 30 English cathedrals and some greater churches throughout\u000a      the UK, with displays\u000a      lasting from one week to 12 months. Organisation varied locally. For\u000a      instance, major venues such\u000a      as Canterbury Cathedral held extended 12 month exhibitions while the\u000a      exhibition was taken on tour\u000a      around the Diocese of Llandaff (Church in Wales) throughout 2011.\u000a      Resources were made\u000a      available for free download on the departmental webpages. On these\u000a      webpages, images of the\u000a      exhibitions at churches and cathedrals were also provided, as well as the\u000a      locations of, and\u000a      information about, the exhibitions:\u000a    http:\/\/www.shef.ac.uk\/kjv\/exhibition\/locations\u000a    The resources and accompanying new research were presented to the\u000a      conference, Biblical\u000a        Literacy and the Curriculum: Celebrating 400 Years of the King James\u000a        Bible (University of\u000a      Sheffield, May 2011). The conference was aimed at teachers,\u000a      educationalists and cathedral\u000a      outreach officers and there were about 100 participants. Each participant\u000a      involved was provided\u000a      with a copy of the DVD and sessions were led by Crossley, Pyper and Hine\u000a      to discuss the ways in\u000a      which the reception of the Bible could be, or was being, used in teaching\u000a      and the curriculum. This\u000a      included research presented by Crossley which has since been revised for\u000a      publication.\u000a    It is impossible to know the number of visitors who saw the exhibition,\u000a      or what proportion visited\u000a      cathedrals because of the exhibitions. However, there are some general\u000a      figures about Cathedral\u000a      visitors which indicate the scope of the impact made by the resources that\u000a      Sheffield provided to an\u000a      audience otherwise unfamiliar with their contents. In 2004, the English\u000a      Heritage and the\u000a      Association of English Cathedrals jointly launched a report on The\u000a        Economic and Social Impacts of\u000a        Cathedrals in England. According to the report, almost 9 million\u000a      people visited England's 42\u000a      Anglican cathedrals annually (compare 6.2 million people visiting\u000a      Blackpool Pleasure Beach, 3.7\u000a      million people visiting the London Eye and 4.5 million people visiting the\u000a      British Museum in 2003),\u000a      with more than 300,000 organised educational visits annually.\u000a    (http:\/\/hc.english-heritage.org.uk\/content\/pub\/CathedralsresearchHeritageCount2004.doc).\u000a    Sheffield Cathedral's adult educational outreach programme was used as a\u000a      specific test case for\u000a      analysing changing perceptions [S3].

The feedback was overwhelmingly positive. Every\u000a      participant believed\u000a      that the course fulfilled its stated aims and every participant listed\u000a      something new they had learnt.\u000a      All evaluations of the exhibitions materials were ranked 3-5, with nothing\u000a      lower.

Up until the past ten years, research on the reception of\u000a      the Bible in the arts,\u000a      literature, politics, and popular culture was rarely undertaken outside\u000a      Sheffield, at least not in any\u000a      sustained way, and the `original' context and theological interpretation\u000a      were the dominant\u000a      emphases in the field. The Department of Biblical Studies pioneered\u000a      research in reception history\u000a      over the past twenty years through individual researchers, past (e.g.\u000a      David Clines, Philip Davies,\u000a      Cheryl Exum, Stephen Moore, Jorunn &#216;kland, Keith Whitelam) and present\u000a      (Pyper, Crossley,\u000a      Finney, Chalcraft, and Edwards), research centres (Bible and Cultural\u000a      Studies [completed 2000])\u000a      and the Bible and the Modern World [2000-2009]), and the founding (2012)\u000a      of the journal, Biblical\u000a        Reception, by Sheffield Phoenix Press (with Crossley on the\u000a      editorial board). In addition to over 30\u000a      publications, Sheffield hosted the Cultural Studies\/Biblical Studies\u000a      colloquium in 1997, bringing\u000a      together a number of international experts. The proceedings were published\u000a      in 1998 (edited by\u000a      Moore and Exum) in what is widely regarded as a landmark publication in\u000a      the field. In 2011,\u000a      Crossley published an open access article with Relegere (with over\u000a      1500 downloads) placing\u000a      reception history at the heart of a manifesto for Biblical Studies. The\u000a      distinctively `Sheffield'\u000a      contribution and approach to biblical reception has shown how biblical\u000a      texts have survived and\u000a      transformed in both `secular' and `religious' contexts while intersecting\u000a      with gender, nationalism,\u000a      ethnicity, and politics. Though this approach has helped transform\u000a      Biblical Studies into a field of\u000a      study far broader than it was twenty years ago, there remains no major\u000a      centre in the UK other than\u000a      Sheffield with such a concentration of expertise in areas relating to the\u000a      use and influence of the\u000a      Bible.\u000a    Crossley and Pyper (along with the Project Coordinator, Iona Hine) were\u000a      responsible for writing the\u000a      exhibition boards and educational resources in light of Sheffield's\u000a      distinctive approach and their\u000a      own specific research between 2005 and 2011. During this period, Pyper's\u000a      research had used\u000a      memetics in order to show the ways in which the Bible, including the King\u000a      James Version, has\u000a      survived and grown over the centuries through translations, editions and\u000a      canons, thus generating\u000a      its own means of survival [R1]. He has also shown how the Bible has been\u000a      adapted in language,\u000a      literature, children's literature, postcolonial contexts, sport, politics,\u000a      nationalism, and the arts, and\u000a      how such cultural appropriations defy dominance by religious and secular\u000a      groups [R1, R2]. During\u000a      this same period, Crossley analysed the ways in which the biblical texts\u000a      have been embedded in\u000a      dominant ideological discourses in Britain and America, covering uses by\u000a      prominent public\u000a      intellectuals or politicians through to more `obscure' figures, including\u000a      the King James Version-only\u000a      American `fundamentalist' preacher Peter Ruckman [R3, R3, R4]. These ideas\u000a      of the embedded\u000a      nature of biblical texts, and their survival, underpinned the overarching\u000a      narrative of the reception of\u000a      the Bible in the exhibition materials, and specific examples from the\u000a      research of Crossley and\u000a      Pyper (e.g. Ruckman, children's literature, politicians, colonialism) were\u000a      used in the exhibition\u000a      materials.\u000a    To help facilitate the impact of this research, Crossley and Pyper were\u000a      successful in acquiring\u000a      funding. A &#163;9,704 award from the Knowledge Transfer Rapid Response Fund\u000a      (University of\u000a      Sheffield, June 2010-June 2011; PI: Crossley) was granted for funding the\u000a      Project Coordinator\u000a      (Hine) and the generation of the exhibition resources and educational\u000a      guides. A &#163;10,784 HEIF-4\u000a      Knowledge Transfer award (May 2010-May 2011; PI: Crossley) was made\u000a      available for a\u000a      conference for teachers and educationalists on biblical literacy (May\u000a      2011). A &#163;3850 Subject\u000a      Centre for Philosophical and Religious Studies award (July 2010-January\u000a      2011; PIs: Crossley and\u000a      Pyper) was secured for the collaboration with Museums Sheffield in order\u000a      to help develop the\u000a      educational resources.\u000a    Papers relating to additional research carried out for the cathedral\u000a      resources were presented to,\u000a      and discussed with, academics, educationalists and cathedral outreach\u000a      officers at the May 2011\u000a      conference. These were then written up for a special edition of Postscripts\u000a      (edited by Crossley and\u000a      Hine) which reflected on the conference [R5]. Crossley's contribution\u000a      focused on the ways in which\u000a      the King James Bible, especially its idiomatic language, has been\u000a      understood in the context of\u000a      liberal capitalism and democracy, allowing him to show that its survival\u000a      is linked with the\u000a      impression that it represents English nationalism and the related values\u000a      of democracy, tolerance\u000a      and freedom. Crossley's paper&#8212;initially prepared in 2011 and revised in\u000a      2012 for publication- was\u000a      a more detailed and analytical expression of that which was developed for\u000a      the exhibition materials.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"19036","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Pickstock's research has entered the contemporary \"canon\", as a reference\u000a      point for clergy, ordinands and seminarians and liturgical reformers. After\u000a        Writing is listed on the \"Transforming Worship\" website of the\u000a      Church of England's Liturgical Commission and the reading list for members\u000a      of the House of Bishops [1]. Her research is discussed and listed in Roman\u000a      Catholic and Anglican seminary bibliographies and in standard clerical and\u000a      seminary reference works, e.g. the Oxford Guide to the Book of Common\u000a        Prayer (OUP, 2006) and The New SCM Dictionary of Liturgy and\u000a        Worship (SCM, 2002) which remain in wide use and feature on standard\u000a      seminary reading lists [1, 2, 3, 6].\u000a    Pickstock's theological analysis of liturgy as \"impossible\" and \"a\u000a      difficult language\" (After Writing, p. 186) has been linked by the\u000a      Church of England's Secretary to the Liturgical Commission with the House\u000a      of Bishops' rejection of the proposed (2011) revisions of liturgical texts\u000a      on the basis that they were inappropriately accessible [1]. Pickstock's\u000a      insistence on the connection between liturgy, the arts and politics, and\u000a      on liturgy as a fusion of the real and the ideal have been cited as an\u000a      animating force behind the theme of this decade's most significant\u000a      liturgical conference organised by the Liturgical Commission (\"Liturgy in\u000a      the Public Square\" and \"Liturgy with Arts and Literature\", July 2013) [1].\u000a    Pickstock's analysis of the mediaeval liturgy has influenced Roman\u000a      Catholic liturgical reform and practice in various ways; for example, the\u000a      sustained increase in the use of the Tridentine Mass all around the world,\u000a      following Pope Benedict's Summorum Pontificum Motu Proprio (2007)\u000a      and Sacramentum Caritatis (2007), is attributed by Roman Catholic\u000a      commentators in part to Pickstock's philosophico-theological analysis of\u000a      mediaeval rites, and her critique of the Vatican II reforms [4, 6, 9; see\u000a      also 2]. Her analysis of liturgical texts and critique of the\u000a      reforms have influenced the International Consultation on English in the\u000a      Liturgy in their recent recommendations and commentaries upon new\u000a      revisions, as well as recommendations for liturgical practice, in\u000a      particular the need for liturgical complexity and 'stammering' as well as\u000a      the re-introduction of caesurae (2009) [3, 4; see also 1, 2]. Pickstock's\u000a      work was a point of reference for the reformers during their new English\u000a      translation of the Roman Catholic Novus Ordo (2010) which was\u000a      issued to English-speaking Roman Catholic parishes in the USA, the UK and\u000a      Australia in 2011 [3; see also 1, 2]. Her discussion of liturgical\u000a      complexity and stammer has also impacted upon liturgical practice, as\u000a      evinced by the Archbishop of Granada in his statement concerning his\u000a      continuing liturgical practices and understanding [6].\u000a    Similarly, in the Church of England, Pickstock's work was a central point\u000a      of reference for reformers during the period when the Church was active in\u000a      the reform of the 1982 Alternative Service Book, leading to its\u000a      publication of the new Common Worship: Services and Prayers in the\u000a        Church of England, authorised for use by the General Synod since\u000a      2005, and now in circulation throughout the Anglican Communion and in\u000a      daily use in parishes all over the world [1, 2]. The new practice of\u000a      \"silent Masses\" and the introduction of the \"caesura\" or \"Form of\u000a      Preparation\" (Common Worship p. 161) have been attributed to\u000a      Pickstock's After Writing [1, 2], and especially her analysis of\u000a      what she has identified as a \"liturgical stammer\" [1]. Her work has also\u000a      been linked with the recent tendency to draw upon mediaeval,\u000a      pre-reformation and pre-Tridentine liturgical practices, over current\u000a      liturgical provision (e.g. A. Davison and A. Milbank, For the Parish:\u000a        a Critique of Fresh Expressions (SCM, 2010) [1, 2].\u000a    In published overviews of Roman Catholic and Anglican liturgical\u000a      revision, such as those of the International Consultation on English in\u000a      the Liturgy and the Centre International d'&#201;tudes Liturgiques ([3]; see\u000a      also for e.g., J. S. Baldovin, Reforming the Liturgy: A Response to\u000a        the Critics (Liturgical Press, 2009), ch. 1), as well as in various\u000a      discussion forums, the reformers and other discussants routinely cite\u000a      Pickstock's work when insisting on liturgy as a theological category, as\u000a      more than a text or isolated rite, as requiring apophatic \"stammering\" and\u000a      \"recommencements\" (e.g. Baldovin, esp. pp. 26-32) [also 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8,\u000a      9, 10]. They acknowledge their debt to her critique of the reforms for not\u000a      adequately contextualising the liturgy in contemporary culture, and for\u000a      raising the following questions:\u000a    \u000a      Do the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy and the subsequent reforms\u000a        too easily accept \"modern\" preconceptions about society? [3, 4, 6, 7, 8]\u000a      Does the reform of the liturgy rationalize the Mass in a way that\u000a        evades its \"impossibility\"? [1, 4, 6]\u000a      Have the strategies of translation (in the 1970s) adequately captured\u000a        the genius of genres to which they were applied? (Aidan Nichols OP, Looking\u000a          at the Liturgy (Ignatius, 1996), pp. 82-6 and The Catholic\u000a          World Report (January 1997), pp. 58-9) [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\u000a      Was there adequate dialogue among liturgical historians, pastoral\u000a        specialists and theologians in the construction of the reform? ([3, 4];\u000a        also Baldovin, Reforming the Liturgy, ch. 1, esp. pp. 26-32).\u000a    \u000a    Pickstock's research and collaborative consultation have impacted upon\u000a      Croatian Lutheran liturgical practice (2010-2013), and are forming the\u000a      basis for a revision of the Croatian Lutheran Liturgy and pastoral\u000a      practice, with greater emphasis upon liturgical complexity, stammering and\u000a      caesurae, and more emphasis on the Eucharistic prayer and communal\u000a      contemplation than had been usual for Croatian Lutheran liturgical\u000a      practice. Her work has also led to more lay attention to the theological\u000a      nature and purpose of liturgy [5].\u000a    Pickstock's research is central to the training of seminarians in\u000a      Granada, especially since the translation of After Writing\u000a      (Herder, 2006) made her work more accessible. It has decisively impacted\u000a      upon the way in which new priests are taught to perform the liturgy, and\u000a      how the Archbishop of Granada regards and celebrates the liturgy, as a\u000a      broader and metaphysical pattern of ritual action in continuity with all\u000a      of life, and his manner of implementing the Pope's \"reform of the reform\"\u000a      and Summorum Pontificum in a Spanish context [6]. It has shaped\u000a      courses on worship and the liturgy in the ecumenical Cambridge Theological\u000a      Federation (the largest such institution in Europe) and has impacted upon\u000a      specific discussions of Anglican priesthood at Westcott House, one of the\u000a      colleges of the Federation [2].\u000a    Pickstock's critical re-evaluation of the liturgy has shaped public\u000a      discourse. During the impact review period, Pickstock has been invited to\u000a      write Credo Columns in The Times, given public addresses\u000a      to groups of churchgoers and ordinands, including talks at Manchester\u000a      Cathedral (2008, c. 70) and Westcott Theological College (2010, c. 45), as\u000a      well as other religious and non-religious audiences and video-link\u000a      discussions (e.g. Mus&#233;e d'art contemporain de Montr&#233;al, 2010, c. 200). Her\u000a      works have been reviewed, discussed and reprinted in semi-popular\u000a      religious as well as non-religious journals and bulletins (e.g. The\u000a        Reader (2009), Art and Christianity (2008)), reviewed and\u000a      cited in newspaper reviews and articles (e.g. L'Homme Nouveau\u000a      (2008), The Tablet (2009), The Church Times (2009), and\u000a      mockingly cited in \"Pseud's Corner\" of Private Eye (Issue 952, p.\u000a      13) and discussed in blogs and online discussion forums (e.g. [7, 8, 9,\u000a      10]).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Catherine Pickstock's metaphysical approach to liturgical texts and her\u000a      associated critique of middle to late twentieth century Roman Catholic and\u000a      Anglican liturgical revision, have influenced recent liturgical revisions\u000a      in several Christian denominations and several languages.

In\u000a      these she re-evaluates the philosophical and cultural assumptions\u000a      underlying the liturgical reform informed by the Vatican II Constitution\u000a        on the Sacred Liturgy, as well as its charter in Sacrosanctum\u000a        Concilium, and the Church of England's Liturgical Commission in the\u000a      late 1970s, and offers a philosophico-theological proposal that liturgy be\u000a      reinstated as a fundamental theological nexus between metaphysical insight\u000a      and embodied practice.\u000a    Inter alia, Pickstock argues:\u000a    \u000a      that liturgical texts are a fundamental site for the imparting of\u000a        theology;\u000a      that liturgical performance is in a certain sense the acme of\u000a        theological reflection, rather than simply its starting point or\u000a        expression;\u000a      that a desire to modernise liturgical language has obscured the\u000a        peculiarities of liturgical language in any era;\u000a      that a change or `updating' of liturgical language can result in an\u000a        alteration of doctrine;\u000a      that there is a need to restore a view of liturgy according to which\u000a        all of life should belong to a pattern of ritual action.\u000a    \u000a    Pickstock's research emphasises particular ways in which the reforms\u000a      presupposed characteristically \"modern\" principles of epistemology at odds\u000a      with ritual purpose in general, and with the specific logic of the\u000a      inherited liturgical texts undergoing revision and reform. It shows how\u000a      the apparent simplicity of ancient rites was mistakenly interpreted as a\u000a      guide to full performance, and how the reformers projected backwards a\u000a      modern preference for unambiguous words, isolated phrases and avoidance of\u000a      redundancy of expression and repetition, all of which are adverse to the\u000a      generation of genuine ritual effects. Through textual analysis of\u000a      mediaeval and contemporary liturgical texts, her works seek to show that a\u000a      complex \"apophatic\" liturgical theology was present in the mediaeval\u000a      rites, which was itself part of a cultural understanding of doxology (or\u000a      praise of the divine) which extended beyond the rite itself to inflect a\u000a      way of life.\u000a    Pickstock's work is situated in a broader re-engagement of theology and\u000a      society through a critique of the problems consequent upon the\u000a      much-attested \"disenchantment\" of popular perception in \"modernity\". She\u000a      has sought to re-assess the relationship between theology and society on\u000a      various critical fronts: liturgical, political, economic, aesthetic,\u000a      linguistic and musical, and has done so in part through her own academic\u000a      writings, and in part through co-founding (with John Milbank and Graham\u000a      Ward) the critical-theoretical theological movement known as Radical\u000a      Orthodoxy in 1997 which led to two book series, a journal, countless\u000a      discussion groups, conferences, engagement with various political leaders\u000a      (e.g. Lord Glasman, Jon Cruddas) and think tanks (e.g. Respublica),\u000a      interviews, PhD dissertations and published responses.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"19864","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2361809","Name":"Burkina Faso"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    In post-unification Germany the late Catholic artist, film maker, theatre\u000a      director and actor Christoph\u000a      Schlingensief (1960-2010) was considered one of the country's key cultural\u000a      figures. According to\u000a      the Nobel Prize laureate Elfriede\u000a        Jelinek, Schlingensief was `one of the greatest artists who ever\u000a      lived' and, in recognition of his importance, much of his estate was\u000a      entrusted to the Berlin\u000a      Academy of the Arts. His principal themes, namely the question of God,\u000a      redemption and the\u000a      meaning of art, have shaped the cultural and political discourse in\u000a      Germany for more than two\u000a      decades, and during the latter part of his life were developed in explicit\u000a      dialogue with Hoff.\u000a      Following diagnosis with lung cancer in 2008, these aspects of his work\u000a      became pronounced as\u000a      seen in his Heaven Could Not Be as Beautiful as Here: A Cancer Diary\u000a      (2009) (cf. obituaries\u000a      Spiegel Online International 23 August 2010; The Guardian\u000a      24 August 2010, New York Times, 26\u000a      August 2010). Upon publication of the diary Hoff embarked upon an\u000a      intensive collaboration with\u000a      Schlingensief, the impact of which contributed to the visibility of\u000a      Christian faith in the German public\u000a      space and changed the perception of academic theology in the context of\u000a      contemporary debates\u000a      on art and culture.\u000a    Hoff's collaboration fed into Schlingensief's series of public high\u000a      profile performances, including the\u000a      acclaimed staging of his oratorio `Eine Kirche der Angst vor dem Fremden\u000a      in mir' at the 2011\u000a      Venice Biennale, and his opera' `Mea Culpa' at the Vienna\u000a      Burgtheater (see\u000a      http:\/\/www.schlingensief.com\/index_eng.html.)\u000a      In each the author enacted his own cancer\u000a      experience and discussed, from a Catholic perspective, the religious\u000a      questions that his imminent\u000a      mortality raised. Through this collaboration, which made a significant\u000a      contribution to the public\u000a      perception of the artist's work, Hoff's scholarship had an impact well\u000a      beyond the academic\u000a      community. By influencing the creative practice of a leading artist during\u000a      a critical juncture of his\u000a      development, Hoff's research has promoted new forms of artistic and\u000a      religious expression which\u000a      have enriched the lives, imaginations and sensibilities of individuals and\u000a      groups.\u000a    The impact of Hoff's collaboration is best seen in relation to\u000a      Schlingensief's production, `Sterben\u000a      Lernen' (`Learning to Die ') (see http:\/\/www.srf.ch\/sendungen\/reflexe\/sterben-lernen-mit-christoph-\u000a      schlingensief-2).\u000a      This emerged from an initial meeting in which Hoff presented Schlingensief\u000a      with\u000a      his account of Cusa's deconstruction of narcissistic habits and `virtual\u000a      reality', typified in the\u000a      Christian concept of heaven which in turn became the basis for the title\u000a      of Schlingensief's Heaven\u000a        Could Not Be as Beautiful as Here. His ongoing dialogue with Hoff\u000a      was shared with his audience\u000a      during a public reading of the diary in the Thalia Theatre, Hamburg. The\u000a      discourse articulated two\u000a      arguments which form the core of Hoff's text. It interprets modernity as\u000a      the `age of narcissism' and\u000a      criticizes the modern obsession with `virtual reality' or the will to\u000a      visualise what he saw as the\u000a      ultimately ineffable nature of faith (`K&#228;mpfe gegen die katholische\u000a      Bilderso&#223;e'). Based on audio\u000a      records, this presentation has been published in Schlingensief's\u000a      posthumous autobiography (Aino\u000a      Laberenz (ed.), Christoph Schlingensief. Ich wei&#223; ich wars\u000a      (M&#252;nchen: KiWi, 2012) especially p.\u000a      56), while the later chapters include further material based on the early\u000a      dialogues. The\u000a      collaboration subsequently developed with Schlingensief's production\u000a      `Sterben Lernen' at the\u000a      Theater Neumarkt in Z&#252;rich, first performed on 4 December 2009. The\u000a      treatment of the themes of\u000a      God, church and existential suffering explored in `Sterben Lernen' were in\u000a      response to Hoff's\u000a      analysis of Meister Eckhart and Nicholas of Cusa. The author recounts\u000a      Hoff's role as a\u000a      `Sterbelehrer' (`a-teacher-of-how-to-die') in his controversial\u000a      `Schlingenblog'. `This', he claims, `is\u000a      precisely not the repetition of a medical history but is about the\u000a      struggle with and for god and about\u000a      the ideas that emerged in the conversation with the systematic theologian\u000a      Johannes Hoff. The\u000a      questions of god, the hope to find a new peace, not according to the\u000a      conventional notions of the\u000a      Evangelical or Catholic Church, but in liberation from human delusion\u000a      towards the reality of the\u000a      ineffable God'. In the fourth act of `Sterben Lernen', Schlingensief\u000a      interrupted his own performance\u000a      on stage in order to talk about his collaboration with Hoff. This\u000a      particular staging was followed by a\u000a      panel discussion with Schlingensief, Carl Hegemann and Hoff himself in\u000a      which these themes were\u000a      further articulated.\u000a    Hoff's further collaboration included preparatory work on Schlingensief's\u000a      celebrated `Operndorf\u000a      Afrika' project in Ouagadougou, the capital of the west African state of\u000a      Burkina Faso. His input\u000a      included a feature article entitled `The Performance Artist Saint\u000a      Augustine' in the 'Schlingensief-\u000a      Feuilleton' (4, 5). This appeared in the Christmas edition of the German\u000a      weekly Die Zeit in 2009\u000a      (6). With a circulation of 488,036 and an estimated readership of two\u000a      million, it is the most widely\u000a      read German weekly newspaper. This article drew on Hoff's academic\u000a      publication on Augustine\u000a      (`Whose self? Which unification? Augustine's anthropology and the\u000a      psychology-theology debate',\u000a      New Blackfriars 91 (2010)), his previous research on Jacques\u000a      Derrida (Spiritualit&#228;t und\u000a        Sprachverlust. Theologie nach Foucault und Derrida (Paderborn:\u000a      M&#252;nchen, 1999)) and his\u000a      collaboration with the interdisciplinary Research Group `Rhetorik als\u000a      Kulturelle Praxis'. Other\u000a      contributors included the former German President Joachim K&#246;hler, the\u000a      award-winning African\u000a      architect Francis K&#233;r&#233;, the American singer songwriter Patti Smith and the\u000a      Swedish dramatist\u000a      Henning Mankell. Profits were directed to `Operndorf Afrika' itself while\u000a      the work drew public\u000a      attention to the artistic project. (See the 20:00 `Tagesthemen' (`Review\u000a      of the Day') broadcast by\u000a      the German television station ARD on 19 December 2010 (9)).\u000a      After the BBC, ARD is the world's\u000a      largest public broadcaster, its programmes reaching 8.8 million households\u000a      in Germany.\u000a    The impact of Hoff's collaboration with the artist continued after\u000a      Schlingensief's death when the\u000a      jury of the 54th Venice\u000a        Biennale awarded the `Golden Lion for the best national pavilion'\u000a      (the\u000a      exhibition's highest honour) to Schlingensief's posthumously staged\u000a      oratorio `Kirche der Angst'\u000a      (`Church of Fear') (see http:\/\/www.kirche-der-angst).\u000a      Along with Dr Susanne Gaensheimer, director\u000a      of Frankfurt's Museum f&#252;r Moderne Kunst and curator of the\u000a      Biennale's German Pavilion, Hoff was\u000a      involved in the preparatory discussions about this project. According to\u000a      Schlingensief's colleague\u000a      Carl Hegemann (Dramaturg, Thalia Theater Hamburg), Hoff's contributions to\u000a      the planning of the\u000a      Pavilion had a significant impact on the presentation of the oratorio as a\u000a      specifically religious work.\u000a      The Biennale attracts over 300,000 visitors, while the German Pavilion and\u000a      Schlingensief's work\u000a      was credited as an exemplar of how contemporary art can be cutting-edge\u000a      and morally engaged at\u000a      the same time (see\u000a        http:\/\/www.deutscher-pavillon.org). As there are few translations,\u000a      subtitles or\u000a      English versions of Schlingensief's complex oeuvre, the Pavilion made it\u000a      accessible to an\u000a      international audience. (For the public responses to this event cf. 'DW\u000a        Akademie and National\u000a        Catholic Register 9,10). The accompanying publication, which is\u000a      aimed at helping visitors to\u000a      contextualise their experience, includes Hoff's essay `Leben in F&#252;lle.\u000a      Schlingensiefs\u000a      Dekonstruktion der (Post-)Moderne' (English translation 10) in which he\u000a      recounts his final\u000a      conversation with Schlingensief, a discussion of narcissistic images and\u000a      the illusionary salvation in\u000a      modern religion and art. This rejects the traditional avant-garde\u000a      reading of Schlingensief's art and\u000a      relates it to the pre-modern tradition of philosophical theology such as\u000a      Meister Eckhart and\u000a      Thomas Aquinas. Hoff was subsequently involved in the Saint Moritz Art\u000a      Festival 2010 where he\u000a      wrote the feature article of the accompanying journal. The festival's\u000a      conference, organized by the\u000a      German art theorist Bazon Brock, afforded Hoff the opportunity to present\u000a      his research on Hugo\u000a      Ball and, together with Carl Hegemann, to participate in public discussion\u000a      on Schlingensief's work\u000a      at the Volksb&#252;hne Berlin and at the Berlin Hebbel Theather am\u000a        Ufer.\u000a    The impact of Hoff's collaboration with Schlingensief, and particularly\u000a      of his research on modern art\u000a      as religion, continued with his invitation to the Wagner-Council at the Akademie\u000a        der K&#252;nste in\u000a      Berlin, May 2011, and to act as critical advisor for Sebastian\u000a      Baumgartner's critically acclaimed\u000a      staging of Tannh&#228;user at the Bayreuth Festival. In 2004 at the invitation\u000a      of Wolfgang and Katharina\u000a      Wagner, Schlingensief had staged Richard Wagner's Parsifal for the\u000a      Bayreuth Festival. Hoff's\u000a      research fed into later discussions regarding art and religious themes in\u000a      the opera. Following its\u000a      first performance, Hoff participated in the `Tannh&#228;user &#8212; Werkstatt der\u000a      Gef&#252;hl' symposium in\u000a      Bayreuth. This annual conference of artists and scholars re-establishes a\u000a      suggestion made initially\u000a      by Friedrich Nietzsche, whose relationship to Wagner and Schlingensief is\u000a      explored in Hoff's\u000a      Pavilion essay.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Collaboration with Christoph Schlingensief, a leading representative of\u000a      contemporary `Avant-\u000a      Garde' Art and Culture which has focused on the visibility of Christian\u000a      faith in the public space and\u000a      is changing the perception of academic theology in the context of\u000a      contemporary debates on art and\u000a      culture.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    University of Wales, Trinity Saint David\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Trinity Saint David (University of Wales)","InstitutionName":"University of Wales, Trinity Saint David","PeerGroup":"C","Region":"Wales","UKPRN":10007858}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2855745","Name":"Paderborn"},{"GeoNamesId":"2357048","Name":"Ougadougou"},{"GeoNamesId":"2761369","Name":"Vienna"},{"GeoNamesId":"2357048","Name":"Ouagadougou"},{"GeoNamesId":"2950159","Name":"Berlin"},{"GeoNamesId":"2911298","Name":"Hamburg"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000ai.

The Analogical\u000a        Turn by Johannes Hoff for the first time\u000a      locates Nicholas of Cusa without anachronism as a post-nominalist realist,\u000a      who reworked the\u000a      inherited analogical vision of Christian theology in a simultaneously late\u000a      Gothic and Renaissance\u000a      manner. As Hoff explains, this idiom offers us a new way forward today.\u000a      Much more than a\u000a      monograph on a historical figure, this imaginatively crafted and extremely\u000a      scholarly volume\u000a      constitutes one of the most significant works of theology in the\u000a      twenty-first century so far. I believe\u000a      that it will exert a very considerable influence on future theoretical\u000a      reflections both within theology\u000a      and without.\u000a    Karsten Harries. Yale University. With The Analogical\u000a        Turn: Rethinking Modernity with Nicholas\u000a      of Cusa Johannes Hoff has given us the most challenging and most readable\u000a      book on the fifteenth-\u000a      century cardinal to have appeared in English. But, as the title suggests,\u000a      at issue is much more --\u000a      the shape and fate of our modern world. Recently there has been much talk\u000a      about this being a\u000a      postmodern, postsecular age. Hoff's book should make such talk more\u000a      thoughtful.\u000a    ","ResearchSubjectAreas":[{"Level1":"20","Level2":"5","Subject":"Literary Studies"},{"Level1":"22","Level2":"2","Subject":"History and Philosophy of Specific Fields"},{"Level1":"21","Level2":"3","Subject":"Historical Studies"}],"Sources":"\u000a    Schlingensief repeatedly referred to his collaboration with Hoff in\u000a      public interviews, for example in\u000a      his 2009 interview with Cultural Journal Cicero (1), his 2009 television\u000a      interview with Die Zeit (2),\u000a      and in footage of `Sterben Lernen' Akt 4 (3)\u000a    \u000a      http:\/\/www.cicero.de\/salon\/die-kirche-ist-ein-m%C3%A4rchenpark\/40447\u000a      \u000ahttp:\/\/www.zeit.de\/kultur\/2009-12\/schlingensief_181209_2.\u000a      http:\/\/schlingenblog.posterous.com\/?page=5\u000a    \u000a    The collaboration is also corroborated in the various sources referenced\u000a      above:\u000a    \u000a      \u000a      http:\/\/www.zeit.de\/2009\/53\/Schlingensief-Christentum\/komplettansicht\u000a      http:\/\/www.zeit.de\/kultur\/kunst\/2009-12\/bg-schlingensief-2\u000a      http:\/\/www.sternberg-press.com\/?pageId=1313&amp;PHPSESSID=f7cf4357c5d13d5569fe00024f492021\u000a      http:\/\/www.schlingensief.com\/weblog\/?p=626\u000a      Aino Laberenz (ed.), 'Christoph Schlingensief.

This is related to his\u000a      published research on post-modernity and the work of the medieval scholar\u000a      Nicholas of Cusa, and\u000a      it explores the way in which Cusa, in collaboration with the north\u000a      Burgundy artists Jan Van Eyck\u000a      and Rogier Van der Weyden, developed an alternative version of modernity\u000a      that built on the Gothic\u000a      tradition. His essays on Hugo Ball (`B&#252;rger - K&#252;nstler - Exorzisten'), on\u000a      Michel de Certeau and\u000a      Henri de Lubac (`Mysticism, Ecclesiology and the Body of Christ') and on\u000a      the modern philosophy of\u000a      `the event' (`Das Paradox des Glaubens und der Holzweg moderner\u000a      Entscheidungslogik') were\u000a      part of this project, their main aim being to develop a radical critique\u000a      of modern theology's usually\u000a      defensive response to globalization. This response builds on pre-modern\u000a      sources, including those\u000a      of Cusa and Thomas Aquinas, without abandoning the achievements of\u000a      modernity. Among the\u000a      themes developed are `performativity' and the `authentic act' in\u000a      Kierkegaard, as well as the\u000a      relationship between science, art and religion. A particular focus is the\u000a      development of an\u000a      iconoclastic (i.e. radical apophatic) concept of God, and the\u000a      deconstruction of the modern\u000a      `virtualisation' of the idea of salvation in art and religion. The outcome\u000a      of this research is\u000a      summarized in Hoff's monograph The Analogical Turn. Re-thinking\u000a      modernity with Nicholas of\u000a      Cusa (2013) which is considered to be `by far the most important\u000a      work of recent theology and at\u000a      last a real German contribution to international theological debates of\u000a      our time' (John Milbank). The\u000a      research moves beyond traditional orthodox narratives in that it\u000a      radicalizes their most elementary\u000a      iconoclastic features and focuses on the inconceivability and\u000a      `namelessness' of God.\u000a    Hoff has also worked with the German interdisciplinary research group\u000a      `Rhetorik als Kulturelle\u000a      Praxis' under the direction of the Peter Szondi Institute for General and\u000a      Comparative Literary\u000a      Sciences (Free University of Berlin) and the Department of Literary\u000a      Sciences of the University of\u000a      Konstanz. His research centres on Kierkegaard and the modern cult of `the\u000a      event' as well as\u000a      spirituality and performativity in the work of the Dadaist Hugo Ball. He\u000a      links Ball's findings on\u000a      psychoanalysis and the tradition of pre-modernity (published in his 1927\u000a      essay `Der K&#252;nstler und\u000a      die Zeitkrankheit') with his own research on Christian orthodoxy and\u000a      psychoanalysis, themes which\u000a      Hoff has explored through collaborative research with the cognitive\u000a      psychologist Peter Hampson.\u000a      Hoff is continuing this project through his ongoing translation of Hugo\u000a      Ball's Das Byzantinische\u000a        Christentum (1923) in collaboration with the Z&#252;rich `Cabaret\u000a      Voltaire' and the Slovenian Artist\u000a      collective IRWIN. IRWIN is recognized for its attempts to deconstruct the\u000a      avant-garde tradition of\u000a      the twentieth century, this being an underlying theme in all of Hoff's\u000a      academic work.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"20088","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    MacCulloch's `rare combination of encyclopaedic learning and lucid\u000d\u000a      writing' (Sir Ian Blair in The\u000d\u000a        Mail on Sunday, 6\/12\/09) has been the major factor facilitating the\u000d\u000a      impact of his research on\u000d\u000a      Britain's media production, its cultural and intellectual life, and in\u000d\u000a      particular its public discourse\u000d\u000a      about the religious and cultural heritage of Christianity in today's\u000d\u000a      world.

While the\u000d\u000a      substantial focussed\u000d\u000a      reading and writing for the project were undertaken between 2005 and 2009,\u000d\u000a      the work represents\u000d\u000a      the culmination of a four-decade academic career in church history\u000d\u000a      informed by MacCulloch's own\u000d\u000a      specialist research in Reformation history and his unique perspective as\u000d\u000a      long-time co-editor of the\u000d\u000a      world-leading Journal of Ecclesiastical History. MacCulloch's\u000d\u000a      research was embedded into a rich\u000d\u000a      research environment in both theology and history including regular\u000d\u000a      research seminars. The\u000d\u000a      Faculty of Theology gave him special leave to complete this project.\u000d\u000a    The book's innovative scholarship rests with its application to the whole\u000d\u000a      of Christianity's history of a\u000d\u000a      perspective that has more recently gained ground in much specialist\u000d\u000a      scholarship. The narrative\u000d\u000a      consciously takes leave of traditional teleologies that inscribed into the\u000d\u000a      very origins of Christianity a\u000d\u000a      seemingly inevitable trajectory leading towards its medieval and modern,\u000d\u000a      Catholic and Protestant,\u000d\u000a      realisations in Europe. Instead, MacCulloch's account privileges parts of\u000d\u000a      the Christian story that\u000d\u000a      were either ignored or marginalised within the traditional paradigm. His\u000d\u000a      work gives appropriate\u000d\u000a      attention to ancient Christianities in Africa and the Middle East and\u000d\u000a      presents their story in a way\u000d\u000a      that accentuates the less central, even secondary status of western\u000d\u000a      Christianity in the formative\u000d\u000a      stages of Christian expansion. Christianity, it turns out, was for much of\u000d\u000a      its history an eastern as\u000d\u000a      much as, if not more than, a western religion. This realisation casts in a\u000d\u000a      new light the worldwide\u000d\u000a      spread of Christianity during the past 150 years. In his treatment of this\u000d\u000a      latest phase of Christian\u000d\u000a      history, MacCulloch is equally concerned to present Christianity in its\u000d\u000a      global dimensions,\u000d\u000a      emphasising its presence in a variety of cultural contexts and the plural\u000d\u000a      forms of theological, ritual\u000d\u000a      and spiritual expression that ensue from it. It is this constant emphasis\u000d\u000a      on the ecumenical,\u000d\u000a      multicultural character of the religion throughout the two millennia of\u000d\u000a      its history that makes\u000d\u000a      MacCulloch's work a fitting church history for the early 21st\u000d\u000a      century.\u000d\u000a    Yet the book's significance lies in its style of presentation as much as\u000d\u000a      its contents. It is the product\u000d\u000a      of applied research: a reflection for the wider public of rapidly changing\u000d\u000a      specialist academic\u000d\u000a      perspectives on the Christian past, looking beyond the confessional-based\u000d\u000a      stories which Churches\u000d\u000a      have told about themselves. Its scholarly value cannot be detached from\u000d\u000a      its aim to rekindle an\u000d\u000a      interest in, and to foster knowledge of, Christian history anew and in a\u000d\u000a      way appropriate for our own\u000d\u000a      time. The research was from the beginning undertaken with an eye on its\u000d\u000a      potential impact on\u000d\u000a      cultural life in Britain and globally, but touching on education and\u000d\u000a      public discourse as well.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"20493","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Beattie's high public profile and impact on public discourse has been\u000a      sustained through non- academic publications, the communication of her\u000a      research more broadly, and collaboration with NGOs (CAFOD, Joint Learning\u000a      Initiative, Progressio, QUEST). These research-driven interventions have\u000a      been a key resource in challenging cultural values around some of the most\u000a      neuralgic issues affecting Catholics in contemporary society.\u000a    Reach:\u000a    Beattie is committed to engaging with wider publics in ways which draw on\u000a      her body of research. Since 2008, public lectures and media appearances\u000a      have reached a wide international audience. She has participated in\u000a      debates about changes in civil law relating to same-sex marriage,\u000a      including the Westminster Faith Debates in 2013, and a debate between the\u000a      British Humanist Association and Catholic Voices when she was part of the\u000a      BHA panel in 2012. Beattie has also contributed to online debate in The\u000a        Guardian, including an online series of eight articles on Thomas\u000a      Aquinas for The Guardian. Based on the research for Theology\u000a        After Postmodernity (2013), the series attracted over 3,000 comments\u000a      from registered website users, and stimulated debate about the rationality\u000a      of religious faith and differing interpretations of Aquinas. Media\u000a      appearances include BBC, Sky, RT&#201;, Al Jazeera, Australian Broadcasting\u000a      Corporation, Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and various American news\u000a      and television outlets, which have contributed to public awareness and\u000a      discourse. Beattie is also consulted and widely quoted by journalists (The\u000a        Washington Post, The Guardian, The Independent, the BBC).\u000a      Her writings have been translated into Norwegian, Spanish, Italian, Dutch,\u000a      French and Romanian.\u000a    As a member of CAFOD's Theological Advisory Group, Beattie's research on\u000a      Catholic social teaching and women's rights reaches beyond public\u000a      audiences, and has informed CAFOD policy relating to the development and\u000a      promotion of the `Live Simply' campaign, and the implementation of\u000a      Catholic Social Teaching in policy and education. She writes for CAFOD\u000a      publications and contributes to CAFOD'S awareness-raising campaigns,\u000a      including the World Social Forum in Nairobi. She is also a Director of and\u000a      theological advisor to the influential Catholic weekly, The Tablet.\u000a      She has acted as an advisor to various women's religious orders (such as\u000a      the Little Sisters of the Poor and the Society of the Sacred Heart), in\u000a      helping them to develop their charisms and formulate their visions through\u000a      an informed dialogue with feminist theology.\u000a    Significance:\u000a    The significance of Beattie's research-led intervention in public\u000a      discourse is illustrated by one high-profile example. In August 2012, she\u000a      and twenty-six others signed a letter to The Times, arguing that\u000a      Catholics could in good conscience support same-sex civil marriage. Her\u000a      decision was informed by her research and demonstrates its social\u000a      relevance. A complaint was made to the Head of the Congregation for the\u000a      Doctrine of the Faith in the Vatican (CDF), who instructed the Bishop of\u000a      Clifton to cancel a public lecture Beattie was due to give in Clifton\u000a      cathedral. This unprecedented intervention with regard to a lay theologian\u000a      in a secular university caused widespread protest. No other signatory was\u000a      censured, despite the fact that these included several priests and\u000a      theologians. Beattie might have been singled out because of her high\u000a      public profile and the nature of her research, which has also been the\u000a      target of conservative Catholic bloggers, and is evident in commentary on\u000a      the range of public engagement activities she undertakes.\u000a    Following this event, in November 2013, Beattie's visiting fellowship at\u000a      the University of San Diego (USD) was cancelled at short notice by the USD\u000a      President, after a campaign by a powerful coalition of funders and\u000a      Catholic public figures, supported by a senior Vatican official (full\u000a      report in the National Catholic Reporter: http:\/\/ncronline.org\/news\/theology\/theologians-disinvite-linked-vatican-supported-group). The extensive media coverage prompted\u000a      on-going international debate. USD students formed a Facebook group &#8212;\u000a      `Toreros Stand With Beattie' &#8212; attracting over 500 supporters, with\u000a      demonstrations and debates on campus, and public lectures. The faculty of\u000a      the College of Arts and Sciences passed a vote of no confidence in the\u000a      President, and several senior faculty members and alumni called for her\u000a      resignation. The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) with\u000a      47,000 members, wrote to the USD President expressing serious concern\u000a      about the violation of academic freedom, and in September 2013 the\u000a      President of the AAUP took part in a debate about the case at USD,\u000a      organised by concerned faculty and students.\u000a    The controversy generated widespread discourse not only about the nature\u000a      of academic freedom, but also around Beattie's theological perspectives on\u000a      homosexuality in particular. Since the cancellation of Beattie's lecture\u000a      and visiting fellowship, it has become evident that her work on religion,\u000a      sexuality and gender has become a valuable resource &#8212; extending and\u000a      increasing the quality of debate and discourse within the Catholic church\u000a      and increasing the possibilities for more informed debate.

Three monographs constitute an extended investigation into the\u000a      significance of gender in the Catholic tradition, augmented by published\u000a      research on Catholic social teaching and theology and human rights,\u000a      including women's reproductive rights. God's Mother, Eve's Advocate\u000a      (2002) is an inter-disciplinary study of the cult of the Virgin Mary,\u000a      focusing on patristic and contemporary theology, French feminism and the\u000a      visual arts. This was followed by twelve years of further research into\u000a      gender in the Catholic tradition.\u000a    Developing this research in engagement with the theology of Hans Urs von\u000a      Balthasar (a significant influence on postconciliar theology), New\u000a        Catholic Feminism (2006) was the output of a Leverhulme research\u000a      fellowship, By analysing gender constructs in theology and theory, New\u000a        Catholic Feminism challenges the sexual essentialisms and\u000a      heterosexual norms of modern Catholic teaching, bringing into play a more\u000a      polymorphous sacramentality of gender. It offers a searching critique of\u000a      Anglo-American feminist theory and feminist theology, arguing that a more\u000a      radical appreciation of the significance of sacramental practice is needed\u000a      if the inherently deconstructive potential of sacramental theology is to\u000a      disrupt the dualistic essentialisms of modernity's sexual constructs.\u000a    Probing into these questions more deeply, Theology after\u000a        Postmodernity (2013) is an in-depth study of Thomas Aquinas's Summa\u000a        Theologiae in engagement with Jacques Lacan. The result of six years\u000a      of research, partly funded by the AHRC, this engages with recent studies\u000a      that point to the influence of Aquinas on Lacan's thought. Focusing on\u000a      Lacanian themes of desire, sexuality, mysticism, embodiment and violence,\u000a      and taking seriously his preoccupation with the formative influence of the\u000a      doctrines of creation and incarnation on western culture, it seeks to\u000a      unearth neglected and repressed themes in Aquinas's work, allowing for the\u000a      emergence of a creation- centred, maternal Trinitarian theology. Learning\u000a      from but going beyond Lacan, it offers a Thomism for our times, in which\u000a      the `unspeakable abyss' of postmodern nihilism becomes the `unsayable\u000a      plenitude' of the divine mystery.\u000a    These three books form the scholarly bedrock of Beattie's public\u000a      engagements, journalism and collaborative work, which is supplemented by a\u000a      large number of journal articles and book chapters.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"20501","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Initial contact with the Bible Society was through partial funding of the\u000d\u000a      first research phase. Andrew Rogers started working for Bible Society in\u000d\u000a      March 2009 fulfilling the role of `ordinary hermeneutics researcher'\u000d\u000a      (until August 2011). The Bible Society was interested in the findings of\u000d\u000a      the first phase of research and asked Rogers to explore the range and\u000d\u000a      quality of biblical hermeneutics resources for `ordinary' Christians. This\u000d\u000a      led into the second phase of the research from September 2009, where\u000d\u000a      Rogers began preparing a hermeneutics course for churches which drew on\u000d\u000a      both first and second phase research.\u000d\u000a    The pilot project, known as `Pathfinder', involved nine churches around\u000d\u000a      England engaging with a number of Bible Society offerings, especially the\u000d\u000a      hermeneutics course which became known as h+: Making Good Sense of the\u000d\u000a        Bible. Rogers wrote and taught the course in a London church between\u000d\u000a      January and April 2011, and trained a Bible Society colleague, Mike\u000d\u000a      Simmonds, to teach h+. h+ was then taught at eight further churches over\u000d\u000a      the next year across a range of denominations. Beyond Pathfinder, there\u000d\u000a      were a number of iterations of revision and development for h+ up until\u000d\u000a      its publication as a facilitator's guide and participant's guide in\u000d\u000a      September 2011. The Bible Society also invested in a video to accompany\u000d\u000a      the course, which included illustrative material and expert opinion on\u000d\u000a      hermeneutical matters. From March 2011, h+ moved towards a facilitator\u000d\u000a      model of delivery, starting with a training day for the Anglican\u000d\u000a        Diocese of Coventry. Church leaders were invited to attend with a\u000d\u000a      view to becoming facilitators of h+ themselves. The training day was\u000d\u000a      refined for a more general church audience in Swindon in June 2011.\u000d\u000a      Subsequently, Mike Simmonds has taken over the training programme for h+\u000d\u000a      facilitators, with over 250 church leaders having undergone such training\u000d\u000a      in England, Ireland and the Balkans (to July 2013).\u000d\u000a    In its final form h+ constitutes a 10 session course on biblical\u000d\u000a      hermeneutics for Christian communities. The stated aim is `to enable\u000d\u000a      participants to make good sense of the Bible for themselves, in the church\u000d\u000a      and in the world, through learning, practising and mediating key\u000d\u000a      hermeneutical virtues and skills'. The virtues of perseverance,\u000d\u000a      confidence, honesty, faithfulness, humility, courage, openness, and\u000d\u000a      community structure eight of the ten sessions. `Passing it on' is a theme\u000d\u000a      running throughout h+, since it is designed to have an impact beyond its\u000d\u000a      immediate participants. The main topics include: making the case that\u000d\u000a      hermeneutics is an indispensable element of Christian discipleship;\u000d\u000a      introducing the notion of hermeneutical virtue; addressing some standard\u000d\u000a      objections to hermeneutics; examining one's own horizons in relation to\u000d\u000a      the Bible; introducing key hermeneutical concepts; looking at the world\u000d\u000a      behind, within and in front of the text (i.e. the emphases on author, text\u000d\u000a      and reader); putting hermeneutical virtues and skills together to tackle a\u000d\u000a      contemporary issue (e.g. homelessness); and learning hermeneutics from the\u000d\u000a      whole body of Christ.\u000d\u000a    The impact of h+ demonstrates broad reach and marked significance for its\u000d\u000a      beneficiaries. In terms of reach, the key outputs are the published h+\u000d\u000a      guides (657 participant guides sold so far); the h+ website and blog; the\u000d\u000a      h+ booklet distributed in the Bible Society's Bible in Transmission\u000d\u000a      journal (circulation to approximately 17,000 church leaders); Word in\u000d\u000a        Action features (60,000+ circulation); the Deep Engagement Fresh\u000d\u000a        Discovery report of the Anglican Communion (1,500 print copies);\u000d\u000a      article on the Anglican Communion news service website; article in the\u000d\u000a      Church of England Reader magazine (circulation 10,000); and all those who\u000d\u000a      have participated in the course or training events so far.\u000d\u000a    The beneficiaries of h+ are the participants, trained facilitators,\u000d\u000a      congregations and their communities, and denominational and parachurch\u000d\u000a      organisations. Many of these beneficiaries have spoken of the significance\u000d\u000a      of h+ for them and their churches or organisations. The Anglican\u000d\u000a        Communion News service speaks of h+'s educational and spiritual\u000d\u000a      benefit through enabling participants to `think for themselves' and take a\u000d\u000a      `greater, deeper part in the life and mission of their churches' (S2).\u000d\u000a      There are many testimonials about h+ from participants, some noting the\u000d\u000a      course as `an accessible focus for Christian discipleship', others noting\u000d\u000a      the need for more advanced courses such as h+ that `treats the ordinary\u000d\u000a      reader as a thinking being' (S3). From the earliest pilot stage of h+,\u000d\u000a      feedback indicated evidence of significant impact on understanding and\u000d\u000a      practices (IC2). For example, one participant changed their Bible reading\u000d\u000a      practices, whilst another spoke of the course turning the Bible from 2D to\u000d\u000a      3D, making the `text alive', leading to a stronger relationship with God.\u000d\u000a      Others found the latter a `liberating' aspect of h+. Some participants\u000d\u000a      noted the change in Bible engagement in the church after h+, so context\u000d\u000a      and critical reflection were mentioned. One leader spoke of the confidence\u000d\u000a      h+ had given him in his preaching, and others spoke of its impact on their\u000d\u000a      preparation (S8).\u000d\u000a    Those training to be facilitators largely provided evidence of\u000d\u000a      congregational impact, particularly in terms of Christian discipleship\u000d\u000a      strategies at the congregational level. There have been many examples of\u000d\u000a      facilitators planning to incorporate h+ into training for leaders in their\u000d\u000a      congregation(s), deaneries, circuits and ecumenical groups. One life coach\u000d\u000a      spoke of running h+ to help people `use the Bible more intelligently in\u000d\u000a      their lives at work' (S13). Text and video testimonials from congregants,\u000d\u000a      leaders and academics speak of h+'s broader significance. One church\u000d\u000a      leader commented `I've seen the impact not only on myself, but also on\u000d\u000a      people in the congregation' and another spoke of h+ extending his social\u000d\u000a      life and `inquisitiveness' about the Bible. David Roche recommends h+ for\u000d\u000a      all church leaders since h+ has `listened to what is happening in our\u000d\u000a      culture' and so enables Christian communities to `get a grip of what we\u000d\u000a      are doing with the Bible'. Another thought it would `grow biblical\u000d\u000a      literacy' in their church. Darren Blaney appreciated h+ particularly for\u000d\u000a      moving participants to action in the later sessions through using the\u000d\u000a      pastoral cycle (S4).\u000d\u000a    At the denominational and parachurch level, the Bible Society is\u000d\u000a      a key beneficiary of the research. h+ was run at their HQ with a very\u000d\u000a      positive response (IC4&amp;5), and they have made h+ a key plank of their\u000d\u000a      Bible advocacy strategy (S3, 4, 6, 9, 11, 12). h+ is one of their core\u000d\u000a      responses to declining biblical literacy and engagement in England and\u000d\u000a      Wales, and as such there is significant benefit in terms of facilitating\u000d\u000a      engagement with a key text in our cultural heritage. The Anglican\u000d\u000a        Communion's `Bible in the Life of the Church' (BLC) project ran from\u000d\u000a      2009-2012 in eight regions around the world (S1, S2). With a strong focus\u000d\u000a      on process, the final report `highly recommended' h+ which it described as\u000d\u000a      `ten steps towards a deeper engagement with Scripture', and reported\u000d\u000a      testimony from participants saying h+ `freed them up to ask questions' and\u000d\u000a      gave them `curiosity and confidence to dig deeper into the text' (S1,\u000d\u000a      IC3). The reach of the impact is indicated as follows: `the Bible Society\u000d\u000a      in conjunction with the Bible in the Life of the Church project is\u000d\u000a      inviting Anglicans across the world to join in the h+ programme' (S1:p49,\u000d\u000a      IC3&amp;5 for on-going situation). Dr Helen Cameron, head of public\u000d\u000a      affairs at the Salvation Army, attended one of the first h+\u000d\u000a      facilitator training events. She then ran h+ twice for her senior\u000d\u000a      colleagues with a particular focus on theological reflection, starting\u000d\u000a      with homelessness (S5). The effect on participants was `a sense of\u000d\u000a      confidence that theological reflection is something that employees can\u000d\u000a      take part in'. h+ drew attention to the hermeneutical skills they already\u000d\u000a      had, which could also be `put to the service of theological reflection'.\u000d\u000a      It is noted of Cameron that `after doing the h+ session on homelessness,\u000d\u000a      her church paused to take stock of their own response to the issue' (S12,\u000d\u000a      IC1). Finally, the Congregational Federation's theological\u000d\u000a      programme runs a Level 6 module on Ordinary Theology, in which h+ and the\u000d\u000a      research outputs underpinning it feature (S7).\u000d\u000a    Further indicators of reach include the fact that 250+ facilitators have\u000d\u000a      been trained and 657 participant guides have been sold to date, which\u000d\u000a      indicates that h+ has run in many more locations beyond the initial 9\u000d\u000a      pilot churches. The nature of the impact, as has been seen, is spiritual,\u000d\u000a      in terms of a deepening of faith; educational, in terms of enriching the\u000d\u000a      hermeneutical practices of Christian communities; and cultural, in terms\u000d\u000a      of enhancing engagement with the Bible which forms a significant part of\u000d\u000a      British cultural heritage.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case study details the impact of theological ethnographic research\u000d\u000a      on the biblical hermeneutics of two contrasting congregations, which was\u000d\u000a      subsequently developed to identify the importance of hermeneutical virtues\u000d\u000a      for Bible reading. Conceptualising biblical hermeneutics in this\u000d\u000a      innovative way has allowed it to be more easily integrated into notions of\u000d\u000a      discipleship and Christian education.

The first phase of the\u000d\u000a      research (Jan '04 to March `09) analysed and evaluated a broad range of\u000d\u000a      hermeneutical practices within two contrasting congregations (Rogers 2007,\u000d\u000a      2009). Concepts and recommendations from the first phase were developed in\u000d\u000a      a second phase of research at the University of Roehampton (from September\u000d\u000a      2009, and on-going). This second phase consisted of preparing papers for\u000d\u000a      conferences and seminars (e.g. Ecclesiology and Ethnography network in\u000d\u000a      January 2011, Society for the Study of Theology in April 2011) and writing\u000d\u000a      two articles for publication from September 2011 to May 2012 (Rogers\u000d\u000a      2013b) and January 2012 to May 2012 (Rogers 2013a). This writing, teaching\u000d\u000a      and subsequent facilitator training of the h+ course for churches (from\u000d\u000a      January 2010 to September 2011) had a symbiotic relationship with the\u000d\u000a      development of the research.\u000d\u000a    The second phase enabled the analytical framework for `congregational\u000d\u000a      hermeneutics' to be formalised in terms of beliefs, goals, processes and\u000d\u000a      mediators (Rogers 2013a). Further examples of that framework can be found\u000d\u000a      in Rogers 2013b (which also demonstrates how such an analysis can be\u000d\u000a      revealing for better understanding of evangelical identities). There have\u000d\u000a      been very few academic studies of congregational hermeneutics (or\u000d\u000a      `ordinary' readers of the Bible), especially in the UK, hence the\u000d\u000a      significance of such a framework. Recommendations from the first phase\u000d\u000a      were also developed in the second through refining the notion of\u000d\u000a      hermeneutical virtue further for an understanding of `hermeneutical\u000d\u000a      apprenticeship' in churches (Rogers 2013a). So the `honest' reader learns\u000d\u000a      to examine their own horizons when engaging with Scripture, and the\u000d\u000a      `courageous' reader learns when they need to challenge certain\u000d\u000a      hermeneutical practices. The research shows something of the structure of\u000d\u000a      `lived hermeneutical virtue within a congregational story' (Rogers\u000d\u000a      2013a:124). Furthermore, such a virtue account links hermeneutics to\u000d\u000a      discipleship, with the implication that growth in hermeneutical virtue is\u000d\u000a      not just for experts but for all Christians.\u000d\u000a    Rogers 2013b synthesises and brings greater focus to the first phase\u000d\u000a      material on transforming horizons. That is, what change, potential and\u000d\u000a      actual, was associated with the different hermeneutical configurations in\u000d\u000a      each congregation? A number of transformative dynamics are identified, for\u000d\u000a      example, the valuable role of `organic theologians' in the churches. Such\u000d\u000a      material also underpins aspects of the h+ course.\u000d\u000a    In summary, the second phase research conceptualises biblical\u000d\u000a      hermeneutical education in a way that seeks to broaden reflective\u000d\u000a      engagement with the Scriptures in Christian communities, leading to\u000d\u000a      impacts such as those described below.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21795","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    \u000a      Reach: The practices of the 3-4,000 full- and part-time healthcare\u000a        chaplains in the UK and\u000a        chaplaincy services and patients and staff in NHS hospitals in the UK\u000a        have been impacted by\u000a        the policies informed by Walton's research.\u000a      Significance: Walton's research has lead to the establishment of the\u000a        first competency\u000a        framework governing healthcare chaplains in the UK, their core\u000a        skillsets, training and\u000a        supervision (adopted and implemented by NHS Scotland, England and Wales,\u000a        and the UK\u000a        Board of Healthcare Chaplaincy) and directly shaping inclusion and\u000a        content of one of the four\u000a        key domains within the framework.\u000a    \u000a    There are 187 NHS health care trusts in the UK, running over 2300\u000a      hospitals and other care\u000a      facilities. Since the establishment of the National Health Service in\u000a      1948, there have been\u000a      chaplaincy services available throughout the institution, primarily based\u000a      on the assumption of a\u000a      broadly shared religious belief system. Since the late 1990s, however, in\u000a      line with views emanating\u000a      from the World Health Organisation, the NHS has acknowledged a wider\u000a      definition of spiritual care\u000a      and the importance of its role in the `full-person' healing and care of\u000a      patients.\u000a    Today's healthcare chaplains work in an environment where they are\u000a      answerable to three different\u000a      and at times seemingly incompatible groups. Chaplains seek to offer care,\u000a      compassion and\u000a      understanding to individuals &#8212; patients, staff and others &#8212; who\u000a      often have no religious\u000a      commitment and struggle to express their spiritual concerns. Chaplains of\u000a      all faiths are employed\u000a      by an institution &#8212; the National Health Service &#8212; which is secular\u000a      in character. And most chaplains\u000a      belong to a faith community to which they have strong personal\u000a      allegiances and which may feel\u000a      that the faith organisation and not the NHS has first claim on overseeing\u000a      their work. Additionally,\u000a      healthcare chaplaincy work is stressful and frequently involves assisting\u000a      people who are\u000a      confronting traumatic situations that can be difficult to accommodate\u000a      within a traditional theological\u000a      framework.\u000a    Walton's work has focused the sector's attention on the particular\u000a      effectiveness in these complex\u000a      circumstances of narrative and poetic techniques in:\u000a    \u000a      providing a capacious and flexible way of acknowledging the diverse\u000a        challenges facing\u000a        healthcare chaplains and creating meaningful links between these areas\u000a        as a guide to practice;\u000a      generating effective pastoral communication and responses in contexts\u000a        in which there is no\u000a        shared framework of belief; and\u000a      enabling chaplains to become aware of their personal and professional\u000a        responses to difficult\u000a        challenges, thus becoming more effective reflective practitioners.\u000a    \u000a    The link between Walton's particular research insights and the influence\u000a      on the competency\u000a      framework for chaplains in the UK healthcare system was her earlier work\u000a      (pre-2008) at major\u000a      Chaplaincy conferences where she presented practitioners with a\u000a      methodological base for\u000a      theological reflection but also enabled them to engage in these reflective\u000a      processes through\u000a      creative writing exercises. Examples of influential events include the\u000a      Irish Healthcare Chaplains\u000a      Conference (2003): `Narrative Methods in Theological Reflection'; the\u000a      National College of\u000a      Healthcare Chaplains Conference (2004): `Beyond Storytelling in Practical\u000a      Theology) and her\u000a      consultancy to the National College of Healthcare Chaplains beginning in\u000a      2005.\u000a    Walton's high-profile espousal of reflective practice led to the\u000a      invitation to join the working group\u000a      sponsored by NHS Education Scotland which in 2008 produced the Spiritual\u000a        and Religious CareCapabilities and Competences for Healthcare Chaplains.\u000a      This framework, which serves as the\u000a      basis for healthcare chaplains' training, professional development and\u000a      supervision, detailed core\u000a      competencies in four key domains:\u000a    \u000a      knowledge and skills for professional practice;\u000a      spiritual and religious assessment and intervention;\u000a      institutional practice; and\u000a      reflective practice.\u000a    \u000a    The identification of Reflective Practice as a core competency domain\u000a      drew directly on Walton's\u000a      expertise as the only academic working group member with this specialism.\u000a      Walton was one of\u000a      only two theologians on the 17-strong committee and her particular\u000a      influence is seen not only in the\u000a      emphasis upon reflective practice and theological reflection methods but\u000a      more specifically in the\u000a      recognition of the importance of creative skills and imaginative resources\u000a      as a professional\u000a      resource for Chaplains. Reflective practice within the framework focuses\u000a      specifically on\u000a      understanding the various models of reflective practice and utilising\u000a      these to address case-related\u000a      issues and therapeutic relationships. Reflection is seen as a key element\u000a      of a chaplain's\u000a      professional development and ability to e.g. understand how belief systems\u000a      and practice inter-\u000a      relate; how to reconcile personal beliefs with those of others,\u000a      particularly how one's own belief\u000a      system may affect the attitudes and behaviour of people using the\u000a      chaplaincy service; and how to\u000a      build professional relationships with vulnerable people in traumatic\u000a      circumstances.\u000a    In 2009, the framework was adopted by NHS England, and the UK Board of\u000a      Healthcare Chaplaincy\u000a      (UKBHC) released a statement saying that they \"recognised the vision,\u000a      experience and expertise\u000a      of NHS Education for Scotland (NES) in the preparation and publication of\u000a      a capability and\u000a      competency framework and is grateful for their permission to adopt and\u000a      reprint this document as a\u000a      framework for healthcare chaplaincy throughout the UK.\" In 2010, the Welsh\u000a      Assembly adopted\u000a      the same framework: \"These competences and capabilities have been adapted\u000a      from the `Spiritual\u000a      and Religious Care Capabilities and Competences for Healthcare Chaplains'\u000a      (NHS Education\u000a      Scotland, 2007). The Welsh Assembly Government acknowledges with thanks\u000a      the support and\u000a      permission of NHS Education Scotland to use and adapt these competences\u000a      and capabilities.\"\u000a    Implementation of the framework on the ground continues to be supported\u000a      by Walton's\u000a      presentations and training sessions at key sectoral events. For example,\u000a      she presented a session\u000a      on `Narrative, Trauma and Identity' at the 2009 National Conference of\u000a      Healthcare Chaplains,\u000a      introducing methods of reflection that provide a basis for chaplains to\u000a      respond to traumatic events\u000a      and begin to use these through reflective exercises. She ran a similar\u000a      training day in Bristol in 2010\u000a      on `Narrative Methods of Theological Reflection'. In relation to the 2009\u000a      conference, the\u000a      Chaplaincy Team Leader of the NHS Dudley Group of Hospitals and then\u000a      President of the College\u000a      of Healthcare Chaplains gave the following feedback:\u000a    What you were able to do was go beyond the (prosaic) narrative\u000a        theology to the idea of poesis.\u000a        This paradigm leap in to poetry was to me revelatory. It hits its mark\u000a        because of the constant\u000a        encounter that I face with life shattering trauma, which often escapes\u000a        meaning. At least the\u000a        search for meaning is never satisfied except by through the encounter of\u000a        a caring self-\u000a        possessed other through which meaning can be experienced. When you said,\u000a        \"Trauma shatters\u000a        narrative\" and replaced it with poesis it opened up many dimensions....I\u000a        am able to introduce\u000a        others to narrative and poetic methods as I lead development days for\u000a        NHS staff called `Caring\u000a        Heart and Soul: A Refresher day to recover the path to the heart.' It\u000a        introduces our chaplaincy\u000a        volunteers (as well as an increasing number of Queens Foundation and\u000a        post-ordination\u000a        trainees) to the principle of such theological reflection methods.\u000a    The NHS Scotland Manager for Education Projects in Spiritual Care created\u000a      a three-year\u000a      programme of ministerial training (pre-2008) that was `deeply influenced'\u000a      by Walton's research,\u000a      particularly `Passion and pain: conceiving theology out of infertility'\u000a      [1]. In 2013, he still finds that\u000a      many chaplains struggle to get beyond applied theology. In teaching\u000a        theological reflection and\u000a        in supervising I often refer chaplains to your article and encourage\u000a        them to `hear' the theology\u000a        that is present in the raw human experiences they encounter daily and\u000a        then, akin to what you\u000a        did, attempt to write a first person account which could end `this is\u000a        how theology is done'. The\u000a        results are not surprisingly variable in terms of end product but the\u000a        process provokes\u000a        transformative learning as stuck practice is interrupted with first\u000a        person insertion and the divine\u000a        presence is disclosed in hints and guesses.\u000a    The impact of Walton's focused work on reflective practice can also be\u000a      seen in the incidences of\u000a      healthcare professionals choosing to do their PhDs under her supervision\u000a      at Glasgow (5 since\u000a      2000).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    A professional framework, establishing core competencies for healthcare\u000a      chaplains, has been\u000a      shaped by the expertise of Glasgow-based researchers in practical theology\u000a      and reflective\u000a      practice. The framework provides clear bench marks for the training, work\u000a      and supervision of\u000a      approximately 4,000 full- and part-time healthcare chaplains working in\u000a      NHS hospitals and\u000a      healthcare facilities throughout the UK.

The correlation of reflection and practice is the\u000a      central problematic in practical\u000a      theology and Walton's distinctive academic background in theology,\u000a      literary theory, ministry\u000a      training and social research enabled her to make innovative links between\u000a      narrative theory,\u000a      ethnographic enquiry, life writing and pastoral care. Walton developed\u000a      forms of reflection that were\u000a      narrative in character and drew both upon the historical theological\u000a      traditions of spiritual biography\u000a      and the techniques of autoethnography and poetics. This particular\u000a      combination of reflective\u000a      techniques was innovative within her disciplinary area and proved\u000a      particularly fruitful method for\u000a      reflecting upon healthcare contexts. In complex and challenging\u000a      situations, pastoral practitioners\u000a      must wrestle with inherited beliefs and bring them into fresh and\u000a      meaningful conjunction with the\u000a      pastoral needs and personal questions of people in pain and enduring\u000a      intense suffering. The\u000a      creative and narrative approaches developed by Walton's research have\u000a      enabled healthcare\u000a      workers to find the resources to meet such challenges more effectively as\u000a      well as enabling them to\u000a      find meaningful ways of interpreting their own roles in such encounters.\u000a    Walton's early work (1993-2003) was undertaken in response to her own\u000a      experience of infertility\u000a      and the medical responses she encountered to this frequently neglected\u000a      problem [outputs 1 and 3\u000a      below]. The experiences of women have been occluded in the literature of\u000a      pastoral care and\u000a      Walton found it necessary to use narrative\/poetic processes in order to\u000a      bring her embodied\u000a      experiences into a fruitful encounter with theological thinking [outputs\u000a      1, 3 and 6]. While it was the\u000a      subject matter &#8212; the emphasis upon embodiment and the healthcare\u000a      environment &#8212; that initially\u000a      commended her work to healthcare professionals, it quickly became apparent\u000a      that Walton's\u000a      reflective techniques provided a creative means for Chaplaincy workers to\u000a      address important\u000a      dilemmas within their own professional practice [outputs 1, 2, 4 and 5].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"22022","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3865483","Name":"Argentina"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"},{"GeoNamesId":"630336","Name":"Belarus"},{"GeoNamesId":"3923057","Name":"Bolivia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"719819","Name":"Hungary"},{"GeoNamesId":"1643084","Name":"Indonesia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1733045","Name":"Malaysia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3489940","Name":"Jamaica"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"3562981","Name":"Cuba"},{"GeoNamesId":"1835841","Name":"South Korea"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"203312","Name":"Democratic Republic of the Congo"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Kim's research articulating mission as `finding out where the Holy Spirit\u000d\u000a      is at work and joining in'\u000d\u000a      has been fed into the churches worldwide through her leading role in two\u000d\u000a      major church-sponsored\u000d\u000a      activities: the Edinburgh 2010 project and the World Council of Churches'\u000d\u000a      Commission on World\u000d\u000a      Mission and Evangelism.

E2010 was\u000d\u000a      the centenary project\u000d\u000a      of the World Missionary Conference held in Edinburgh in 1910. This event\u000d\u000a      had been highly\u000d\u000a      significant both for the ecumenical movement and also for world mission\u000d\u000a      (Stanley, The World\u000d\u000a        Missionary Conference, Eerdmans, 2009, 5-7). Its centenary attracted\u000d\u000a      global and pan-ecclesial\u000d\u000a      interest. E2010 was sponsored and governed by a Council of mostly global\u000d\u000a      bodies including World\u000d\u000a      Council of Churches, Roman Catholic Church, World Evangelical Alliance,\u000d\u000a      and representatives of\u000d\u000a      Orthodox, Pentecostal and Indigenous churches. With the support of the\u000d\u000a      Study Process Monitoring\u000d\u000a      Group (SPMG), Kim put her pneumatologically-informed approach of `global\u000d\u000a      conversation' into\u000d\u000a      practice by leading a `poly-centric' process which brought together\u000d\u000a      research from roughly 20\u000d\u000a      university research institutes, 22 theological institutions, 18 academic\u000d\u000a      networks and 22 church and\u000d\u000a      mission organisations. Researchers and research groups were based in all\u000d\u000a      continents and in many\u000d\u000a      different countries, including, Australia, Argentina, Belarus, Bolivia,\u000d\u000a      Canada, Congo, Costa Rica,\u000d\u000a      Cuba, Denmark, Finland, France, Ghana, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India,\u000d\u000a      Indonesia, Italy,\u000d\u000a      Kenya, Malaysia, New Zealand, Norway, Singapore, South Africa, South\u000d\u000a      Korea, Sweden,\u000d\u000a      Switzerland, UK and USA. Kim edited the collaborative reports on nine main\u000d\u000a      themes to produce\u000d\u000a      the preparatory volume for the E2010 conference (Balia and Kim 2010).\u000d\u000a    The conference was held at the University of Edinburgh on 2-6 June 2010.\u000d\u000a      The 300 invited\u000d\u000a      delegates at the conference were chiefly leading representatives of the\u000d\u000a      church and mission bodies\u000d\u000a      who sponsored the project. Speakers and delegates interacted with the\u000d\u000a      reports and aimed to\u000d\u000a      crystalize their implications for action in the churches. The conference\u000d\u000a      provided an opportunity for\u000d\u000a      Kim to test whether her approach of `finding out where the Holy Spirit is\u000d\u000a      at work and joining in with\u000d\u000a      the Spirit' captured contemporary mission theology. During the conference,\u000d\u000a      she drafted the\u000d\u000a      Common Call of the conference, which is a condensed statement of\u000d\u000a      the main affirmations of the\u000d\u000a      different study groups and the only unified output from the process. It\u000d\u000a      was discussed constructively\u000d\u000a      in plenary, approved by representatives of each of the main church bodies\u000d\u000a      of the Council and\u000d\u000a      affirmed in worship at the closing service. The Call reflects the\u000d\u000a      theme of Joining in with the Spirit\u000d\u000a      (Kim 2009\/2012) in that it defines mission (opening paragraph) as `sharing\u000d\u000a      in God's mission of love\u000d\u000a      though the transforming power of the Holy Spirit'. Moreover, pneumatology\u000d\u000a      is used to justify an\u000d\u000a      affirming mission that extends to the whole creation, diverse peoples and\u000d\u000a      cultures, involving unity,\u000d\u000a      healing, gifts, sharing and empowerment, and at the same time includes\u000d\u000a      discernment in the form of\u000d\u000a      truth-telling and power encounter.\u000d\u000a    For sheer variety of denominations and nationalities, Edinburgh 2010 was\u000d\u000a      hailed as a `watershed\u000d\u000a      moment... the first time in almost 100 years that the Christian family has\u000d\u000a      met together like this'\u000d\u000a      (Archbishop John Sentamu, Anglican, York). The Common Call stands\u000d\u000a      as an inclusive statement\u000d\u000a      of the intention of the churches to witness to Christ together (Archbishop\u000d\u000a      Mario Conti, RC,\u000d\u000a      Glasgow). It was disseminated to the churches through the sponsoring\u000d\u000a      bodies and has been\u000d\u000a      translated into at least 10 other languages. It was immediately taken up\u000d\u000a      by the world Christian\u000d\u000a      press (e.g. Christian Post, Ecumenical News, Catholic World News) as a\u000d\u000a      renewed commitment to\u000d\u000a      mission. The archives of E2010 are held in the University of Edinburgh and\u000d\u000a      will doubtless be\u000d\u000a      revisited on future anniversaries.\u000d\u000a    World Council of Churches\u000d\u000a    From 2007 to 2013, Kim served on the Commission on World Mission and\u000d\u000a      Evangelism (CWME) of\u000d\u000a      the World Council of Churches (WCC). During this time she chaired the\u000d\u000a      drafting committee for the\u000d\u000a      main work of CWME: a new position statement on mission and evangelism for\u000d\u000a      the WCC.\u000d\u000a      The WCC brings together 349 national churches, denominations and church\u000d\u000a      fellowships in more\u000d\u000a      than 110 countries and territories throughout the world (www.oikoumene.org).\u000d\u000a      It represents over\u000d\u000a      560 million Orthodox and Protestant Christians. It has a formal working\u000d\u000a      relationship with the\u000d\u000a      Roman Catholic Church and growing collaboration with Evangelical and\u000d\u000a      Pentecostal churches. The\u000d\u000a      drafting committee for the new statement was tasked with bringing together\u000d\u000a      the findings of the\u000d\u000a      mission conference in Athens 2005 (www.mission2005.org;\u000d\u000a      at which Kim was an advisor and a\u000d\u000a      plenary speaker), the Edinburgh 2010 project and some other WCC-related\u000d\u000a      work. The only\u000d\u000a      previous WCC position statement on mission and evangelism was adopted in\u000d\u000a      1982. It used a\u000d\u000a      christological framework and the motif of the kingdom of God predominated.\u000d\u000a      In her role as chair,\u000d\u000a      Kim was mandated to bring her expertise in theology of the Holy Spirit to\u000d\u000a      bear to develop a\u000d\u000a      pneumatological perspective in the new statement.\u000d\u000a    The drafting of Together Towards Life: Mission and Evangelism in\u000d\u000a        Changing Landscapes began at\u000d\u000a      the Commission meeting in Bangalore in October 2008 and was continued by\u000d\u000a      working groups and\u000d\u000a      through a series of drafting group meetings until March 2012. By\u000d\u000a      invitation of the working groups,\u000d\u000a      Kim gave direct input from her research to three of the four main sections\u000d\u000a      of the document -\u000d\u000a      mission and pneumatology (Joining in with the Spirit, chapter 2;\u000d\u000a      meeting in Manila, July 2011),\u000d\u000a      church and mission (chapter 10; Switzerland, May 2011), and mission\u000d\u000a      spirituality (chapter 9;\u000d\u000a      Jamaica, May 2011). Furthermore, together with the Moderator of the\u000d\u000a      Commission, Metropolitan\u000d\u000a      Geevarghese Mor Coorilose and the Commission Secretary, Revd Dr Jooeop\u000d\u000a      Keum, she finalised\u000d\u000a      the introduction and conclusion. Kim chaired all the drafting committee\u000d\u000a      meetings and checked all\u000d\u000a      the drafts up to the final one. In this way she ensured that, in keeping\u000d\u000a      with her research: (1) the\u000d\u000a      whole document was cast in an explicitly pneumatologically defined\u000d\u000a      framework; (2) `joining in with\u000d\u000a      the Spirit' was the overriding theme (the phrase itself occurs in\u000d\u000a      concluding para. 110); (3) the\u000d\u000a      reference to `spirit' was plural as well as singular; (4) the ecclesiology\u000d\u000a      section was missional; (5)\u000d\u000a      the approach of affirming and discerning of spirits was clearly expressed\u000d\u000a      (especially the section on\u000d\u000a      `Spiritual gifts and discernment', paras 24-28).\u000d\u000a    In March 2012, Kim presented the draft statement to the WCC conference on\u000d\u000a      mission and\u000d\u000a      evangelism in Manila, where approximately 250 invited representatives from\u000d\u000a      church and mission\u000d\u000a      organisations studied and commented on it. On 30 August 2012, she\u000d\u000a      presented a revised version\u000d\u000a      to the Central Committee of the WCC at their meeting in Crete, where it\u000d\u000a      was adopted as an official\u000d\u000a      WCC statement on Christian witness. Since it addresses the second of the\u000d\u000a      three main foci of the\u000d\u000a      work of the WCC (unity, witness and service), this statement will play a\u000d\u000a      key role in re-defining WCC\u000d\u000a      policy at the General Assembly in Busan, Korea in November 2013 (http:\/\/wcc2013.info\/en),\u000d\u000a      and\u000d\u000a      determining its activities in the next eight-year term and beyond. The\u000d\u000a      CWME Moderator will\u000d\u000a      present the new document to the General Assembly of about 4000 church\u000d\u000a      representatives as the\u000d\u000a      centre-piece of the plenary session on mission on 5 November 2013 in\u000d\u000a      Busan, Korea. (Kim will\u000d\u000a      moderate this session and is helping to prepare it). It is being actively\u000d\u000a      disseminated globally and\u000d\u000a      ecumenically at a church level, for example by a Practical Guide\u000d\u000a      to prepare delegates to the\u000d\u000a      Assembly. It has already been the subject of many discussions, including a\u000d\u000a      consultation with the\u000d\u000a      Roman Catholic Church and the basis of a European Ecumenical Study Course\u000d\u000a      (see WCC website\u000d\u000a      press reports). After the Assembly, Together Towards Life will be\u000d\u000a      the foundation for the\u000d\u000a      deliberations, outputs and actions of the new CWME. Like the 1982\u000d\u000a      statement, which endured for\u000d\u000a      30 years, the new document will be the key point of reference for anyone\u000d\u000a      wanting to know and\u000d\u000a      engage with the WCC approach to mission and evangelism. It is likely to be\u000d\u000a      required study for\u000d\u000a      training of church workers and education of clergy in mission.\u000d\u000a    Through her central roles as research coordinator of the Edinburgh 2010\u000d\u000a      project and her\u000d\u000a      leadership in drafting and presenting the new World Council of Churches\u000d\u000a      statement on mission and\u000d\u000a      evangelism, Kim's research on Christian pneumatology in global perspective\u000d\u000a      has directly and\u000d\u000a      significantly impacted the mission policy of the World Council of Churches\u000d\u000a      and the conduct of\u000d\u000a      mission in WCC-related churches and in other churches worldwide.

Her main\u000d\u000a      field of research is\u000d\u000a      Christian pneumatology in global perspective. While employed at Leeds\u000d\u000a      Trinity, Kim re-oriented her\u000d\u000a      previous research on `mission pneumatology' (Mission in the Spirit,\u000d\u000a      2003; The Holy Spirit in the\u000d\u000a        World, 2007) toward the implications for theology of mission of the\u000d\u000a      wider mission of the Spirit in the\u000d\u000a      whole creation and of the context of world Christianity (Kim &amp; Kim, Christianity\u000d\u000a        as a World Religion,\u000d\u000a      2008). Joining in with the Spirit: Connecting World Church and Local\u000d\u000a        Mission (2009) drew on\u000d\u000a      insights from the wide variety of Christian churches worldwide to present\u000d\u000a      a pneumatological\u000d\u000a      paradigm and framework for understanding mission in the twenty-first\u000d\u000a      century. The book\u000d\u000a      demonstrated how much contemporary British mission practice and mission\u000d\u000a      studies owe to\u000d\u000a      interaction with theologies from other global regions, encouraging `global\u000d\u000a      conversation' across the\u000d\u000a      many ecclesial and theological differences between churches. At the same\u000d\u000a      time it re-expressed\u000d\u000a      missio Dei in a pneumatological paradigm: `finding out where the\u000d\u000a      Holy Spirit is at work and joining\u000d\u000a      in' &#8212; and set all the main themes of the study of mission within a\u000d\u000a      pneumatological framework. On\u000d\u000a      the basis that, for Christians, the Spirit is both the Spirit of Creation\u000d\u000a      and also the Spirit of Christ,\u000d\u000a      Kim outlined a model of ecumenical collaboration in mission that both\u000d\u000a      affirms the Spirit at work in\u000d\u000a      creation, cultures and persons of many faiths and none and is, at the same\u000d\u000a      time, discerning of the\u000d\u000a      many spirits abroad and questioning of certain mission practices,\u000d\u000a      alliances and theologies.\u000d\u000a      On the strength of her scholarship and reputation for effectiveness in\u000d\u000a      international church circles,\u000d\u000a      Kim was invited to coordinate the research for the Edinburgh 2010 project\u000d\u000a      (E2010) from her base\u000d\u000a      at Leeds Trinity, which she did from January 2009 to March 2011. The E2010\u000d\u000a      marked the\u000d\u000a      centenary of the World Missionary Conference in Edinburgh in 1910 and was\u000d\u000a      based at the\u000d\u000a      University of Edinburgh. Kim co-edited the reports of the nine\u000d\u000a      international and inter-confessional\u000d\u000a      study groups as Witnessing to Christ Today (Balia &amp; Kim,\u000d\u000a      2010), which was the raw material for\u000d\u000a      the deliberations of the conference at the University of Edinburgh in June\u000d\u000a      2010. In invited articles,\u000d\u000a      Kim also analysed a century of mission theology and identified major\u000d\u000a      shifts. To give two examples:\u000d\u000a      `Mission Theology of the Church' (2010) outlined a dynamic and global\u000d\u000a      approach to ecclesiology,\u000d\u000a      based on the movement of the Spirit, which recognises that churches are\u000d\u000a      not only settled and\u000d\u000a      boundaried but also migrating and in mission. `Edinburgh 1910 to 2010:\u000d\u000a      From Kingdom to Spirit'\u000d\u000a      (2010) explained the contemporary prevalence of pneumatological language\u000d\u000a      over against the\u000d\u000a      predominant kingdom metaphor in 1910 as reflecting the different world\u000d\u000a      order in 2010. It further\u000d\u000a      suggested that contemporary discourse of the Spirit could nevertheless\u000d\u000a      mask continuing colonial\u000d\u000a      attitudes. To address this issue, she insisted that the Spirit, as the\u000d\u000a      Spirit of Christ, does not inspire\u000d\u000a      domination but `free and mutual [global] relations'.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"22127","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Hunt's research has contributed towards the personal and professional\u000a      development of\u000a      practitioners and those interested in spirituality\/meditation.

Her paper formed the basis of a weekend\u000a      study-retreat which\u000a      included worship and spiritual direction and involved around 25 lay\u000a      people. Her ability to explain\u000a      academic ideas to non-conventional students within a pastoral setting\u000a      engendered not only\u000a      learning but spiritual nourishment according to informal feedback from the\u000a      session; she was\u000a      therefore invited to join the Board of MONOS and asked to address the\u000a      annual retreat in 2012, and\u000a      to deliver a day's teaching on acedia in the desert and desert attitudes\u000a      to the body on 9 March\u000a      2013 for the certificate course, for which she acts as informal\u000a      educational advisor.

Her\u000a      main field of research is\u000a      the spirituality of the Early Eastern Christian church and issues of the\u000a      interplay of bodily and\u000a      spiritual aspects of the human person.\u000a    Hunt's research has established a continuum between the practice of\u000a      spiritual direction in the\u000a      desert fathers, its reinterpretation by the eleventh century abbot Symeon\u000a      the New Theologian (as a\u000a      paradigm for divine inspiration and mystical indwelling taking precedence\u000a      over ordination as the\u000a      benchmark of authority in the church) and its controversial manifestation\u000a      in the modern Orthodox\u000a      church. She started working on this theme for her MA dissertation in 1992\u000a      and has returned to it for\u000a      conference papers from 2007 onwards, resulting in the publication of `The\u000a      Reforming Abbot and\u000a      his Tears: Penthos in Late Byzantium' in 2009 and `Uses and Abuses of\u000a      Spiritual Authority in the\u000a      Church in St Symeon the New Theologian' in 2012, for which she was\u000a      especially requested to\u000a      research a contentious example of spiritual direction in the monastery of\u000a      St Anthony in the Sonoran\u000a      Desert of Arizona, where Elder Ephraim was accused (as Symeon the New\u000a      Theologian was a\u000a      millennium ago) of fostering a cult rather than engaging in genuine\u000a      spiritual fatherhood. The issue\u000a      also forms a substantial part of the argument contained in her current\u000a      monograph under contract\u000a      with Brill, An Unholy Trinity: Models of sacred and secular authority\u000a        in Eleventh Century Byzantium\u000a      (forthcoming 2014).\u000a    She is notably one of very few scholars working in this field who is not\u000a      an ordained Eastern\u000a      Christian cleric and as such brings a level of objectivity to the subject\u000a      as being of interest to church\u000a      historians as well as members of the parish and monastery. She asserts the\u000a      importance of the\u000a      Evagrian quality of discernment in determining whether a spiritual\u000a      `father' offers genuine spiritual\u000a      guidance or an arrogantly assumed psychological hold over a needy\u000a      spiritual `child'. Symeon\u000a      insists on the presence of spiritual and real tears as a marker of the\u000a      spiritual enlightenment\u000a      essential in order to offer guidance to a spiritual child. Hunt shows how\u000a      this theme dominates the\u000a      writings of Symeon which have influenced subsequent spiritual directors\u000a      within the Orthodox\u000a      church as well as providing the basis for a major upheaval in the\u000a      Byzantine church of his day. The\u000a      controversial nature of the practice and the insistence on the mystical\u000a      insight of the spiritual father\u000a      had been explored by scholars writing on the Desert Fathers and also\u000a      modern spiritual direction,\u000a      notably Deacon John Chryssavgis' Soul Mending: The Art of Spiritual\u000a        Direction (Brookline, 2000)\u000a      and Hieromont Alexander Golitzin's writings on the subject for St\u000a        Vladimir's Theological Quarterly\u000a      and from a more secular viewpoint by Olga Louchakova, writing in The\u000a        Humanist Psychologist in\u000a      2003. Hunt distinguishes between the psychological aspects of penitence\u000a      and personal growth and\u000a      biblically based experiences of spiritual parenting. She notes that\u000a      contemporary forms of media\u000a      such as YouTube, local radio and Facebook are used to air the issue as\u000a      well as potentially to offer\u000a      remote access forms of spiritual direction to modern Christians.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"22136","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Indicators of the impact and benefit of Lincoln's research in\u000d\u000a      these areas include invitations to lecture to those training for church\u000d\u000a      ministry, clergy, teachers and members of the general public,\u000d\u000a      recommendations to such groups by writers in journals and blogs about the\u000d\u000a      outstanding value of his work for responsible preaching and teaching and a\u000d\u000a      significant number of unsolicited emails from those who have employed his\u000d\u000a      work in preaching or appreciated its enhancement of their understanding.\u000d\u000a      Links to aspects of it also regularly feature on the text this week,\u000d\u000a      a lectionary and Scripture study resource, one of the most influential\u000d\u000a      Christian websites in the USA, generating two million hits a month mainly\u000d\u000a      from ministers and educators.\u000d\u000a    The Truth on Trial monograph generated email correspondence from\u000d\u000a      seminary students in the USA for whom it had been assigned as a set text,\u000d\u000a      enthusiastic recommendations on internet sites, and quotations being\u000d\u000a      reproduced in lectionary studies for preachers.

His videos on John for A-Level students\u000d\u000a      have also been noted and recommended by bloggers on biblical studies.\u000d\u000a    Lincoln's commentary on Colossians is regularly listed as among\u000d\u000a      the best available and frequently recommended for its usefulness for\u000d\u000a      teaching and preaching; pastors have sent emails expressing appreciation\u000d\u000a      for its help; and extensive quotations from it have been used, for\u000d\u000a      example, as the basis for Bible study materials in Lutheran dioceses in\u000d\u000a      the USA and in sermons for Earth Sunday, 2009.

Lincoln proposes ways of\u000d\u000a      being critically honest about the nature of the texts while negotiating\u000d\u000a      creedal statements on the birth of Jesus in a contemporary context.\u000d\u000a      Various parts of the research were presented, for example, to an audience\u000d\u000a      of students, faculty, clergy and members of the public in the Ethel M.\u000d\u000a      Wood annual lecture on the English Bible at King's College, London (March,\u000d\u000a      2009) and to the general audience of the Vacation Term for Biblical\u000d\u000a      Studies in Oxford in five lectures (August, 2011). One of the clergy\u000d\u000a      present for the Oxford course later sent a copy of the sermon he had\u000d\u000a      preached on the Sunday before Christmas, incorporating insights from the\u000d\u000a      lectures. Lincoln's recent JBL article on Luke has led to his\u000d\u000a      being commissioned to write a more popular article in this area for the Biblical\u000d\u000a        Archaeological Review, a magazine with a worldwide subscription for\u000d\u000a      a broad general audience eager to understand the world of the Bible\u000d\u000a      better. His very recent book on the overall topic of the virgin birth has\u000d\u000a      already attracted enthusiastic attention from bloggers and others both\u000d\u000a      before and after its publication.\u000d\u000a    The implications of Lincoln's research on the concept of koinonia\u000d\u000a      in Paul's Letters were presented as a keynote address to the Porvoo\u000d\u000a      Conference (a consultation between the Church of England and the state\u000d\u000a      churches of Northern Europe) on Ethics and Communion (January, 2008). This\u000d\u000a      contribution received a favourable mention in a more popular article in\u000d\u000a      the Church Times, because of its relevance to present problems\u000d\u000a      within the Anglican Communion, and led to participation in the Church of\u000d\u000a      England's further consultation with the German State Lutheran Church under\u000d\u000a      the Meissen Agreement in D&#252;sseldorf (November, 2008) on the topic of \"The\u000d\u000a      Authority and Uses of the Bible in the Life of the Churches.\"\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Lincoln's research treats historical, literary, theological and\u000d\u000a      hermeneutical issues in New Testament studies.

Four main areas\u000d\u000a      of his work since then have been selected as generating broader impact.\u000d\u000a      The first is the Gospel of John, on which he has written a major\u000d\u000a      monograph, Truth on Trial (research for which began elsewhere but\u000d\u000a      the writing of which was completed in 2000 after his move to the\u000d\u000a      University of Gloucestershire), a major commentary, The Gospel\u000d\u000a        according to St. John (2005), and a number of journal articles and\u000d\u000a      essays. These have established him as one of the foremost international\u000d\u000a      scholars on the Gospel of John and on issues such as its distinctiveness\u000d\u000a      in relation to the Synoptic Gospels, its historicity, its literary and\u000d\u000a      thematic structure, its place in early Christianity and relation to Second\u000d\u000a      Temple Judaism, its influential Christology, and its ongoing role in\u000d\u000a      Jewish-Christian relationships and in shaping the Christian theological\u000d\u000a      tradition.\u000d\u000a    A second major area of research has been the birth of Jesus. Here Lincoln\u000d\u000a      has written an essay on some of the critical and hermeneutical issues in\u000d\u000a      relating the New Testament to contemporary understandings of conception\u000d\u000a      and to the church's creeds (2007) and given papers that resulted in two\u000d\u000a      detailed journal articles on the interpretation of Matthew's and Luke's\u000d\u000a      annunciation accounts (2012; 2013). His work has involved investigation,\u000d\u000a      among other matters, of the genre of birth narratives, the diversity of\u000d\u000a      New Testament perspectives on the conception of Jesus, and ancient\u000d\u000a      understandings of procreation. He has undertaken further research and\u000d\u000a      given lectures on how and why the virginal conception tradition became the\u000d\u000a      dominant one in the period up to Augustine, how it came under scrutiny\u000d\u000a      from Schleiermacher onwards and what the implications of contemporary\u000d\u000a      notions of biology are for scriptural interpretation and Christology. Lincoln's\u000d\u000a      research, papers and public lectures in this area have now culminated in a\u000d\u000a      comprehensive monograph Born of a Virgin? Reconceiving Jesus in the\u000d\u000a        Bible, Tradition and Theology (2013) published in the UK and the\u000d\u000a      USA.\u000d\u000a    A third area is the study of the letter to the Colossians, one of the\u000d\u000a      disputed later Pauline letters. Lincoln has explored questions\u000d\u000a      about the letter's pseudonymity, its relation to the thought of the\u000d\u000a      undisputed Paul, its cosmic Christology and the nature of the spiritual\u000d\u000a      wisdom it advocates for its readers and produced a substantial commentary,\u000d\u000a      \"The Letter to the Colossians\" (2000).\u000d\u000a    Finally, a further piece of underpinning research should be mentioned.\u000d\u000a      With an eye on present disputes in the Anglican Communion, the Church of\u000d\u000a      England's Council for Christian Unity commissioned Lincoln to\u000d\u000a      write a paper on the concept of koinonia or communion in Paul's\u000d\u000a      letters. Among the results of this work were a critique of the way in\u000d\u000a      which much ecumenical literature has appropriated the concept and a\u000d\u000a      proposal for a more adequate way of appealing to and interpreting the New\u000d\u000a      Testament material. This research was published as an article in the\u000d\u000a      peer-reviewed journal Ecclesiology (2009).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"22138","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"248816","Name":"Jordan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    A. Religious impact\u000a    Raphael's post-Holocaust theological engagement has continued to reach a\u000a      national and international audience through featuring in online blogs (see\u000a      5 A i-v) and broadcasts such as Radio 4's Beyond Belief in 2009\u000a      and Radio 4's prestigious Lent Talks that are given annually by a\u000a      variety of `household-name' figures, with several million listeners\u000a      nationally and worldwide (8 and 11\/4\/09) (see 5 A vi-vii.)\u000a    The presentation of a theology of love in The Female Face of God in\u000a        Auschwitz led to Raphael's keynote lecture at the University of\u000a      Oxford's interfaith symposium on Abrahamic theologies of love, co-hosted\u000a      by HRH Prince Ghazi bin Muhammad of Jordan (13\/10\/12). The audience for\u000a      the event (which was recorded for television) was over a hundred clergy\u000a      and community leaders working to improve interfaith relations between the\u000a      Abrahamic faiths in the UK and abroad.\u000a    B. Cultural impact\u000a    Raphael has enabled the public to re-examine their previous understanding\u000a      of Jewish attitudes to the visual dimension by introducing them to her and\u000a      others' new thinking about Jewish art and its theology of images.\u000a    The centrepiece of her 2008 Sherman Lectures on Jewish Art (hosted by the\u000a      University of Manchester and open to the public) was a lecture given to a\u000a      non-academic audience covering the whole denominational spectrum of\u000a      Manchester's Jewish community (see 5 B. i). In 2010 Raphael gave a lecture\u000a      on Jewish art at Birmingham Progressive Synagogue's contribution to the\u000a      `European Days of Culture and Heritage' which led, soon afterwards, to her\u000a      series of lectures on Jewish art for `Mosaic' - a Birmingham-based Jewish\u000a      Studies evening class for people without formal Jewish education.\u000a      Professor Raphael's appointment as Oxford University's Walter Hussey\u000a      Lecturer in the Church and the Arts in 2011-12, previously held by\u000a      well-known artists such as the composer John Tavener, allowed her to\u000a      challenge widespread misconceptions about Judaism as an iconophobic\u000a      tradition and introduce people to its history of counter-idolatrous\u000a      image-making. 2012 also saw her give paradigm-shifting lectures at an\u000a      Oxford University Continuing Education Day School; a non credit-bearing\u000a      Woolf Institute Interfaith Day School for clergy, NGOs and other\u000a      non-academics. Raphael was invited in early 2013 to join a team of\u000a      academic consultants for an architect-designed `Tri-Faith Space' in\u000a      Regent's Park, London, furthering the cause of interfaith relationships\u000a      through a common space for worship.\u000a    Professor Raphael's capacity to make new research accessible and even\u000a      entertaining has been evident in television and broadcasts to national\u000a      audiences such as that given on [Stephen] Fry's English Delight\u000a      (25\/8\/11) (see 5 B ii). Consequently, new thinking about religion and\u000a      culture has been disseminated through talks to Gloucestershire societies\u000a      such as The Cheltenham Interfaith Group and The Newman Society with\u000a      audiences of about thirty to fifty people, many of whom are retired or are\u000a      working outside the religious field.\u000a    C. Political impact\u000a    After the publication of her work on Holocaust theology, Raphael was\u000a      appointed by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 2004 as the British\u000a      Representative (academic) on the International Taskforce on Holocaust\u000a      Remembrance, Education and Research, advising government ministers on the\u000a      commemoration of genocidal atrocities and assessing bids for films and\u000a      journalistic training on genocide-related topics. This governmental\u000a      recognition of the authoritative role she has played in recent research on\u000a      the dangerous intersection of sexual inequality and racism led to her\u000a      being invited by The Imperial War Museum London to give a talk on sexual\u000a      violence against Jewish Women during the Holocaust in December 2010, as\u000a      well as to broadcast on Woman's Hour (Radio 4, 26\/4\/12 and\u000a      repeated on the weekend omnibus) and UCB Ireland's Sky Digital News\u000a      on 28\/4\/12.\u000a    D. Educational impact\u000a    The publication of Judaism and the Visual Image in 2009 has\u000a      influenced the content of ordination training (and thereby pulpit\u000a      preaching) through day schools on Jewish art given for Jewish (Reform) and\u000a      Christian (Ecumenical) ministerial ordinands such as in March, 2010 at the\u000a      Queen's Foundation, Birmingham, and in February 2011, at the Leo Baeck\u000a      College's programme for rabbinical training, London. Raphael's\u000a      contribution to post-Holocaust theology is taught in rabbinical seminaries\u000a      from Seminario Rab&#237;nico Latinoamericano in Buenos Aires (but serving the\u000a      whole Latin American region) to the Jewish Theological Seminary in New\u000a      York, and the Leo Baeck College in London.\u000a    The DVD The Problem of Evil (2005), which includes Raphael\u000a      presenting a feminist theodicy of the Holocaust, remains a key resource\u000a      for schools' A Level courses. On the strength of her name in this area,\u000a      she was invited to write the BBC Religion and Ethics Online Learning\u000a      article: `Feminism and Judaism' (2012). These contributions help teachers\u000a      to introduce feminist theological ideas not normally prominent in the\u000a      curriculum to many cohorts of school pupils across the UK (see 5 D.i.).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Raphael's research into the theological meaning of women's\u000a      experience during the Holocaust, the Jewishness of Jewish Art and\u000a      idol-breaking as a key tool in the criticism of contemporary culture has\u000a      had religious, cultural, political and educational impact outside the\u000a      Higher Education academy.

Both of the cycles of\u000a      research of which these were a part were begun and completed while she was\u000a      in post at the University of Gloucestershire.\u000a    \u000a\u0009   Raphael's monograph The Female Face of God in Auschwitz\u000a      (2003), shortlisted for the Koret Jewish Book Award in 2004 and with sales\u000a      of almost 2,000 copies to date, was written in the conviction that\u000a      reflection on Jewish women's experience can offer a more nuanced\u000a      theological account of the holocaustal presence and absence of God than\u000a      that of androcentric theology alone. The book and a number of related\u000a      articles brought into conversation Jewish feminist theology, classic\u000a      Jewish texts and historical and biographical accounts of women's\u000a      experiences in the camps and ghettos. The purpose of the research was to\u000a      enlarge the canon of authoritative Holocaust texts and question the\u000a      dominant post-Holocaust assumption that God's absence or hiddenness during\u000a      the catastrophe was a necessary deferral to human freedom. While\u000a      post-Holocaust theology has tended to assume that human dignity is\u000a      predicated on autonomy and that such can only be secured if God does not\u000a      intervene in the causal processes of human choice, Raphael found that the\u000a      memoir literature suggests that the survival of women's humanity (though\u000a      rarely their physical survival) was invested not in the preservation of\u000a      autonomy, but in the degree to which they were obligated to others.\u000a    The recurrent theme in women's Holocaust memoirs is how relations of love\u000a      or care to the familial and quasi-familial suffering other could be\u000a      maintained in circumstances designed to dehumanise and murder its victims.\u000a      It was women's narration of the sustenance of a kind of covenantal love\u000a      that seemed to Raphael to present a counter-narrative not only to that of\u000a      androcentric, anti-redemptive Holocaust historiography, but to most\u000a      post-Holocaust theology as well. If restorative human care (acts of tikkun)\u000a      continued to make the world fit for God's presence as the Shekhinah or\u000a      grieving divine mother, then the covenantal relationship between God and\u000a      Israel was not broken or suspended by Auschwitz, but went on in spite of\u000a      it. Raphael's arguments addressed a wide public interest in the lesser\u000a      known experiences of women in the death and concentration camps, in\u000a      spiritual resistance to dehumanization, and how one might be able to talk\u000a      as a Jew, without a theology of the cross, about divine presence to\u000a      suffering.\u000a    Raphael's book Judaism and the Visual Image: A Jewish Theology of\u000a        Art (Continuum, 2009) was inspired by recent Jewish cultural\u000a      historian's findings that legal interpretations of the Second Commandment\u000a      have been less restrictive than previously supposed. Rather than offer a\u000a      history of Jewish art or an inventory of pictures with Jewish religious\u000a      content, Raphael's study explored how modern Jewish art, figurative as\u000a      well as abstract, arises in a positive and fruitful negotiation with the\u000a      Second Commandment, not in spite or neglect of it.\u000a\u0009  \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24030","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1168579","Name":"Pakistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The importance of the Wode Psalter project is immediately visible in\u000d\u000a      reactions to the exhibition and related activities such as the concert and\u000d\u000a      the workshops from informed observers.\u000d\u000a    The Wode Part Books were `initially the work of Thomas Wode, a monk and\u000d\u000a      cleric from St Andrews, who was commissioned to produce a series of\u000d\u000a      harmonisations of psalm tunes for a protestant Scottish Psalter.

The Anglo-Genevan legacy\u000d\u000a      brought Scotland its first metrical psalter developing into a\u000d\u000a      psalm-singing tradition that has remained part of Scottish life and spread\u000d\u000a      across the English-speaking world. The Wode Partbooks provided one special\u000d\u000a      example of the first metrical psalter. These eight illustrated and\u000d\u000a      annotated manuscripts written by Thomas Wode (d. 1592) are one of\u000d\u000a      Scotland's cultural treasures, containing a high proportion of the\u000d\u000a      country's surviving early music. Having been dispersed (Washington DC,\u000d\u000a      London, Dublin and Edinburgh), research on the Psalter has been difficult\u000d\u000a      and displaying the Partbooks together for the first time since the 17th\u000d\u000a      century and providing a digital record was one aim of the research\u000d\u000a      project, `The world of Reformation Britain as seen and heard in the Wode\u000d\u000a      Psalter' (2009-2012).\u000d\u000a    Dawson's historical insights and multidisciplinary approach underpinned\u000d\u000a      that project and were reflected in much of the interpretative material\u000d\u000a      within the Singing the Reformation exhibition and booklet. The\u000d\u000a      research collaboration between Dawson and Mrs Nancy Bailey, a Renaissance\u000d\u000a      stitching expert, produced four research-based stitched exhibits which\u000d\u000a      were central to the exhibition's domestic section, entitled `Hamely with\u000d\u000a      God', linking singing and religious instruction to embroidery, painted\u000d\u000a      interiors and plant decorations. Other parts of the exhibition revealed\u000d\u000a      how the psalms played a central part in Scottish worship and devotion, as\u000d\u000a      well as in literature and poetry, particularly at the court of James VI.\u000d\u000a      Singing inside and outside church helped spread Reformed ideas and\u000d\u000a      practice within a non-literate society and assisted in the creation of a\u000d\u000a      Scottish identity. The Gaelic dimension was demonstrated through John\u000d\u000a      Carswell's versification of the Lord's Prayer found in the first book\u000d\u000a      printed in Gaelic [his Foirm 1567], a volume discussed in Dawson's\u000d\u000a      earlier research. Previously established connections between Thomas Wode,\u000d\u000a      George Buchanan and Regent Moray underlay the sections featuring these\u000d\u000a      individuals and their context within the Reformation in St Andrews. The\u000d\u000a      entire exhibition used the Wode Psalter research to demonstrate the\u000d\u000a      interconnecting layers of early modern Scottish culture with no sharp\u000d\u000a      boundaries between religion and other aspects of life.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24031","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The reach of this project was trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific with\u000d\u000a      Northcott providing over 100 presentations to religious and community\u000d\u000a      groups in the UK, US, Australia, and Southeast Asia.

The scientific\u000d\u000a      revolution, and the Enlightenment, involved the construction of a division\u000d\u000a      of labour between the sciences and the humanities, and the splitting of\u000d\u000a      natural from human history and climate from culture. This made the\u000d\u000a      scientific claim that human behaviours and values influence the\u000d\u000a      climate implausible to modern ears. But to faith communities shaped by\u000d\u000a      ancient texts &#8212; such as those of the Hebrew Prophets and New Testament\u000d\u000a      apocalyptic &#8212; the scientific claim that excessive use of fossil fuels\u000d\u000a      impacts the climates of Bangladeshi fishers or African farmers, or of\u000d\u000a      future generations, is more plausible. This is because justice in these\u000d\u000a      texts is not only a human virtue but a divinely given quality which is\u000d\u000a      situated in creaturely relations below the heavens. `Climate justice'\u000d\u000a      therefore has purchase in Christian ethics and rituals which it lacks in\u000d\u000a      cultures in which ethics and morality are seen as purely human constructs\u000d\u000a      and not as part of the structure of the cosmos.\u000d\u000a    In A Moral Climate Northcott argues that the apprehension of the\u000d\u000a      climate as interactive with human (and creaturely) behaviours acquires\u000d\u000a      traction in the traditional rituals of faith communities &#8212; around\u000d\u000a      pilgrimage (mobility), sanctuary (dwelling) and eucharist (eating and\u000d\u000a      drinking). Such rituals have the potential to shape more sustainable\u000d\u000a      approaches to mobility, the built environment, and agriculture, land use\u000d\u000a      and food production and use, which are the three principal sources of\u000d\u000a      anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Northcott has gone on to explore this\u000d\u000a      potential in more detail in subsequent papers and in a monograph treatment\u000d\u000a      of the political theology of climate change (2013).\u000d\u000a    The 2007 book received early and favourable reviews in the church press\u000d\u000a      and on the internet &#8212; e.g. by the prominent biologist and former curator\u000d\u000a      of Kew Gardens Sir Ghillean Prance in The Church Times, and by\u000d\u000a      theologian Sam Wells in the influential magazine Christianity Today\u000d\u000a      in the USA. The wide take up and favourable notices of the book led to\u000d\u000a      many public speaking invitations on the ethics of climate change in the\u000d\u000a      UK, and in Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, the United States from 2008 -\u000d\u000a      2012. In over a hundred presentations Northcott `performed' the research\u000d\u000a      in a range of denominations, churches, public fora, and scholarly\u000d\u000a      gatherings using PowerPoint as well as traditional communication devices\u000d\u000a      including sermons and debates.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24032","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6290252","Name":"Serbia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3202326","Name":"Croatia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3277605","Name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Early discussions in project planning involving Edinburgh researchers\u000d\u000a      established that\u000d\u000a      research on the religious framings of conflict resolution of project\u000d\u000a      members was not widely\u000d\u000a      known, and had not been tested in areas affected by religiously-linked\u000d\u000a      violence.

The research identifies religion not only as a source of\u000d\u000a      conflict but as a\u000d\u000a      potent factor in the restraint of violence, and in mediation and\u000d\u000a      peacebuilding in post-conflict\u000d\u000a      settings.\u000d\u000a    Mitchell's research reveals the role of media and public communication\u000d\u000a      technologies in the\u000d\u000a      instigation of civil conflicts, and their potential in peacebuilding. It\u000d\u000a      sheds light on how\u000d\u000a      individuals and communities remember and reframe violence (3.1). Certain\u000d\u000a      kinds of\u000d\u000a      memorialization and reporting can contribute to ongoing cycles of\u000d\u000a      violence. For example,\u000d\u000a      Second World War news footage was recycled over five decades later to keep\u000d\u000a      `dangerous\u000d\u000a      memories' of past wrongs in the Balkans alive. Subsequent research\u000d\u000a      demonstrated how\u000d\u000a      sermons, posters, murals, films, radio broadcasts and cartoons have all\u000d\u000a      been used in an\u000d\u000a      attempt to encourage populations to fear, to fight the `other', or even to\u000d\u000a      kill `others' for a\u000d\u000a      putative greater good.\u000d\u000a    Research has also investigated closely the interface of religion and\u000d\u000a      violence. For example,\u000d\u000a      Mitchell (3.2) has investigated religiously-motivated strategies to break\u000d\u000a      such cycles of\u000d\u000a      violence. O'Donovan's research (3.5) on `Just War' reveals the role of\u000d\u000a      religion in ethical and\u000d\u000a      legal framings of conflict and violence which restrain violence and war.\u000d\u000a      Meanwhile the\u000d\u000a      research undertaken by Clegg (3.3, 3.4) and Wilkes (3.6, 3.7) reveals the\u000d\u000a      role of religion in\u000d\u000a      mediation, peacebuilding and the repair of communities and societies\u000d\u000a      affected by violence\u000d\u000a      and war.\u000d\u000a    Taken together, this body of research demonstrates that religious\u000d\u000a      framings and religious\u000d\u000a      ethics are central to the task of addressing the roots of violent\u000d\u000a      conflict, of transforming cycles\u000d\u000a      of violence and of healing the consequences of violence and war linked to\u000d\u000a      ethnic and\u000d\u000a      religious identities.\u000d\u000a    The research findings are mobilized by Wilkes, supported by the Project\u000d\u000a      Team which\u000d\u000a      includes Mitchell as PI, Clegg and O'Donovan as Project Advisors, and\u000d\u000a      local researchers in\u000d\u000a      Bosnia-Herzegovina, in an empirical action-research project (funded by an\u000d\u000a      anonymous\u000d\u000a      UK\/Dutch trust &#163;205k, 2010-15). The project adopted a grounded theory\u000d\u000a      approach which\u000d\u000a      enabled research subjects to identify a range of independent variables in\u000d\u000a      the roots of\u000d\u000a      conflict, and in mediation and reconciliation projects and efforts. The\u000d\u000a      research revealed that\u000d\u000a      although development agencies and local academics have adopted the\u000d\u000a      negative\u000d\u000a      characterisation of religion as a source of conflict, civil society\u000d\u000a      groups, members of religious\u000d\u000a      communities, teachers and others believe that religion remains a potential\u000d\u000a      source of moral\u000d\u000a      values and trust and hence represents a crucial resource in mediation,\u000d\u000a      peace-building and\u000d\u000a      community reconstruction.

A commitment (embodied in the `Common Call' issued by the conference)\u000d\u000a      to work together in\u000d\u000a      developing patterns of theological education that transcend traditional\u000d\u000a      boundaries and\u000d\u000a      incorporate the contributions of the rapidly proliferating Pentecostal and\u000d\u000a      new Southern churches,\u000d\u000a      many of which now have a substantial diasporic presence in the northern\u000d\u000a      hemisphere. This\u000d\u000a      commitment emerged from the study process.

Heightened\u000d\u000a      awareness of the Asian role at EWMC 1910 as revealed by Stanley's\u000d\u000a      monograph (3.4) informed\u000d\u000a      the numerous and vocal contributions of non-Western Christian leaders to\u000d\u000a      both the study\u000d\u000a      process and the conference itself, and gave non-Western delegates to the\u000d\u000a      2010 conference a\u000d\u000a      heightened sense that EWMC 1910 was part of their own Christian history,\u000d\u000a      not merely that of the\u000d\u000a      Western churches.\u000d\u000a    Study Process\u000d\u000a    This was initiated in 2008 bringing together, in an exercise of knowledge\u000d\u000a      co-creation, academics\u000d\u000a      and users of academic research. It included scholars of Christian history\u000d\u000a      and mission,\u000d\u000a      international church leaders and lay members, theological educators and\u000d\u000a      representatives of\u000d\u000a      ecumenical and mission agencies working together in nine international\u000d\u000a      study groups\u000d\u000a      (http:\/\/edinburgh2010.org\/en\/study-themes\/main-study-themes.html).\u000d\u000a      The groups, coordinated\u000d\u000a      from Edinburgh, met in representative locations on all continents and\u000d\u000a      studied the themes of 1.\u000d\u000a      Foundations for mission; 2. Christian mission among other faiths; 3.\u000d\u000a      Mission and\u000d\u000a      postmodernities; 4. Mission and power; 5. Forms of missionary engagement;\u000d\u000a      6.

Mission spirituality and authentic\u000d\u000a      discipleship. The report of\u000d\u000a      the nine study groups was published as Balia and Kim (5.1).\u000d\u000a    The most tangible impact discernible to date was achieved by the study\u000d\u000a      group on Theme 6,\u000d\u000a      `Theological Education and Formation' which produced a report, Theological\u000d\u000a        Education in World\u000d\u000a        Christianity (November 2009), recommending that a global handbook on\u000d\u000a      theological education\u000d\u000a      be prepared. This led to the publication of The Handbook of\u000d\u000a        Theological Education in World\u000d\u000a        Christianity, edited by four members of the group, Dietrich Werner,\u000d\u000a      David Esterline, Namsoon\u000d\u000a      Kang and Joshva Raja in 2010. This Handbook is the first attempt\u000d\u000a      to map and analyse\u000d\u000a      developments in theological education on a global scale. The volume, with\u000d\u000a      contributions from 98\u000d\u000a      leaders in theological education from around the world, provides a\u000d\u000a      comprehensive introduction to\u000d\u000a      the major themes and contexts in the international discourse on\u000d\u000a      theological education (5.3).\u000d\u000a      These publications were seminal in the development of the World Council of\u000d\u000a      Churches' Global\u000d\u000a      Survey on Theological Education 2011-2013. This was the first survey of\u000d\u000a      theological education\u000d\u000a      ever conducted which covered all branches of Christianity &#8212; Catholic,\u000d\u000a      Orthodox, mainline\u000d\u000a      Protestant, and evangelical Protestant (including Pentecostals). The role\u000d\u000a      of the Edinburgh 2010\u000d\u000a      Study Process and conference in this development is referenced in an\u000d\u000a      `Ecumenical Covenant on\u000d\u000a      Theological Education' endorsed by the WCC Central Committee in August\u000d\u000a      2012 which makes\u000d\u000a      explicit reference both to the 1910 conference and to the 2010 study\u000d\u000a      process and conference. In\u000d\u000a      this way, the study process brought together third sector leaders and\u000d\u000a      practitioners with academic\u000d\u000a      providers resulting in a commitment to reflect upon theological education\u000d\u000a      and set it on a more\u000d\u000a      inclusive and global trajectory that reflects the radically changing\u000d\u000a      composition of global\u000d\u000a      Christianity.\u000d\u000a    `Edinburgh 2010'\u000d\u000a    The conference to celebrate the centennial of EWMC 1910 was the\u000d\u000a      culmination of the\u000d\u000a      knowledge co-creation process of the study groups.

The\u000d\u000a      conference, hosted 2-6\u000d\u000a      June 2010 by the University of Edinburgh, was attended by 300 delegates\u000d\u000a      from 200 churches\u000d\u000a      and Christian organisations, who were members of 115 denominations,\u000d\u000a      represented 77\u000d\u000a      nationalities, and 62 mother tongues.\u000d\u000a    The conference culminated in a public celebration in the Assembly Hall of\u000d\u000a      the Church of\u000d\u000a      Scotland (the venue of the 1910 conference) attended by delegates and an\u000d\u000a      additional 800\u000d\u000a      members of the public, and web-streamed live (5.4). The address was given\u000d\u000a      by the Archbishop\u000d\u000a      of York, John Sentamu. Participants included descendants of the Asian\u000d\u000a      delegates at EWMC\u000d\u000a      1910, whose contribution had been brought to public attention in Stanley's\u000d\u000a      book. Their\u000d\u000a      contributions attracted particular interest. One Hong Kong delegate\u000d\u000a      observed: `It was truly an\u000d\u000a      exciting and meaningful experience to be present in the 2010 Edinburgh\u000d\u000a      Conference, particularly\u000d\u000a      sitting in the same Assembly Hall at the closing celebration where Rev.\u000d\u000a      Cheng Jing-yi, the\u000d\u000a      forefather of the Church of Christ in China sat in 1910.

Andrew Walls identified EWMC 1910 as `the point at which\u000d\u000a      Christians first began to\u000d\u000a      glimpse something of what a world church would be like' in his monograph The\u000d\u000a        Cross-Cultural\u000d\u000a        Process in Christian History (3.1).\u000d\u000a    In 2002 David Kerr, (Director of CSCNWW from 1996 to 2005), established\u000d\u000a      an action research\u000d\u000a      process to prepare for the centennial conference of EWMC 1910. This\u000d\u000a      process drew church\u000d\u000a      leaders and scholars into eight themed conferences held in the School of\u000d\u000a      Divinity, 2003-7,\u000d\u000a      designed to mirror the original eight commissions set up to prepare for\u000d\u000a      EWMC 1910. These\u000d\u000a      conferences in turn led to the establishment of nine international study\u000d\u000a      groups in 2008. The\u000d\u000a      conferences and study groups constituted an action research process of\u000d\u000a      global knowledge co-creation.\u000d\u000a      This action research both shaped the agenda, plenaries and workshops of\u000d\u000a      Edinburgh\u000d\u000a      2010 and disseminated the extensive research of members of the UoA on EWMC\u000d\u000a      1910.

This work by Ross and\u000d\u000a      Johnson represents a\u000d\u000a      major research advance in the data mapping of Christianity as a religion\u000d\u000a      which, as a partial\u000d\u000a      consequence of the global coordination of Christian mission at EWMC 1910,\u000d\u000a      had in the course of\u000d\u000a      the subsequent century acquired more adherents in the global South than in\u000d\u000a      its original centres\u000d\u000a      of strength in Europe and the Middle East.\u000d\u000a    Brian Stanley (Director of CSCNWW &#8212; renamed CSWC &#8212; 2009 - present)\u000d\u000a      authored the\u000d\u000a      monograph The World Missionary Conference, Edinburgh 1910 (3.4).\u000d\u000a      Stanley's research\u000d\u000a      provides an evidentiary basis for the argument advanced by his\u000d\u000a      predecessors (Walls, Kerr,\u000d\u000a      Ross) that the reputation of the 1910 conference as the starting point of\u000d\u000a      the ecumenical\u000d\u000a      movement, whilst not without substance, had eclipsed the implications of\u000d\u000a      the conference for\u000d\u000a      understanding world Christianity. Previous writing had portrayed the\u000d\u000a      conference as an event\u000d\u000a      wholly dominated by Northern Christians, but Stanley modified this picture\u000d\u000a      by devoting an\u000d\u000a      important chapter to the presence, contributions and provocative impact of\u000d\u000a      Asian Christian\u000d\u000a      leaders (3.4, pp. 91-131).

This demonstration\u000a      is crucial to advancing\u000a      the dialogue between faith service providers and the international\u000a      agencies responsible for\u000a      overseeing the achievement of key development targets such as the\u000a      Millennium Development\u000a      Goals (MDGs). In 2000 the MDGs were established and agreed to by 189\u000a      member states in the\u000a      UN. Two of these universally recognised objectives for addressing specific\u000a      global needs have not\u000a      been met: MDG 5 (improving maternal health) and MDG 6 (combating HIV\/AIDS,\u000a      malaria and\u000a      other diseases). Clague's research has been used to:\u000a    1. bridge the secular\/faith-based divide in the international\u000a        HIV\/AIDS response through activities\u000a      within the following organisations.\u000a    - Joint Learning Initiative (JLI). Religious drivers of the\u000a      HIV\/AIDS pandemic have undermined\u000a      the positive contributions to tackling HIV made by faith communities,\u000a      meaning that these\u000a      contributions have been overlooked, under-researched, and as a consequence\u000a      under-funded.\u000a      To address this research deficit, the UN is working with representatives\u000a      from faith-based\u000a      organisations and relevant researchers including Clague, through the JLI,\u000a      to map the\u000a      nature and extent of faith community responses, in order to develop a\u000a      reliable evidence base\u000a      of the role and impact of faith-based interventions in relation to HIV and\u000a      maternal health.\u000a      Clague is co-chair of the HIV\/AIDS and Maternal Health learning hub of the\u000a      JLI, and was\u000a      instrumental in driving the data-gathering and evidence-based research to\u000a      examine the link\u000a      between faith, maternal health and HIV\/AIDS development work. The JLI and\u000a      the evidence\u000a      base it continues to compile, through the learning hub co-chaired by\u000a      Clague, is an important\u000a      channel for faith-based organisations to communicate their impact more\u000a      effectively to those\u000a      overseeing the global HIV and maternal health response. The United Nations\u000a      Population\u000a      Fund (UNFPA) published the JLI\u000a        report on maternal health and HIV while JLI research\u000a      findings have been disseminated to the major donor agencies USAID (the\u000a      United States\u000a      Agency for International Development) and DFID (the UK Department for\u000a      International\u000a      Development).\u000a    There have been a number of meetings between DFID's Civil Society team,\u000a      USAID and the\u000a      JLI project team, in which the agencies expressed an interest in JLI\u000a      findings concerning the\u000a      role of faith-based organisations in global health, since this information\u000a      is unavailable\u000a      elsewhere. USAID and DFID have shown their recognition of the value of the\u000a      emerging\u000a      evidence base established by JLI in a number of ways. For example, USAID\u000a      proposed that\u000a      another JLI learning hub be established, focusing on maternal and child\u000a      health; and Clague\u000a      has been invited to deliver two seminars at DFID in London and East\u000a      Kilbride to promote\u000a      faith literacy among staff, including senior civil servants and ministers\u000a      (although these are\u000a      scheduled to take place in November 2013, outwith the eligible timeframe).\u000a    A Senior Advisor for the UNFPA writes:\u000a      Faith beliefs and practices &#8212; such as those concerning sensitive issues\u000a      such as gender\u000a      equality, sexual and reproductive health and HIV &#8212; continue to shape\u000a      critical behaviours\u000a      that have a profound impact upon health. Clague's engagement in this field\u000a      is helping to\u000a      promote dialogue within the Catholic Church on such difficult topics. It\u000a      is also helping non-religious\u000a      and global inter-governmental bodies, such as UNFPA: (i) better understand\u000a      the\u000a      diversity of approaches that exist within Catholicism; and, (ii) identify\u000a      the synergies and\u000a      key differences between Catholic values and teachings, as well as the\u000a      human rights that\u000a      underpin much of UN policy on these issues.\u000a    - Ecumenical Advocacy Alliance. In November 2011 Clague was\u000a      consultant to the Ecumenical Advocacy Alliance of the World\u000a      Council of Churches during their `closed-door' workshop\u000a      discussions on Theology, Human Rights and the HIV Response.\u000a      Clague's input was\u000a      described by the HIV and AIDS Campaign Coordinator as `a vital part' of\u000a      this ongoing\u000a      Ecumenical Advocacy Alliance project. Religious leaders, representatives\u000a      from UNFPA and\u000a      UNAIDS (the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV\/AIDS), and people living\u000a      with HIV met\u000a      in Geneva to promote debate and research into the (often sensitive) human\u000a      rights issues\u000a      relating to HIV, with a view to overcoming ideological barriers and\u000a      facilitating dialogue\u000a      between faith communities and non-religious agencies. This event, along\u000a      with the next\u000a      session to be held in Manila (November 2013), will lead to a forthcoming\u000a      World Council of\u000a      Churches publication on human rights and HIV. The Alliance's work on which\u000a      Clague is\u000a      advising is focused on Christian approaches to gender and to sexual and\u000a      reproductive health\u000a      rights, aiming to identify areas of agreement and contention in the run up\u000a      to ICPD Beyond\u000a        2014 (the official UN review of successes and failures in the 20\u000a      years since the first\u000a      International Conference on Population and Development). The aim of the\u000a      publication is to\u000a      better understand and address Christian ambivalence concerning\u000a      international rights norms.\u000a    In May 2011 Clague was approached by the Partnerships Advisor at UNAIDS\u000a      to provide advisory\u000a      input for the drafting of the plenary speech delivered by Michel Sidib&#233;\u000a      (Head of UNAIDS) to the\u000a      Vatican AIDS Conference, ensuring that details in the speech were accurate\u000a      and its language\u000a      appropriate to its audience.\u000a    2. inform the Catholic response to HIV\/AIDS by advising\u000a      policy-makers in key decision-making\u000a      contexts. Since 2000 Clague has been a member of the HIV\/AIDS Advisory\u000a      Group of CAFOD.\u000a      In this capacity she has helped to drive the discussion of Catholic\u000a      approaches to HIV prevention\u000a      within the Church. The Director of CAFOD describes Clague's contribution\u000a      to dialogue on this\u000a      subject in the wider Catholic faith community as `tremendous'. On 25 July\u000a      2010 Clague co-organised\u000a      an international seminar on HIV with Gillian Paterson (Co-founder and\u000a      Coordinator at\u000a      HARC, The HIV, AIDS and Religion Collaborative). This brought together 75\u000a      Catholic ethicists\u000a      in Trento, Italy to foster international collaboration on HIV-related\u000a      research, and resulted in the\u000a      formation of a Catholic HIV Network under the auspices of Catholic\u000a        Theological Ethics in the World Church.\u000a    As well as empowering Catholic responses to HIV on the ground, Clague's\u000a      expertise is\u000a      influencing approaches at episcopal level. Through the Caritas\u000a        in Veritate Foundation Clague\u000a      offers advice on Catholic social teaching to the Holy See in Geneva for\u000a      its interventions at the\u000a      UN Human Rights Council. The Foundation is one of the official channels by\u000a      which the Catholic\u000a      Church engages with the UN. On 27 June 2011 Clague was invited to speak at\u000a      a Directors'\u000a      Meeting of CIDSE, an international alliance of Catholic development\u000a      agencies, on tackling\u000a      sensitive issues in Catholic identity and international development. The\u000a      current president of\u000a      CIDSE has noted their appreciation of Clague's contribution, which helped\u000a      the alliance\u000a      redefine our understanding of gender and reproductive health ethics at a\u000a      CIDSE Directors'\u000a      Meeting in Ghent in 2011 [....] [Clague's] approach, research and\u000a      expertise &#8212; and\u000a      engagement through CAFOD, CIDSE and the JLI &#8212; clearly in my opinion has\u000a      influenced\u000a      the wider Catholic and FBO world, improving its understanding and\u000a      effectiveness.\u000a    Clague delivered a lecture on `HIV and the theology of sin' to 90\u000a      London-based Christian HIV\u000a      practitioners at the AIDS: A Sign of the Times conference,\u000a      sponsored by CAFOD and\u000a      Progressio (14 November 2009). She has also delivered in-service training\u000a      on HIV prevention to\u000a      clergy and practitioners for CAFOD (attended by local and overseas\u000a      partners).

Yet religious beliefs and practices can also\u000a      undermine health and\u000a      development goals, such as those relating to gender equality, reproductive\u000a      health and HIV\/AIDS.\u000a      The impact of faith-based organisations on the United Nations Millennium\u000a      Development Goals\u000a      (MDGs) for maternal health and HIV\/AIDS is contested because of the\u000a      limited available evidence\u000a      concerning the activities of faith-based organisations.\u000a    Julie Clague (Lecturer in Theology and Religious Studies, 2000 to the\u000a      present) has been\u000a      researching sexual and reproductive health issues since 1994. Her research\u000a      on faith-based\u000a      responses to HIV has been in three interrelated areas:\u000a    1. Mapping and evaluating faith community responses to the MDG\u000a        targets on maternal health and\u000a        HIV\/AIDS. Clague researched and compiled the Joint Learning\u000a      Initiative on Faith and Local\u000a      Communities (JLI) database &#8212; at http:\/\/www.scribd.com\/doc\/118047301\/HIV-and-Maternal-Health-Annex-1\u000a      &#8212; of faith-based responses to HIV and maternal health. Her key findings\u000a      include:\u000a    - that faith-based organisations offer both community-based care and\u000a      institutional health\u000a      services;\u000a    - that services are diverse, spanning prevention, home-based care,\u000a      advocacy, treatment,\u000a      prevention of mother-to-child transmission and training of faith leaders\u000a      and congregations;\u000a    - that the scale of initiatives ranges from multi-country programmes &#8212;\u000a      eg, international\u000a      networks of religious congregations, whose global membership may be as\u000a      high as 40\u000a      million &#8212; to localised one-to-one activities; and,\u000a    - that there is sparse published evidence or mapping of the involvement\u000a      of faith-based\u000a      organisations in maternal health: far more evidence exists concerning\u000a      HIV-related services.\u000a    2. Catholic approaches to HIV prevention. With HIV programmes\u000a      across 114 countries, the\u000a      Catholic Church is one of the world's largest providers of HIV-related\u000a      services. However,\u000a      Vatican teaching on HIV prevention &#8212; eg, rejecting condom use &#8212; is widely\u000a      regarded as counter-productive\u000a      to HIV-prevention strategies. Since 2000 Clague has been a member of the\u000a      HIV\/AIDS Advisory Group of CAFOD (the Catholic Agency For Overseas\u000a      Development), the\u000a      development arm of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales\u000a      and the HIV\u000a      response coordinating body for Caritas Internationalis. Her research on\u000a      Catholic moral method\u000a      in relation to HIV makes her one of a handful of experts in this field in\u000a      the Catholic Church.\u000a      Clague's work has shown how and in what ways Catholic moral reasoning is\u000a      applied to HIV\u000a      prevention strategies. This has helped CAFOD articulate its HIV policy and\u000a      successfully\u000a      implement it among at-risk communities. To this end, Clague's article on\u000a      `HIV and Catholic\u000a      Theology' (2006), which appears on CAFOD's website, has been widely\u000a      disseminated and cited\u000a      across Catholic and faith-based communities worldwide, as indicated in\u000a      section 4 below.\u000a    3. The ideological divide between the rights-based value system of\u000a        secular societies and the\u000a        religiously-inspired value system of conservative faith communities on\u000a        issues of gender and\u000a        sexuality. Clague has published three articles discussing the\u000a      synergies and key differences\u000a      between the rights-based values of secular society and the religiously\u000a      informed moral values of\u000a      conservative faith communities. The earliest (2000) discusses the\u000a      ambivalence to rights\u000a      discourse within Catholicism. The others (2006, 2009, 2011) examine\u000a      religious antipathy to\u000a      gender theory and homosexual rights. Clague's research shows why an\u000a      ideological gulf exists\u000a      between the rights-based approach to development, espoused by secular\u000a      agencies such as the\u000a      UN and donor governments, and the religiously-based premises of\u000a      conservative faith\u000a      communities, especially in the fields of women's reproductive health and\u000a      HIV\/AIDS. This\u000a      research informs Clague's work with the World Council of Churches and the\u000a      UN. With 84% of\u000a      the world's population religiously affiliated, UN agencies cannot ignore\u000a      the influence of religious\u000a      ideology on public health. Clague is currently promoting dialogue on these\u000a      contested issues\u000a      between faith leaders and UN representatives on behalf of the Ecumenical\u000a      Advocacy Alliance.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"27162","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"798549","Name":"Romania"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Orthodox theology has been part of British university life for a long\u000d\u000a      time. Research in this area has\u000d\u000a      been pioneered by Metropolitan Kallistos Ware, Prof Andrew Louth, Donald\u000d\u000a      Allchin, and the\u000d\u000a      Fellowship of St Alban and St Sergius. Now, however, with the retirement\u000d\u000a      of this generation,\u000d\u000a      Andreas Andreopoulos has been placed in a central position as far as the\u000d\u000a      study of Orthodox\u000d\u000a      theology in the UK is concerned. In addition, he is gradually replacing\u000d\u000a      Kallistos Ware and Andrew\u000d\u000a      Louth in several Orthodox organizations in the UK, taking the baton (as it\u000d\u000a      were) from them. Under\u000d\u000a      his leadership, Winchester is becoming a leading centre for research and\u000d\u000a      study in Orthodox\u000d\u000a      theology in the UK.\u000d\u000a    To ensure the maximum benefit to the Orthodox community in the UK from\u000d\u000a      this research activity,\u000d\u000a      and to ensure that Winchester's academic activity in this area remains\u000d\u000a      closely connected to the\u000d\u000a      needs of the Orthodox community, Andreopoulos has since 2010 been\u000d\u000a      developing the Winchester\u000d\u000a      Orthodox Network, formally inaugurated by the Faculty of Humanities and\u000d\u000a      Social Sciences in 2012.\u000d\u000a      This is an association of clergy, students and laypeople who are\u000d\u000a      interested in Eastern Christianity.\u000d\u000a      Its members are based in the area around Winchester, or are keeping close\u000d\u000a      contact with it, and it\u000d\u000a      also includes two Visiting Research Fellows, Prof Nicholas Loudovikos\u000d\u000a      (Greece) and Dr Adrian\u000d\u000a      Agachi (Romania). The Winchester Orthodox Network facilitates a continuous\u000d\u000a      pastoral and\u000d\u000a      theological dialogue, making it the first level of impact that connects\u000d\u000a      the research conducted in\u000d\u000a      Winchester with a number of other organizations and levels of\u000d\u000a      dissemination and pastoral activity\u000d\u000a      in the UK.\u000d\u000a    Andreopoulos has been a member of the committee of the Orthodox\u000d\u000a      Fellowship of St John the\u000d\u000a      Baptist for several years, becoming its chairman in June 2013. The\u000d\u000a      Fellowship enables members\u000d\u000a      of the several Orthodox Church Traditions in the UK to come together, and\u000d\u000a      through prayer,\u000d\u000a      discussion and mutual friendship, to deepen their understanding of the\u000d\u000a      Orthodox Christian faith\u000d\u000a      and its place in the West. It brings together clergy, theologians and\u000d\u000a      laypeople, and for this reason it\u000d\u000a      has a wide and large membership, of about 500 members. Andreopoulos'\u000d\u000a      election as chairman\u000d\u000a      was a recognition both of his research reputation and his commitment to\u000d\u000a      pastoral life and theology.\u000d\u000a      Through his work on the committee, Andreopoulos has had a considerable\u000d\u000a      influence on the\u000d\u000a      directions and interests of the Fellowship. The theological and pastoral\u000d\u000a      background of his\u000d\u000a      involvement is reflected in several of his publications, where the\u000d\u000a      direction and the goals of modern\u000d\u000a      Orthodox theology are discussed (such as 2012 and 2013a, which touch on\u000d\u000a      the contribution of\u000d\u000a      Orthodox theology and methodology to modern Christian theology), or\u000d\u000a      publications that reflect a\u000d\u000a      dialogue with the Patristic heritage (such as 2011b) and the continuous\u000d\u000a      research into liturgical\u000d\u000a      theology (such as 2013b).\u000d\u000a    The main aim of the Fellowship is to develop all levels of Orthodox life.\u000d\u000a      It operates in such a way\u000d\u000a      that learning and research are extended to the level of the parish and the\u000d\u000a      average churchgoer,\u000d\u000a      something especially evident in the annual Study Weekends, which are\u000d\u000a      sponsored by, and held in,\u000d\u000a      a different Orthodox parish every year. Through its close collaboration\u000d\u000a      with Orthodox clergy and\u000d\u000a      parishes throughout the country, the Fellowship affects the entire\u000d\u000a      English-speaking Orthodox\u000d\u000a      population of the UK, and much of the ethnic Orthodox Church in the UK,\u000d\u000a      and promotes awareness\u000d\u000a      of Orthodox spirituality, communal spirit beyond ethnic lines, and further\u000d\u000a      understanding of liturgical\u000d\u000a      life. Its activities include:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      An international residential weekend conference each summer. Recent\u000d\u000a        subjects have been:\u000d\u000a        Mothers and Fathers in God: Spiritual Guidance in the Orthodox Church\u000d\u000a        (2010), Orthodox\u000d\u000a        Witness Today (2011), Death and Eternity (2012), and The Liturgy:\u000d\u000a        Entrance into the Kingdom\u000d\u000a        (2013). Andreopoulos was a keynote speaker in the 2013 conference (July\u000d\u000a        12-14, 2013), with a\u000d\u000a        presentation (The Eschatological Character of the Divine Liturgy)\u000d\u000a        based on material from two of\u000d\u000a        his publications (2013a and 2013b).\u000d\u000a      A Study Weekend early each year, often devoted either to the Bible or\u000d\u000a        to one of the Church\u000d\u000a        Fathers. Andreopoulos was the organizer and keynote speaker of two\u000d\u000a        recent Study Weekends,\u000d\u000a        `Song of Songs: Mystical Prayer, Poetry and Worship in Daily Life' (Jan\u000d\u000a        28 &#8212; Feb 2, 2011) and\u000d\u000a        `Symbolism in the Gospel of John' (Jan 25-27, 2013). His presentations\u000d\u000a        were based on\u000d\u000a        material from two of his publications (2011b and 2012 respectively).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The Fellowship Youth Committee also organises various events including\u000d\u000a      Youth Festivals, choir\u000d\u000a      concerts, pilgrimages and additional events according to demand. The\u000d\u000a      Fellowship publishes an\u000d\u000a      annual Calendar and Lectionary, as well as a Directory giving details of\u000d\u000a      Orthodox clergy and\u000d\u000a      places of worship in the UK and Ireland. The extent of its impact may be\u000d\u000a      seen in the number of\u000d\u000a      participants in its events (80-100 in most annual conferences; 30-50 in\u000d\u000a      most Study Weekends),\u000d\u000a      and in the annual sales of the Directory and the Calendar (about 200 for\u000d\u000a      the Directory and 600 for\u000d\u000a      the Calendar).\u000d\u000a    Andreopoulos has also undertaken direct pastoral duties. He provides\u000d\u000a      regular pastoral support in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with the local hospitals. In addition, he has founded and is\u000d\u000a      in charge of a new\u000d\u000a      Orthodox parish in Winchester, which has allowed Orthodox Christians to\u000d\u000a      worship there on a\u000d\u000a      weekly basis, and is open to people who are generally interested in\u000d\u000a      Orthodox theology and\u000d\u000a      practice. As preparation for the foundation of the parish, Andreopoulos\u000d\u000a      held weekly catechetical\u000d\u000a      lectures for a year at the Orthodox church of St Nicholas in Southampton,\u000d\u000a      open to parishioners and\u000d\u000a      inquirers (attended by 10-20 people every time). These catechetical\u000d\u000a      lectures continued in the\u000d\u000a      Winchester parish, and as he has been offering them in the last three\u000d\u000a      years, they have drawn\u000d\u000a      material from all of Andreopoulos's publications. The thematic units\u000d\u000a      covered included Biblical\u000d\u000a      analysis, the Church lectionary and the feasts, ecclesiology and the\u000d\u000a      theology of the sacraments,\u000d\u000a      and the language and theology of iconography. The effect of these\u000d\u000a      activities is considerable, at the\u000d\u000a      level of community formation, generation and enhancement of spiritual\u000d\u000a      practices, and the dynamic\u000d\u000a      integration of the Orthodox community within the wider social and\u000d\u000a      spiritual context.\u000d\u000a    Andreopoulos's speaking engagements have extended beyond the immediate\u000d\u000a      area. He is often\u000d\u000a      invited to preach or speak in clergy gatherings and lay theology\u000d\u000a      conferences outside the UK.\u000d\u000a      Examples include: lectures on the iconographic programme of St Nicholas in\u000d\u000a      Cardiff, September\u000d\u000a      2012 (in association with Open Doors 2012 &#8212; European Heritage Days in\u000d\u000a      Wales); an exposition of\u000d\u000a      John's Gospel over two weeks to a clergy retreat (attendance of 30, mostly\u000d\u000a      Catholic priests) in\u000d\u000a      Tantur College, Jerusalem, November 2012 (drawing largely on material from\u000d\u000a      Andreopoulos\u000d\u000a      2011b, 2012 and 2013a); a talk on New Martyrs, Diocese of R&#226;mnicu V&#226;lcea,\u000d\u000a      Romania,\u000d\u000a      September 2012 (invited by the local bishop, with an audience of 200); an\u000d\u000a      exposition of the\u000d\u000a      challenges of spiritual guidance in modern Greece at the biennial\u000d\u000a      Madingley Conference of the\u000d\u000a      Friends of Mount Athos, March 2013 (attendance of 150). Such talks\u000d\u000a      communicate the fruits of\u000d\u000a      research beyond the context of higher education, but they are also a way\u000d\u000a      to make sure that\u000d\u000a      Orthodox theological study and research remain grounded in the needs of\u000d\u000a      the wider community.\u000d\u000a    As an extension of this, Andreopoulos has provided expert opinions to the\u000d\u000a      wider Orthodox\u000d\u000a      community. A relevant example is the case of the iconostasis of the\u000d\u000a      Orthodox Church of St\u000d\u000a      Makarios in Leeds, which was bought by that community in 2013 (a cost of\u000d\u000a      &#163;20,000). Before its\u000d\u000a      design and purchase, the priest of that community solicited the advice of\u000d\u000a      Andreopoulos regarding\u000d\u000a      its design. The advice sought had to do with the choice and the placement\u000d\u000a      of the icons within the\u000d\u000a      icon screen, a matter of theological and liturgical symbolism. This came\u000d\u000a      up not only through\u000d\u000a      Andreopoulos's personal involvement with that parish, but also because of\u000d\u000a      the recognition of his\u000d\u000a      expertise in iconography (such as may be demonstrated in 2013a).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case study describes the impact of Orthodox theological research at\u000d\u000a      Winchester on Orthodox\u000d\u000a      Christian life in the UK at several levels.

The first relates to the comparative study of\u000d\u000a      Eastern and Western theology.\u000d\u000a      The second has to do with research in Christian symbolism, and more\u000d\u000a      specifically with iconography\u000d\u000a      and liturgy.\u000d\u000a    These have been longstanding interests of Andreas Andreopoulos, developed\u000d\u000a      in numerous\u000d\u000a      publications prior to his move to Winchester in 2010. Since then he has\u000d\u000a      explored in several\u000d\u000a      publications the way Christianity is experienced beyond its doctrinal\u000d\u000a      content, and how this spiritual\u000d\u000a      experience fits within a wider European context. To this end, in a\u000d\u000a      publication in Sobornost,\u000d\u000a      Andreopoulos (2011b) offered an analysis on the theme of confession in the\u000d\u000a      work of Alexandros\u000d\u000a      Papadiamantis, a writer who is often considered equivalent to Dostoyevsky,\u000d\u000a      and yet is not well\u000d\u000a      known outside Greece. Sobornost is the journal of the St Alban and\u000d\u000a      St Sergius Fellowship, which\u000d\u000a      promotes Anglican-Orthodox dialogue (with 1,500-2,000 members), and\u000d\u000a      therefore this analytical\u000d\u000a      presentation of the spiritual strand of Papadiamantis fit within the\u000d\u000a      context of the presentation of\u000d\u000a      modern Orthodoxy in Western terms and audiences.\u000d\u000a    What started as an exploration of literary and art works in terms of\u000d\u000a      their contribution to theological\u000d\u000a      thought, was developed further. The theme of the experiential aspect of\u000d\u000a      Christianity, developed\u000d\u000a      along the lines of Liturgy and Iconography, is explored in a more extended\u000d\u000a      way in the monograph\u000d\u000a      Gazing on God (Andreopoulos, 2013a). The book is intended to\u000d\u000a      contribute to ecumenical dialogue\u000d\u000a      by stressing the experience of worship (rather than doctrinal dialogue\u000d\u000a      alone) as a basis for mutual\u000d\u000a      understanding between Eastern and Western Christianity. There is very\u000d\u000a      little research in this\u000d\u000a      direction, and this book is an attempt to broach the subject in a way that\u000d\u000a      will be useful not only to\u000d\u000a      theologians but also to clergy and laity. In addition, the second part of\u000d\u000a      the book offers a detailed\u000d\u000a      analysis of selected icons, in order to demonstrate the depth of the\u000d\u000a      symbolism of iconography. This\u000d\u000a      analysis goes beyond the level of doctrine (as we find in the vast\u000d\u000a      majority of iconology), touching\u000d\u000a      on the understanding of time, space, absolute freedom, and participation\u000d\u000a      in the life of God. It\u000d\u000a      thereby opens iconographic symbolism more than previous texts &#8212; and makes\u000d\u000a      that symbolism\u000d\u000a      accessible also to readers whose primary interest is not in doctrinal\u000d\u000a      interpretation alone.\u000d\u000a    The exploration of liturgy and symbolism in the Orthodox tradition, and\u000d\u000a      its relevance today, took a\u000d\u000a      different turn in the article on the Byzantine anaphora (Andreopoulos,\u000d\u000a      2013b), which explores a\u000d\u000a      much more focused problem. Liturgical theologians since the Middle Ages\u000d\u000a      (even the most detailed\u000d\u000a      ones) have not interpreted the meaning of the phrase \"according to all and\u000d\u000a      for all\", at the heart of\u000d\u000a      the offertory of the Greek liturgies. The article proposes an\u000d\u000a      interpretation (an eschatological\u000d\u000a      reading) based on some earlier liturgical forms, scriptural evidence, and\u000d\u000a      Patristic texts that have\u000d\u000a      not been considered before. The gap in liturgical research was\u000d\u000a      embarrassingly conspicuous, and\u000d\u000a      therefore the findings should be of interest to a wide range of people,\u000d\u000a      liturgical scholars, people\u000d\u000a      who are interested in Orthodox theology, as well as clergy\/practitioners.\u000d\u000a      This more focused\u000d\u000a      research also ties in with the theme of the interpretation of Christian\u000d\u000a      symbolism and liturgy, and\u000d\u000a      tries to make the eschatological character of the Byzantine liturgy more\u000d\u000a      clearly understood. Both in\u000d\u000a      this publication and even more so in 2013a, which also touches on matters\u000d\u000a      of liturgical\u000d\u000a      interpretation, the eschatological-made-present dimension of Orthodox\u000d\u000a      theology is understood\u000d\u000a      beyond its close historical boundaries. While publications such as 2013b\u000d\u000a      explore Orthodox\u000d\u000a      theology at the cutting edge, publications such as 2013a care to\u000d\u000a      contextualize this research in a\u000d\u000a      wider narrative that fits within the wider framework and vocabulary of\u000d\u000a      modern Christian thought.\u000d\u000a    The same relationship between cutting edge research and Western\u000d\u000a      contextualization of Eastern\u000d\u000a      theology may be seen in Andreopoulos's work on the Transfiguration.\u000d\u000a      Andreopoulos published a\u000d\u000a      book dedicated to the Transfiguration in 2005, and subsequently numerous\u000d\u000a      articles. His second\u000d\u000a      book on the Transfiguration (Andreopoulos, 2012), explores some systematic\u000d\u000a      directions that\u000d\u000a      emerged as a result of an ongoing research into the Biblical and medieval\u000d\u000a      significance of the\u000d\u000a      Transfiguration, but also as a response to a number of publications by\u000d\u000a      Western theologians since\u000d\u000a      2005 &#8212; and therefore, while it expresses a practice that is grounded in\u000d\u000a      the Eastern tradition, it is\u000d\u000a      part of the modern systematic theological dialogue on the significance of\u000d\u000a      the Transfiguration,\u000d\u000a      especially in the Eastern tradition. It includes much original research in\u000d\u000a      terms of the connection of\u000d\u000a      modern Orthodox systematic theology (which it tries to advance) with\u000d\u000a      Patristic and Biblical themes.\u000d\u000a    The Patristic interpretation of Scripture can also be seen in the article\u000d\u000a      on the Song of Songs\u000d\u000a      (Andreopoulos, 2011b). The originality of that publication is that it\u000d\u000a      tries to illustrate the mystical\u000d\u000a      interpretation of this Biblical text for the early Christian tradition, by\u000d\u000a      comparing and contrasting the\u000d\u000a      major Patristic commentaries, and also it tries to build on this mystical\u000d\u000a      spirituality and demonstrate\u000d\u000a      how it still informs modern Orthodox theology today, and how it can be of\u000d\u000a      interest to wider modern\u000d\u000a      Christian theology.\u000d\u000a    Much of this research has informed Andreopoulos's teaching and research\u000d\u000a      supervision. A product\u000d\u000a      of the latter is the study of Dr Adrian Agachi on Dumitru Staniloae\u000d\u000a      (Agachi, 2013), one of the very\u000d\u000a      few and most illuminating publications that present and analyse the work\u000d\u000a      of this Orthodox\u000d\u000a      theologian, and his conversation with and reception by Western theology.\u000d\u000a      Agachi's PhD was\u000d\u000a      awarded in 2013 and he is currently a Visiting Research Fellow of CSTR.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"27163","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"163843","Name":"Syria"},{"GeoNamesId":"1282988","Name":"Nepal"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Owen's and King's work on developing a conflict specific framework for\u000d\u000a      analysing the potential of religious peacebuilding within a given context\u000d\u000a      has led to increased engagement between themselves and policy makers both\u000d\u000a      in Nepal and in the UK. In 2012\/13 the WCRRP was invited on three\u000d\u000a      different occasions to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to talk to\u000d\u000a      staff and senior officers about religious peacebuilding, both in Nepal and\u000d\u000a      several other contexts including Syria. Their work in this area has also\u000d\u000a      been presented to Lord Alderdice at the House of Lords in May 2013 and as\u000d\u000a      a result he has offered to convene a meeting of Lords interested in this\u000d\u000a      area, with a view to establishing a working committee with representation\u000d\u000a      from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Department for International\u000d\u000a      Development, as well as academic institutions working in this area. Whilst\u000d\u000a      difficult to quantify precisely, their research and the growing reputation\u000d\u000a      of WCRRP has increased the awareness and willingness of civil servants and\u000d\u000a      policy makers to more seriously consider the necessity and importance of\u000d\u000a      engaging religious leaders, groups and organisations in situations of\u000d\u000a      conflict.\u000d\u000a    The impact of their research within the Nepalese context is much clearer\u000d\u000a      and more tangible. During the first two periods of fieldwork Owen and King\u000d\u000a      initiated dialogue with a wide range of religious and non-religious actors\u000d\u000a      involved in the peacebuilding process to survey the current state of\u000d\u000a      religious peacebuilding in Nepal and collect baseline data for the\u000d\u000a      project. This interactive assessment initiated a process of knowledge\u000d\u000a      exchange, and drawing on insight from previous research; in-depth\u000d\u000a      knowledge of the relevant religious traditions; and an enhanced\u000d\u000a      understanding of the Nepal context, Owen and King were able to facilitate\u000d\u000a      change for a variety of stakeholders. For example, religious stakeholders\u000d\u000a      consistently reported a clearer understanding of the potential of\u000d\u000a      religious actors within the peace and development processes, and the type\u000d\u000a      and nature of engagements necessary to their being seen as legitimate\u000d\u000a      actors by other stakeholders. `Secular' organisations (such as Saferworld,\u000d\u000a      UNODA) reported a greater understanding of the potential roles of\u000d\u000a      religious groups and communities, and increased confidence in how to\u000d\u000a      approach them.\u000d\u000a    The research data collected during the first two periods of field work\u000d\u000a      was subsequently used to devise a participative and facilitative workshop\u000d\u000a      which was delivered in June 2013 to several inter-faith organisations\u000d\u000a      based in the Terai region, where inter-religious conflict has\u000d\u000a      traditionally been a problem. Workshops particularly in Neplagunj and\u000d\u000a      Biratnagr were very well-received, with religious actors reporting a range\u000d\u000a      of benefits including:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Increased understanding of the roles of religious actors in\u000d\u000a        peacebuilding;\u000d\u000a      A greater appreciation of the problems and potentials of religion in\u000d\u000a        the Nepalese context;\u000d\u000a      Increased advocacy skills particularly in relation to engaging\u000d\u000a        national and state actors;\u000d\u000a      Better insight into the barriers to participation in peacebuilding for\u000d\u000a        religious actors at national and international level.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    In addition to the workshops, a national level symposium and consultation\u000d\u000a      was held in Kathmandu on 17th and 18th June 2013 in\u000d\u000a      association with Religions for Peace Nepal and the Department of Conflict,\u000d\u000a      Peace and Development Studies, Tribhuvan University. The consultation was\u000d\u000a      the direct result of the relationship building process carried out by King\u000d\u000a      and Owen, and brought together religious actors, faith-based\u000d\u000a      organisations, `secular' peace practitioners, INGOs\/NGOs, as well as\u000d\u000a      policy makers and government representatives including the Minister for\u000d\u000a      Peace and Reconstruction. King's and Owen's research informed the\u000d\u000a      structure and content of the symposium, and they facilitated much of the\u000d\u000a      dialogue process.\u000d\u000a    As a result of the two day discussion a wide range of stakeholders agreed\u000d\u000a      and signed up to the `Kathmandu Declaration' an action plan identifying\u000d\u000a      specific areas of religious peacebuilding on which religious and\u000d\u000a      non-religious organisations and actors would collaborate\u000d\u000a      (http:\/\/www.winchester.ac.uk\/academicdepartments\/theology\/Research\/Documents\/Kathmandu%20Declaration%20final.pdf).\u000aAdditional\u000a      impacts include:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The initiation of network of stakeholders working in peacebuilding;\u000d\u000a      The opportunity for grassroots peacebuilders (from Biratnagar,\u000d\u000a        Neplagunj, and Muslim communities) to address for the first time a high\u000d\u000a        level national audience and inform them of their problems;\u000d\u000a      A shift in recognition of the importance and potential of religious\u000d\u000a        actors at government level;\u000d\u000a      A report summarising the last three years research has been compiled\u000d\u000a        and on invitation submitted to the Minister of Peace and Reconstruction\u000d\u000a        and we are awaiting his response; particularly in relation to assisting\u000d\u000a        in the establishment of a national level `Commission on Religious\u000d\u000a        Affairs' which would act as an advisory body to the government to act as\u000d\u000a        an early warning system for identifying potential problems within and\u000d\u000a        between religious groups\u000d\u000a        (http:\/\/www.winchester.ac.uk\/academicdepartments\/theology\/Research\/Documents\/Religion%20and%20Peacebuilding%20in%20Nepal%20Report.pdf).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case study describes an iterative cycle of research and impact in\u000d\u000a      relation to work in the area of religion and peacebuilding in Nepal.\u000d\u000a      King's and Owen's research in Buddhism and conflict transformation, Islam\u000d\u000a      and gender violence, and their work on developing a framework for\u000d\u000a      analysing the potential of religion for peacebuilding in a given context,\u000d\u000a      has informed the development of a participatory workshop on the role of\u000d\u000a      religious actors in peacebuilding which has been delivered to a number of\u000d\u000a      communities in the Terai region of Nepal, and the facilitation of a larger\u000d\u000a      networking event in Kathmandu in June 2013 which resulted in the\u000d\u000a      formulation of an action plan to which participating religious groups and\u000d\u000a      faith-based NGOs have committed.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Winchester\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Winchester (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Winchester","PeerGroup":"F","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10003614}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"1283582","Name":"Biratnagar"},{"GeoNamesId":"1283240","Name":"Kathmandu"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a*King, Anna. 2004. `Dalit Theology: a Theology of Outrage', in Bocken,\u000d\u000a      Inigo, Wilhelm Dupr&#233;, and Paul van der Velde (eds.): The Persistent\u000d\u000a        Challenge.

King is a\u000d\u000a      recognised authority on South Asia Religions, and has published on\u000d\u000a      Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam (2004, 2006, 2009, 2010). Since 2004 King's\u000d\u000a      work has examined structural violence within religion, with particular\u000d\u000a      reference to gender and Islam. From 2006 &#8212; 2010 Owen worked extensively\u000d\u000a      within Tibetan Buddhist communities in India, Nepal, Tibet, China, and\u000d\u000a      Mongolia, including working with the Tibetan Centre of Conflict Resolution\u000d\u000a      and supporting their capacity development. In addition Dr Owen's work on\u000d\u000a      Buddhism and ethnography has informed the methods of interaction by the\u000d\u000a      research team in Nepal (2008, 2010). His work has strongly influenced the\u000d\u000a      collaborative and reflexive nature of engagement with religious leaders,\u000d\u000a      organisations and faith-based NGOs (seeing them as active and\u000d\u000a      collaborative participants in the research community of practice), and the\u000d\u000a      modes of knowledge exchange used in workshops and seminars.\u000d\u000a    Since the launch of the `Winchester Centre of Religions for\u000d\u000a      Reconciliation and Peace' (WCRRP) in 2009 Owen and King have been engaged\u000d\u000a      in carrying out a comprehensive review of academic literature in the area\u000d\u000a      of religious peacebuilding and conflict transformation; and in assessing\u000d\u000a      the applicability of a range of Conflict Assessment Frameworks used by\u000d\u000a      peacebuilding organisations and actors. The have also collaborated with\u000d\u000a      academics and peace practitioners throughout the world (including Kosovo,\u000d\u000a      Sri Lanka, Nepal, India, Burma, Sierra Leone); engaged with religious\u000d\u000a      organisations and faith-based NGOs; and contributed to policy debates,\u000d\u000a      acting as consultants on religious peacebuilding to the Foreign and\u000d\u000a      Commonwealth Office.\u000d\u000a    The findings from this process which underpin the action research project\u000d\u000a      in Nepal include that:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Identification of the most effective areas of religious peacebuilding\u000d\u000a        requires a thorough understanding and analysis of the conflict context;\u000d\u000a      The construction of effective religious peacebuilding hierarchies and\u000d\u000a        networks needs to take account of the local history and context;\u000d\u000a      An effective tool for analysing the potential of religious\u000d\u000a        peacebuilding in a given context or conflict is urgently needed, and\u000d\u000a        considered essential and necessary by donors and aid organisations, and\u000d\u000a        religious groups and organisations involved in peacebuilding.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    More specifically since 2011 Owen and King have conducted three periods\u000d\u000a      of field work in Nepal assessing the problems and potentials of engaging\u000d\u000a      religion more effectively in the continuing peace process. The research\u000d\u000a      has been carried out in collaboration with the Department of Conflict,\u000d\u000a      Peace and Development Studies, Tribhuvan University, and the Nepalese NGO\u000d\u000a      Religions for Peace Nepal. The first phase of the project culminated in\u000d\u000a      June 2013 with a series of `problem solving' workshops attended by\u000d\u000a      religious leaders in areas of Nepal which have a history of\u000d\u000a      inter-religious violence, and a consultation in Kathmandu attended by key\u000d\u000a      national level stakeholders including religious actors, civil society\u000d\u000a      representatives, academics, policy makers and government officials.\u000d\u000a      Research insights and findings include: the identification of good\u000d\u000a      practice by faith-based NGOs and organisations involved in development and\u000d\u000a      peacebuilding; the need for the development of a non-hierarchal religious\u000d\u000a      peacebuilding network for sharing knowledge and resources; skills and\u000d\u000a      capacity building among grassroots religious leaders; a more co-ordinated\u000d\u000a      effort by government and faith groups to engage with religious militants;\u000d\u000a      more aid assistance for Muslim communities at risk of radicalisation; the\u000d\u000a      establishment of a national level `Commission for Religious Affairs';\u000d\u000a      reservation for religious representation on Local Peace Committees.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28119","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Context:\u000a      The Cairo Genizah manuscripts were found in a storeroom (Genizah) in\u000a      Cairo's Ben Ezra\u000a      Synagogue in the 19th century. They include new texts which\u000a      revolutionize our understanding of\u000a      the history of Judaism. The Jewish community now regards the Genizah\u000a      manuscripts as a precious\u000a      part of its cultural patrimony; Jewish Foundations such as Safra and\u000a      Friedberg have invested in\u000a      making them accessible. The Genizah manuscripts also constitute a\u000a      significant element of the\u000a      cultural assets with which the UK finds itself entrusted.\u000a    Pathways to Impact and Impact:\u000a    (1) Conservation. Pathways to impact: The Rylands Genizah\u000a      manuscripts are in a physically\u000a      poor condition. The Project conserved them: (a) materially:\u000a      manuscripts were cleaned,\u000a      flattened and encased in melinex by the conservation unit at the Rylands\u000a      Library; and (b)\u000a      digitally: digitization reduced the need physically to handle them.\u000a      Impact: Without this\u000a      conservation work substantial parts of the collection would have been\u000a      lost, and a significant\u000a      cultural asset would have been diminished and degraded.\u000a    (2) Presentation. Pathways to impact: Presentation was\u000a      achieved primarily by posting high-resolution\u000a\u0009  digital images on the University of Manchester Library website\u000a      (5.1). Selected\u000a      images are also available on the Princeton Geniza website (5.1), and,\u000a      since 2013, the\u000a      whole Rylands collection has been uploaded into the Friedberg Genizah\u000a      Project (5.1)\u000a      database which is not part of any HEI and is concerned with the assembly\u000a      on one server for\u000a      public use of this major cultural asset. Impact: This high\u000a      international exposure has opened\u000a      up the collection to journalists, writers, documentary makers,\u000a      school-teachers, and the\u000a      educated public for their own purposes (5.2)\u000a    (3) Interpretation. Pathways to impact: Interpretation is\u000a      achieved in three ways: (a) By\u000a      searchable English catalogue records attached to each image identifying\u000a      its content &#8212; thus\u000a      allowing users to discover texts relevant to any topic. (b) By a popular\u000a      website, explaining\u000a      the nature and importance of the Genizah in general, and the Rylands\u000a      Genizah in\u000a      particular. (c) By publications and lectures. Impact: The\u000a      Project's scholarly workshops\u000a      always included well-attended public lectures (5.3). In addition the\u000a      Project published a\u000a      newsletter and a blog, and the University issued press releases. These\u000a      have been\u000a      responded to in press and radio reports (both in the UK and abroad), and\u000a      by invitations\u000a      from a variety of public bodies, to address popular audiences (5.7).\u000a    (4) Capacity building. Pathways to impact: The Project\u000a      has built capacity to conserve and\u000a      disseminate other culturally significant artefacts. Impact: (a)\u000a      The in-house conservation\u000a      work has enhanced the capacity of the Rylands conservation unit to\u000a      conserve other delicate\u000a      artefacts. (b) The Project's personnel and state-of-the-art equipment laid\u000a      the foundations for\u000a      a permanent photographic unit within the Rylands Library, which is now\u000a      digitizing other\u000a      culturally significant artefacts (further below). (c) As one of the first\u000a      in the field of digitizing\u000a      Genizah manuscripts, the Project's adoption of rigorous standards of\u000a      metadata (based on\u000a      the Dublin Core) has provided a model for other libraries to follow (e.g.\u000a      Bodleian and\u000a      University Library Cambridge) (5.4 and 5.5).\u000a    Reach and significance of impact:\u000a      The research addresses two main constituencies beyond academia:\u000a    (1) The Jewish Community. Impact was first felt locally in the\u000a      sizeable Jewish community of\u000a      Manchester (`The Jews of Manchester regard themselves as very fortunate\u000a      that the\u000a      University is the custodian of an important repository of fragments which\u000a      comprise the\u000a      Rylands Cairo Genizah project', President, Zionist Central Council,\u000a      Greater Manchester;\u000a      [5.6]). The impact was delivered through public lectures at the Rylands\u000a      Library, and through\u000a      talks at communal educational events (e.g. Limmud; `Making the material\u000a      accessible\u000a      supplements the work that has already been done by the Department in\u000a      reaching out\u000a      beyond the University in making available this great stock of material to\u000a      the Jewish\u000a      Community and beyond in numerous educational projects, lectures and\u000a      forums', Trustee of\u000a      the Manchester Great New and Central Synagogue; [5.6]). From there the\u000a      impact rippled\u000a      out nationally and internationally. The pattern is illustrated by the\u000a      Dybbuk Exorcism: the\u000a      report on the University Website was picked up by the local Jewish\u000a      newspaper, the Jewish\u000a        Telegraph (5.7). The national Jewish Chronicle picked it up\u000a      from the Telegraph, and the\u000a      Jewish Daily Forward (New York) and the mass-circulation Israeli\u000a      papers, the Jerusalem\u000a        Post and Ha-Aretz, picked it up from the Chronicle.\u000a      The combined readership of these\u000a      papers runs into many tens of thousands.\u000a    (2) The Heritage Community.

(2) The\u000a      extent of the collection is now known to be greater than previously\u000a      estimated (15,000 mss as\u000a      against 11,000) (3.1; 3.2). (3) Clarifying the nature and content of the\u000a      collection has highlighted its\u000a      importance in hitherto unsuspected areas, e.g. the history of the Arabic\u000a      language in the early\u000a      modern period. (4) A method of digitizing, uploading and displaying, with\u000a      catalogue records,\u000a      manuscripts of this type, has been devised and demonstrated &#8212; a method\u000a      that remains at the\u000a      forefront of its field (e.g. in its thematically searchable records, and\u000a      in its work-in-progress mode of\u000a      cataloguing) (3.3: Introduction). (5) Numerous significant individual\u000a      finds include: (a) A Dybbuk\u000a      Exorcism &#8212; the only known description of an actual, historical exorcism of\u000a      this type, giving the\u000a      names of the parties (3.3: Bohak\/Smithuis).

Three are noteworthy.\u000a    First, there is impact in terms of the influence on the public\u000a        imagination and publishing industry. Alexander's and\u000a      Brooke's contributions to television (e.g., in 2013 for World Media Rights\u000a      on \"John Allegro\" for the Yesterday Channel) and radio and numerous\u000a      popular speaking engagements in museums, synagogues, and churches show\u000a      that their research is deemed (by those inviting them to speak) to be\u000a      changing popular perceptions of the character of Judaism from which\u000a      Rabbinic Judaism and Christianity derive. Brooke has given 29 public\u000a      lectures in the 2008-2013 assessment period, both nationally and\u000a      internationally, often on the Scrolls and the New Testament, one of his\u000a      research specialisms; some talks have been recorded for general public\u000a      access on legacy websites (5.1). Such changes in perception are\u000a      encouraged, e.g., in the popular introduction co-authored by Brooke: The\u000a      Complete World of the Dead Sea Scrolls (London: Thames &amp; Hudson,\u000a      2002), which has been translated into Dutch, German, Hungarian, Japanese\u000a      and Spanish, and sold widely (hardback 52,799 plus 7,954 paperback Book\u000a      Club editions in Germany and the USA) (5.2). Allegro's photographs,\u000a      catalogued by Brooke, are used extensively throughout the volume. As an\u000a      indication of the reach and significance of the work, a quotation from it\u000a      appeared on the wall at the entrance to the 2010 Scrolls exhibition at the\u000a      Science Museum of Minnesota. The book has sold so well that it is now in a\u000a      revised paperback edition (2011). Production\/sales figures (Sept 2013)\u000a      from Thames and Hudson for paperbacks since 2011: UK\/Europe 2,123; North\u000a      America 2,700; Foreign editions: 1,500 = 6,323. The book has thus\u000a      generated substantial income for publisher and booksellers alike (5.3) and\u000a      has become widely used on university and college syllabuses (5.4).\u000a    Second, the research group at Manchester is a point of reference for the\u000a      national and international funding of research and other activities\u000a      on the Scrolls. Though much of this impact concerns HEI, in three matters\u000a      there has been engagement with bodies outside HEI. (a) Brooke has been a\u000a      board member of the Dead Sea Scrolls Foundation which is involved in\u000a      raising and disbursing funds for activities involving the scrolls (5.5).\u000a      (b) Brooke has written confidential reports for the funding of museum\u000a      building projects and other activities, notably for a UK Foundation\u000a      intending to support a multi-million pound museum project in Israel\u000a      (2008). (c) As part of his role as advisor to the Nordic Network in Qumran\u000a      Studies, Brooke has had advice accepted concerning the identification and\u000a      publication of a private manuscript collection (the Sch&#248;yen Collection,\u000a      Oslo) (5.6); a comprehensive catalogue is forthcoming in 2014.\u000a    Third, the research at Manchester and beyond has had a significant direct\u000a      impact on heritage conservation and debates about how best to\u000a      treat fragile artefacts (5.7). The reach and significance of the analysis\u000a      of the Manchester fragments for impact on conservation have been taken\u000a      forward notably by two groups in relation to debates about conservation\u000a      and exhibiting policy. (1) With respect to parchment conservation\u000a      (including the Domesday Book) the work on the collagen of the Manchester\u000a      scrolls fragments was undertaken jointly with the Department of\u000a      Ophthalmology of the University of Wales, Cardiff: the ongoing impact of\u000a      this was referred to, e.g., by Prof Tim Wess on BBC 4, \"Material World,\"\u000a      April 2008. (2) The conservation implications of the chemical composition\u000a      of the fragments have been taken forward especially by Dr Ira Rabin and Dr\u000a      Oliver Hahn and their collaborators. Their ongoing observations on other\u000a      Scrolls are compared with the relatively stable Manchester fragments to\u000a      reveal rapid and accelerating deterioration in several cases (5.8). They\u000a      have incorporated their finds into reports that have influenced policy\u000a      changes (5.9) at the Shrine of the Book, Israel Museum, on the\u000a      conservation and exhibiting of the Dead Sea Scrolls with the overall aim\u000a      of reducing stress on ancient artefacts and enhancing their material\u000a      stability. `In the face of a growing body of research presented by Ira\u000a      [Rabin] and conservation scientists, The Shrine was faced with the\u000a      unavoidable decision to cease all IAA conservation treatment and loans\u000a      abroad' Hasia Rimon (5.10). The Shrine no longer uses the facilities of\u000a      the Israel Antiquities Authority. The 2012 policy decision, its research\u000a      basis, and its implications were showcased to all interested parties at\u000a      the three-day Green Symposium at the Israel Museum in April 2013.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study concerns the reach and significance of the impact that\u000a      the study of the Dead Sea Scrolls at the University of Manchester has had\u000a      in three areas. The first concerns the impact on public imagination and\u000a      the publishing industry, e.g., through (a) various media to influence the\u000a      understanding of faith communities about the founding moments of Judaism\u000a      and Christianity; and (b) the production of popular literature of\u000a      international appeal. The second concerns the impact on public policy in\u000a      the allocation of research and conservation funds in several countries.\u000a      The third concerns international policy-making in heritage conservation.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    University of Manchester\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Manchester (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Manchester","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"North West","UKPRN":10007798}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"3143244","Name":"Oslo"},{"GeoNamesId":"2643743","Name":"London"}],"References":"\u000a    (AOR &#8212; Available on request)\u000a    \u000a3.1.

Key researchers in the assessment period have been:\u000a      Prof. P. Alexander FBA (1993-2010); Prof. G. Brooke (1993-date); Dr. I.\u000a      Rabin (2005-2007); Dr. E. Pantos (2005-2007); Dr H. von Weissenberg\u000a      (2006-2007); Dr A. Feldman (2008-2011).\u000a    Since the first discoveries in 1947 the University of Manchester has been\u000a      in the forefront of Scrolls research. Since 1993 this has been led by\u000a      Profs Philip Alexander FBA (retired 2010) and George Brooke (3.6), both\u000a      members of the international team of principal editors (under the auspices\u000a      of the Israel Antiquities Authority). Since 1994 Alexander has edited the\u000a      Cave 4 versions of the Rule of the Community (3.1), a book on the\u000a      Qumran mystical texts (3.2), and other studies. Brooke has edited the Commentaries\u000a        on Genesis from Cave 4 (3.3), worked on the Scrolls and the New\u000a      Testament, and developed various methodological interests. Several other\u000a      scholars have undertaken related research at Manchester during the period,\u000a      including recently Dr Ira Rabin (2005 working over a period of short\u000a      visits with Dr E Pantos of the Daresbury Synchrotron; now continuing\u000a      similar research in Berlin (3.4), Dr Hanne von Weissenberg (2006-2007),\u000a      and Dr Ariel Feldman (ESRC Fellow 2008; Newton International Fellow\u000a      2009-2011). Overall, the underpinning research is based on ongoing textual\u000a      work producing principal editions of ancient manuscripts and\u000a      reflecting on these from a wide range of perspectives; in addition there\u000a      has been ongoing scientific analysis of the Manchester Reed\u000a      Collection of fragments.\u000a    Several international conferences on the Dead Sea Scrolls have been\u000a      hosted in Manchester: e.g., in 1996 a research symposium involving\u000a      archaeologists and textual scholars marked the fortieth anniversary of the\u000a      opening of the Copper Scroll in Manchester in 1955-56 (3.5). To\u000a      share research results with a wider public a major Exhibition on the Copper\u000a        Scroll and related artefacts was held at the Manchester Museum: the\u000a      Copper Scroll was borrowed from Jordan. Brooke has also built up in\u000a      Manchester a series of key primary sources for research, e.g., the\u000a      Allegro Qumran Photograph archive, widely used by publishers and museums\u000a      (most recently the Drents Museum, Assen for its 2013 Scrolls Exhibition)\u000a      is housed at the Manchester Museum.\u000a    Brooke was responsible for identifying and cataloguing the images. The\u000a      John Rylands Library of Manchester now houses archival material such as\u000a      the William H. Brownlee Archive and, since 1997, the Reed Collection of\u000a      Dead Sea Scroll fragments (Manchester is the only UK institution to\u000a      possess actual fragments of the Scrolls). The Reed fragments have formed\u000a      the basis for several projects concerned with heritage conservation:\u000a      scientists from the laboratories in Daresbury and in Berlin have worked in\u000a      tandem with collagen experts from the University of Wales, Cardiff. Brooke\u000a      has been the anchor for this leading research which has been widely\u000a      showcased, e.g., at Tate Modern at the launch of the House of Lords\u000a      Science and Technology Ninth Report on Science and Heritage by Baroness\u000a      Sharp in November 2006.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28210","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1733045","Name":"Malaysia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    De Nobili House\u000d\u000a    Barnes moved to Southall in 1999 in order to work from a multicultural\u000d\u000a      part of the capital and thus integrate the practical and experiential side\u000d\u000a      of interreligious relations with the more academic side at Heythrop\u000d\u000a      College. The De Nobili House (DNH) centre in Southall began in 2000 as an\u000d\u000a      initiative of the British Province of the Society of Jesus, of which\u000d\u000a      Barnes is a member. The community of Jesuits also took on responsibility\u000d\u000a      for the Catholic parish of St Anselm's to give the work of DNH credibility\u000d\u000a      within the Catholic community and visibility to other local faith\u000d\u000a      communities &#8212; Sikh, Muslim, Hindu and Buddhist. Informed by Barnes's\u000d\u000a      research on how to realise the transformative potential of interreligious\u000d\u000a      encounter through hospitality and generous engagement, DNH seeks to\u000d\u000a      practise dialogues of `common life' and `common action'. The key is the\u000d\u000a      nature of the hospitable `safe space' defined by the house itself; the\u000d\u000a      organisation and strategy of DNH supports a culture of respectful\u000d\u000a      engagement between individuals. The project was captured in a DVD film in\u000d\u000a      2008, A Year in the Life of the Jesuits (12,000 downloads).\u000d\u000a    Involvement in and contact with DNH activities has had an important\u000d\u000a      formative effect on local faith leaders. There are around sixty faith\u000d\u000a      communities and religious groupings within the square mile that covers the\u000d\u000a      centre of Southall; since 2008, representatives of more than half of these\u000d\u000a      have either visited the house to speak or have hosted groups visiting them\u000d\u000a      from DNH. A leader of the local Sikh scout group comments that his contact\u000d\u000a      with DNH has `strengthened the message of joint working'. Another notes\u000d\u000a      that encounter with other believers at DNH has `opened up areas of\u000d\u000a      awareness that I would have taken for granted otherwise'. Another speaks\u000d\u000a      of the challenge to faith inspired by contact with DNH: `I am a better\u000d\u000a      person; [it has] helped me to understand Sikhism better'. In 2012, a\u000d\u000a      Southall Faiths Forum was established &#8212; a sign, after years of serious\u000d\u000a      racial and ethnic tension going back to the late 1970's, that the everyday\u000d\u000a      dialogues of common life and action espoused by DNH have had some effect.\u000d\u000a      A highly significant impact has been on the Catholic community itself &#8212;\u000d\u000a      now more confident of its own mission to promote faith and justice in a\u000d\u000a      multi-cultural environment. The ethos of thoughtful concern for other\u000d\u000a      communities now pervading St Anselm's is evidenced in a video about the\u000d\u000a      parish made in July 2013.\u000d\u000a    DNH and St Anselm's offer hospitality to school groups who visit\u000d\u000a      Southall. During the REF period, at least one group came every fortnight\u000d\u000a      in term time. A regular visitor is St Mary's, Ascot. Notes of appreciation\u000d\u000a      include the following from one of the teachers: `When we visited with Year\u000d\u000a      7, one year, an 11-year old Catholic girl on the school trip asked Father\u000d\u000a      Michael \"why does God create so many faiths?\" His reply \"God loves\u000d\u000a      diversity\" has reached legendary status in the school and is often quoted\u000d\u000a      in relation to the study of Genesis 1, in Year 8, and in the GCSE\u000d\u000a      Religious Prejudice module.... On their return from DNH, one year 7 group\u000d\u000a      created posters expressing the Christian values underpinning interfaith\u000d\u000a      dialogue. By coincidence a school inspector came to the class and was\u000d\u000a      clearly moved by the depth of response the visit to DNH had inspired in\u000d\u000a      the girls.'\u000d\u000a    Other visits come from university students, RE teachers, clergy training\u000d\u000a      courses and a Catholic volunteering organisation that holds an intensive\u000d\u000a      training programme every summer for young people spending a year and more\u000d\u000a      on teaching and social justice projects overseas. Feedback indicates that\u000d\u000a      the visit to DNH is a major stimulus not just in understanding the\u000d\u000a      `richness of other religions' but `in learning how to open up a fruitful\u000d\u000a      conversation'. In preparing to take that step into another culture, `Fr\u000d\u000a      Michael is an exemplary guide, modelling for us a courteous way to\u000d\u000a      approach such different cultures and religions.' Another comments that she\u000d\u000a      gained `a better understanding of how to show more respect appropriately\u000d\u000a      in other cultural religious settings.' An organiser adds that, `The\u000d\u000a      volunteers learn so much and it helps them to prepare for their own\u000d\u000a      experience of crossing cultures, and each year I too find the experience\u000d\u000a      opens my mind and heart to the other.'\u000d\u000a    One highly significant development of the work of DNH is a\u000d\u000a      Christian-Muslim marriage support group. While the co-ordinator of the\u000d\u000a      group has worked with Barnes and his primary collaborator, Bro Daniel\u000d\u000a      Faivre, since the late 1990's, the group's impact continues throughout the\u000d\u000a      REF period. The meetings at DNH take place two or three times a year,\u000d\u000a      touching a dozen or so couples each time. Of its very nature, the topics\u000d\u000a      being discussed &#8212; particularly where they touch on family and local\u000d\u000a      community issues &#8212; are extremely delicate. Conversation about family\u000d\u000a      problems as well as theological questions are made possible, says one\u000d\u000a      couple, by the `radical hospitality' they encounter at DNH: `people feel\u000d\u000a      free in such a welcoming setting to speak of some really difficult\u000d\u000a      personal issues.' The aim of the group, which created a website to\u000d\u000a      facilitate communication between members and provide resources and links,\u000d\u000a      is not only to support those affected by Muslim-Christian marriage, but\u000d\u000a      also to represent the group to the media and to develop links with\u000d\u000a      interfaith and educational bodies. The website homepage notes that the\u000d\u000a      group `couldn't have got this far without the help of wise people who have\u000d\u000a      made the interfaith world so much more than a pious hope. Our interfaith\u000d\u000a      facilitators have bequeathed to us the 'language' of tolerance that makes\u000d\u000a      it possible for us to talk at all, and a wider community of people who\u000d\u000a      think both faiths matter, so that we really do not feel alone, but most of\u000d\u000a      all they give us the courage \"not to cease from exploration\".' This work\u000d\u000a      with Christian-Muslim couples, and the ideas and principles from Barnes's\u000d\u000a      research that support it, has been noticed and taken up by the Christian\u000d\u000a      Muslim Forum. A set of `ethical guidelines' which began with the pastoral\u000d\u000a      practice exercised at DNH is provided as a resource on its website, and\u000d\u000a      was discussed in 2012 on Al Jazeera TV (2300 hits).\u000d\u000a    Faiths Together\u000d\u000a    Arranging visits to places of worship and religious centres is an\u000d\u000a      effective way of helping people cross boundaries. While much preparation\u000d\u000a      is needed, the results can be considerable &#8212; most obviously in teaching\u000d\u000a      the skills of engagement and becoming sensitised to the stages involved in\u000d\u000a      entering into another religious world. Informed by Barnes's research into\u000d\u000a      these skills and their development, the Faiths Together project was a\u000d\u000a      training course originating as a co-operative exercise between the Centre\u000d\u000a        for Christianity and Interreligious Dialogue at Heythrop College and\u000d\u000a      DNH. It was set up by Barnes, with the support of Faivre and the Southall\u000d\u000a      Jesuit community, as a practical process of embedding these skills in\u000d\u000a      people of different faiths by bringing them into direct dialogue and\u000d\u000a      collaboration with each other. It was supported by a grant of &#163;66,000 from\u000d\u000a      HEIF, while a subsequent grant from a private trust of &#163;30,000 enabled the\u000d\u000a      production of DVD presentations illustrating key aspects of the programme.\u000d\u000a    Applicants were invited through publicity on the Heythrop website and\u000d\u000a      various interfaith groups, and participants from across the religious\u000d\u000a      spectrum were selected by interview as those considered most likely to\u000d\u000a      resource their own communities and neighbourhoods. The first group of 24\u000d\u000a      included a variety of Christian denominations, five Muslims, a Jew and a\u000d\u000a      Buddhist; the repeated course working with a smaller group included a\u000d\u000a      Hindu and a Sikh alongside the same proportion of Christians and Muslims.\u000d\u000a      The principle of honest and respectful interreligious conversation quickly\u000d\u000a      became the pedagogical and theological focus. After initial sessions at\u000d\u000a      Heythrop, the focus moved to Southall where local people became involved\u000d\u000a      as speakers, facilitators and, most importantly, hosts for visits &#8212; making\u000d\u000a      them less objects of curiosity than active participants in the learning\u000d\u000a      process: `I experienced Faiths Together as an ongoing expression of\u000d\u000a      interfaith practice at work. It is an inclusive space with an emphasis on\u000d\u000a      openness, hospitality and respect for the \"other\".'\u000d\u000a    The project concluded with four short films reprising the major themes,\u000d\u000a      and made available with discussion notes through the Heythrop College\u000d\u000a      website. A number of groups committed to developing good interfaith\u000d\u000a      relations have used the films (downloaded 150 times) and notes as\u000d\u000a      discussion starters. Three participants collaborated in introducing some\u000d\u000a      of the ideas to schools in north London; a teacher in Scotland speaks of\u000d\u000a      using the DVDs in RE classes to `open up the nitty-gritty reality of\u000d\u000a      religious pluralism'.\u000d\u000a    As intended, participants in Faiths Together went on to develop their own\u000d\u000a      initiatives on the basis of the project, expanding the impact of the\u000d\u000a      thinking behind the project into new and highly diverse contexts. A Muslim\u000d\u000a      comments: `I have since become a Member of the board for the Cambridge\u000d\u000a      Coexist Leadership programme. ... I have introduced Malaysian government\u000d\u000a      officials to Judaism and Jews.'

For example, a Catholic sister has facilitated seminars for\u000d\u000a      members of her religious congregation, colleagues and friends at\u000d\u000a      Roehampton University.

The impact falls mainly into two types. The first is\u000d\u000a      generated by the activities in and around Southall, focused on developing\u000d\u000a      new forms of religious expression and the potential for change in\u000d\u000a      religious practice and interreligious understanding in the local area. The\u000d\u000a      second flows from a project that brought together a number of individuals\u000d\u000a      from different religious traditions to learn how to practise the skills of\u000d\u000a      interreligious relations. The impact includes personal and professional\u000d\u000a      development as well as the processes of learning with and between persons\u000d\u000a      from different religious communities in a variety of contexts.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    Heythrop College, University of London\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Heythrop College","InstitutionName":"Heythrop College","PeerGroup":"G","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007765}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2643743","Name":"London"},{"GeoNamesId":"2637490","Name":"Southall"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000aTheology and the Dialogue of Religions (Cambridge: Cambridge\u000d\u000a      University Press, 2002)\u000d\u000a      `The Work of Discovery: Interreligious Dialogue as Life-long Learning', Spiritus,\u000d\u000a      11 (2011), 224-46 Interreligious Learning (Cambridge: Cambridge\u000d\u000a      University Press, 2012)\u000d\u000a    \u000a","ResearchSubjectAreas":[{"Level1":"22","Level2":"4","Subject":"Religion and Religious Studies"},{"Level1":"20","Level2":"5","Subject":"Literary Studies"},{"Level1":"20","Level2":"2","Subject":"Cultural Studies"}],"Sources":"\u000d\u000a    DNH activity\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000aA Year in the Life of the Jesuits, Part 5: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=noXnkxpcZIo\u000a\u000d\u000a      St Anselm parish video: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7gcu5IX2zB0\u000a\u000d\u000a      Sikh scout leader, Southall\u000d\u000a      Jesuit Missions, Wimbledon\u000d\u000a      Head of Religious Studies, St Mary's School, Ascot\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Muslim-Christian marriage group\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Family specialist, Muslim-Christian Forum UK\u000d\u000a      http:\/\/www.christianmuslimforum.org\/index.php\/resources\u000d\u000a      http:\/\/www.aljazeera.com\/indepth\/features\/2012\/12\/2012122795639455824.html\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Faiths Together\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      http:\/\/www.heythrop.ac.uk\/outreach\/faiths-together.html\u000d\u000a      Muslim Law Sharia Council\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    ","Title":"\u000d\u000a    Religious Pluralism and Interreligious Dialogue in Southall, West London\u000d\u000a    ","UKLocation":[],"UKRegion":[{"GeoNamesId":"2638360","Name":"Scotland"}],"UOA":"Theology and Religious Studies","UnderpinningResearch":"\u000d\u000a    The underpinning research was conducted by Prof Michael Barnes. Since at\u000d\u000a      least the turn of the millennium, his work has been concerned with\u000d\u000a      developing an approach to the theology of religions which arises from\u000d\u000a      reflection on the lived experience of interreligious relations. A\u000d\u000a      theoretical basis was worked out in his Theology and the Dialogue of\u000d\u000a        Religions (2002) and has been given more sustained attention in\u000d\u000a      terms of praxis in Interreligious Learning (2012).\u000d\u000a    In the last chapter of the earlier book, Barnes describes a practice of\u000d\u000a      Christian faith which builds up a Christian habitus, an instinct\u000d\u000a      of hospitality and welcome to the other. He ends by picking up the ancient\u000d\u000a      Patristic theme of the `seeds of the Word' in order to commend the\u000d\u000a      resources of Christian faith for generous engagement with the other. The\u000d\u000a      latter book continues that project through the prism of lived examples. In\u000d\u000a      particular, it owes much to the experience of doing interreligious\u000d\u000a      contextual theology that begins `in the middle of things'.\u000d\u000a    In style and method, this approach has similarities to `comparative\u000d\u000a      theology', the close reading of the texts of another religious tradition\u000d\u000a      from a consciously Christian theological perspective. The question\u000d\u000a      addressed in Barnes's research &#8212; as much in writing as in co-operative\u000d\u000a      practices of learning &#8212; is how to read intelligently, prayerfully,\u000d\u000a      theologically, so that what is being assimilated becomes a source of\u000d\u000a      wisdom beyond the particular community of faith where, strictly speaking,\u000d\u000a      it can be said to belong. Unlike `comparative theology', however, the\u000d\u000a      focus of his research is less on the `life of texts' than on the `life of\u000d\u000a      a community' which texts support. He uses `texts' in a loose sense to\u000d\u000a      refer not just to canonical scripture and authoritative commentary, but to\u000d\u000a      the forms of practice which inhabit the narratives of faith and give them\u000d\u000a      flesh and blood reality. The focus is on interpersonal engagement and the\u000d\u000a      ideas, events, meetings and particularly places which sound echoes and\u000d\u000a      resonances of the known in the unknown and provoke an imaginative\u000d\u000a      re-engagement with tradition.\u000d\u000a    Although the research outputs are written from a consciously Christian\u000d\u000a      angle, the general principles and &#8212; more particularly &#8212; the virtues of\u000d\u000a      interreligious relations which they support apply across the spectrum of\u000d\u000a      religious traditions. Much of Barnes's work in the last decade describes\u000d\u000a      instances of interreligious learning which fit within a pattern of three\u000d\u000a      `moments' or shifts in the relationship with whatever is `other'. The\u000d\u000a      first section of Interreligious Learning, `Meetings', opens up the\u000d\u000a      terms of an interreligious social imaginary; the second, `Crossings',\u000d\u000a      taking `translation' as the primary metaphor for a process of growing\u000d\u000a      engagement with the other, focuses on the spirituality of dialogue and\u000d\u000a      develops an interiority in which desire is channelled by the virtue of a\u000d\u000a      humble and hopeful waiting upon ultimate mystery, however that is\u000d\u000a      conceived; the third, `Imaginings', is concerned with the return, back\u000d\u000a      across religious boundaries, to grapple with a disarranged yet strangely\u000d\u000a      enhanced sense of self.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28211","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Law's project of identifying and diagnosing doubtful intellectual\u000a      strategies for defending belief\u000a      systems and creating a false impression of reasonableness has obvious\u000a      practical importance.\u000a      Raising public awareness of such strategies enables people to think more\u000a      critically and reflectively\u000a      about topics of fundamental importance. Law's 'Evil God Hypothesis', his\u000a      critique of Plantinga's\u000a      EAAN and his examination of criteria employed by Biblical historians with\u000a      respect to Jesus also raise\u000a      questions about the extent to which theistic, Christian and\u000a      atheistic\/naturalistic positions are\u000a      rationally held. These are on-going debates that are obviously of\u000a      considerable public interest and\u000a      significance. Law's research has had far-reaching and significant impact\u000a      on popular discussion and\u000a      understanding of these issues, as will be detailed.\u000a    Reach\u000a    Law has offered versions of his philosophical arguments in popular books,\u000a      notably Believing Bullshit:\u000a        How Not To Get Sucked Into An Intellectual Black Hole (Prometheus,\u000a      2011) and Humanism, A Very\u000a        Short Introduction (Oxford University Press, 2011), as well as\u000a      contributing popularisations to\u000a      Blackford &amp; Russell (eds.) 50 Voices of Disbelief: Why We Are\u000a        Atheists (Wiley-Blackwell, 2009) and\u000a      Warburton &amp; Edmonds (eds.) Philosophy Bites (Oxford University\u000a      Press, 2010, 2012). Total sales of\u000a      these books prior to July 2013 come to 34,581. Law's books received\u000a      high-profile reviews, including\u000a      in THES and The Guardian, and widespread online\u000a      discussion, and his contribution to 50 Voices (on\u000a      the Evil God Challenge) was singled out by several reviewers, including in\u000a      the biggest US\u000a      ecumenical journal First Things and the Polish broadsheet\u000a      newspaper Gazeta.\u000a    Law's work has also been the subject of numerous reviews and articles\u000a      published both in print\u000a      and online. These include a Newsweek magazine article (4th\u000a      September 2011), which focused on\u000a      Law's thinking on irrational belief systems, a double-page spread\u000a      interview in New Scientist\u000a      magazine (13th June 2011), an article in the `Life and Style'\u000a      section of The Hindu newspaper (29th\u000a      March 2012, circulation 1.5 million) and an interview on irrationality in\u000a      the Swedish national\u000a      newspaper Dagens Nyheter (13th November 2012). These\u000a      few examples display the geographical\u000a      reach that Law's ideas have had, as well as their relevance to and impact\u000a      within a variety of religious\u000a      and cultural contexts.\u000a    Law's research has also been made accessible to the public via the\u000a      publication of ideas and\u000a      papers on his blogs. These have received a cumulative total of over\u000a      961,000 views and generated\u000a      around 15,000 comments since 2008. On his academic blog, `The Evil God\u000a      Challenge' has been the\u000a      most popular &#8212; accessed over 4,000 times; on his main blog, `Evidence,\u000a      Miracles and the Existence\u000a      of Jesus' has been accessed 23,390 times. His main blog is accessed from\u000a      around the world, most\u000a      notably the US, but it also draws significant traffic from Germany (30,000\u000a      views), Russia (9,000\u000a      views), and India (4,000 views).\u000a    The publication of material relating to Law's academic research has\u000a      promoted impassioned but\u000a      content-driven and content-focused discussion from those inside and\u000a      outside academia, inside and\u000a      outside religious traditions, and from a number of different countries.\u000a      Explicit discussion of Law's\u000a      central claims and arguments appears on over 90 blogs and websites with a\u000a      cumulative total of over\u000a      11,000 comments. Discussions range from Bayesian logic to how Law's\u000a      challenges might be\u000a      incorporated into Quaker praxis, demonstrating the variety of debates and\u000a      audiences Law's research\u000a      impacts upon. One example is Reasonable Faith, the website of\u000a      William Lane Craig, recognised as\u000a      one of the world's leading apologetic Christian theologians. Craig has\u000a      published a number of articles\u000a      online engaging directly with Law's work, notably on the Evil God\u000a      Hypothesis and the historicity of\u000a      Jesus. The website receives an average of 500,000 visitors per month and\u000a      articles directly engaging\u000a      Law's work are viewed an average of 1,230 times a month. A second example\u000a      is Right Reason, the\u000a      website of Dr Glenn Peoples, a Christian philosopher. Peoples has written\u000a      about Law's Evil God\u000a      Hypothesis, and recorded a podcast discussing it. The podcast has been\u000a      downloaded 2,670 times\u000a      and generated 95 comments. A third example, Why Evolution is True,\u000a      is the website of Dr Jerry A.\u000a      Coyne, a Professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at the\u000a      University of Chicago. Coyne\u000a      is an atheist who has published analyses of Law's `The Evil God\u000a      Hypothesis' and `Evidence,\u000a      Miracles and the Existence of Jesus'. These pieces have generated 285\u000a      comments. Finally, The\u000a        Malcontent's Gambit is the personal website of Alan Litchfield, a\u000a      layperson with a background in\u000a      technical journalism, who hosts podcasts in the interest of promoting\u000a      secularism. Litchfield's podcast\u000a      featuring Law has been downloaded 26,077 times. The websites of Craig,\u000a      Peoples, Coyne and\u000a      Litchfield serve as examples for many other blogs and websites where\u000a      discussion of Law's ideas\u000a      can be found. They demonstrate that discussion has been generated on both\u000a      sides of the\u000a      theism\/atheism debate and has engaged people from a number of different\u000a      disciplines and\u000a      backgrounds, professional and lay. Law's research has also found a\u000a      platform in 51 YouTube videos,\u000a      with a cumulative total of 279,408 views, 11,300 comments, and 3,580\u000a      'likes'. Multiple audio\u000a      recordings and podcasts are accessible online, with cumulative downloads\u000a      in excess of 397,500.\u000a      These are largely recordings of public lectures or debates that Law has\u000a      participated in, but also\u000a      include independent third-party discussion of his ideas.\u000a    Law has presented his research concerning the rationality of theism and\u000a      atheism\/naturalism,\u000a      especially `The Evil God Challenge', in numerous public forums in the UK\u000a      and abroad. These have\u000a      included lectures and debates presented in collaboration with high-profile\u000a      universities and institutes,\u000a      and lectures to schools and non-institutional societies. He has spoken to\u000a      over 4,600 school children,\u000a      and the cumulative total for audience figures for other talks and\u000a      discussions since 2008 exceeds\u000a      2,250 (excluding those mentioned below). One example of a high-profile\u000a      talk is Law's debate with\u000a      Craig in Westminster Hall in October 2011 as part of Craig's Reasonable\u000a        Faith tour, which was\u000a      discussed extensively in the media. BBC Radio 4, The Daily Mail\u000a      and The Telegraph all gave the\u000a      debate prior mention, and Law's Evil God Challenge was singled out for\u000a      mention afterwards in The\u000a        Independent. The debate, in front of an audience of 1,900, was\u000a      broadcast on Premier Christian\u000a      Radio, and discussed and referenced extensively online, including in\u000a      numerous blog posts, reviews,\u000a      and even argument maps. The audio and video recordings of the debate have\u000a      been accessed over\u000a      37,881 times. A further example is Law's discussion with Richard Dawkins\u000a      in the Sheldonian\u000a      Theatre in February 2013 to a full house exceeding 500, in which Law again\u000a      drew significantly on his\u000a      research. The discussion has been made available in a number of places on\u000a      YouTube. The full\u000a      videoed discussion has been viewed 116,482 times, generating 1,344\u000a      comments and 1,385 `likes'.\u000a    A final example of the reach of Law's research into the rationality of\u000a      belief systems is Law's\u000a      public voice in the debate regarding potentially problematic beliefs\u000a      within school curricula, as seen in\u000a      his piece for Channel 4's 4Thought TV (22 November 2011) on the\u000a      teaching of Young Earth\u000a      Creationism in schools.\u000a    Significance\u000a    The significance of Law's impact is evidenced by public recognition of\u000a      his work, notably:\u000a    (i) Humanism, A Very Short Introduction was the winner of the\u000a      $1,000 Morris D. Forkasch award for\u000a      Best Humanist Book of 2011. Shortly after its publication, Law was elected\u000a      a Laureate of the\u000a      International Academy of Humanism.\u000a    (ii) Law's many public appearances have all been by invitation. He has\u000a      had repeat invitations to\u000a      appear on BBC television and radio programmes, such as The Big\u000a        Questions, Steve Wright in the\u000a        Afternoon and others (with cumulative viewing\/listening figures of\u000a      over 1,348,000). He has been\u000a      invited to contribute multiple times to Oxford THINK week. He has had\u000a      repeat appearances on\u000a      Closer to Truth, an increasingly influential television series and\u000a      award-winning online media archive\u000a      concerned with 'cosmos, consciousness and God', currently broadcast on\u000a      around 170 US public\u000a      television stations and in several other countries. Total monthly viewings\u000a      of Closer to Truth in\u000a      January 2013 was recorded at 184,994,020. Law has had repeat invitations\u000a      to speak on\u000a      Unbelievable, an award-winning programme hosted by Premier\u000a      Christian Radio which aims to\u000a      promote conversation between Christians and non-Christians on topics\u000a      concerned with the viability\u000a      of the Christian faith, with an average weekly listening audience of\u000a      138,000.\u000a    (iii) Law's Evil God Hypothesis is becoming increasingly established in\u000a      the accepted catalogue of\u000a      arguments for atheism. Evidencing this, the University of Cambridge's Investigating\u000a        Atheism website\u000a      includes a version of the Evil God Hypothesis alongside well-established\u000a      arguments for atheism. In\u000a      The Huffington Post (8 June 2013), Nathan Schneider's `10 Proofs\u000a      That Will Change How You Think\u000a      About God' put Law's Evil God Hypothesis number four on his list.\u000a    (iv) Law regularly receives emails, comments and tweets from members of\u000a      the public, which include\u000a      testimonies of how his work has impacted their philosophical studies,\u000a      their need for teaching\u000a      resources and their personal intellectual journeys regarding the question\u000a      of theism\/atheism and\u000a      related issues. The following examples are indicative:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aI've used your evil God hypothesis often with A level\u000a          students-always well received.

He\u000a      focuses particularly, though not exclusively, on the rationality of (i)\u000a      atheism\/naturalism, (ii) traditional\u000a      monotheism and (iii) a range of other religious and non-religious beliefs,\u000a      including belief in the\u000a      existence and miracles of Jesus, Young Earth Creationism and Christian\u000a      Science. Law examines\u000a      the intellectual strategies people employ to defend and support beliefs to\u000a      which they are often\u000a      powerfully drawn but which may, in reality, be unreasonably held. He has\u000a      mapped and investigated\u000a      a number of strategies that he suggests recur across, and play a pivotal\u000a      role in sustaining, many\u000a      irrational systems of belief.\u000a    Law is particularly interested in strategies used to deal with\u000a      counter-evidence and counter-arguments.\u000a      These strategies include appeals to mystery, to scepticism, and the\u000a      application of a\u000a      strategy Law calls `But it fits!'. Law argues that these strategies are\u000a      employed, for example, in many\u000a      standard theistic responses to the problem of evil, in many defences of\u000a      Young Earth Creationism\u000a      and also in various non-religious belief systems.\u000a    One central focus of Law's research is the evidential problem of evil. He\u000a      argues that this problem\u000a      has been significantly underestimated by theists both inside and outside\u000a      academe. He develops a\u000a      version of the argument (`The Evil God Challenge') that aims to make much\u000a      clearer the inadequacy\u000a      of many standard apologetic responses to the problem. Engaging with\u000a      responses made by both\u000a      professional philosophers and by the lay public, he argues that they fail\u000a      to salvage traditional\u000a      monotheism from the charge of irrationality.\u000a    Another thread to Law's research into the rationality of certain\u000a      religious beliefs questions criteria\u000a      commonly employed within the discipline of Biblical Studies to determine\u000a      what might reasonably be\u000a      believed about Jesus. Law develops a philosophical argument to show that,\u000a      contrary to much\u000a      popular expert and non-expert opinion, the existence of Jesus is open to\u000a      reasonable doubt.\u000a    In addition, Law has defended atheism and naturalism against the charge\u000a      of irrationality\u000a      developed in a well-known and much utilized line of attack by Alvin\u000a      Plantinga. Plantinga's\u000a      Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism (EAAN), which is regularly\u000a      appealed to by religious\u000a      apologists outside academia, aims to show that atheism\/naturalism is\u000a      intellectually self-defeating\u000a      and is thus irrationally held. Law argues that the EAAN fails, arguing on\u000a      the basis that there are\u000a      certain conceptual links between belief content and behaviour.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28286","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3923057","Name":"Bolivia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The findings that emerged from Morris' ground-breaking research,\u000a      subsequently consolidated by further evidence, constitute significant and\u000a      far-reaching impact in two major respects. Firstly, it has enhanced the\u000a      educational and professional achievement of many of the Deaf candidates\u000a      who passed through the BSL Certificate in Christian Ministry programme, as\u000a      evidenced by testimonials and career paths, and facilitated the greater\u000a      visibility and aspirations of a formerly `hard to reach' section of the\u000a      churches. Secondly, it has influenced the organizational cultures and\u000a      practices of a major Christian denomination in the UK and an international\u000a      ecumenical organization towards greater awareness of the needs of Deaf\u000a      people and adoption of principles of best practice in terms of inclusion.\u000a    As a member of the Church of England's Committee for Ministry among Deaf\u000a      and Disabled People, Morris established a partnership between CMDDP, the\u000a      University of Chester and other ecumenical networks of Deaf Christians,\u000a      which set out to widen participation for Deaf people in HE. This\u000a      initiative resulted in a 60-credit level one Certificate in Christian\u000a      Ministry (http:\/\/www.signsofgod.org.uk\/data\/signsofgod\/downloads\/course.pdf).\u000a      Morris received two grants from the Philosophy and Religious Studies\u000a      Subject Centre of the HEA for the development (2004-05) and evaluation\u000a      (2005-06) of the programme, publishing the outcomes of the research in Discourse,\u000a      the subject centre journal, in 2006. The main finding of this research was\u000a      that an educational programme which met the specific linguistic and\u000a      educational needs of Deaf people &#8212; in medium of delivery, deployment of\u000a      Deaf tutors and modes of assessment &#8212; could transform the performance of\u000a      Deaf candidates. This programme thus served as an innovative example of\u000a      best practice and a model for further patterns of theological training and\u000a      ministerial formation.\u000a    A typical example of this programme's impact on its students is a\u000a      Jersey-based candidate who, having completed the Certificate in 2007, went\u000a      on to be the first Deaf person to be licensed as a lay reader in the\u000a      Diocese of Winchester in 2012. As a result of her achievement, a local\u000a      Deaf charity, Earsay, created an achievement award in her name to be\u000a      presented annually. She testifies to the confidence-building nature of her\u000a      educational experience and its decisive role in providing the foundation\u000a      for moving into licensed ministry.\u000a    Morris' reputation in the field of theology and disability also led to an\u000a      invitation to participate in two international consultations of the World\u000a      Council of Churches (WCC) on disability and the churches, in Geneva (2003)\u000a      and La Paz, Bolivia (2007). Aspects of his published work and work in\u000a      progress were influential on the reports published subsequently, one of\u000a      which (Just and Inclusive Communities) was co-authored with Michael\u000a      Blair. The methodology and scope of this report reflected many of Morris'\u000a      emergent concerns, such as the inclusion of illustrative narratives that\u000a      highlighted Deaf Christians' lived experiences; the `anatomy of exclusion'\u000a      in the churches; and the emphasis on theological anthropology and the imago\u000a        Dei as the basis of recognition.

The Consultation on Just and\u000a        Inclusive Communities in La Paz, Bolivia in January, 2007 and the\u000a      document that came out of it, continue to be significant landmarks, both\u000a      for the ways in which these gave expression to Deaf perspectives and for\u000a      the creative way they sought to articulate a practical theology of\u000a      disability that could be implemented by member churches. This process has\u000a      set the trend for subsequent theological affirmations of those with\u000a      disabilities, some of which can be found at http:\/\/www.oikoumene.org\/en\/what-we-do\/people-with-disabilities-edan.\u000a      The La Paz report continues to be one of the most frequently-accessed WCC\u000a      documents. Throughout the period 2008 to 2013, it has enabled the\u000a      programme to approach issues of discrimination and marginalisation as\u000a      fundamentally theological, and not simply moral or political, challenges.\u000a      Building on stories and experiences of people suffering from and\u000a      struggling against marginalisation has been the essential methodological\u000a      approach of this theological activity.\u000a    The theological work that ensued through these consultations'\u000a      considerations of disability is also considered to have been a landmark\u000a      towards the establishment of the Ecumenical Disability Advocates' Network\u000a      (EDAN) (http:\/\/www.oikoumene.org\/en\/what-we-do\/people-with-disabilities-edan),\u000awhich\u000a      last met in June 2013.

Whilst the\u000a      impediments to academic attainment confronting Deaf people had been\u000a      well-documented, Morris' combination of participant-observation in a\u000a      number of Deaf congregations and extended interviews (in BSL) with 80 Deaf\u000a      and 16 hearing informants offered in-depth analysis of how cultural\u000a      attitudes towards people with disabilities affected their day-to-day\u000a      experiences as practising Christians.\u000a    Adopting a cultural-linguistic understanding of Deafness, in contrast to\u000a      social models of disability, Morris argues that Deaf people's exclusion\u000a      from mainstream activities, including access to educational attainment,\u000a      occurs as the result of discrimination and lack of accommodation on the\u000a      part of hearing culture. However, whilst Deaf people have traditionally\u000a      been marginalized, Morris' research also suggests that British Sign\u000a      Language is a rich and autonomous source of theological ideas and concepts\u000a      which lie at the heart of a distinctive Deaf theology, liturgy and\u000a      spirituality. The research thus identifies a number of ways in which\u000a      barriers to participation might be removed; and in particular, how Deaf\u000a      Christians might be empowered and supported in their ministry (Morris,\u000a      2008: 119-125). One core principle is to ensure that Deaf people\u000a      themselves are fully consulted and involved in all aspects of policy and\u000a      practice: especially access to and interpretation of Biblical texts and\u000a      the development of liturgies and other resources for worship, spirituality\u000a      and theological formation (Morris, 2008: 116-117).\u000a    Morris' research therefore focuses on the experiences of those who\u000a      identify as Deaf Christians and how their aspirations and theological\u000a      understandings are shaped by the notion of a `Deaf culture' with a\u000a      distinctive (but misconstrued) linguistic identity; and the differences\u000a      between conventional theological concepts and a unique `theology without\u000a      words' relying instead on `vision, space, touch and relationship' (Morris,\u000a      2008: 157). These findings were then applied to the field of theological\u000a      education, examining how a partnership between an HEI and the Church of\u000a      England might facilitate a radically new approach to the design and\u000a      delivery of initial ministerial formation for Deaf candidates. In this\u000a      discussion, Morris consolidates his critique of educational endeavours\u000a      which seek to include Deaf students yet continue to discount the\u000a      importance of sign language as their primary mode of communication\u000a      (Morris, 2006a). He demonstrates how the access programme at the\u000a      University of Chester reflected an alternative understanding, privileging\u000a      students' facility in BSL and seeking to build on methods and models of\u000a      theological reflection and formation previously identified in his\u000a      fieldwork amongst Deaf congregations.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28287","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    HPP's impact strategy incorporates academics, organizations and\u000a      professionals, and Anonymous Fellowships themselves.

TSPs describe\u000a      themselves as `spiritual not religious', but the use of the terms `God',\u000a      `God of our understanding' and `Higher Power' in several of the Twelve\u000a      Steps of recovery lead many professionals, as well as addicts themselves,\u000a      to conclude that the steps are explicitly religious or even specifically\u000a      Christian. This factor has been shown to be the most significant\u000a      impediment to accessing TSPs\/Fellowships, amongst professionals and\u000a      addicts alike (Day et al, 2010). Dossett's article (2013) argues that in\u000a      TSPs, there is a shift from explicit Christian terminology to that of\u000a      non-religious spirituality. She locates this change in the context of the\u000a      emergence of non-religious or secular spiritualties in late- or\u000a      post-modern Western society, along with the predominance of a subjective\u000a      turn in religious belief and affiliation.\u000a    Dossett then places this analytical framework alongside empirical\u000a      findings from a qualitative study conducted as Phase 1 of HPP of\u000a      ex-residents from a Treatment Centre in West Wales in sustained recovery.\u000a      This study shows that whilst TSPs and membership of an Anonymous\u000a      Fellowship(s) are central to their recoveries, the majority of them speak\u000a      of a `spiritual' approach rather than any kind of religious conversion.\u000a      Whilst these initial conclusions cannot be extrapolated to those in TSP\u000a      recovery generally because of the small sample involved, they are of\u000a      considerable interest because they suggest that (for this group)\u000a      characterisations of TSPs as creedal or religious in the traditional\u000a      sense, or requiring a conversion experience, are inappropriate. Work being\u000a      undertaken by the HPP will thus produce data and develop theory to inform\u000a      reflection on the language used within Fellowships and generate an\u000a      evidence-based understanding of the phenomenology of `non-religious\u000a      spirituality' amongst those undertaking TSPs.\u000a    Phase 2 of the qualitative research started in January 2013 and is\u000a      supported by a grant from the Sir Halley Stewart Trust (&#163;25.8K) over two\u000a      years. It involves extending the pilot study to addicts from a wider\u000a      breadth of cultures, social backgrounds, treatment centres and Anonymous\u000a      Fellow-ships. Participants will be drawn from treatment centres in the UK\u000a      and Anonymous Fellowship members from the UK, Ireland, Europe and North\u000a      America. Data from these different groups will enable comparative studies\u000a      across fellowships and treatment modalities, as well as across the\u000a      demographic categories of age, gender, ethnicity, nationality, wealth,\u000a      social class, education and other markers of social inclusion\/exclusion.\u000a      To date, the data from this study (70 participants) indicate that 75%\u000a      would regard themselves as \"spiritual\" rather than \"religious\".\u000a    These findings are already being actively disseminated to, and\u000a      influencing, a wide range of audiences, as described below.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28885","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Impact on debate about the theology and practice of mission in the\u000d\u000a        Anglican church [5.8, 5.9]\u000d\u000a    For the Parish has sold 3,137 copies from September 2010 until\u000d\u000a      August 2013.

These were\u000d\u000a      later disseminated to 50 stewards at Truro Cathedral and their education\u000d\u000a      officer, which led to the\u000d\u000a      Truro Cathedral Treasury Project. This is a new Interpretation\u000d\u000a      method and reorganization of\u000d\u000a      visitor experience via video and barcodes to read objects. This is\u000d\u000a      directly the result of Milbank's\u000d\u000a      research and the talks given at Ely, based on For the Parish. The\u000d\u000a      Education Officer at Truro [5.6]\u000d\u000a      came to see Milbank, and developed the practical project from Milbank's\u000d\u000a      theological methodology;\u000d\u000a      Milbank also worked with interns on the project. The project has gained EU\u000d\u000a      and lottery money,\u000d\u000a      and has continued 2011-2013 with support for University of Falmouth Film\u000d\u000a      Studies. Southwell\u000d\u000a      Archbishop's Palace Project has also used the Treasury Project in their\u000d\u000a      National Lottery bid which\u000d\u000a      proved successful in April 2013. The projects offer a methodology as well\u000d\u000a      as a practical\u000d\u000a      application of reordering ideas of time, pace and narrative for cathedral\u000d\u000a      visitors.\u000d\u000a    Impact on Anglican ministerial education:\u000d\u000a    Canon Prof. Martyn Percy writes:\u000d\u000a    `the book has a reasonable claim to be one of the most influential\u000d\u000a      critiques of contemporary\u000d\u000a      fads and fashions in missiology over the last decade.

The primary research\u000d\u000a      finding used the\u000d\u000a      linguistic turn in twentieth-century philosophy to argue that the major\u000d\u000a      flaw in both the report and\u000d\u000a      consequent Anglican organisational changes was an attempt to separate form\u000d\u000a      and content,\u000d\u000a      practices and beliefs: instead, `to become a Christian is to cease to be\u000d\u000a      an atomized individual but\u000d\u000a      to enter the life of communion' (p.133). The role of material reality and\u000d\u000a      relationships embodied in\u000d\u000a      the parish should be central to mediating the life and mission of the\u000d\u000a      church.\u000d\u000a    Milbank, who was appointed as Lecturer in Literature and Religion in\u000d\u000a      2004, developed her\u000d\u000a      own approach to religion and literature in which genres and tropes are\u000d\u000a      bearers of theological\u000d\u000a      meaning in their stylistics, as explored in Chesterton and Tolkien as\u000d\u000a        Theologians (2007) [3.1]. She\u000d\u000a      subsequently extended this approach to the church, presenting her findings\u000d\u000a      first at the `Returning\u000d\u000a      to the Church' conference, St Stephen's House, Oxford, 5-7 January 2009,\u000d\u000a      where she and Davison\u000d\u000a      were encouraged to develop this further. For the Parish (2010)\u000d\u000a      gave an account of the Church as\u000d\u000a      a narrative and a habitus as well as an institution. The authors\u000d\u000a      planned and researched the whole\u000d\u000a      book; Davison drafted Chapters 1-5, while Milbank drafted 6-9, the\u000d\u000a      introduction and conclusion,\u000d\u000a      with Milbank performing substantial editing of 1-5 and chapter organising\u000d\u000a      of 4 &amp; 5. Milbank's\u000d\u000a      contribution involved a new model of mission in relation to culture in\u000d\u000a      terms of uncovering and\u000d\u000a      transformation, `unveiling what is truly real' (p.128) rather than\u000d\u000a      implantation and acculturation. The\u000d\u000a      book also used her research into cultural theory and virtue ethics to\u000d\u000a      delineate a theology of time,\u000d\u000a      space, narrative and ethics, achieved through the mediation of material\u000d\u000a      reality and through\u000d\u000a      recourse to theological realism.\u000d\u000a    Milbank has also developed her reconstrual of the relation of religious\u000d\u000a      practice to culture in\u000d\u000a      relation to the imagination [3.3]. She seeks to found a contemporary\u000d\u000a      reasoned defence of Christian\u000d\u000a      belief on a recuperation of the `magic idealism' of German Romanticism and\u000d\u000a      again seeks to show\u000d\u000a      how literary and artistic tropes can also be modes of reasoning, which\u000d\u000a      avoid the positivism and\u000d\u000a      rationalism of some apologetic modes.\u000d\u000a    Conferences linked to For the Parish have also resulted in\u000d\u000a      another book chapter, `Returning\u000d\u000a      to the Parish' [3.4], which grounds its theology in a recuperation of the\u000d\u000a      local in politics and\u000d\u000a      ecclesiology. The research is moving towards a wholesale renewal of the\u000d\u000a      Christian imaginary, and\u000d\u000a      giving such practical developments an intellectual rationale.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28886","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Influencing policy formation via `Red Tory' and `Blue Labour'\u000a        movements:\u000a      Milbank's research has proposed a religious politics that would invert our\u000a      present right-wing economic and left-wing cultural politics for a more\u000a      conservative set of social values and a more radical economic system based\u000a      on community, reciprocity and the common good.

He\u000a      was quickly promoted to a peerage soon after he took up and propagated\u000a      Milbank's `blue socialism': the story of Milbank's influence and Glasman's\u000a      ascent has been documented by the journalist Rowenna Davis, Tangled Up\u000a        in Blue. [5.5] Lord Glasman writes:\u000a    `Professor John Milbank has had a profound impact on the political\u000a      position that has come to be known as Blue Labour. He spent some very\u000a      important time with me and urged me to \"think paradoxically\" and that has\u000a      been a very significant feature of the academic and political work. A\u000a      seminar was created at Oxford University called \"The Labour Tradition and\u000a      the Politics of Paradox\" which generated 120,000 downloads in a week when\u000a      it was published as an ebook by Lawrence and Wishart [5.6]. Since then,\u000a      the ideas of Professor Milbank have informed a range of debates and policy\u000a      initiatives within the Labour movement from welfare reform to foreign\u000a      policy.' [5.7]\u000a    Similarly, Jon Cruddas MP, Labour Party Policy Coordinator, writes:\u000a    John Milbank is one of the main thinkers behind the emerging post-liberal\u000a      politics in Britain. ... His thinking has influenced in equal measure the\u000a      Red Tory project of Phillip Blond and the Blue Labour movement founded by\u000a      Maurice Glasman. Blue Labour's work on an ethical market, a mutualist\u000a      approach to welfare and a focus on vocationalism for all rather than just\u000a      equality of opportunity, has been considerably shaped by Milbank's work\u000a      and so, through the impact of Blue Labour, has in turn influenced debates\u000a      within the Labour Party, including the Policy Review. Moreover, he has\u000a      made public interventions in the mainstream media and at public\u000a      conferences in which he has developed his own brand of Christian\u000a      socialism. It can be summarised as a post-liberal, post-secular politics\u000a      that overcomes both neo-liberal capitalism and authoritarian statism in\u000a      the direction of a civic polity and a civil economy. ... By arguing for\u000a      the primacy of the social and the ethical over the political and the\u000a      economic, Milbank has helped to redefine the battleground of ideas in\u000a      British politics. [5.8]\u000a    Milbank was invited to chair the ResPublica Trust to redirect it towards\u000a      being a non-party-political charity dedicated to postliberal politics in\u000a      general and with close links to religious bodies, Christian and\u000a      non-Christian. He has also addressed a meeting at the House of Lords on\u000a      this topic in relation an alternative version of Lords' reform on 29th\u000a      February 2012, launching the ResPublica publication to which he\u000a      contributed, Our House: Reflections on Representation and Reform in\u000a        the House of Lords [5.2], alongside, amongst others, the Minister\u000a      for Political and Constitutional Reform. This was instrumental in\u000a      inspiring the Alternative Proposal published and promoted by a number of\u000a      members of the Joint Committee for the House of Lords Reform Draft Bill,\u000a      arguing that the Second Chamber should embody a participative democracy\u000a      and reflect the diversity of communities in the country beyond political\u000a      and regional divides [5.9].\u000a    Milbank has also stimulated interest in and contributed to public\u000a      awareness of moral issues in party politics: he appeared on BBC Radio 4's\u000a      The Moral Maze: 8pm 2 December 2009 `The moral significance of\u000a      science in political and moral debate in society'; 8pm 4 July 2012: `Moral\u000a      leadership and public virtue in light of the bank crisis'. Eight articles\u000a      he contributed on his political thinking to ABC online between March 2012\u000a      and May 2013 generated significant engagement and debate with 1,031 Likes\u000a      on Facebook, 303 Re-Tweets. Of 370 comments, those generated by his essay\u000a      after the death of Thatcher include: `an outstanding contribution to the\u000a      debate', and `I don't often agree with John Milbank, but this essay is\u000a      superb' [5.10]. Complementing this media engagement with his work, Milbank\u000a      participates in regular public debate. Recent examples include: a debate\u000a      on gay marriage, Westminster Hall, London, 18 April 2013; a conference on\u000a      religion and democracy, Coll&#232;ge des Bernardins, Paris, 20 April 2013; a\u000a      debate on Robert &amp; Edward Skidelsky's book, How Much is Enough?\u000a        Money and the Good Life, House of Lords, 23 April 2013; Blue Labour\u000a      Midlands seminar, 5 July 2013; seminar for Demos think tank 20th\u000a      anniversary celebrations, `Making markets moral', 17 July 2013. The themes\u000a      of these events reflect Milbank's engagement with a diverse range of\u000a      constituencies, and the application of his research to wide-ranging\u000a      contemporary political, philosophical and theological debate.\u000a    Influencing church social teaching\u000a      Religious bodies have been attracted by his finding that a notion of the\u000a      common good needs a notion of objective values held in common and by his\u000a      call for an inherently moral market in the article, `A Real Third Way' in\u000a      The Crisis of Capitalism, based on talks given to many church\u000a      audiences [5.13]. Of his many other talks to church audiences [5.11], his\u000a      addresses to the international Communion and Liberation Catholic\u000a      lay movement have been particularly influential: his talk to several\u000a      thousand at their annual meeting in Italy (Rimini, August 2008) led to\u000a      subsequent annual invitations (2009-13), interviews for their journal Traces\u000a      and Foundation for Subsidiarity, a talk to their subsidiarity\u000a      movement of business people in Milan (March 2012) and a seminar in the\u000a      h&#233;micycle of the European Parliament (`National States within the European\u000a      Polity' 16 December 2009). Milbank's research on the common good has also\u000a      involved a valuing of the churches themselves as co-ordinators and\u000a      creators of community, which has led the Church of England to commission a\u000a      report on the role of churches in society from ResPublica, Holistic\u000a        Mission, launched jointly by the Minister for Civil Society, Nick\u000a      Hurd MP, and the Archbishop of Canterbury, 10 July 2013 [5.3]: the\u000a      influence of Milbank is seen throughout the report.\u000a    Contributing to theological curricula on an international scale\u000a      The Radical Orthodoxy movement is widely studied in theological curricula\u000a      at universities worldwide. Its influence has been summarised by Melanie\u000a      Newman in her article on the movement in THES 16th pril\u000a      2009: `A revival of interest in theology is evident in academic and\u000a      political debate, and John Milbank and the radical orthodoxy movement are\u000a      spreading the news' [5.12].

Developing this approach, he has argued\u000a      in more recent papers that there is in reality no theologically neutral\u000a      social theory or practice. Both `right' and `left' in political terms are\u000a      essentially secular categories which assume a foundation of either\u000a      isolated individual freedom or the manipulation of impersonal force. What\u000a      is omitted is a civil economy grounded in mutual benefit as well as\u000a      competition, gift as well as contract, vocation as well as employment, and\u000a      communal celebration as well as labour &#8212; all underpinned by a theological\u000a      conception of the common good.\u000a    Milbank was appointed as Professor of Religion, Politics and Ethics at\u000a      the University of Nottingham in 2004 as part of a strategic campaign to\u000a      attract world-changing researchers; specifically, his task was to launch\u000a      and direct the Centre of Theology and Philosophy. In this role, Milbank\u000a      has sought to apply his theological vision to contemporary political\u000a      institutions. At the heart of his work is this research question: `Why do\u000a      we have a lack of social justice under the present political system?' He\u000a      has concluded that this has to do with the public dominance of secularist\u000a      notions: the essential collusion of both right and left in their shared\u000a      commitment at once to atomic or collectivist individualism and at the same\u000a      time, to impersonalism, has become apparent in the shift to a market\u000a      state. Milbank proposes that the challenge to this new conjuncture has to\u000a      come from religion, which alone is capable of resisting the\u000a      desacralisation of people and nature upon which a secular and oligarchic\u000a      politics and economics ultimately rests. He has therefore developed a\u000a      postliberal `politics of paradox' which seeks to combine realising the\u000a      maximum flourishing of all with a hierarchic educational guidance towards\u000a      virtue. This would effectively recover a genuine Christian `socialism'\u000a      which cannot be placed on a right-left spectrum. In conclusion, an\u000a      incisive summary of Milbank's research has been given by the Labour\u000a      Party's head of policy:\u000a    `Over the last decade, his writings have combined a critique of secular\u000a      liberalism and capitalism with an alternative political vision. Milbank's\u000a      particular contribution centres on a Christian socialism that appears\u000a      paradoxical in terms of current political divisions &#8212; blending demands for\u000a      greater economic justice with a renewed sense of the importance of social\u000a      tradition, locality and personal honour. He was one of the first to argue\u000a      that right-wing economic liberalism and leftwing cultural liberalism are\u000a      two halves of the same picture, and to propose instead a more\u000a      associationist and teleological approach in both domains, focussed upon an\u000a      attempt to achieve greater human flourishing. ... Building on Polanyi,\u000a      Milbank has put forward original ideas about how to re-embed the global\u000a      'market-state' into the `complex space' of intermediary institutions and\u000a      the social bonds and civic ties they uphold &#8212; a vision that has, directly\u000a      and indirectly, influenced the Labour Party's thinking about the 'Good\u000a      Society' in general and welfare reform in particular.' [5.8]\u000a    Milbank's research on politics at Nottingham has been developed initially\u000a      through a series of papers given through an extensive, frequent, and\u000a      prolonged series of speaking engagements worldwide, from Mexico to the\u000a      Ukraine, in academic settings both inside and outside theology, in church\u000a      settings, and in political meetings. To facilitate Milbank's research, the\u000a      department has supported him as a research professor relieved of\u000a      undergraduate teaching and administration. Many of the key papers have\u000a      been developed into journal articles or book chapters, including\u000a      `Liberality versus Liberalism', in The Future of Love [3.2] &#8212; his\u000a      inaugural lecture at Nottingham, his contributions to The Radical\u000a        Orthodoxy Reader [3.3], `Culture and Justice' [3.4], `A Real Third\u000a      Way' [3.5], and `Against Human Rights' [3.6]. While many further existing\u000a      papers are still to be collected in a volume entitled Geopolitical\u000a        Theology, his narrative of the historical co-development of theology\u000a      and political theory has just been published as Beyond Secular Order\u000a      [3.1].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28887","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2264397","Name":"Portugal"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Cunningham's book has had an exceptionally wide public reception for an\u000a      academic monograph.

Cunningham was then invited to speak at Lambeth Palace\u000a      to an audience including politicians (MPs and Lords), journalists,\u000a      celebrities, scientists, clergy, and school children in July 2009 &#8212; this\u000a      event was mentioned in The Times, the Guardian and The\u000a        Tablet, and Madeleine Bunting, who chaired it, wrote an article in\u000a      the Guardian citing Cunningham's work (which in itself generated\u000a      144 comments) [5.1]. This series of events at once illustrates the\u000a      contribution made by Cunningham's work to thought within the church, and\u000a      describes the further diffusion of his ideas beyond the church and into\u000a      public discourse through the media.\u000a    Informing the public debate &#8212; talks, sermons, reading groups\u000a    The American Vineyard Church theological conference 2012, consisting of\u000a      pastors, lay people and theologians, held a panel on the book, Darwin's\u000a        Pious Idea.

Darwin's Pious\u000a        Idea may be one of those books.'), Times Literary Supplement,\u000a        commonweal, Symposia, Times Higher Education Supplement, hristian\u000a        Century, The Guardian [5.2], Perspectives on Science And\u000a        Christian Faith, National Catholic Register, The Tablet, Isis, Cosmos,\u000a        First Things, Christian Books, CBA Retailers and Resources, The Times,\u000a      and Scientific and Medical Network Review.\u000a    Reviews, discussions and symposia on the book have taken place on various\u000a      blogs, including: Biologos Foundation [5.3] By Common Consent; Regent\u000a      College: Cosmos; Vox Nova; The Socialist.Net; Logic of the Cross; The\u000a      Intention Experiment; Bensonian, A Greater Courage.\u000a    All of this activity demonstrates the reach, uptake and use by\u000a      educational, theological, faith and science communities along with the\u000a      wider public. This circulation of his research findings through public\u000a      discourse is sometimes at quite a technical level of sophistication. For\u000a      example, in a review of Darwin's Pious Idea reposted from the TLS\u000a      on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation website [5.4], Rowan Williams\u000a      wrote: `[T]he presumption of an omnicausal gene leads into the\u000a      fallacy-soaked morass of \"misplaced concreteness.\" A gene is not a thing,\u000a      not a biological billiard ball: it is a cluster of information-carrying\u000a      material. Its unity or identity is given by the nature of the information\u000a      it carries; it does not exist as such independently of the chain of\u000a      \"instruction\" in which it functions.'\u000a    Informing the public debate &#8212; BBC documentary\u000a    One of the principal ways in which the research has reached a wider\u000a      audience is through the BBC2 documentary, `Did Darwin Kill God?', written\u000a      and presented by Conor Cunningham, and aired at 7pm, Tuesday 31 March 2009\u000a      [5.5]. The documentary, while including interviews with the likes of\u000a      Daniel Dennett and Richard Dawkins, does also express clearly Cunningham's\u000a      own research findings. It received the Sandford St Martin Trust Merit\u000a      Award for Religious Broadcasting. The chair of the judging panel making\u000a      the award commended Cunningham's documentary for the way in which it\u000a      provided `relief from the ritualised combat of extremists such as Richard\u000a      Dawkins and assorted creationists, who are fighting a battle many think is\u000a      more suited to the early 19th century than the 21st'.\u000a      He also suggested that the high viewing figures (1.06 million) for such a\u000a      `demanding' programme attested to `its success in engaging viewers with\u000a      abstract argument', confirming its role in contributing knowledge and\u000a      insight to wider public debate, and, as the section above suggests, beyond\u000a      audiences one might expect for theological research. [5.6] It has\u000a      subsequently been shown in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, and has\u000a      been further disseminated by non-academic individuals copying it onto\u000a      Youtube in seven different locations, generating a further 10,000 views\u000a      and heated discussion, involving over 600 comments. [5.7] The documentary\u000a      is now a bestseller on Classroom Video's Secondary Education catalogue for\u000a      summer 2013 [5.8].\u000a    Cunningham has given a number of interviews on radio, television, and for\u000a      websites [e.g 5.9], including contributing to a series of BBC Knowledge\u000a      Worldwide programmes, `Does God Exist?', with separate contributions aired\u000a      6,13 &amp; 20 March 2012, two appearances on BBC1 `The Big Questions' (6\u000a      June 2010, 25 March 2012), and `Sunday Morning Live' (31 July 2011).\u000a      Overall, his media work has generated correspondence from teachers,\u000a      scientists, lay people, and philosophers who have reacted positively to\u000a      his argument that science and religion can exist side by side. Sixth form\u000a      teachers write to say they are showing the documentary in their classes\u000a      [available at 5.5 &amp; 5.8].

He pursued this research up to and\u000a      beyond the publication of his award-winning monograph Darwin's Pious\u000a        Idea in 2010. He was initially appointed as a postdoctoral fellow to\u000a      coordinate the new Centre of Theology and Philosophy, and was promoted to\u000a      Lecturer in 2007. He took an interdisciplinary approach, learning major\u000a      advances and theories in evolutionary biology, molecular biology,\u000a      developmental biology and systems biology, while also exploring theologies\u000a      of creation as well as philosophy, specifically philosophy of science,\u000a      phenomenology and metaphysics. In conversation with his Nottingham\u000a      colleague Professor John Milbank, he developed a theological approach to\u000a      metaphysics out of Christian doctrines of Creation and Incarnation,\u000a      drawing heavily on the Church Fathers and Aquinas. This research was also\u000a      supported through the conversations arising from a series of major\u000a      conferences, of which Cunningham was the principal organiser, held under\u000a      the auspices of Nottingham's Centre of Theology and Philosophy:\u000a      Transcendence and Phenomenology (Nottingham, 2005), The Return of\u000a      Metaphysics (Granada, 2006), The Grandeur of Reason (Rome, 2008), and What\u000a      is Life? (Krakow, 2011).\u000a    The principal research finding was a suspension of the common modern\u000a      distinction between the natural and supernatural upon which much of the\u000a      science and religion debate is premised. Creation gives an account of the\u000a      natural order that guides and directs scientific research without\u000a      conflicting with it. This called into question attempts to build a\u000a      metaphysics out of evolutionary theory, as done by ultra-Darwinists, as\u000a      well as attempts to formulate notions of God as an instrumental designer\u000a      on the basis of a scientistic metaphysics, as performed by Creationists.\u000a      The strong conclusion was that there is no conflict between the orthodox\u000a      doctrine of creation and contemporary research into evolution. Moreover,\u000a      careful attention to recent advances in biology made possible a more\u000a      constructive and open account of Darwinism, no longer wedded to reductive\u000a      assumptions about selfish genes.\u000a    The main research output was the 563 page monograph, Darwin's Pious\u000a        Idea [3.1], alongside articles responding to Richard Dawkins [3.2\u000a      &amp; 3.3], and other articles on the metaphysics of creation and\u000a      naturalism [3.4, 3.5 &amp; 3.6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"29569","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Impact from the research was primarily generated by working directly with\u000a      leading financiers and business leaders in two projects (the first leading\u000a      into the second), instigated by the Archbishop of Westminster and\u000a      president of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales,\u000a      Vincent Nichols.\u000a    The ethics of finance\u000a      The first project began in October 2009. Cowley was involved by the\u000a      Archbishop in a private seminar of leading international financiers, viz.\u000a      the Chairmen of Barclays Bank, Lloyds TSB, Roundtable Investment Partners,\u000a      HSBC Holdings, the Treasury Select Committee, and Marshall Wace; the\u000a      Presidents of the CBI, PPF Partners Ltd, and Schroders; the CEO of Tudor\u000a      Capital UK, the Global Head of Healthcare JP Morgan, the Director of\u000a      Rothschild's, and senior representatives of McKinsey &amp; Co, Goldman\u000a      Sachs International, Deloitte, Schroders, Syntel, and Bain &amp; Co. Also\u000a      present were a former Chief of the Defence Staff, an Auxiliary Bishop in\u000a      Westminster, the Vice- President and Assistant General Secretary of the\u000a      Catholic Bishops' Conference, and Professor Stefano Zamagni, adviser to\u000a      the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace on the papal encyclical Caritas\u000a        in Veritate.\u000a    The meeting was convened to discuss the implications of Caritas in\u000a        Veritate, which seeks to place economic and financial activity in\u000a      the broadest context of human flourishing and fulfilment. The encyclical\u000a      outlines a vision for how `integral human development' can be promoted\u000a      through economic development and the opportunities afforded by\u000a      technological change. Cowley was consulted in the preparatory note that\u000a      raised questions for discussion, which drew heavily on her research into\u000a      the ethics of financial markets, in particular, her analyses of (i) the\u000a      relationship between the nature of derivatives, the use of risk assessment\u000a      models and remuneration packages, and (ii) the relationship between market\u000a      assumptions, the nature of the regulatory framework and the nature of\u000a      moral decision-making. The purpose of the preparatory note and the\u000a      discussions that followed, in which Cowley participated fully, was to help\u000a      senior personnel to reflect on how these relationships operate and how\u000a      behaviours might be modified.\u000a    The financiers were very positive about the first seminar, and requested\u000a      a second seminar, convened in March 2010. They identified the need for a\u000a      clear statement of their responsibilities as financial leaders and for a\u000a      more philosophical statement of the underlying issues. Both were produced,\u000a      with Cowley's involvement. The Assistant General Secretary of the Catholic\u000a      Bishops' Conference drafted a letter, in consultation with Cowley, which\u000a      was published in the Financial Times on 28 September 2010,\u000a      entitled `Financial leaders pledge excellence and integrity'. It was\u000a      promoted by key participants from the seminars, and attracted significant\u000a      support from other City leaders who co-signed. Archbishop Nichols comments\u000a      that Cowley's `detailed knowledge of both the Church's social teaching and\u000a      the financial economy enabled her to act as a vital interpreter. She has\u000a      greatly helped to shape and focus the work we have done to ensure that it\u000a      is fully grounded in the reality of the market economy and the practical\u000a      decisions of business leaders. At the same she has helped our secular\u000a      audience to understand and engage with the moral and ethical challenge of\u000a      CST [Catholic social teaching].'\u000a    The project was taken up by the Lord Mayor of the City, Nick Anstee, at a\u000a      conference at Mansion House on 4 October 2010, at which the Financial\u000a        Times letter was a focus for reference and discussion. Archbishop\u000a      Nichols spoke at the conference, and his talk was informed by previous\u000a      discussion with Cowley. The next Lord Mayor of the City, Michael Bear,\u000a      took the work forward in a project entitled `Trust and Values in the\u000a      City', leading to a symposium in July 2011, a further conference in\u000a      October 2011, a report on the conference, and the establishing of several\u000a      further initiatives, including the City Values Forum and the Integrity\u000a      Resources website. The Financial Times letter and the conference\u000a      of October 2010 were identified as the origin of these development in a\u000a      press release from the City of London Corporation on 27 October (`City\u000a      institutions respond to demands for greater ethical accountability', note\u000a      1).\u000a    To further extend the reach of impact, Cowley also engaged extensively\u000a      with the media, including a 30-minute television interview for HARDTalk\u000a      broadcast on BBC News and BBC World News on 9 September 2009; The\u000a        Greed Imperative, a 30-minute programme written and presented by\u000a      Cowley and broadcast on Radio 4 on 23 May and 28 June 2010; a four-page\u000a      feature interview in the monthly journal Islamic Banker in\u000a      February 2010; and numerous appearances on Radio 4 and World Service panel\u000a      discussions on the ethics of finance, including flagship programmes such\u000a      as `Beyond Belief', `The Sunday Programme', `The Moral Maze', and `Front\u000a      Row'.\u000a    Blueprint for Better Business\u000a      The second project was initiated in 2012, when Cowley was involved in\u000a      wider discussions hosted by Archbishop Nichols, not confined to the\u000a      financial sector, but on the purpose of business. These discussions\u000a      involved a working group that included senior representatives from\u000a      JPMorgan, KPMG, private equity firms, a former Permanent Secretary for\u000a      Tax, and Cowley. This work led to an initiative called `Blueprint for\u000a      Better Business?', with members of the working group becoming the `core\u000a      group' running the initiative. The Archbishop comments that Cowley `plays\u000a      a key role as a member of the core group guiding this initiative'. The aim\u000a      is to turn the insights of Catholic social teaching and the tradition of\u000a      virtue ethics into a body of knowledge that can be accessed by business\u000a      leaders in a practical way. Cowley was involved in drafting and critiquing\u000a      all the documents produced in creating the initiative, including a 20-page\u000a      document `Better Business' prepared for the conference, a Framework of\u000a      Principles, and Archbishop Nichols's speech at the public launch. This\u000a      work drew heavily on Cowley's research in the application of Catholic\u000a      social teaching to business ethics in the first half of her monograph. She\u000a      continues to assist in drafting and refining documents, ensuring that they\u000a      both remain true to the tradition of Catholic social teaching and yet use\u000a      everyday language and provide clear and actionable principles that those\u000a      of all faiths and none can readily adopt.\u000a    The initiative was publicly launched at a conference on 18 September\u000a      2012, at which the CEOs of McKinseys, Vodafone, and Unilever addressed an\u000a      audience of 200 business executives, mostly from `the next generation' of\u000a      CEOs &#8212; those on leadership development programmes in the top 20- 30\u000a      companies internationally. After the conference, a number of work streams\u000a      commenced, with funding raised and staff hired to co-ordinate. Cowley\u000a      leads the group working with institutional investors. The work has\u000a      included meetings with the CEO of Hermes Capital and other international\u000a      players on how investors can encourage companies to embrace the principles\u000a      outlined in the Framework as a practical way to enhance long term value,\u000a      influence the allocation of capital and encourage seeking both a financial\u000a      return and a return to society. This was followed, in spring 2013, by work\u000a      with two of the largest asset managers in the world on how institutional\u000a      investors can bring about change by changing the metrics demanded from\u000a      fund managers. The group also introduced an interfaith dimension to its\u000a      work by organising a meeting involving Chairmen and CEOs of different\u000a      faiths and Jewish, Muslim and Sikh theologians.\u000a    Cowley was also centrally involved in work with Unilever and another\u000a      large multinational to refine and shape a version of the Framework that\u000a      can be used within a business, e.g. with employees, as well as a meeting\u000a      with 25 CEOs of the largest UK companies.\u000a    As of the end of July 2013, the Blueprint core group was in preparation\u000a      for two major events: a conference in October on `Business Success Through\u000a      Serving Society', with speakers to include, among others, the Archbishop\u000a      of Canterbury, the former CEO of Oxfam, the Director General of the CBI,\u000a      and business leaders from Unilever, Hermes, Blackrock, Credit Suisse,\u000a      Morrisons, KPMG, Barratt's, and a former Director of the Institute of\u000a      Fiscal Studies; and a `soft launch' of the Framework of Principles at\u000a      Davos in January 2014.\u000a    As the list of companies and executives with whom Cowley has worked\u000a      indicates, the reach of the impact of Cowley's research extends throughout\u000a      the international financial and business sector. Its significance cannot\u000a      be exaggerated, as her work is at the vanguard of developments in business\u000a      ethics at a time when there is more interest and dynamism in this field\u000a      than ever before.

The findings were the\u000a      culmination of several years of observation of the financial markets, but\u000a      more specifically of work carried out in 2004-5.\u000a    In the monograph that presented the findings, Cowley critiqued standard\u000a      business ethics and mainstream economics, demonstrating that these\u000a      prevented an adequate understanding of the particular features of the\u000a      finance sector. The first half of the book set out a framework for\u000a      understanding business and markets, the individual and common good,\u000a      especially in the light of insights from Catholic social teaching. In the\u000a      second half, following an examination of the nature and philosophy of\u000a      money, Cowley presented a framework for examining the finance sector as a\u000a      specific and distinctive sector of the economy. She examined the ethical\u000a      implications of the use of derivatives, risk and cross-border capital\u000a      flows for the finance sector itself and for the wider economy, and\u000a      criticised the regulatory framework used by the Financial Services\u000a      Authority, particularly as this was related to the individual financial\u000a      practitioner through the Approved Persons regime.\u000a    In particular, she argued that the ways in which risk measurement,\u000a      distribution and evaluation were carried out, and the models used for that\u000a      assessment, were fundamentally flawed. Giving a number of examples, she\u000a      argued that risk was not dispersed through the system as the sector and\u000a      mainstream economics claimed. Through the examination of the use of\u000a      derivatives and the sector's volatility models, she argued that the whole\u000a      financial system could be destabilised and suggested some corrective\u000a      measures. Having looked at the systemic elements, she then focussed on the\u000a      individual financial practitioner, both from the point of view of\u000a      regulation by the FSA and by an examination of the employment and\u000a      remuneration practices of the sector, including the use of bonuses. She\u000a      highlighted areas where current assumptions and practices left the\u000a      individual financial institution and the sector as a whole vulnerable to\u000a      behaviour which was either unethical or at least lacking in judgement.\u000a    A further piece of research carried out in 2006 extended the analysis of\u000a      risk within the finance sector. In it, Cowley argued that the sector could\u000a      undermine the necessary conditions for its own success by destabilizing\u000a      currencies and markets. She correctly identified in advance that the use\u000a      of credit derivatives in the US sub-prime mortgage market would bring\u000a      about systemic failure.\u000a    The financial crash in 2008 demonstrated that the findings of the\u000a      research were correct &#8212; the distribution of risk was flawed, FSA\u000a      regulation was inadequate, the whole financial system was open to\u000a      destabilisation, and systemic failure resulted from practices in the US\u000a      sub-prime mortgage market.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"34483","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"597427","Name":"Lithuania"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    UCL research on the history of Jews in Europe has helped to shape the\u000a      stories British and European Jews tell about themselves. This has been\u000a      achieved by providing cultural organisations, media and individuals with\u000a      information from research on under-reported facets of Jewish cultural\u000a      heritage, and creating original forums at which to engage with this\u000a      heritage.\u000a    Informing genealogical research and engaging the public with a\u000a        little-known heritage\u000a    Research at UCL has enabled investigations of British Jewish heritage by\u000a      the producers of the popular BBC genealogy programme Who Do You Think\u000a        You Are? Guesnet and Berkowitz received enquiries from the programme\u000a      makers (eg Guesnet, 2010, 2011 and 2012). Most notably, on 11 August 2011\u000a      Berkowitz appeared on an episode aired both in the UK and overseas. The\u000a      producers approached Berkowitz to help the actor June Brown &#8212; who played\u000a      Dot Cotton in EastEnders. Berkowitz drew on research to advise on\u000a      tracing her ancestor, the Sephardi Jewish boxer Isaac Bitton, and\u000a      recommended sites of particular relevance such as the Tom Cribb pub which\u000a      was later used for filming. The audience of the original broadcast was\u000a      5.82 million, demonstrating the reach of this impact [1].\u000a    The significance of this public engagement impact is demonstrated\u000a      by the intense interest this segment generated in this little-known\u000a      history. The episode's web forum had an active discussion about the boxing\u000a      connection, including a viewer who discovered her own ancestral links to\u000a      Jewish boxers in the East End of London [2] and many others who noted\u000a      their prior ignorance of this history. The episode was reviewed in news\u000a      outlets including the Daily Mail, Independent, Daily Mirror,\u000a        Metro (\"perfect fodder for a social history programme\") and on\u000a      genealogy blogs such as Genes Reunited [2]. As a result, a wide\u000a      public has gained a new appreciation of the complex routes by which Jews\u000a      integrated themselves into British society. This has profound impacts both\u000a      on those of Jewish heritage, who thus gain a deeper understanding of and\u000a      connection with their cultural heritage, and the wider British public\u000a      whose understanding of Jewish history is improved, thus contributing to\u000a      community cohesion.\u000a    Fostering debate between academics, cultural organisations and the\u000a        public\u000a    UCL research provided cultural organisations and embassies with a means\u000a      to fulfil their mandate to promote informed and authoritative debate in\u000a      London and internationally about contested or little-known histories,\u000a      demonstrated by their repeated sponsorship of events bringing the research\u000a      to an interested public. Research also provided British Jews with a\u000a      sustainable forum at which they could engage with academic debates around\u000a      the history and experiences of Eastern European Jewry and thus created\u000a      interest and engagement with a shared, but often overlooked, history. This\u000a      was achieved through a series of free talks and public conferences at the\u000a      UCL Institute for Jewish Studies, which were advertised through community\u000a      newspapers and mailing lists to attract a non-specialist audience and were\u000a      accompanied by exhibitions and film screenings.\u000a    For example, research provided the Polish Cultural Institute (PCI), a\u000a      diplomatic mission, a means by which to achieve what it terms \"one of the\u000a      most challenges priorities of Polish cultural diplomacy\": to engage the\u000a      British public with Polish and Jewish relations in their historical and\u000a      contemporary aspects [3]. This was achieved through a partnership,\u000a      beginning in 2009, to arrange a conference titled `Warsaw: the History of\u000a      a Jewish Metropolis' (June 2010), organised by Guesnet, who lectured on\u000a      the 19th century transformation of Warsaw's Jews \"from community to\u000a      metropolis\". This was sponsored by the PCI, its collaborator the Instytut\u000a      Adama Mickiewicza and the Polish Embassy as part of Polska!Year. This was\u000a      so successful that the Polish Embassy invited Dr Guesnet back in March\u000a      2012, to moderate a discussion on Polish-Jewish relations in the Second\u000a      World War, which was also widely covered in London's Polish press [4].\u000a    According to the Director of the PCI, this was the largest academic\u000a      conference devoted to the history of the Polish capital outside Poland\u000a      itself [3]. The conference, and those which succeeded it, was designed as\u000a      a hybrid event attracting a non-academic Polish and Jewish audience\u000a      interested in engaging with the latest research on the subject. It was\u000a      attended by over 300 people [8] and sparked a series of successful\u000a      collaborations, including:\u000a    - May 2011: Unsere kinder, the last Yiddish film in Poland,\u000a      introduced by Guesnet\u000a    - Dec 2011: launch of a special issue of the journal Polin (over\u000a      100 attendees)\u000a    - Feb 2013: sold-out screening of the Venice Biennale film And Europe\u000a        Will be Stunned by Yael Bartana for Jewish Book Week. Guesnet was\u000a      the historian on the discussion panel before about 400 Jewish and Polish\u000a      attendees [3].\u000a    These and similar events in 2010-2013 collectively attracted over 1,400\u000a      people and enabled the PCI to fulfil its commitment to promote discussion\u000a      of the contentious history of Jewish-Polish relations while reaching out\u000a      to a British public interested in Jewish themes [3]. It also enabled the\u000a      PCI to build sustainable new relationships with other organisations, such\u000a      as Jewish Book Week, with whom a new partnership was subsequently arranged\u000a      for 2014.\u000a    The communities attending these events also benefited from a new\u000a      conversation about British Jewish history and connections to continental\u000a      Europe, which facilitated the strengthening of this group with its\u000a      cultural heritage and history. When several screenings of Unsere\u000a        kinder sparked an interest in historical research amongst members of\u000a      the Shomrei Hadat Congregation in London, for example, they invited\u000a      Guesnet to deliver a series of three lectures on the history of the Jews\u000a      in Poland and Lithuania in October 2012-January 2013 [5]. These, in the\u000a      words of the congregation's President, \"enhanced our community and our\u000a      understanding of who we are and who we have come from\" [5].\u000a    UCL research led to wider public awareness of, and interest in, the\u000a      little-discussed role of Jewish sportsmen and thus challenged assumptions\u000a      about the role of this community in British society. This was achieved\u000a      through the development of heritage resources in order to conserve and\u000a      interpret cultural and historical heritage. In 2007 the Jewish Museum\u000a      London mounted Ghetto Warriors, the first major exhibition on the\u000a      relationship of Jews and other minorities to boxing. Drawing on the work\u000a      which was later published as [e], Berkowitz served as its Academic\u000a      Consultant and co-edited with Ruti Ungar the widely praised catalogue, Fighting\u000a      Back? Jewish and Black Boxers in Britain (2007), to which Berkowitz\u000a      contributed a essay . This was, unusually for a publication in this field,\u000a      reviewed in Supersport in 2009 and recommended as a `fascinating\u000a      new book' of interest to boxing fans despite its academic style [6]. The\u000a      significance of this exhibition is demonstrated by its ongoing use by the\u000a      museum, which incorporated parts of Berkowitz's interpretation into a new\u000a      permanent display launched in 2010 [7]. It also integrated objects from\u000a      the show into its Sandford Award-winning Take One educational\u000a      programme, such as a pair of shorts worn by a Jewish boxer competing in\u000a      the Olympics [8]. In 2013, this research was used for a special exhibition\u000a      and public lecture (30 July), on Jews and boxing, for members of the\u000a      Jewish Historical Society of England as a preview of its 120th anniversary\u000a      celebration later that year.\u000a    A two-day public colloquium on relations between Jews and Lithuanians,\u000a      co-organised by Guesnet, brought this contested subject to worldwide\u000a      attention. `No Simple Stories' (February 2011) was co-sponsored by the\u000a      Rothschild Foundation (Hanadiv) Europe and the Lithuanian Embassy. It was\u000a      attended by over 250 people from non-academic and academic backgrounds\u000a      [9]. Even before the event, the involvement of the Lithuanian government\u000a      was strongly disputed by groups who felt it was complicit in downplaying\u000a      the Holocaust and difficulties faced by present-day Lithuanian Jews.\u000a      Heated debate erupted in the media and at the event [10]. A comparatively\u000a      little-known controversy was thus brought to mainstream attention and\u000a      covered in The Economist (circulation over 1.4 million) where\u000a      lively debate continued in the comments section [10]. As many positive\u000a      emails on the thought-provoking content confirmed [9], the conference\u000a      provided space for a stimulating and informed debate on this contested\u000a      history.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research by Michael Berkowitz, Fran&#231;ois Guesnet and John D.

Their collective study encompasses the history\u000a      of Jews in Europe from the early modern era and questions of identity\u000a      formation and self-representation in 19th-20th century Britain.\u000a    The first strand of research, led by Klier and Guesnet, addresses the\u000a      history of Jews in Eastern Europe, particularly in Poland-Lithuania and\u000a      Russia. In contrast to the small Jewish communities of Central and Western\u000a      Europe, Jews in East-Central and Eastern Europe during the early modern\u000a      era (18th-19th centuries) lived in large communities. These enjoyed\u000a      significant autonomy, guaranteed through privileges offering considerable\u000a      constitutional and legal stability over many generations. This contributed\u000a      to a strong identification with the community as a distinct cultural and\u000a      political entity, most evidently in the continued use of Yiddish, the\u000a      insignificant numbers of conversions to the surrounding faiths, and the\u000a      cultural hegemony of religious observance. Another key insight concerns\u000a      the impact of the partitions of Poland, and the integration of former\u000a      Polish-Lithuanian Jewry in Russia, Prussia and Austria, which led to\u000a      significant political and cultural segmentation of a once-unified\u000a      community. These questions were examined in Klier's posthumously published\u000a      monograph [a], and Guesnet's research on Jewish historiography in\u000a      East-Central Europe, which focuses on the dialectics of integration and\u000a      separateness [c, d], and developed in his anthology of Polish sources on\u000a      the Jewish presence in Poland [b]. Guesnet is also Director of the\u000a      Montefiore Testimonials project, which is digitising and transcribing\u000a      testimonials sent by Jews from around the world, but particularly\u000a      continental Europe, to the great British Jewish philanthropist, Sir Moses\u000a      Montefiore, from the 1840s to 1885.\u000a    Berkowitz's work on modern European Jewish identity formation and\u000a      political self-representations between 1881-1948 has focused on the\u000a      relationships between art, politics, culture, sport (especially boxing)\u000a      and spectacle. Research focused on boxing in England, where Jewish boxers\u000a      such as Daniel Mendoza, Isaac Bitton and `Dutch Sam' were leading figures\u000a      in the sport's rise to prominence in the 18th-19th century, with Jews\u000a      remaining active until the early 1960s [e]. Since 2008, Berkowitz has\u000a      researched the engagement of Jews with photography in Europe and the\u000a      United States, and has investigated the pioneering attempt in the 1960s to\u000a      write a history of Jews in photography [f].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"34484","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6254930","Name":"Palestinian Territory"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2264397","Name":"Portugal"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The archival research outlined above has had significant impacts within\u000a      Portugal on public understanding of and engagement with the country's\u000a      ambiguous role in World War II, particularly its negotiation as a neutral\u000a      power and its relationship with Jewish refugees from the Holocaust. This\u000a      was achieved primarily through the publication of Lisbon: War in the\u000a        Shadows of the City of Light, 1939-1945, Neill Lochery's book, based\u000a      on his archival research. Lisbon appeared in English in November\u000a      2011; six months later it was published in Portuguese by Editorial\u000a      Presen&#231;a, a major publishing house and, in May 2013, in Spanish. Uniquely\u000a      amongst histories with a popular readership, it provides an inside view of\u000a      the discussions within the Salazar administration and in Allied diplomatic\u000a      correspondence, based on many years of primary research using unpublished\u000a      archival material.\u000a    The book received immediate critical acclaim through reviews in major\u000a      Portuguese newspapers, as well as in widely-read political, literary and\u000a      lifestyle magazines including:\u000a    - Expresso Actual, `Mis&#233;rias liter&#225;rias' 16 June 2012. 4*\u000a      review in culture supplement of top weekly newspaper with a circulation of\u000a      140k.\u000a    - Time Out Lisbon, `Lisboa em tempos de guerra' 20 June 2012. 4*\u000a      review in weekly events magazine, circulation of 13,100 per week.\u000a    - Di&#225;rio de Not&#237;cias, `Algo de Scott Fitzgerald' 19 July 2012.\u000a      Top daily paper, circulation of 34k in 2011. [1]\u000a    These uniformly positive reviews recognised the unique contribution of\u000a      Lochery's research to Portuguese citizens' understanding of this important\u000a      passage in their country's history. For example, the 4-star Expresso\u000a      noted that:\u000a    \"Lochery understands that Salazar is a controversial figure, and the\u000a      merit of his book (for the Portuguese) is to show in detail the double\u000a      dealing; the complex politics of the former dictators policy of `flexible\u000a      neutrality', which both annoyed or reassured the Allies and the Germans,\u000a      while at the same time he kept an eye on Spain and did not lose sight of\u000a      the internal opposition [in Portugal].\" Translated from the original\u000a        Portuguese [1]\u000a    In addition, excellent reviews were received in widely-read publications\u000a      in the English-speaking world, including:\u000a    - The Wall Street Journal (3 Dec 2011), which wrote of Lisbon\u000a      that it \"... traces the subtlety of [Salazar's] manoeuvring with clarity\u000a      and precision. Distilling an enormous quantity of research, he [Lochery]\u000a      has rendered a fascinating and readable account of this small country's\u000a      role in World War II, protected, as it was, by its wily champion\".

[1]\u000a    By May 2013, some 7,000 copies of the Portuguese version had been sold,\u000a      with the book nearing the end of its third edition. The extent and\u000a      significance of public interest aroused in Portugal by the book is evident\u000a      in Lochery's many invitations to follow-up activities, including invited\u000a      talks to:\u000a    - An audience of approximately 200 secondary school pupils and parents at\u000a      St Julian's, Lisbon. Nov 2011.\u000a    - Students, journalists and the general public at the Wars and Cities\u000a      conference, New University of Lisbon and Camara Municipal, 15 Sept 2012.\u000a    - A general public audience at Camara Municipal de Lisboa (city hall), 25\u000a      Oct 2012.\u000a    Most significantly, the book's success inspired a group of public and\u000a      private sector sponsors to support a highly successful free photographic\u000a      exhibition titled `Lisbon: Bottleneck of Europe in WWII: 1939-1945'. Held\u000a      at the Camara Municipal and opened by the Mayor of Lisbon on the evening\u000a      of 17 October 2012, the exhibition presented many of the historic\u000a      photographs and other documents identified by Lochery in the course of his\u000a      research [2]. A cocktail reception for 185 guests was hosted by Societ&#233;\u000a      G&#233;n&#233;rale Private Banking, in association with Pernod Ricard Portugal and\u000a      Mont Blanc Iberia, attended by ambassadors from several European countries\u000a      and the United States, as well as by business leaders and arts\u000a      professionals. The interest and enjoyment taken by attendees in this new\u000a      exhibition of artistic resources is evident in the following comments,\u000a      extracted from the Exhibition Report prepared after its close:\u000a    - `Casts new light upon Lisbon's unique role during those terrible years'\u000a      &#8212; Partner, Morais Leitao, Galv&#227;o Teles, Soares da Silva &amp; Associados\u000a      legal firm.\u000a    - `An impressive and unique portrait of the Portuguese capital in the\u000a      1940s' &#8212; Centro do Historia BES.\u000a    - `Very interesting and diversified display of documents, most of them\u000a      previously undisclosed to public eye' &#8212; Head of International, Montepio\u000a      Bank.\u000a    - `Especially wonderful to see and to have on display for the first time\u000a      new documents uncovered on Peggy Guggenheim and her family' &#8212; President,\u000a      Peggy Guggenheim Collection Advisory Board. [4, p11]\u000a    A 56-page catalogue documenting the exhibition was published in an\u000a      edition of 550 copies, with sponsorship from the Soci&#233;t&#233; G&#233;n&#233;rale bank, as\u000a      part of efforts to fulfil its commitment to supporting artistic progress;\u000a      the bank itself distributed 200 copies to its own guests at the opening\u000a      reception. The remainder were sold through the gift shop, distributed by\u000a      the mayor as gifts, and provided to Lisbon's municipal libraries [3].\u000a    The exhibition and catalogue successfully engaged a large Lisboan public\u000a      with new archival research on their city's murky history during World War\u000a      II. Although the exhibition was free and the precise visitor numbers were\u000a      not collected, a three-week tracking exercise found that on average the\u000a      gallery had 1,500 to 2,000 visitors per week, giving an estimated total of\u000a      10,500-14,000 visitors over the course of the relatively short run [4, p.\u000a      10]. A visitor survey found that whilst the greatest number of visitors\u000a      were Portuguese, many other nationalities (notably British, American and\u000a      Spanish) were also represented [4]. While all age groups were evenly\u000a      represented, several schools benefitted particularly from the provision of\u000a      guided educational tours for Year 6 pupils (age 10-11) to support the\u000a      national curriculum of WW2 studies, as well as tours for students in\u000a      continuing education and civics. In particular, educational resources,\u000a      such as quizzes, were developed to help teach WW2 history through the\u000a      exhibition. One head teacher remarked: `...the students have just returned\u000a      from Lisbon, full of enthusiasm for the way they were looked after on\u000a      their visit to the exhibition &#8212; and found it instructive, attractive,\u000a      poignant and uplifting &#8212; as all good History should be.' [4, p. 11]\u000a    The exhibition received substantial and enthusiastic press coverage, with\u000a      long and detailed features appeared in at least 10 major Portuguese\u000a      language national and city newspapers, with a combined circulation of over\u000a      a million, a tenth of the population of Portugal. Examples include:\u000a    - Expresso Revista `Lisboa j&#225; foi Casablanca' 20 Oct 2012 (a 4\u000a      page interview feature in weekend magazine, circulation 140k per issue).\u000a    - Jornal de negocios `Lisboa, \"Casablanca\" de Salazar' 26 Oct\u000a      2012 (3 page interview feature in this daily newspaper, circulation 300k\u000a      per issue).\u000a    - Time Out Lisbon feature and Top 3 Time Out Choice (weeks of 18\u000a      and 25 Oct 2012). [3]\u000a    This was accompanied by widespread broadcast coverage, including:\u000a    - Primetime evening news broadcast on SIC News (national commercial TV)\u000a      23 Oct 2012.\u000a    - Lunchtime News broadcast on RTP News (national state news) 24 Oct 2012,\u000a      repeated in `Good Morning News' the following day.\u000a    - Antena 1 (national state radio) 23 Oct 2012. [4]\u000a    Coverage continued well after the exhibition's end, demonstrating the\u000a      ongoing impact on media discourse; for example, Diario Economico,\u000a      the country's premier financial newspaper, published a 4-page article and\u000a      interview in its monthly magazine supplement in March 2013. [5]\u000a    However, the greatest indicator of the strength and scale of public\u000a      interest in the exhibition itself and in the social, historical and\u000a      political issues that it raised is its extension of the exhibition &#8212; due\u000a      to public demand &#8212; beyond the initial four weeks to seven weeks; it\u000a      eventually closed on 30 November 2012. The significance of the associated\u000a      public engagement activities is also witnessed by the fact that the\u000a      exhibition has consistently contributed to the visitor service and tourist\u000a      experience in Lisbon. Thus the Portuguese Tourist Board, for example, used\u000a      the story told in Lisbon of the refugees passing through Europe to\u000a      develop interest in the sights of this city by making it the focus, in\u000a      March 2012, of its regular `This Month's Travel Secret' feature, [6] and\u000a      in May 2013, the National World War II Museum in New Orleans (USA),\u000a      announced it had invited Lochery to present a talk and private exhibition\u000a      viewing of Lisbon for 300 passengers on a cruise commemorating the\u000a      70th anniversary of the D-Day Landings the following year. [7]\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    UCL research improved public understanding in Portugal of the important\u000a      role that Lisbon played in WWII as an `open city' where both sides in the\u000a      war operated. In particular, it showed and publicised the city's role as\u000a      an exit point for thousands of refugees (mainly Jewish) trying to escape\u000a      German-occupied Europe and get to North America or Palestine. This was\u000a      achieved through a best-selling publication and a photographic exhibition\u000a      in Lisbon attended by 10-14,000 visitors. Both were widely reviewed as\u000a      providing important insights supported by research into previously\u000a      unpublished archives.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    University College London\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"University College London","InstitutionName":"University College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007784}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2267057","Name":"Lisbon"},{"GeoNamesId":"4335045","Name":"New Orleans"},{"GeoNamesId":"2553604","Name":"Casablanca"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a[a] Lochery, N.

His investigations have been\u000a      particularly underpinned by his use of unpublished and often previously\u000a      little-used or untouched archival documents &#8212; for example those held in\u000a      the National Archives at Kew, the Foreign Office archives and in major\u000a      holdings in Israel, Portugal and the United States &#8212; to elucidate\u000a      important socio-political and historical developments within and between\u000a      these nations.\u000a    This archival research has, for instance, resulted in a monograph [a]\u000a      exploring the impact of Israel's West Bank security fence and examining\u000a      its integration into the broader philosophy of Israel's engagement with\u000a      the Palestinians and influence on political decision-making. A subsequent\u000a      project traced the development of Anglo-Israeli relations from the\u000a      creation of the State of Israel to the present day. In analysing why these\u000a      relations have been problematic, Lochery examined Britain's diplomatic\u000a      role in the Middle East, leading to a second monograph [b] and several\u000a      refereed articles on British arms sales to Israel since immediately after\u000a      independence [c]. Again, these outputs were underpinned by archival\u000a      research, including material released for the first time following a\u000a      Freedom of Information request by Lochery [d].\u000a    Whilst working on Loaded Dice [b], Lochery came across a series\u000a      of documents (FO\/371) revealing attempts by the British Foreign Office to\u000a      persuade the Portuguese government not to allow Jewish rescue groups to\u000a      operate in Lisbon in 1940, lest Jewish refugees were sent to Palestine.\u000a      This policy &#8212; and Salazar's decision to accede &#8212; provided the starting\u000a      point for Lochery's extensive research on Lisbon during World War II.\u000a    In undertaking this work his expertise in using archival research to shed\u000a      new light on contemporary and historical issues particularly informed\u000a      Lochery's approach to the examination of archival records detailing\u000a      Portugal's evolving treatment of the thousands of refugees, most of them\u000a      Jewish, who flooded Lisbon during World War II, as well as the impact of\u000a      the policy of `flexible neutrality' formulated by Portugal's authoritarian\u000a      leader, Antonio de Oliveira Salazar. With a British Academy Small Grant,\u000a      this was developed into an investigation of the role played by Portugal as\u000a      a neutral power during World War II, its treatment of its refugee\u000a      population, and its emergence from the war financially better off than at\u000a      its start. Over the course of this three year project (2007-10) some\u000a      50,000 unpublished documents were critically examined in archives in the\u000a      United Kingdom, United States, and Portugal, including many which had not\u000a      been studied before. The trajectories of thousands of refugees were traced\u000a      through Lisbon, and the failings, from 1940 onwards, of international\u000a      Jewish rescue groups to accommodate them examined. Finally, Lochery\u000a      examined the post-war negotiations over German gold payments for wolfram,\u000a      a mineral used in manufacturing armaments, of which Portugal had large\u000a      deposits. This has, to date, been published as a book based on this\u000a      research but written to be accessible to a popular readership [e].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35197","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Newman Research Centre for the Bible and its Reception was\u000a      established by Docherty in 2009. Its aims are to forge connections between\u000a      the academic study of the Jewish and Christian Bible and debates about\u000a      contemporary issues facing society, and to educate the wider public on the\u000a      ways in which the Bible has influenced European art, music and literature\u000a      throughout the centuries. Docherty collaborated with scholars working in\u000a      related fields at other UK Universities to run two public seminar series\u000a      in 2009\/10 and 2010\/11, to which she contributed sessions on the reception\u000a      and reworking in later Jewish and Christian tradition of biblical texts\u000a      and characters which drew directly on her published research.\u000a    The first series included two guided tours of selected paintings held in\u000a      the Barber Institute of Fine Art Birmingham which were led by experts in\u000a      the field of the Bible and Art. These tours were open to the public and\u000a      free of charge, and they were supported and promoted by the Gallery's then\u000a      director, and the by the organisation of the Friends of the Barber\u000a      Institute. They each attracted approximately forty-five participants. The\u000a      Barber Institute houses one of the finest small collections of European\u000a      art in the UK, and its mission dovetails neatly with the aims of the\u000a      Newman Research Centre for the Bible and its Reception as it was founded:\u000a      \"to promote the study and encouragement of art and music for the benefit\u000a      of the University of Birmingham and the wider public.\" This relationship\u000a      with the Barber Institute is on-going, and, for instance, undergraduate\u000a      students in Theology and History from Newman University are now required\u000a      to make presentations every year at both the Barber Institute and a number\u000a      of cathedrals throughout the UK on the meaning and social and cultural\u000a      significance of paintings, statues and key features of church\u000a      architecture. Other events organised by the Newman Research Centre\u000a      included a free public seminar on the use of biblical imagery in\u000a      contemporary advertising in December 2010.\u000a    In 2012 Docherty made a successful bid to the HEA for a grant to develop\u000a      a series of podcasts and accompanying on-line materials which would make\u000a      accessible to the non-specialist some of the key insights of contemporary\u000a      biblical scholarship. These have been produced, trialled with groups, and\u000a      disseminated in a number of fora, including via an open-access website (http:\/\/biblicalstudies.podbean.com\/)\u000a      from 08\/07\/2013.

A\u000a      representative response is provided by the minister of Living Waters\u000a      Church, Ludlow (by e-mail on 09\/07\/2013): \"Accessing the biblical studies\u000a      content in the form of podcasts has provided me with new avenues into\u000a      biblical content for my church congregation. Firstly the content has\u000a      provided simple and transmittable background information as people\u000a      approach bible study with a view understanding the original context in\u000a      which it was written. This is true even for members of the community who\u000a      know their bible well from a devotional perspective, as the academic\u000a      approach is one that few have considered previously. Secondly the\u000a      effectiveness of the podcasts as short, accessible perspectives on\u000a      biblical material has made us think about how we can replicate something\u000a      of that format for us in our corporate biblical study. This is\u000a      particularly important where work or other commitments make it difficult\u000a      to gather people together regularly.\"\u000a    Docherty has provided two contributions for the magazine The Bible in\u000a        Transmission, published by the Bible Society of the UK, which aims\u000a      to to engage lay Christians with biblical and theological themes relevant\u000a      to key ethical and societal issues.

Directly as a result of his\u000d\u000a      research into Columba and early\u000d\u000a      Celtic Christianity, the Community invited Dr Bradley to engage with it in\u000d\u000a      rethinking its weekly\u000d\u000a      pilgrimages around the island. Dr Bradley proposed a series of specific\u000d\u000a      changes to these, which\u000d\u000a      have been adopted, and was subsequently invited to lead nine study weeks\u000d\u000a      for the Community on\u000d\u000a      the theme of pilgrimage. These have brought over 800 participants from 12\u000d\u000a      different countries, to\u000d\u000a      stay on Iona and led directly to invitations to advise Swedish, Norwegian\u000d\u000a      and Danish pilgrim\u000d\u000a      pastors on new ways to encourage modern pilgrimage. The Island Centres'\u000d\u000a      Director\/Programme\u000d\u000a      Co-Ordinator writes that `Your research on Columba, Irish monasticism\u000d\u000a        and Celtic pilgrimage has\u000d\u000a        had a direct and perceptible impact on the way that we present these\u000d\u000a        topics to our guests staying\u000d\u000a        on Iona.

She estimates that `the week in which you disseminated\u000d\u000a        your research into pilgrimage in\u000d\u000a        June 2011 directly generated a total of &#163;34,760 for the island economy'\u000d\u000a      and that, overall, the ten\u000d\u000a      pilgrim weeks devised and led by Dr Bradley have generated in excess of\u000d\u000a      &#163;250,000 for the Iona\u000d\u000a      economy [S1]. Comments and feedback gathered from those attending these\u000d\u000a      weeks shows that\u000d\u000a      they travelled from as far afield as New Zealand specifically to hear Dr\u000d\u000a      Bradley and described their\u000d\u000a      experience of Iona as being hugely enriched and enhanced, and their\u000d\u000a      perspectives changed, as a\u000d\u000a      result of attending his presentations [S6].\u000d\u000a    More recently, Dr Bradley was invited to present his research on the\u000d\u000a      development of pilgrimage on\u000d\u000a      Iona to a conference organised by Historic Scotland in April 2012 [S7].\u000d\u000a      This has led to an on-going\u000d\u000a      involvement with Historic Scotland, advising on the substantial\u000d\u000a      re-interpretation of Iona's historical\u000d\u000a      landscape. The principal researcher for Heritage Research at Historic\u000d\u000a      Scotland writes that `Dr\u000d\u000a        Bradley's research on the re-evaluation of Iona Abbey in the late\u000d\u000a        nineteenth century, and in\u000d\u000a        particular the role of the 8th Duke of Argyll, has been\u000d\u000a        incorporated into the new permanent\u000d\u000a        exhibition and Audio Guide unveiled in May 2013 for the 1450th\u000d\u000a        anniversary of Columba's arrival on\u000d\u000a        Iona, in the rebuilding of the Abbey.

He was invited to\u000d\u000a      provide presentations in\u000d\u000a      2011 to Fife Council and to the Dunfermline-Trondheim Twinning\u000d\u000a      Association.

The minister of Holy Trinity, the Town\u000d\u000a      Kirk, testifies that `the\u000d\u000a        annual St Andrew's Day pilgrimages which you have devised and led\u000d\u000a        directly based on your\u000d\u000a        academic research on St Andrews as a place of pilgrimage have had a\u000d\u000a        direct and demonstrable\u000d\u000a        impact in enhancing the experience of both visitors and residents.\u000d\u000a        Through them, and the annual\u000d\u000a        Stations of the Cross which you have led round Holy Trinity in Holy\u000d\u000a        Week, your academic research\u000d\u000a        has changed practices in the main church in the town and enhanced its\u000d\u000a        outreach to the\u000d\u000a        community'. [S4] In addition to these initiatives, Dr Bradley has\u000d\u000a      devised and led Good Friday\u000d\u000a      pilgrimages around St Andrews over the last three years, directly based in\u000d\u000a      his academic research,\u000d\u000a      which have brought together every single major denomination in the town\u000d\u000a      for the first time.\u000d\u000a    As a direct consequence of his books on the subject, Dr Bradley was\u000d\u000a      invited to address the\u000d\u000a      Scottish Parliament on promoting pilgrimage in February 2011. His\u000d\u000a      presentation, attended by\u000d\u000a      MSPs, church, local authority and tourism representatives, gave a major\u000d\u000a      impetus to the campaign\u000d\u000a      to develop pilgrim routes across Scotland and has led to invitations to\u000d\u000a      work with individuals wanting\u000d\u000a      to initiate local projects. An example are the meetings that he has had\u000d\u000a      with the minister of\u000d\u000a      Whitekirk, an ancient place of pilgrimage in East Lothian, who approached\u000d\u000a      him having read his\u000d\u000a      books to provide advice an input on her plans to promote and reinterpret\u000d\u000a      pilgrimage from Whitekirk\u000d\u000a      to Haddington. His input has stimulated new practices such as pilgrim\u000d\u000a      walks and information\u000d\u000a      centres. Dr Bradley is the main academic adviser for the Scottish Pilgrim\u000d\u000a      Routes Forum,\u000d\u000a      established in February 2012 following extensive consultations involving\u000d\u000a      church groups, politicians,\u000d\u000a      Scottish Natural Heritage, Visit Scotland, and walkers' organizations. His\u000d\u000a      input into the Forum's\u000d\u000a      deliberations, based directly on his research is having a significant\u000d\u000a      impact on the practical\u000d\u000a      development of pilgrim routes across Scotland. [S8]\u000d\u000a    On the strength of his published work on pilgrimage, Dr Bradley was\u000d\u000a      invited to give a two-day\u000d\u000a      residential presentation to Scottish army chaplains on the subject in\u000d\u000a      February 2012 at the Army\u000d\u000a      Chaplaincy centre, Amport House, Hampshire. The Deputy Chaplain General of\u000d\u000a      the British Army\u000d\u000a      writes of the direct impact this had in leading chaplains to discuss and\u000d\u000a      develop with their\u000d\u000a      commanding officers initiatives to involve troops relocated from Germany\u000d\u000a      to Scotland in pilgrim trail\u000d\u000a      infrastructure work.

His\u000d\u000a      initial research was directed at determining the extent to which Columba,\u000d\u000a      the sixth-century Irish\u000d\u000a      saint, was seen as a pilgrim in early hagiography, poems and monastic\u000d\u000a      literature from the seventh\u000d\u000a      century to the twelfth. The results of this research were published in a\u000d\u000a      revised edition of his book\u000d\u000a      Columba: Pilgrim and Penitent (2000) commissioned by the Iona\u000d\u000a      Community. Subsequent\u000d\u000a      research into the pilgrim journeys made by Irish monks, their motivation\u000d\u000a      and destinations, led to\u000d\u000a      exploration of the extent to which the theme of pilgrimage was taken up in\u000d\u000a      extant sermons from the\u000d\u000a      so called `golden age of Celtic Christianity' in the sixth and seventh\u000d\u000a      centuries. This research was\u000d\u000a      published in Colonies of Heaven (2000), which also explored the\u000d\u000a      pastoral and theological\u000d\u000a      implications and contemporary resonances of this emphasis. Further\u000d\u000a      research focussed on the\u000d\u000a      significance of pilgrimage as a motif in early Irish literature and in the\u000d\u000a      characteristic decorative\u000d\u000a      intertwining knot-work found on Irish high-standing crosses and\u000d\u000a      illuminated manuscripts. This was\u000d\u000a      found to be related to the theme of journeying in the stories and poems of\u000d\u000a      epic voyages, notably in\u000d\u000a      the so-called imra tradition, and to the ubiquity of pilgrimage in\u000d\u000a      Irish monastic life. This research\u000d\u000a      was published in a substantially revised edition of The Celtic Way\u000d\u000a      (2003).\u000d\u000a    A further concentrated period of research on pilgrimage between 2006 and\u000d\u000a      2008 explored the\u000d\u000a      history and contemporary revival of Christian pilgrimage on a Europe-wide\u000d\u000a      basis, drawing on\u000d\u000a      biblical, historical and literary sources and on insights and\u000d\u000a      methodological principles from\u000d\u000a      anthropology and art history as well as the disciplines of church and\u000d\u000a      cultural history and religious\u000d\u000a      studies.\u000d\u000a    This project involved fieldwork through observation of twelve pilgrimages\u000d\u000a      across Europe.\u000d\u000a      Substantial quantities of empirical data were collected through interviews\u000d\u000a      with organisers and\u000d\u000a      participants in pilgrimages regarding their motivations, expectations and\u000d\u000a      experiences, and the\u000d\u000a      extent to which they viewed themselves as connecting with medieval\u000d\u000a      pilgrims. The conclusions of\u000d\u000a      this research were published in the book Pilgrimage: A Spiritual and\u000d\u000a        Cultural Journey (2009),\u000d\u000a      extensively illustrated and translated into Norwegian, Dutch, Japanese and\u000d\u000a      Arabic.

Widespread increased awareness and discussion at an international\u000a        level of the political\u000a        context and claims of the gospel narratives\u000a    \u000a      a. Changed international awareness\u000a    \u000a    The Politics of Christmas [5] report attracted immediate media\u000a      attention, including an extensive\u000a      article in the Daily Telegraph [S4], a comment piece in The\u000a        New Statesman, and online reports in\u000a      the Huffington Post and elsewhere. At least eight BBC local radio\u000a      stations carried items on the\u000a      report in the weekend after its release, which strategically came in the\u000a      run-up to Christmas. As a\u000a      result of the publication, Holmes was invited to write reflective pieces\u000a      drawing on the report for The\u000a        Times (appeared online 9\/12\/11), for politics.co.uk [S5], and for\u000a      the Australian Broadcasting\u000a      Company's prestigious religion and ethics website; he was interviewed by\u000a      BBC Radio Manchester,\u000a      Radio Rhema in New Zealand, and several faith-based media sources,\u000a      including an interview\u000a      resulting in an article covering the whole front page of the Baptist\u000a        Times, subsequently highlighted\u000a      as one of the most significant stories of the year in that newspaper's\u000a      annual review. This story was\u000a      picked up and republished by the American Ethics Daily. Other\u000a      articles appeared on the CNN\u000a      website in the USA, in church news stories in the Irish Republic, in the\u000a      leading Tanzanian\u000a      newspaper The Citizen, and extensively across the internet. The\u000a      Director of Theos attests that their\u000a      data demonstrate significant take-up by `a variety of communities\u000a        beyond academia: believers and\u000a        non-believers, a range of age groups and genders' [S1]. The extent\u000a      of this media and public\u000a      engagement demonstrates a widespread impact on awareness and understanding\u000a      of political\u000a      themes within the biblical nativity narratives.\u000a    b. Changed international discourse\u000a    More direct public responses to The Politics of Christmas report\u000a      included a somewhat hostile\u000a      response from Daily Telegraph comment writer, Peter Mullen [S6],\u000a      whose piece received several\u000a      hundred comments (since edited down to just over 130) online, and many\u000a      other online discussions.\u000a      The energy of some of these discussions &#8212; particularly in response to\u000a      Mullen &#8212; demonstrates that\u000a      the report succeeded in generating widespread public discussion on the\u000a      themes it treated. Analysis\u000a      of the comments on the online versions of news reports indicate that the\u000a      range of those reached\u000a      included a wide variety of age groups, and people of varying religious\u000a      affiliations, including many\u000a      people of no religious affiliation [S1]. Discussions took place on sites\u000a      serving communities from all\u000a      over the world: local media from New Zealand to Manchester, on at least\u000a      four continents [S1].\u000a    Mullen's article was shared over 300 times on social media sites [S4],\u000a      which is indicative of wide\u000a      readership, interest, and engagement (this figure is considerably higher\u000a      than many other articles\u000a      from the same website). Theos estimate that social media content\u000a      referencing the report reached\u000a      15,000 [S3]. There can be little doubt that the awareness of these themes\u000a      across a substantial\u000a      audience &#8212; plausibly numbered into the hundreds of thousands, given the\u000a      known reach of the\u000a      various media outlets &#8212; was increased; given the relative invisibility of\u000a      such themes in popular\u000a      culture prior to the publication of the report, as demonstrated by polling\u000a      data included in the report\u000a      (only 19% of the population saw any political relevance in the Christmas\u000a      story, a figure that did not\u000a      change significantly with different levels of religious commitment), the\u000a      increase was significant.\u000a      Theos state that the report `distinctively coloured public\u000a        conversations about the practice of\u000a        Christmas for the final months of 2011' [S1]. The report was\u000a      included in a resource pack produced\u000a      by the British and Foreign Bible Society in 2012 for schools and churches\u000a      to engage the Christmas\u000a      story. The inclusion of the report in this pack, extensively disseminated\u000a      across the UK, is another\u000a      indication of its reach, encompassing the younger generation, addressing\u000a      schools and children as\u000a      well as churches and adults [S10].\u000a    2. Changed practices in churches\u000a    There are a number of examples from individuals indicating changed\u000a      practices, mostly from\u000a      Christian ministers (including bishops), suggesting that their public\u000a      celebrations of Christmas were\u000a      revised as a result of their reading of the report [S1; S2]. Leaders spoke\u000a      of how the report had\u000a      informed their sermons, and how positive comments from many congregation\u000a      members had\u000a      indicated that this had changed their thinking and their practice in\u000a      celebrating Christmas [S1; S2].\u000a      Given that the change of practice of one minister will lead to a changed\u000a      experience for one or\u000a      several congregations which may each number into the hundreds, and given\u000a      the significance of the\u000a      celebration of Christmas in the liturgical year of many Christian\u000a      denominations, but particularly the\u000a      Church of England and the Roman Catholic Church, even a small number of\u000a      changes of practice\u000a      like this suggests a substantial impact in terms of changed experience of\u000a      numbers of people at a\u000a      significant moment in their cultural and religious life. Since the\u000a      available evidence of changed\u000a      practices comes simply from those who chose to contact the author and\/or\u000a      publisher of the report\u000a      to express gratitude, it is almost certain that the number of people, and\u000a      hence congregations,\u000a      celebrating Christmas differently as a result of the research is in fact\u000a      significantly larger than can\u000a      yet be demonstrated in statistical terms [S1]. There is evidence of some\u000a      level of changes in\u000a      practice in regard to core issues of religious and cultural celebration\u000a      [S1], and reason to suppose\u000a      that this change in practice may well have been extensive.\u000a    By demonstrating what it does and does not mean to read foundational New\u000a      Testament narratives\u000a      with an eye to their political content, the report had significantly\u000a      increased awareness of the reality\u000a      that the birth of Jesus was &#8212; irreducibly and with radical implications &#8212;\u000a      a political event [S1; S2]. In\u000a      offering a popular window on scholarly research on what the Bible might actually\u000a      be saying about\u000a      Christian origins, it had led a wide range of people to rethink their\u000a      notions of Christmas as merely a\u000a      celebration of domesticity or an opportunity for excess. One influential\u000a      church leader in England\u000a      commented that her preaching was specifically `informed' by the\u000a      report: `I talked about how\u000a        Christmas isn't just to be a cozy family time, but should incorporate an\u000a        outward focus and that we\u000a        should not be nervous of being overtly political at Christmas time. Many\u000a        people said how helpful\u000a        that was' [S2].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Dr Stephen Holmes was commissioned by the Westminster think-tank\u000a      Theos to write a report under the title The Politics of Christmas\u000a      (2011).

His report, The\u000a        Politics of Christmas, drew\u000a      upon two longstanding research directions within the School of Divinity.\u000a      First, under the\u000a      distinguished leadership of Prof. Richard Bauckham, FBA (Professor of New\u000a      Testament Studies\u000a      1992-2007, now Emeritus Professor), and involving work by other scholars\u000a      in the School, including\u000a      Prof. Trevor Hart (1995-2013, now Honorary Professor), a distinctive\u000a      methodology for using biblical\u000a      narratives to address political and social questions was developed at the\u000a      University of St Andrews\u000a      from the mid-1990s onwards [1,2,3 below]. The methodology stemmed in part\u000a      from the School's\u000a      general research interests in pursuing cross-disciplinary links between\u000a      theology and biblical\u000a      studies, but it applied that concern in a specific way by developing\u000a      suitable approaches for\u000a      intellectually serious applications of ancient sacred texts to particular\u000a      contemporary issues of\u000a      politics, economics, social justice, ecology, and personal ethics. The\u000a      research sought to\u000a      demonstrate how biblical texts should not be appealed to in\u000a      support of political positions, and\u000a      through several academically rigorous case-studies (including a number of\u000a      monographs) it\u000a      developed a positive hermeneutical proposal for the appropriate\u000a      application of biblical texts to\u000a      modern political questions.\u000a    Second, from 2005 onwards, Dr Holmes directed from the University of St\u000a      Andrews an\u000a      international research project under the title `Public Theology in\u000a      Cultural Engagement'. With\u000a      funding of around &#163;50k from charitable bodies and trusts, the enterprise\u000a      found natural synergies\u000a      with the School's established research strengths in the Bible and\u000a      politics. Aiming to develop modes\u000a      of engagement with public issues that remained authentically theological\u000a      whilst being relevant to,\u000a      and comprehensible within, the public square, the research proceeded by\u000a      examining and critiquing\u000a      available theological accounts of culture, and by considering case-studies\u000a      that seemed to\u000a      exemplify successful attempts to treat cultural and political questions.\u000a      These included, inter alia,\u000a      drugs policy, education, and issues of national identity [4]. Out of these\u000a      examinations, a new\u000a      account of how to think theologically about cultural and political\u000a      realities was presented, with\u000a      exploration of the consequences for an adequately theological approach to\u000a      public engagement.\u000a      The project involved popular seminars in London, Heidelberg and Seattle to\u000a      consider the impact of\u000a      Christian theological claims on public policy debates; it climaxed in 2008\u000a      with the publication of\u000a      Public Theology in Cultural Engagement, edited by Holmes [4]. The\u000a      project coalesced with other\u000a      developments in public advocacy work in the UK by bodies such as the\u000a      British and Foreign Bible\u000a      Society, which in November 2006 set up Theos, an ecumenical Public\u000a      Theology Think-tank in\u000a      Westminster. As a consultant researcher for Theos, Holmes was invited to\u000a      write a report which\u000a      would bring some of the political implications of the public theology\u000a      project into sharp focus on a\u000a      classic issue of popular interest: the meaning of Christmas [5].\u000a    Drawing upon the methodological advances described above, the Politics\u000a        of Christmas report\u000a      reconsidered the New Testament's nativity narratives in a way that offered\u000a      intellectually serious yet\u000a      accessible commentary on a number of contentious political debates,\u000a      including the proper\u000a      treatment of asylum seekers, housing policy, and taxation. The impact of\u000a      the report depended\u000a      entirely upon its being both academically credible and culturally\u000a      relevant, and so upon the research\u000a      outcomes outlined above.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"36511","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"1835841","Name":"South Korea"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Kim's research on methods of theological engagement in the public sphere\u000d\u000a      has had significant and demonstrable impact in the following respects:\u000d\u000a    (a) In Search of Identity: Debates on religious Conversion in India\u000d\u000a      (OUP, 2005) was acknowledged as `a landmark in studies on conversion' (Seminar)\u000d\u000a      and `a handy reference both for policy-makers and scholars' (Telegraph)\u000d\u000a      by the media.

As evidenced through email discussions with Kim and\u000d\u000a      invitations to speak at various church, religious and public events, this\u000d\u000a      book has been read by policy-makers, journalists, religious leaders and\u000d\u000a      the general public as well as researchers and students of sociology,\u000d\u000a      religion, theology, history, politics, and law. In 2007 and 2008, Kim was\u000d\u000a      consulted by Indian religious and political leaders (including Mr Ashok\u000d\u000a      Chowgule, Director, Hindu Vivek Kendra; Mr Surendra Jain, National\u000d\u000a      Spokesman, Vishva Hindu Parishad). Kim was invited to Lambeth Palace on 27th\u000d\u000a      July 2010 as a consultant to inform the Archbishop of Canterbury regarding\u000d\u000a      religious conversion in preparation for his visit to India during October\u000d\u000a      2010, and especially in preparation for a meeting with prominent Hindu\u000d\u000a      leaders in Bangalore. The Archbishop and his assistants expressed their\u000d\u000a      great appreciation to Kim for his advice on religious conversion, which is\u000d\u000a      the most contentious issue between Christian and Hindu communities in\u000d\u000a      India.\u000d\u000a    (b)The main impact of the work on religion, peace and reconciliation has\u000d\u000a      been on the Christian communities and on the general public in South\u000d\u000a      Korea, particularly during the time of the International Conference on\u000d\u000a      Peace and Reconciliation in Seoul in 2010. 150 participants were invited\u000d\u000a      from 40 different countries, mainly prominent church leaders, peace\u000d\u000a      activists, NGO personnel, theologians and scholars of peace studies. They\u000d\u000a      were joined by some 200 South Korean church leaders, politicians, policy\u000d\u000a      makers and NGO leaders. Together the participants visited the\u000d\u000a      Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and the Joint Security Area (JSA) on the border\u000d\u000a      between the North and South Korea, which drew significant Korean media\u000d\u000a      attention. Throughout the conference, national media broadcast and\u000d\u000a      published the activities of the conference and disseminated the conference\u000d\u000a      discussion through interviews with the participants. A press conference\u000d\u000a      with the keynote speakers was held with 20 major national media\u000d\u000a      organisations which covered various issues concerning the theory and\u000d\u000a      practice of Christian contributions to peace and reconciliation in the\u000d\u000a      Korean peninsula and lessons from other contexts. The amount of media\u000d\u000a      coverage given throughout the 5-day conference indicates that this event\u000d\u000a      was considered by wider Korean society as a major gathering for a serious\u000d\u000a      examination of peace in Korea.\u000d\u000a    As a result of the publication of the book Peace and Reconciliation,\u000d\u000a      Kim received an invitation from the University of York to provide a\u000d\u000a      half-day session on religion and peace-building for the Chevening Conflict\u000d\u000a      Resolution Course in 2010, sponsored by the UK Foreign and Commonwealth\u000d\u000a      Office (FCO). It brought together twenty participants from across the\u000d\u000a      world who work in civil service, government, journalism, the military,\u000d\u000a      NGOs and United Nations posts.\u000d\u000a    (c)The Ebor Lectures represent a significant landmark in the engagement\u000d\u000a      of theology with public life in the UK. Between October 2007 and October\u000d\u000a      2013, a total of 12,100 people attended the Ebor lectures (the average\u000d\u000a      attendance at every lecture was 400 and the lecture given by BBC business\u000d\u000a      correspondent Robert Peston reached 1,500). As evidenced by the continuing\u000d\u000a      high attendance, the lectures have become a major event in the region,\u000d\u000a      generating discussions on contemporary issues and bridging between\u000d\u000a      academics, policy makers and religious experts and the wider public. The\u000d\u000a      lectures are published in book form and through podcasts and blogs. The\u000d\u000a      lectures are reported by the local and national media as they meet the\u000d\u000a      need for relevant interaction with various public issues (see, for\u000d\u000a      example, BBC News, 26 March 2009; The Telegraph, 26 March 2009, Daily\u000d\u000a        Mail, 26 March 2009; Church Times, 26 March 2009, 27\u000d\u000a      November 2009, 20 April 2010, 28 May 2010; The Press, 14 September\u000d\u000a      2006, 26 November 2009, 2 January 2010, 12 March 2010, 12 October 2009, 5\u000d\u000a      October 2010, 8 February 2011, 30 September 2011; Yorkshire Post,\u000d\u000a      16 February 2010; Mensa Magazine, December 2009, January 2010).\u000d\u000a      The impact of the Ebor Lectures is evidenced through some of those\u000d\u000a      attending who say that attending the lectures often gives them a better\u000d\u000a      understanding of issues; in some cases people say that this has made them\u000d\u000a      recognise the need to be more actively involved in issues (e.g. poverty,\u000d\u000a      environmentalism, anti-racism) within their localities. Some of the\u000d\u000a      Churches in York and the wider region are also using the content and\u000d\u000a      discussion emerging from the Ebor Lectures in promoting understanding\u000d\u000a      amongst their members about the important role of religion in the public\u000d\u000a      sphere.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This impact case study relates to the development of a public theology\u000d\u000a      for peace-making.

As a result, Kim published Peace and Reconciliation: In\u000d\u000a        Search of Shared Identities (Ashgate, 2008) and a further three\u000d\u000a      volumes &#8212; Building Communities of Reconciliation: Reflections on the\u000d\u000a        Life and Teaching of Reverend Kyung-Chik Han (Nanumsa, 2012); Building\u000d\u000a        Communities of Reconciliation: Christian Responses to Situations of\u000d\u000a        Conflict (Nanumsa, 2012); Building Communities of\u000d\u000a        Reconciliation: Christian Theologies of Peace and Reconciliation\u000d\u000a      (Nanumsa, 2012).\u000d\u000a    c) Theology in public life:\u000d\u000a      For the development of public theology, Kim established the Centre for\u000d\u000a      Religion in Society (CRiS), a research centre at York St John University\u000d\u000a      in 2008. The activities of the CRiS include the publication of the International\u000d\u000a        Journal of Public Theology, of which Kim is the founding and current\u000d\u000a      Editor. In particular, it engages in conversation with policy-makers and\u000d\u000a      practitioners through special issues such as `Climate Change and the\u000d\u000a      Common Good', `Obama: An American Commentary', `Faith, Welfare and\u000d\u000a      Well-being' and `Restoring Justice'.\u000d\u000a    The CRiS also organises the Ebor Lectures. Kim initiated this series of\u000d\u000a      lectures as part of the practical application of public theology. The\u000d\u000a      series aims to promote public conversation between the academy, religious\u000d\u000a      communities and the wider society and to contribute to the formation of\u000d\u000a      personal decisions and collective policy-making in economic, political and\u000d\u000a      social spheres. These lectures have been an instrument for the active\u000d\u000a      application of academic thinking and reflection to contemporary issues of\u000d\u000a      day to day society. Selected lectures have been published as Liberating\u000a        Sacred Texts? Revelation, Identity and Public Life (SPCK, 2008) and\u000d\u000a      Christianity and the Renewal of Nature: Creation, Climate Change and\u000d\u000a        Sustainable Living (SPCK, 2011).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"36512","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact of this body of research has been felt in several areas,\u000d\u000a      notably:\u000d\u000a\u0009  \u000d\u000a    The Bible in the Anglican Communion\u000d\u000a    As a result of the research noted above, Andrew Village was asked to act\u000d\u000a      as consultant to the Anglican Consultative Council (ACC) for their Bible\u000a        in the Life of the Church Project (BiLC). This project was\u000d\u000a      commissioned by the Anglican Communion in the wake of the global\u000d\u000a      controversies related to homosexuality and other issues that threatened\u000d\u000a      the cohesion of the Anglican Church. At the heart of these disputes are\u000d\u000a      issues about the use and authority of Scripture, and the project was\u000d\u000a      intended to help the church understand how the Bible is used by its\u000d\u000a      members. After a meeting in Durban in November 2010 a questionnaire survey\u000d\u000a      was set up that used the research instruments already developed. The\u000d\u000a      initial results formed part of the final project report (ACC, 2012), and\u000d\u000a      follow-up work is planned.\u000d\u000a    Issues of biblical authority, veracity and applicability remain of\u000d\u000a      central importance for many `ordinary' readers. Beliefs about the nature\u000d\u000a      of Scripture are central to explaining how it is interpreted, but these\u000d\u000a      beliefs are complex and shaped by a variety of factors. Quantitative\u000d\u000a      research on ordinary readers is revealing how these different factors\u000d\u000a      interact, and why simple explanations do not always suffice. For example,\u000d\u000a      the effects of educational experience on levels of biblical literalism\u000d\u000a      vary even within a single denomination. Research that makes these effects\u000d\u000a      clear is helping denominations such as the Anglican Church to better\u000d\u000a      understand the forces that are currently creating internal tensions and\u000d\u000a      threatening schism.\u000d\u000a    The impact of the YSJU research input to the BiLC project has been to\u000d\u000a      help members of the ACC working group recognize that, without some attempt\u000d\u000a      to reach `ordinary' members of the denomination, there is a danger of\u000d\u000a      assuming that the only relevant view of Scripture in the Church is that\u000d\u000a      which is wholly derived from the educated, informed and interested\u000d\u000a      sections of the hierarchy. The survey has shown how other voices might\u000d\u000a      potentially be heard in a debate that has profound significance for\u000d\u000a      members of an internationally important religious denomination.\u000d\u000a    The SIFT method of preaching\u000d\u000a    Psychological type measures such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator are\u000d\u000a      widely used among churches to help individuals to better understand\u000d\u000a      themselves and to help groups to function more productively. This is not\u000d\u000a      without some critique, so it is important that there is a sound body of\u000d\u000a      evidence to ensure that any application of psychological type is valid and\u000d\u000a      justified.\u000d\u000a    Research on psychological type in churches has shown that congregations\u000d\u000a      and clergy have distinct psychological profiles that differ from each\u000d\u000a      other, and from the public at large. This means that it is especially\u000d\u000a      important that those responsible for teaching or preaching in churches\u000d\u000a      understand the way in which psychology shapes the hermeneutical task of\u000d\u000a      delivering a message to a particular group of people.\u000d\u000a    The SIFT method of preaching (Francis &amp; Village, 2008) is based on\u000d\u000a      the theory corroborated by the research mentioned above. It has been\u000d\u000a      applied to specific lectionary readings (Francis &amp; Atkins, 2000, 2001,\u000d\u000a      2002) and to the general theory of preaching. SIFT preaching is\u000d\u000a      increasingly being discussed by preachers (for example it was the theme of\u000d\u000a      the Church of England's annual lay Reader's conference in 2012) and taught\u000d\u000a      through workshops delivered in the UK. The theory predicts that people\u000d\u000a      have different preferences for acquiring and evaluating information, and\u000d\u000a      this may shape the way that sermons are heard or the Bible read. Preachers\u000d\u000a      are using the results of the research to their advantage, by shaping\u000d\u000a      sermons that ensure their listeners can appreciate biblical expositions\u000d\u000a      using their preferred ways of psychological functioning.\u000d\u000a    The Bible and Creationism\u000d\u000a    The 2009 celebrations of Charles Darwin spawned a number of publications\u000d\u000a      and research studies. Empirical studies were aimed at the general\u000d\u000a      population, and left some church groups feeling that they had been\u000d\u000a      misunderstood. A survey of mainly conservative denominations in the UK in\u000d\u000a      2010 drew on the research expertise of the Practical Theology group at\u000d\u000a      YSJU, and was sponsored by church groups interested in understanding in\u000d\u000a      more detail what Creationists in the UK believe about the Bible, creation\u000d\u000a      and the environment. The impact of this study has been to move the debate\u000d\u000a      from a simple description of beliefs among churchgoers to a more\u000d\u000a      analytical understanding of what factors predict different beliefs, and\u000d\u000a      why Creationist beliefs persist in some church traditions.\u000d\u000a\u0009  \u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The Practical Theology group's collaboration with other researchers and\u000d\u000a      churches has helped faith groups to understand how clergy and lay people\u000d\u000a      engage with Scripture, leading to developments in the theory and practice\u000d\u000a      of preaching.

The first is the\u000d\u000a      development of interest in `real' readers among biblical scholars.\u000d\u000a      Although this has mainly focused on how the social location of scholarly\u000d\u000a      readers affects their interpretation, there is a growing group of biblical\u000d\u000a      scholars who are engaging with 'ordinary' readers. The second source of\u000d\u000a      impetus has been the realization by churches that social and psychological\u000d\u000a      factors cannot be discounted when trying to understand theological\u000d\u000a      disputes about the status and interpretation of Scripture.\u000d\u000a    Two main lines of research have informed empirical studies of Bible\u000d\u000a      reading in faith communities:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000aDevelopment of reliable empirical instruments. Most empirical\u000d\u000a        work on Bible beliefs before the 1990s was based on general population\u000d\u000a        surveys in the United States, with instruments poorly suited for use\u000d\u000a        among churchgoers. Single-item questions on beliefs about biblical\u000d\u000a        literalism, for example, were being used as proxy measures for a range\u000d\u000a        of religious and political beliefs. These measures had some success in a\u000d\u000a        North American context, but were wholly inadequate when applied to\u000d\u000a        Christian groups in the UK. The work of Andrew Village (Village, 2007)\u000d\u000a        remedied this through a study of lay people in the Church of England.\u000d\u000a        Village showed how constructs such as horizon preference, biblical\u000d\u000a        conservatism and biblical literalism could be assessed by reliable and\u000d\u000a        valid instruments. These instruments were developed among a range of\u000d\u000a        Christian denominations, and enabled key dimensions of biblical beliefs\u000d\u000a        to be assessed quantitatively.\u000d\u000a      \u000aThe application of Jungian psychological-type to biblical\u000d\u000a          interpretation. The idea that psychological-type preferences might\u000d\u000a        shape biblical interpretation was first suggested in a book based on\u000d\u000a        different interpretations of the Gospel passages from the Revised Common\u000d\u000a        Lectionary (Francis, 1997).

She advised on the\u000a      content of and appeared in two episodes on Abraham and Moses, drawing\u000a      directly upon her\u000a      research into the religious significance of these cultural ancestors of\u000a      Israel (3.1 above). The\u000a      episodes achieved viewing figures of 0.8 million and 1.0 million\u000a      respectively. Stavrakopoulou also\u000a      wrote an accompanying article, entitled `Abraham's Inheritance', for\u000a      Channel 4's website. Reviews\u000a      of the programmes, broadcast in February 2010, included one in The\u000a        Telegraph (5.2) which\u000a      highlighted Stavrakopoulou's contribution and her suggestion that Moses\u000a      was merely a mythical,\u000a      territorial ancestor of Israel (3.1 above, chapter 3).\u000a    Subsequently, Stavrakopoulou was invited to write and present three\u000a      hour-long documentary\u000a      programmes for BBC2 based on her academic research and expertise. Bible's\u000a        Buried Secrets,\u000a      broadcast in March 2011, again raised questions about the biblical\u000a      portrayal of religion and history\u000a      which challenged beliefs central to Judaism and Christianity, such as\u000a      whether the empire of the\u000a      biblical King David ever existed (episode one; 3.4 above), and\u000a      whether the ancient Israelites\u000a      worshipped a goddess (episode two; 3.3 above, chapter 4). Episode\u000a      three also drew on\u000a      Stavrakopoulou's research on the Garden of Eden (3.2 and 3.6 above).\u000a      Stavrakopoulou's writing\u000a      of the programmes in collaboration with BBC staff meant that her knowledge\u000a      and expertise directly\u000a      impacted upon their content, format and presentation, and during the\u000a      making of the series she\u000a      gave an in-house seminar for staff at BBC TV Centre about the research\u000a      used in the making of the\u000a      programmes. A statement from the BBC's series' executive producer comments\u000a      that: \"Francesca's\u000a      research expertise was crucial to the shaping of Bible's Buried Secrets.\u000a      First, she was able to\u000a      advise the BBC to drop certain programme ideas that were not credible\u000a      subject areas for the\u000a      series; second... she was able to find a focus that would make for an\u000a      original and compelling\u000a      documentary in what is after all a highly sensitive area.\" (5.3).\u000a    The documentaries were screened in a primetime slot, achieving viewing\u000a      figures per episode of\u000a      1.95 million, 1.62 million and 1.56 million. They have since been posted\u000a      on YouTube, attracting\u000a      audiences from the UK, the USA, Canada, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan,\u000a      Singapore and the\u000a      Solomon Islands, with the most popular extracts achieving over 488,000\u000a      views and 3,800\u000a      comments (5.4). The programmes have also been franchised to BBC\u000a      Worldwide, and broadcast in\u000a      countries including Sweden and Australia.\u000a    The programmes were widely previewed in the national press, with the\u000a      idea, presented in episode\u000a      two, that the God of the ancient Israelites might have had a wife (3.3\u000a        above, chapter 4) attracting\u000a      particularly widespread coverage. Reviews of the series appeared in the Telegraph,\u000a      the\u000a      Independent, the Daily Mail and the Times HE Supplement\u000a      as well as on Time website (5.5). A\u000a      number of religious publications have commented on the controversial\u000a      content of the programmes,\u000a      with the Catholic Herald featuring an article (5.6)\u000a      discussing Stavrakopoulou's research findings,\u000a      shown in episode three, about the Garden of Eden (3.2 and 3.6 above),\u000a      and the Catholic website\u000a      Protect the Pope responding to episode one, which called into\u000a      question the existence of King\u000a      David (3.4 above). The Mormon Dialogue discussion forum\u000a      demonstrates the further impact of the\u000a      third episode on religious communities (5.7), while the Guardian\u000a      has included comment on the\u000a      implications of Stavrakopoulou's research for the future of the Mormon\u000a      Church (5.8). The Guardian\u000a      has also produced an edition of their `Passnotes' series featuring Asherah\u000a      (5.9) in response to\u000a      episode two of the documentaries. The Spring 2011 broadcast of the BBC\u000a      TV's viewer reply\u000a      programme Points of View (Spring 2011) carried a main feature on\u000a      the series, and BBC Radio 3's\u000a      Night Waves (14th March 2011) has included a discussion\u000a      of it, while Stavrakopoulou's BBC TV\u000a      blog post about the programmes attracted 322 comments during the short\u000a      period in which readers\u000a      were able to post responses to the blog.\u000a    As a result of the content and impact of the documentaries,\u000a      Stavrakopoulou has appeared several\u000a      times as a panellist on BBC1's religion and ethics programme The Big\u000a        Questions, appeared as a\u000a      guest on BBC1's Sunday Morning Live, contributed to a televised\u000a      discussion programme on BBC4,\u000a      appeared on the US History Channel's documentary series Secrets of the\u000a        Bible, been interviewed\u000a      on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, and participated in Radio 4's panel\u000a      show, Museum of Curiosity.\u000a      One episode of The Big Questions to which Stavrakopoulou\u000a      contributed has since been posted on\u000a      YouTube, where it has received over 100,000 viewings and attracted nearly\u000a      3,500 comments\u000a      (5.10). In July 2011, she presented her research on the suppression\u000a      of the Asherah tradition in\u000a      Hebrew Bible interpretation (3.3 above), which featured in episode\u000a      two of the documentary series,\u000a      at the Modern Church conference, an event mostly attended by non-academic\u000a      liberal Anglicans.\u000a    Also in 2011, her monograph (3.1 above) was discussed by a panel\u000a      at the annual conference of\u000a      the US Society of Biblical Literature, which exists to foster biblical\u000a      scholarship, but also make\u000a      resources available to the wider public.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research carried out at the University of Exeter into the ancient\u000a      religious traditions reflected in\u000a      biblical texts has been at the centre of two major TV documentary series.\u000a      Advised and, for one\u000a      series, written and presented by the main researcher, Francesca\u000a      Stavrakopoulou, the\u000a      documentaries contributed to the content and delivery of public\u000a      broadcasting and greatly extended\u000a      public understanding of the evidence concerning foundational aspects of\u000a      the Jewish and Christian\u000a      faiths.

Appointed to a lectureship at Exeter in\u000a      2005, she took up her\u000a      current role in 2012. Primarily concerned with the cultural contexts of\u000a      the Bible, both ancient and\u000a      modern, her interdisciplinary research combines analysis and assessment of\u000a      archaeological\u000a      reports, textual analysis of biblical and other West Asian literature,\u000a      critical theory from disciplines\u000a      including anthropology, sociology and archaeology, and literature reviews.\u000a    Stavrakopoulou's research into biblical portrayals of history and\u000a      religious practices has included\u000a      investigations into aspects of ancient Israelite and Judahite religion and\u000a      culture that are of great\u000a      significance for modern religious claims and convictions. In 2007\u000a      Stavrakopoulou was awarded\u000a      British Academy grant funding (3.7) to support her work on a\u000a      monograph exploring ancestral\u000a      claims to territory and land-ownership, a topic highly pertinent to\u000a      continuing land disputes in\u000a      Israel\/Palestine (3.1). The monograph, which sold out of its first\u000a      printing within two months of\u000a      publication, showed how an essential element of territorial ideologies\u000a      plays on the belief in the\u000a      post-mortem existence of the dead, including renowned figures such as\u000a      Abraham, Moses and\u000a      David, and highlighted the close correlation of ancestor veneration and\u000a      biblical land claims.\u000a      Stavrakopoulou has also pursued research into the religious and political\u000a      ideology of the Garden of\u000a      Eden (3.2; 3.6).\u000a    Stavrakopoulou has collaborated with a number of international experts,\u000a      including John Barton,\u000a      Martti Nissinen and Susan Niditch, to explore the nature and extent of\u000a      religious diversity in ancient\u000a      Israel and Judah, leading to a co-edited volume (3.3) and a\u000a      forthcoming special issue of a journal.\u000a      Her chapter in this co-edited volume (chapter 4) looks particularly at the\u000a      social contexts of\u000a      polytheism in ancient Israel\/Judah, including claims about the belief that\u000a      God had a wife, and a\u000a      new OUP monograph based on this research is currently in preparation.\u000a    In addition, Stavrakopoulou has undertaken research into death rituals,\u000a      burial and corpses in\u000a      ancient Israel\/Judah, which has included articles published in\u000a      peer-reviewed international\u000a      academic journals (3.5; 3.6). This research identifies and analyses\u000a      the significance of the corpse\u000a      and its social location in these ancient religious contexts. In 2011 she\u000a      was awarded an Early\u000a      Career Fellowship by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) for a\u000a      research project on\u000a      the social agency of the corpse in the biblical world, comparing ancient\u000a      and modern perceptions of\u000a      death and the corpse (3.8), and a monograph based on this project\u000a      is forthcoming.\u000a    From 2006-2009 Stavrakopoulou was Co-Investigator on a project funded by\u000a      the AHRC examining\u000a      uses of the Bible in environmental ethics (3.9), and co-editor of\u000a      one of the project's main outputs.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37281","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    \u000a      Informing international policy debate and practice in areas of\u000a          urban planning\u000a      Shaping public awareness of ethical issues relating to urban\u000a          planning\u000a      Highlighting need for urban planning that takes the environmental\u000a          crisis seriously\u000a    \u000a    Gorringe's research has impacted upon policy and practices in urban\u000a      planning at both national and international levels.

Simm\u000a      of the University of Nottingham and HR Water in a paper on flood risk\u000a      management which argues that even such practical and essential\u000a      construction projects as flood defence systems should be shaped by\u000a      aesthetic as well as functional considerations (5.2).\u000a    Research by Gorringe has further helped to shape public awareness of\u000a      ethical issues relating to urban planning, impacting in particular upon\u000a      church communities both in the UK and abroad. In 2009, Gorringe gave a\u000a      public lecture on his research into ethics and aesthetics in planning and\u000a      public policy (see 3.1-3.4 above) as part of the `Radical\u000a      Abundance: A Theology of Sustainability' conference held at the Trinity\u000a      Institute, New York. The lecture, which was followed by a question and\u000a      answer session with the audience, was streamed live to viewers throughout\u000a      the United States, and is now available to view on the Trinity Institute\u000a      website (5.3) &#8212; where it received 463 viewings in February 2009\u000a      alone &#8212; together with articles responding to the issues raised. A review\u000a      of the lecture has been posted on the `God's Politics' blog maintained by\u000a      `Sojourners', a USA-based organisation for faith-based social action, and\u000a      Gorringe's research in this area has also been the subject of debate on\u000a      numerous other blogs, including that of the Cooperative Baptist\u000a      Fellowship, an Atlanta-based movement with approximately 1800 affiliated\u000a      churches (5.4). An adult education course based on Gorringe's\u000a      research into theology and the built environment (see 3.1 above)\u000a      has been devised, and has the aim of raising public awareness of Christian\u000a      perspectives on urban issues (5.1). The course was first run at St\u000a      Mark's Episcopal Cathedral, Minneapolis, in 2012. In the UK, reviews and\u000a      recommendations of both Gorringe's 2002 and 2011 monographs (see 3.1\u000a        and 3.5 above) have appeared on the websites of both the Arthur Rank\u000a      Centre, which supports rural communities and churches in the UK, and\u000a      Christian Ecology Link, which seeks to foster links between the UK's\u000a      Christian churches and environmental movements.\u000a    Gorringe's research (see 3.5 above) has additionally served to\u000a      highlight the need for the environmental crisis to be taken seriously\u000a      within urban planning. In March 2013, speaking at a seminar for Operation\u000a      Noah, a UK organisation promoting responsible Church engagement with\u000a      issues of climate change, Gorringe launched the Ash Wednesday Declaration\u000a      which, jointly-authored by Gorringe and informed by his research, has\u000a      been signed up to by all the major churches and commits them to action on\u000a      climate change (5.5). A member of the Board of Operation Noah,\u000a      commenting on Gorringe's involvement with the Declaration, states that:\u000a      `Tim went away to produce a first draft statement which the group then\u000a      discussed. It condenses a great deal of careful theology into an\u000a      accessible one-side document. The final version follows exactly Tim's\u000a      outline, and the vast majority of his wording. He was an essential factor\u000a      in its publication [and] Operation Noah is fortunate in having Tim's\u000a      support as a substantial theological and academic resource' (5.6).\u000a      Discussions of and responses to the Declaration, which has received the\u000a      support of Archbishop Rowan Williams, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Oecumenical\u000a      Patriarch Bartholomew, and church groups from Australia, the USA ,and\u000a      continental Europe, have since featured widely in both national and\u000a      international media, including the Telegraph, in an article that\u000a      has attracted 314 reader comments (5.7), the Guardian, the\u000a      Church Times, the Church of England newspaper, Independent\u000a        Catholic News and the National Catholic Reporter (USA). The\u000a      declaration has also been discussed on the websites of Eco-Congregation\u000a      and the European Christian Environmental Network, as well as in the blog\u000a      of The Tablet. It has further provided the basis for recent\u000a      campaigns including, most notably, the attempt to persuade Christian\u000a      churches to disinvest from fossil fuels, and in this way has had\u000a      significant impact upon ecclesiastical investment bodies and their\u000a      decisions (5.6).\u000a    This research has also stimulated public debate, especially among church\u000a      congregations, about the importance of sustainability. In 2011, Gorringe\u000a      delivered Operation Noah's Annual Lecture, speaking on the subject of\u000a      whether climate change, and its connection with the global economy, was a\u000a      matter for Church confession &#8212; a lecture that was significant in paving\u000a      the way for the development of the Ash Wednesday Declaration the following\u000a      year. A response to the lecture was given by Christine Elliot of the\u000a      Methodist Church in Britain (5.8). Additionally, in 2012, Gorringe\u000a      led workshops on his research into sustainable economy at the Christian\u000a      Ecology Link annual conference, the theme of which was `Spiritual Capital\u000a      and Sustainable Living', and, in 2013, he gave a paper entitled `Towards a\u000a      New Economics' at a theology seminar organised by Operation Noah and\u000a      attended by around 50 people, including clergy and members of the public\u000a      as well as academics.\u000a    Research led by Gorringe into the role of values in major social change (see\u000a        3.6 above) has impacted significantly upon the development of the\u000a      Transition Network, prompting thought among church communities and other\u000a      public organisations about responsible attitudes towards climate change.\u000a      Gorringe's research project on this subject (see 3.7 above)\u000a      included a `Values in Transition' conference, held at the University of\u000a      Exeter in May 2012, which brought together academic scholars and members\u000a      of the Transition community for discussion and debate about Gorringe's\u000a      research. A report on the conference by members of the Transition\u000a      community has featured on the Transition Town Totnes website, and a public\u000a      discussion of the social vision underpinning the movement, including\u000a      contributions by Gorringe, has taken place on the blog of the national\u000a      Transition Network website (5.9). In 2009, Gorringe was invited to\u000a      present his research as keynote speaker at the Christian Ecology Link\u000a      annual conference, the theme of which was the Transition Network, and, at\u000a      the 2010 conference of the National Justice and Peace Network, he led\u000a      workshops on Transition Towns and the future of food. An interview with\u000a      Gorringe, in which he discusses his research in this area, featured in the\u000a      August 2013 edition of the Church Times, the leading Anglican\u000a      newspaper for clergy and church members. Gorringe's research has also\u000a      influenced the development of Transition-inspired initiatives in the USA (5.10).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Timothy Gorringe's research examines issues in urban planning and\u000a      transition towns from a theological and ethical perspective.

This is\u000a      particularly the case in view of the current need to re-envision our\u000a      cities in the face of ecological pressures, among which climate change is\u000a      especially significant.\u000a    It is this challenge of thinking theologically and ethically about the\u000a      form of the city that is addressed in Timothy Gorringe's research, which\u000a      has taken place within the context of a wider Departmental focus on the\u000a      engagement of theology with issues of public and ethical concern. This\u000a      focus includes the study of not only urban planning but also subjects\u000a      including farming, human rights, criminal justice and environmental\u000a      ethics. Gorringe in particular has been at the forefront of such research\u000a      since his appointment to Exeter as Professor of Theological Studies in\u000a      1998.\u000a    Gorringe's first monograph on theology and the urban environment, A\u000a        Theology of the Built Environment, was published in 2002 by\u000a      Cambridge University Press and was submitted to RAE2008 (3.1).\u000a      Described by John Vincent in a review for the International Journal\u000a        for the Study of the Christian Church as `a brilliant, creative,\u000a      sustained, wide ranging and enormously erudite contribution to the current\u000a      debates about \"the City\" and \"the Urban\"', this monograph formed the\u000a      subject of a week-long conference at the University of Virginia in 2006,\u000a      in which Gorringe was invited to participate. The monograph has also\u000a      informed the development of a specialist undergraduate module, `Theology\u000a      and the Built Environment', which involves visits to a variety of urban\u000a      environments and discussions with public officials involved in the\u000a      planning process. Additional research in this area led to the publication\u000a      of two articles in peer-reviewed journals and a chapter in an edited\u000a      volume (3.2; 3.3; 3.4), and culminated in the publication by\u000a      Cambridge University Press in 2011 of a second major monograph by\u000a      Gorringe, The Common Good and the Global Emergency: God and the Built\u000a        Environment, which is being submitted to REF2014 (3.5).\u000a    In 2010, Gorringe was awarded a major AHRC grant for a two-year project\u000a      examining the role of values in responding to major social change. The\u000a      project focused on the Transition Network, which promotes sustainable\u000a      living in local communities (3.7) and is particularly strong in the\u000a      South-West of England. Gorringe has been involved with the Network since\u000a      very near its inception, and he has also assisted with its establishment\u000a      in the United States. A monograph based on the findings of the project is\u000a      due to be published by Gorringe, likely with Polity Press. Gorringe and\u000a      Rosemary Beckham (employed as researcher since Michael DeLashmutt's\u000a      departure to the USA) have written an account of Transition for Churches,\u000a      published by SCM in October 2013. In addition, Beckham is writing two\u000a      journal articles on Theology and Transition. Stewart Barr from the School\u000a      of Geography, who jointly held the grant, has one journal article\u000a      published (3.6) and a second in preparation. A postdoctoral\u000a      research assistant, Justin Pollard, worked with local Transition groups,\u000a      seeking to understand their approach to social change and the values that\u000a      sustain them, and is also due to produce two journal articles.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38436","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The underpinning research has generated impact in two main spheres:\u000a      religious practice and third-sector awareness and policy.\u000a    Impact has been enhanced by the UoA's commitment to dialogical methods in\u000a      fieldwork and its policy of hosting conferences with contributions by\u000a      research users alongside scholars. (Papers from ASANAS and other\u000a      scholarship on the field made freely available through Journal of\u000a        Alternative Spiritualities and New Age Studies (2005-11) ).\u000a    Religious practice\u000a    Impact is particularly evidenced by the adoption and re-articulation of\u000a      terms and knowledge drawn from Bowman and Harvey's outputs and public\u000a      engagements.\u000a    During her long-term research in Glastonbury, Bowman has given public\u000a      lectures to a cross-section of townspeople, and participated in symposia\u000a      exploring the relationship between academics and the town. She has had\u000a      on-going engagement with a range of practitioners, e.g. Christians,\u000a      Goddess devotees, non-aligned Pagans and spiritual seekers, and people\u000a      involved in the `pilgrim economy'. Their access to her writing, and in\u000a      some cases their participation in films for the Unit's undergraduate\u000a      modules, have impacted on practitioner self-awareness and\u000a      self-presentation, and their contextual awareness of broader spiritual\u000a      trends. People involved in Glastonbury's `spiritual' or `pilgrim economy'\u000a      have used her work to counter the more cynical critiques of such activity,\u000a      articulating their business in terms of `calling', bringing spiritual\u000a      values to the marketplace, and increasingly reflecting such insights in\u000a      their websites and discourse.\u000a    Bowman's work has also focused on contemporary Celtic spirituality. Her\u000a      term `cardiac Celts', for those whose Celtic self-identity results from\u000a      `elective affinity', has been adopted by practitioners, including the\u000a      Cyberwitch website, which cites Bowman's `brilliant essay on the topic' (http:\/\/www.cyberwitch.com\/wychwood\/library\/WhenIsACeltNotACelt.htm).\u000a    Harvey is regularly invited to talk at Pagan venues and events, e.g. an\u000a      annual talk at the Milton Keynes Pagan moot and at the Rainbow Future's\u000a      Druid Camp. Interviews on Paganism or animism have been posted on websites\u000a      and YouTube, e.g. by Keltoiradio (Italy) and the Earth Medicine Alliance\u000a      (USA).\u000a    Reception of Harvey's research among religious practitioners has inspired\u000a      increased confidence and even the adoption of ways of defining, speaking\u000a      about and experimenting with animism. The Earth Medicine Alliance (USA)\u000a      website (http:\/\/earthmedicine.org\/voicesoftheearth)\u000a      notes that `Animism: Respecting the Living World helped inspire the\u000a      founding of the Earth Medicine Alliance'. The Bioregional Animism website\u000a      (Germany) (www.bioregionalanimism.com)\u000a      comments, `We quote you for a damn good reason! Why reinvent the wheel!'\u000a      Their definition of animism as focused on inter-species relationality\u000a      rather than as `belief in spirits' demonstrates the impact of Harvey's\u000a      argument. Similarly, the founders of the UK's Midwinter Bear Feast (a core\u000a      event for a self-identified `animistic spirituality group') emailed Harvey\u000a      to say that, `This now established religious Rite was inspired in a large\u000a      part by your research and writings', and that `We always refer to your\u000a      work when explaining the origins of the Midwinter Bear Feast'. This is\u000a      corroborated in their website (www.ancientmusic.co.uk\/bear_tribe\/about.html).\u000a    Third-sector awareness and policy\u000a    Among alternative and mainstream business people in Glastonbury, Bowman's\u000a      `spiritual economy' work is recognised as having provoked more nuanced\u000a      academic and popular understanding of spirituality as a positive economic\u000a      force.\u000a    Having addressed the Glastonbury Chamber of Commerce, she has been\u000a      thanked for helping to raise awareness among local councillors of\u000a      Glastonbury's international importance as a pilgrimage site, something\u000a      that had not previously been fully acknowledged. This will influence how\u000a      the town promotes itself in future, both in terms of conventional and\u000a      spiritual tourism. Her work, like\u000a    Harvey's, has promoted broader understanding of changes in religious\u000a      expression and new forms of interpreting, presenting and interacting with\u000a      cultural heritage.\u000a\u0009  Harvey's research played a key role in the Druid\u000a      Network's 2009 application for UK charitable status, a striking example of\u000a      how work of this kind has informed and influenced practice among\u000a      policy-makers. Following the Charity Commission's rejection of an earlier\u000a      case, the Druid Network approached Harvey for a supporting statement on\u000a      the grounds of the high value placed on his work by Pagan movements.\u000a      Harvey's statement is cited by the Charity Commissioners (www.charitycommission.gov.uk\/media\/92221\/druiddec.pdf)\u000a      both for what it says about Druidry and Paganism, and also for its comment\u000a      on the inherent diversity of all lived religions (further illustrating the\u000a      UoA's importance in foregrounding vernacular practice). The Druid\u000a      Network's website\u000a      (druidnetwork.org\/about-the-druid-network\/charitable-status) includes an\u000a      acknowledgement by the chair of the charity's trustees that `Harvey's\u000a      report went a long way in helping' resolve the Charity Commissioners'\u000a      concerns about `cogency, coherence, seriousness and importance'.\u000a    In addition to the Druid Network being awarded charity status, impact\u000a      also includes a 2012 request by a Plymouth Brethren Christian Church group\u000a      for advice and supporting statements to aid in their ongoing application\u000a      for charity status.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study assesses the impact of research in two spheres:\u000a    \u000a      the self-presentation of practitioners of alternative religions and\u000a        spiritualities\u000a      the decision making of policy-makers in relation to them.\u000a    \u000a    In the first sphere, the research has helped practitioners of\u000a      `alternative' and `vernacular' religions (especially those identifiable as\u000a      `animist Pagans' and `New Agers') to achieve a more confident and better\u000a      understood public presence.\u000a    Research in the second sphere assisted the Druid Network UK to gain\u000a      charitable status, and helped councillors and `alternative' and mainstream\u000a      businesses to understand better Glastonbury's international importance as\u000a      a pilgrimage site, and the economic benefits thereof.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    The Open University\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Open University","InstitutionName":"Open University","PeerGroup":"D","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007773}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000aBowman, Marion (2000).

Work by Bowman and Harvey has spearheaded international\u000a      research in this area, `normalising' the inclusion of associated debates\u000a      within the discipline. Their research (largely conducted by ethnological\u000a      methodologies) has also engaged with vernacular Christianity and\u000a      indigenous religions (e.g. in Newfoundland). Bowman's Glastonbury research\u000a      and Harvey's animism research are widely cited internationally and have\u000a      shaped undergraduate curricula and research agendas.\u000a    Bowman has applied insights from folkloristics and ethnology to both\u000a      contemporary Celtic spirituality and Glastonbury's vernacular religion and\u000a      `alternative' spirituality, e.g. highlighting the role of narrative,\u000a      material culture, the creation of tradition and elective identity. She has\u000a      revealed continuities amidst apparent change, focusing on the\u000a      heterogeneity of lived religion in both traditional and emergent forms of\u000a      religiosity, and articulated competing paradigms of sacred place. Her work\u000a      on Glastonbury's spiritual economy exemplifies current debates on, and\u000a      reappraisal of, commodification within the neoliberal economic sphere.\u000a      Bowman's longitudinal research on Glastonbury (a heterotopic site\u000a      emblematic of religious, healing and economic trends found in lesser\u000a      concentration elsewhere in Europe) has fostered international scholarship\u000a      on and multidisciplinary engagement with worldviews and praxis within the\u000a      contested contemporary religious milieu.\u000a    Harvey's fieldwork among Pagans internationally has concerned the\u000a      diversity of Pagan movements, their involvement with contemporary culture,\u000a      definitional tensions between ritual and belief, and the significance of\u000a      performance and interiority. Partially influenced by his research among\u000a      indigenous peoples (particularly Anishinaabeg and Maori), he has paid\u000a      particular attention to the ongoing rise of animism in framing how people\u000a      relate to `other than human persons' and related ontological \/\u000a      epistemological debates among Pagans. His work shapes multidisciplinary\u000a      international debate about animism.\u000a    Parallel to Bowman's work, Harvey's research maintains a focus on the\u000a      permeable boundaries of lived and vernacular religion. Attention to\u000a      animistic and esotericist currents (among others) in the continuing\u000a      evolution of Paganism is important to understanding the diversity of Pagan\u000a      environmentalism, ritualism, origins-myths, gender constructions and\u000a      activism. Related contributions to methodological debates include Harvey's\u000a      influential `guesthood' proposal as a contrast to the dichotomy\u000a      `insider\/outsider'.\u000a    The key insights from this body of work are:\u000a    \u000a      Critical revision, on both theoretical and empirical grounds, of a\u000a        conventional narrative of the marginality and eccentricity of\u000a        `alternative' religious currents.\u000a      Enhanced awareness of the significant contributions made to popular\u000a        culture and civil society by Pagans and New Agers &#8212; including in\u000a        therapeutic, cultural heritage, performance and new entrepreneurial\u000a        realms.\u000a      Revision of understanding of `animism', both as a scholarly category\u000a        and as an increasingly popular practice or lifestyle.\u000a      Methodological innovation in focusing on vernacular, performance and\u000a        material cultural issues in the study of religions.\u000a      Challenging Protestant Christian emphases on beliefs, texts and\u000a        transcendence in the definition and debate about `religion'.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38585","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Central to maximising impact has been Wolffe's AHRC Knowledge Transfer\u000d\u000a      Fellowship, `Modern Religious History and the Contemporary Church'\u000d\u000a      (working title, `Building on History'), in partnership with Kings\u000d\u000a      College London, the Church of England Diocese of London and Lambeth Palace\u000d\u000a      Library.\u000d\u000a    The primary initial aim was to work alongside the main stakeholder, the\u000d\u000a      Diocese of London, to:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      promote learning amongst churchgoers, clergy and others, informing\u000d\u000a        them about the modern history of the Church of England in ways that\u000d\u000a        enhance the self-understanding of the diocese and its parishes\u000d\u000a      shape contemporary ministry and engagement through increased\u000d\u000a        historical awareness.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The `Building on History' project engaged with its stakeholders and the\u000d\u000a      wider user community in a variety of ways.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      There was a comprehensive programme of seminars and workshops,\u000d\u000a        summarising recent research in modern religious history, and suggesting\u000d\u000a        applications to the work of the present-day church. These were attended\u000d\u000a        by over 450 lay leaders, clergy and ordinands in London between 2009 and\u000d\u000a        2011. In 2011, three regional events for leaders from other Church of\u000d\u000a        England dioceses attracted a further 100 or so participants from as far\u000d\u000a        afield as Cornwall. Feedback suggests significant impacts on thinking\u000d\u000a        and practice: for example in embedding new and more practical approaches\u000d\u000a        to the use of history in clergy training, and in inspiring the\u000d\u000a        restoration in 2012 of the important Victorian decoration at St Mary\u000d\u000a        Magdalene, Enfield.\u000d\u000a      The project has aimed to inform strategy and policy through applying\u000d\u000a        historical insight to contemporary problems. Events were held in 2010\u000d\u000a        for the staff of St Paul's Cathedral and archdeacons and area deans, and\u000d\u000a        reports and recommendations submitted to the Bishop of London and to his\u000d\u000a        senior staff. The project has informed development of the diocese's\u000d\u000a        future strategy, `Capital Vision 2020', launched in June 2013. The\u000d\u000a        Bishop of London writes (printed project report p.3): `This project has\u000d\u000a        been a powerful contribution to enhancing the character of the Church in\u000d\u000a        the Diocese as a learning organism.'\u000d\u000a      In June 2010, the project launched an innovative online resource\u000d\u000a        toolkit which provides expert advice on how to find out about the\u000d\u000a        history of local congregations, churches and communities. This online\u000d\u000a        resource is a significant legacy of the project, facilitating new\u000d\u000a        `grassroots' historical research in the coming years. Dr Clive Field OBE\u000d\u000a        (formerly Head of Research and Collections at the British Library)\u000d\u000a        regards the project as an `exemplar for developing an appreciation of\u000d\u000a        the relevance of the past, and the importance of historical records,\u000d\u000a        among contemporary faith communities' (printed project report, p.22).\u000d\u000a      The project has developed the concept of a `history audit', which\u000d\u000a        individual churches can undertake in order to contextualise their\u000d\u000a        current activity and planning for the future. This approach was outlined\u000d\u000a        in a published pamphlet: John Maiden and Neil Evans, What Can\u000d\u000a          Churches Learn from their Past? The Parish History Audit\u000d\u000a        (Cambridge: Grove Booklets, 2012). The pamphlet is now embedded in the\u000d\u000a        diocese's strategy and included in its Mission Action Planning\u000d\u000a        guidelines. The Bishop of Willesden describes this development as one of\u000d\u000a        `real importance'.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The success of the project partnership with the Diocese of London formed\u000d\u000a      the basis for wider engagement with other faith constituencies in London.\u000d\u000a      This engagement developed in a subsequent Open University- and AHRC-funded\u000d\u000a      follow-on project, `Building on History: Religion in London', in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with Royal Holloway University of London and a range of\u000d\u000a      practitioner stakeholders. A series of ten events involving Baptists,\u000d\u000a      Black Majority Churches, Jews, Methodists, Muslims and Roman Catholics was\u000d\u000a      held in late 2012 and early 2013. Attendance averaged approximately 40,\u000d\u000a      with at least 200 individuals attending on at least one occasion.\u000d\u000a      Accompanying resources were provided on the website.\u000d\u000a    Very positive feedback was received. For example, Dr Jamil Sherif (Muslim\u000d\u000a      Council of Britain) judges that the project `really brought people\u000d\u000a      together', raised the profile of history and has stimulated a more\u000d\u000a      positive attitude to record-keeping among Muslims in London. Dr Tim Powell\u000d\u000a      (National Archives) regards this project as `a very important strand in\u000d\u000a      the delivery of the religious archives support plan'. There was also\u000d\u000a      significant engagement with schools: Mr Marlon Chetty (The Urswick School,\u000d\u000a      Hackney) considers the impact on his students (from two workshops in the\u000d\u000a      autumn term 2012) to have been `really profound'. Examples of pilot\u000d\u000a      teaching material have been made publicly available on the website.\u000d\u000a    The programme for Wolffe's `Protestant-Catholic Conflict' project\u000d\u000a      included, in 2012, a series of seminars with users and stakeholders in\u000d\u000a      Belfast, Birmingham, Liverpool, London and Milton Keynes. The final\u000d\u000a      project conference in Belfast attracted numerous non-academic delegates.\u000d\u000a      Participants at the seminars and conference included religious leaders,\u000d\u000a      senior civil servants, police officers and key representatives of\u000d\u000a      non-governmental organisations and voluntary organisations.

In the mid-1990s, work by Beckerlegge, Wolffe,\u000d\u000a      Gerald Parsons (senior lecturer until 2012) and Terence Thomas (senior\u000d\u000a      lecturer until 1996) pioneered the documentation and analysis of the\u000d\u000a      growth of religious diversity in Britain after the Second World War,\u000d\u000a      setting recent trends in the longer-term historical perspective of\u000d\u000a      developments since the Victorian era. Subsequent important contributions\u000d\u000a      were made by Susan Mumm (lecturer\/senior lecturer 1996-2006), with her\u000d\u000a      work on Anglican sisterhoods, and David Herbert (lecturer\/senior lecturer\u000d\u000a      1996-2009), with his research on secularisation theory and on media\u000d\u000a      representations of the Northern Ireland conflict. Wolffe has been\u000d\u000a      particularly active in this field. He published substantial monographs on\u000d\u000a      aspects of British and Irish religious identities in 1994 and 2000, and\u000d\u000a      edited texts and analysis of the 1851 Census of Religious Worship between\u000d\u000a      2000 and 2005. There is also extensive British and Irish material in his\u000d\u000a      2006 and 2012 books on international evangelicalism. Maiden, who joined\u000d\u000a      the department as a research associate in 2009, has published a monograph\u000d\u000a      on the 1927\/28 prayer book crisis, and has since developed these research\u000d\u000a      themes in work on evangelicalism and anti-Catholicism in the 1960s and\u000d\u000a      1970s.\u000d\u000a    During recent years, Wolffe has focused his attention on London and to\u000d\u000a      Northern Ireland. His work on London includes a substantial contribution\u000d\u000a      to the prize-winning 1400th anniversary history of St Paul's\u000d\u000a      Cathedral (2004), a co-authored analysis of the resurgence of the Church\u000d\u000a      of England in the capital since 1980 (2012), and a case study of the\u000d\u000a      relationship between the building of physical churches and the development\u000d\u000a      of congregations in Victorian Finchley (2013). He has approached Northern\u000d\u000a      Ireland through the comparative historical framework suggested by his\u000d\u000a      earlier work on British and American anti-Catholicism, resulting in an\u000d\u000a      edited book with a substantial sole-authored introduction and conclusion\u000d\u000a      (2013) that explores long-term trajectories since the Reformation. In\u000d\u000a      collaboration with the Belfast-based Institute for Conflict Research\u000d\u000a      (ICR), he has been investigating recent and present-day attitudes in\u000d\u000a      Northern Ireland, exploring how these are illuminated by an historical\u000d\u000a      perspective and seeking to identify potential strategies to assist in\u000d\u000a      conflict resolution, both in Northern Ireland and elsewhere. Initial\u000d\u000a      outcomes from this work are reported in John Bell, For God, Ulster and\u000d\u000a        Ireland?

In 2013, the senior pastor of the Yoido Full\u000a      Gospel Church, which has a\u000a      membership of over 1 million people, observed that `Anderson's prominent\u000a      book, An Introduction to\u000a        Pentecostalism, is indeed a must-read not only for scholars but also\u000a      for pastors and interested lay\u000a      leaders', and reported that `readers of Dr. Anderson's book have contacted\u000a      my church from all\u000a      around the world with various comments and questions', and that Anderson's\u000a      `creative insights in\u000a      An Introduction to Pentecostalism have helped Yoido Full Gospel\u000a      Church specify its strengths and\u000a      weaknesses' (see corroborating source 1). These reactions attest\u000a      impressively to the\u000a      attractiveness to church leaders and members of Anderson's revision of the\u000a      origins of\u000a      Pentecostalism, and the desire of huge numbers of Pentecostal Christians\u000a      to hear more about\u000a      them.\u000a    On the basis of his published research, and particularly An\u000a        Introduction to Pentecostalism (2004),\u000a      Anderson has been invited to speak in 23 countries on five continents. He\u000a      has lectured to church\u000a      congregations, often of considerable size, and also addressed\u000a      consultations for church leaders, lay\u000a      persons and seminary groups around the world. In both his public lectures\u000a      and consultation\u000a      addresses he has advanced his multiple centre argument for the origins of\u000a      Pentecostalism, and the\u000a      global perspective of the phenomenon. He continues to influence the\u000a      direction of thinking in\u000a      churches and seminaries through his involvement with the individuals,\u000a      churches and organisations\u000a      he has encountered. Examples include the following:\u000a    a) Every year since 2008 Anderson has been invited to the Ecumenical\u000a      Institute at Bossey, an\u000a      international centre of the World Council of Churches in Geneva for\u000a      encounter, dialogue and\u000a      formation, to deliver annual guest lectures to Pentecostal and other\u000a      church practitioners from six\u000a      continents.\u000a    b) Anderson's post-colonial views about the origins of Pentecostalism\u000a      have readily found\u000a      recognition among influential church organisations in non-Western\u000a      countries. In April 2008, he\u000a      spoke about his distinctive global Pentecostal theology and\u000a      multiple-origin history at five separate\u000a      regional Easter convention meetings in various parts of Ghana for the\u000a      Church of Pentecost, the\u000a      largest denomination in Ghana, with audiences totalling about 7,000. In\u000a      November 2009, he was\u000a      guest speaker at an immense gathering of 35,000 Indian Pentecostals at the\u000a      Filadelfia Bible\u000a      College, Rajasthan (source 2). He has had a similar influence on the\u000a      leaders of churches and\u000a      seminaries in the Philippines and in Ecuador (details are given in the\u000a      accounts below).\u000a    Influencing teaching and curriculum design in training institutions\u000a        and seminaries\u000a      The most focused impact of Anderson's work on non-academic audiences has\u000a      been through its\u000a      influence on teaching and curriculum design at theological training\u000a      institutions in Ghana, India, the\u000a      Philippines and Ecuador, and on attitudes of pastors connected with them.\u000a      This influence has been\u000a      exerted both through Anderson's publications and through his personal\u000a      visits as expert consultant.\u000a      Since 2008, students in these institutions who are training for ministry\u000a      (after five years these now\u000a      number in their thousands), mainly among Pentecostal church congregations,\u000a      have followed\u000a      courses which enshrine Anderson's principles: that Pentecostalism\u000a      originated in many different\u000a      places as local phenomena, rather than as an export from the USA; that it\u000a      bears specific\u000a      characteristics in different locations; and that it frequently\u000a      incorporates assimilated forms of pre-existing\u000a      religious beliefs and practices. Pastors connected with the institutions\u000a      have also been\u000a      influenced in their understandings of the origins of Pentecostal movements\u000a      in their regions both by\u000a      Anderson's publications and by the lectures he has delivered there. The\u000a      net result is increased\u000a      confidence that the forms of Pentecostalism practised in specific\u000a      locations have their own\u000a      authenticity, and that they should continue to develop along their own\u000a      lines rather than conform to\u000a      foreign models.\u000a    Anderson has had close connections with a number of theological colleges\u000a      in various parts of the\u000a      world. Among them is Pentecost University College, Accra, Ghana, which was\u000a      founded by the\u000a      Chair of the Church of Pentecost and President of the Ghana Pentecostal\u000a      and Charismatic\u000a      Council, the largest denomination in Ghana. Anderson visited the College\u000a      in April 2008 soon after\u000a      its foundation, and advised the newly-appointed staff on curriculum\u000a      design. One of those who\u000a      benefited was the Chair himself, who reports that Anderson's research\u000a      influenced his design of a\u000a      new course. Furthermore, `This course is taught to all Church of Pentecost\u000a      ministers in training.\u000a      The course has also been approved by the Ghana National Accreditation\u000a      Board and has become a\u000a      major course for the BA Theology degree held at the Pentecost University\u000a      College in Accra (source\u000a      3).\u000a    Another institution with which Anderson has had close ties is Filadelfia\u000a      Bible College, Rajasthan,\u000a      India, which educates mainly `tribal' Christians in church leadership.\u000a      Here, Anderson worked with\u000a      the staff on curriculum development in November 2009. The College\u000a      Principal explains that he\u000a      `helped our colleagues to develop a \"Pentecostal cognitive structure\" in\u000a      their academic pursuit\u000a      without losing their \"Pentecostal spirituality\". ... As a result, a new\u000a      generation of leaders who are\u000a      prepared in the Filadelfia Bible College are trained from a global\u000a      Pentecostal perspective to\u000a      treasure our particular Indian heritage and history' (source 2).\u000a    Anderson has also worked with staff at Asia Pacific Theological Seminary,\u000a      Baguio City, Philippines,\u000a      `a cooperative ministry of the Assemblies of God national churches of\u000a      Asia, Pacific Oceania, and\u000a      the Assemblies of God World Missions-USA'. The on-going impact of his\u000a      influence stemmed from\u000a      the Fourteenth William Menzies Lectures that he delivered in February\u000a      13-17, 2006, to an\u000a      audience of about 200 people including local pastors, teachers from other\u000a      theological institutions,\u000a      ministers from other parts of the Philippines and interested lay people. A\u000a      recent faculty member\u000a      indicates that `during and after' these lectures, Anderson's input had\u000a      profound effects, in the form\u000a      of new confidence in local versions of Pentecostalism among pastors and\u000a      also new interest in local\u000a      Pentecostal history. He continues: `Several of those who attended Prof.\u000a      Anderson's lectures and\u000a      became acquainted with his books [were challenged to] look at their\u000a      curriculum, particularly the\u000a      Pentecostal studies.' Moreover, `The comments from Filipinos and Asians in\u000a      particular are\u000a      consistent. They appreciate the information that they were getting from\u000a      the lectures that basically\u000a      decentralizes the North American Pentecostal experience as the paradigm\u000a      and the source of the\u000a      mighty movement of the Holy Spirit. ... There is that sense of growing\u000a      confidence and clear\u000a      realization that the expressions and forms of their Christian faith are\u000a      not only due to the influence\u000a      of Western Christianity.' Finally, he suggests that Anderson's influence\u000a      has extended into the wider\u000a      Pentecostal communities: `the books that he has written already reached\u000a      the Asian Pentecostal\u000a      congregations through the ministers of the gospel that read them' (source\u000a      4).\u000a    A fourth example of this profound influence is SEMISUD, Seminario\u000a      Sudamericano, Quito,\u000a      Ecuador, which trains church leaders. In September 2011, Anderson gave a\u000a      series of lectures to\u000a      students, all practising Pentecostal ministers, from eight different Latin\u000a      American countries, and\u000a      also advised staff on the curriculum. SEMISUD's President comments:\u000a      `During the said lectures\u000a      there were representatives of 18 countries of Latin America in the\u000a      classroom. Most of them were\u000a      pastors that have shown great deal of success in their Christian\u000a      ministry'. His overall assessment\u000a      was that `[i]t was an inspirational and educational moment for the life\u000a      and ministry of the\u000a      Pentecostal leaders who attended the lectures' (source 5).\u000a    These wide-ranging examples give clear evidence of Anderson's unrivalled\u000a      influence among\u000a      Pentecostal church leaders in many parts of the world, and the ready\u000a      response his ideas have met.\u000a      Influenced by his mould-breaking research into the origins of charismatic\u000a      manifestations in various\u000a      locations, local congregations and seminarians have achieved new\u000a      understanding and new\u000a      confidence. The path from his historical and theological teachings to\u000a      fresh expressions of religious\u000a      faith is clear, and their impact is both wide and deep.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Challenging the popular perception of Pentecostalism as a\u000a      `made-in-the-USA' religion and\u000a      advocating the global beginnings, multiple origins and local initiatives\u000a      of the phenomenon,\u000a      Anderson's research has had profound effects on the self-understanding\u000a        and practices of\u000a        Pentecostal Christian churches across the globe.

His research has played a key\u000a      role in challenging American-centred\u000a      mission methodologies and in endorsing the independence and authenticity\u000a      of local,\u000a      indigenous versions of Pentecostal practices. He is one of very few\u000a      internationally acknowledged\u000a      specialists on global Pentecostalism, and enjoys a reputation as `one of\u000a      the greatest scholars of\u000a      the phenomenon' (Philip Jenkins).\u000a    At the heart of Anderson's research are three contentions:\u000a    \u000a      Pentecostalism originated and spread as a missionary movement\u000a        throughout the world from\u000a        multiple centres of renewal and revival.\u000a      The popularity of the Pentecostal movement can in part be attributed\u000a        to its contextual\u000a          spirituality.\u000a      Pentecostalism has been more meaningful precisely because it has continued\u000a          some pre-Christian\u000a          religious expressions and symbols and invested them with new meanings.\u000a    \u000a    These contentions have emerged from extensive fieldwork undertaken over a\u000a      period of 20 years\u000a      (since 1993) in 8 African and 5 Asian countries, in Chile and Ecuador, and\u000a      also in the UK,\u000a      Germany, USA and Canada. It began with pioneering research on the rapidly\u000a      changing nature of\u000a      African Christianity, but quickly expanded to a broader scope, resulting\u000a      in three co-edited\u000a      collections on global Pentecostalism (1999), Pentecostalism in Asia (2005,\u000a      2011), and theories and\u000a      methods in the academic study of global Pentecostalism (2010).\u000a    Most important are two highly influential recent texts in the field: An\u000a        Introduction to Pentecostalism\u000a      (OUP 2004), and Spreading Fires: The Missionary Nature of Early\u000a        Pentecostalism (SCM and Orbis\u000a      Books 2007). Both these works were voted as among the 10 outstanding books\u000a      by the\u000a      International Bulletin for Missionary Research in their respective\u000a      years of publication, while\u000a      Spreading Fires was awarded the Pneuma Book Award for 2007 by the\u000a      Society for Pentecostal\u000a      Studies.

In consideration of his distinctive contributions to\u000a      the debate about RE as\u000a      outlined above, in 2005 he was invited to draft the new Agreed\u000a        Syllabus for Religious Education\u000a        for Birmingham City Council, the largest education authority in the\u000a      country. The work on this\u000a      involved producing a text on religious education in schools from early\u000a      years to secondary level (see\u000a      source 1 below), steering it through a scrutiny committee and sessions of\u000a      the Birmingham Agreed\u000a      Syllabus Conference, consulting regularly with teachers and educators\u000a      across the city, and briefing\u000a      the Birmingham Faith Leaders' Group. Felderhof was instrumental in\u000a      ensuring that everyone\u000a      affected by the syllabus, including members of nine different faith groups\u000a      and different departments\u000a      of the City Council, accepted and associated themselves with it.\u000a    This intensive process resulted in the adoption of the syllabus\u000a      by Birmingham City Council in\u000a      June 2007 (source 2), and its implementation throughout the Birmingham\u000a      Education Authority\u000a      area. By 2012 an impressive 385 primary and secondary schools were\u000a      teaching it, together with\u000a      a number of early years education providers. In addition it was adopted\u000a        by Birmingham Diocese\u000a      for use in its church schools, and also by Nishkam primary, a Sikh\u000a        school in Handsworth, where it\u000a      is at the heart of the educational philosophy (source 3). This means that\u000a      since the syllabus was\u000a      introduced it has reached literally thousands of young people in the\u000a      Birmingham area, meaning\u000a      that Felderhof's distinctive insights into the nature of RE, enshrined in\u000a      the Agreed Syllabus with the\u000a      24 dispositions prominently included, have wide and deep effects on many\u000a      young and developing\u000a      lives. This is the only RE Syllabus constructed along these lines\u000a        currently available in the\u000a        UK.\u000a    Faith leaders in Birmingham readily endorsed the syllabus and gave\u000a      it their full support, as was\u000a      vividly demonstrated when the Anglican Bishop of Birmingham, David\u000a      Urquhart, wrote to\u000a      government ministers in 2009 to commend it in place of the government's\u000a      draft guidance on the\u000a      Non-Statutory National Framework for Religious Education, 2004 (source 4).\u000a      In response, Jill\u000a      Loosely, Deputy Director of the Curriculum Policy Division in the\u000a      Department for Education, visited\u000a      Birmingham in September 2011 to find out more, while Nick Gibb MP,\u000a      Minister of State for\u000a      Schools, planned to come on 2 October 2012 (a cabinet reshuffle prevented\u000a      this).\u000a    The City Council gave substantial backing to the Syllabus through\u000a      an on-going budget for its\u000a      implementation to SACRE. First allocated from 2011, this budget funds a\u000a      website for teachers\u000a      which sets out the rationale and aims of the syllabus, and provides\u000a      schemes of work, lesson plans,\u000a      films of good classroom practice, and other resources (sources 5 and 6).\u000a    The Syllabus has generated widespread interest and debate outside\u000a      Birmingham, both in the UK\u000a      and abroad. Birmingham SACRE has received enquiries about it from\u000a      Bristol, London, Coventry\u000a      and Manchester, while Felderhof has given invited talks on it at\u000a      conferences for religious\u000a      leaders, academics and educators in Israel (June 2010) and the USA (April\u000a      2011), to the\u000a      government of the Sudan (April 2011), at the Museum of World Religions in\u000a      Taiwan (November\u000a      2011), at the International Symposium on Religion, Spirituality and\u000a      Education for Human\u000a      Flourishing in Marrakesh (March 2012, co-convened by the Guerrand-Hermes\u000a      Foundation for\u000a      Peace and the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations), and a keynote\u000a      address to an audience of\u000a      researchers and educators at the Westhill Trust seminar on Spirituality\u000a      and RE in Leeds,\u000a      November 2011. He was also invited to join Birmingham political and\u000a      spiritual leaders in their\u000a      representations on RE at the Department for Education. In 2009 he\u000a      was part of a delegation to\u000a      consult a London-based Queen's Counsel on the legality of elements in the\u000a      government's draft\u000a      Guidance for RE (2009), in particular the status of the Non-Statutory\u000a      National Framework for RE\u000a      (2004). As a result, the final Guidance issued by the government in 2010\u000a      was significantly changed\u000a      from its draft form, acknowledging the right of local authorities to\u000a      continue to issue their own\u000a      syllabus and to make the major religious traditions the basis of their\u000a      contents.\u000a    Evaluation of the impact of the Syllabus has begun. In preparation\u000a      for a full-scale study, in 2012\u000a      a pilot study was made by Penny Jennings to compare pupils' responses with\u000a      many similar\u000a      questions asked in a survey done some years ago in Cornwall. One\u000a      observation was: `Although\u000a      aware that comparisons cannot be made without the relevant statistical\u000a      analyses and unless\u000a      samples are comparable in size and composition, [we] noticed that the\u000a      responses to some sections\u000a      of the Birmingham pilot study differed greatly from those in the earlier\u000a      Cornwall survey. For\u000a      example, Birmingham's Year 9 pupil responses to items examining attitudes\u000a      to \"spiritual\"\u000a      experiences appeared to be predominantly positive, whereas Cornwall's Year\u000a      9 and 10 pupil\u000a      responses in this section were predominantly negative.' (source 7)\u000a    Praise for the Syllabus has been consistent. As early as 2008,\u000a      Tony Howell, then Director of\u000a      Children's Services for Birmingham, commented: `It is probably one of\u000a        the most exciting\u000a        curriculum developments we have seen over the last few years'\u000a      (source 8), and in 2011\u000a      Professor Trevor Cooling, Director of the National Institute for Christian\u000a      Education Research at\u000a      Canterbury Christ Church University, wrote: `If RE went down this road it\u000a      would be the most\u000a        radical change since the shift stimulated by Ninian Smart's work'\u000a      (source 9). Its influence on\u000a      faith cooperation in Birmingham is summed up in the 2011 report of\u000a      Councillor Les Lawrence,\u000a      Cabinet Member for Children, Young People and Families, to the City\u000a      Council: `The experience of\u000a      delivering the 2007 Birmingham Agreed Syllabus for Religious Education ...\u000a      has brought the\u000a        faiths together in a common purpose and has created mutual support\u000a      among the religious\u000a      communities' (7 February, 2012).\u000a    Most significant of all, teachers themselves have commented on\u000a      how their students approach RE\u000a      in a new way. Bethan Ruth, Frankley School, says: `Historically it was\u000a      just about learning facts.\u000a      Now it's about what they get out of it and what the benefits are\u000a      and if any of those benefits could\u000a      be applied within their own lives. So it's a lot more about learning from\u000a      religion as a result of\u000a      looking at how faith has an impact in a believer's life. I very rarely get\u000a      them asking why they are\u000a      learning this. It's more about \"this is really interesting and I\u000a      want to learn more\" and \"this is my\u000a      view on it. What motivates someone to come from that view on this?\"'\u000a      (source 10). In addition,\u000a      other educational practitioners have begun to see the potential of\u000a      the syllabus. In September\u000a      2013, Ian Jones, the head of St Peter's Saltley Trust, Birmingham, raised\u000a      the possibility of applying\u000a      it for FE students, explaining: `If it's true that employers as often\u000a      value good character as specific\u000a      skills or knowledge, some of those fundamental dispositions (such as being\u000a      accountable and living\u000a      with integrity, being open, honest and truthful, being merciful and\u000a      forgiving) will surely be key to\u000a      that. Indeed, recently I showed the 'Faith makes a Difference' site to a\u000a      new FE college chaplain\u000a      who was looking for ideas and resources, and he got quite excited about\u000a      how relevant the\u000a      dispositions could be within his context' (source 11).\u000a    These high commendations were endorsed in August 2011, when an issue\u000a        of the Journal of\u000a        Beliefs and Values was dedicated to Felderhof and his\u000a      innovative work (source 12), showing\u000a      that his original insights into the nature and function of RE, expressed\u000a      in the 24 dispositions, have\u000a      not only reached great numbers of school children in the West Midlands,\u000a      but have also influenced\u000a      thinking at high levels among educationalists and practitioners. The\u000a      impact of his research is\u000a      clearly both pervasive and profound and it continues to spread.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Enshrining 24 moral and spiritual dispositions, the 2007\u000a      Birmingham Agreed Syllabus for\u000a      Religious Education, the outcome of years of Marius Felderhof's research\u000a      into educational\u000a      principles, marks a dramatic departure from previous RE syllabuses.\u000a      It has been officially\u000a      adopted by Birmingham City Council, welcomed by civic leaders, endorsed by\u000a      Birmingham faith\u000a      leaders, and implemented in nearly 400 Birmingham schools.

In the wake of\u000a      government statutes in the 1990s that reconfirmed the requirements of the\u000a      1944 Education Act, he\u000a      developed an interest in the practical and theoretical issues raised by\u000a      the obligation on maintained\u000a      schools to provide religious education and collective worship. His\u000a      reflections on these issues\u000a      through the early 2000s are documented by a selection of his articles\u000a      listed below, in particular his\u000a      contribution to Inspiring Faith in Schools (2007), of which he was\u000a      co-editor (the outcome of a series\u000a      of colloquia he helped to organise in order to pursue further his vision\u000a      of religious education). The\u000a      theological position that underpins his work is summed up in his book Revisiting\u000a        Christianity,\u000a        theological reflections (Farnham: Ashgate, 2011).\u000a    Felderhof's main principle is that in their religious education young\u000a      people should be approached\u000a      as whole persons through their experience. Educating them about\u000a      religion should provide them\u000a      with guidelines for life, for which the profoundest insights of the great\u000a      religions can be tapped. The\u000a      task of religious education is not simply to impart facts, but to help\u000a      young people to recognise the\u000a        spiritual and moral dimensions of life and to make them their own.\u000a      In advancing this approach,\u000a      he challenges many assumptions about RE that are built into current UK\u000a      curriculums. For him the\u000a      primary focus should be on educating young people in what it is to be\u000a        religious and moral,\u000a      with their development as whole individuals uppermost in mind, rather than\u000a      on learning the\u000a      detached intellectual study of religion - this comes later. So, he has\u000a      taken the four cardinal virtues\u000a      and three theological virtues of classical Christian theology and related\u000a      them to equivalents in other\u000a      religious traditions. On the basis of this he has developed 24 moral\u000a        and spiritual dispositions.\u000a    Felderhof has spoken about these 24 dispositions at specialist\u000a      conferences and has written articles\u000a      on them for academic journals from the early 2000s onwards. They lie at\u000a      the heart of the\u000a      Birmingham Agreed Syllabus for Religious Education, published in\u000a      2007. This Syllabus, which\u000a      was drafted by him, is the main outcome of the body of research that\u000a      underpins this case for\u000a      impact.\u000a    Since the Syllabus was officially adopted and implemented, Felderhof has\u000a      continued to reflect and\u000a      publish on the implications of the principles about religious education he\u000a      advocates. He has\u000a      particularly focused on the place of secular humanism and atheism in the\u000a      curriculum, and on the\u000a      cognitive, affective and conative dimensions of this method of education.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40331","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1655842","Name":"Laos"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"3202326","Name":"Croatia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1227603","Name":"Sri Lanka"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"458258","Name":"Latvia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"357994","Name":"Egypt"},{"GeoNamesId":"1668284","Name":"Taiwan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1605651","Name":"Thailand"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    A. General Public (Buddhist and non-Buddhist): Findings from the\u000a      research have been used in\u000a      different ways, including Widening Participation activities at the\u000a      University of Bristol (master class\u000a      on `ghosts' on 24\/6\/2009, 20 participants). A digital exhibition in\u000a      Birmingham Museum on the\u000a      occasion of Buddha Day (24\/4\/2010) attracted `an audience of more than\u000a        100 people who were\u000a        touched by the depth of sensitivity and authenticity of the visual\u000a        descriptions of death rituals in\u000a        South-east Asia being portrayed' [c]. Heise (1\/12\/09), Ladwig\u000a      (10\/11\/09) and Langer (15\/12\/09)\u000a      were invited by the University of Hamburg to give talks (audience of ca.\u000a      100 from the general\u000a      public) and show their films (audience of ca. 70, general public) as part\u000a      of their public lecture\u000a      series, `Tod und Sterben im Buddhismus' [g]. They also contributed\u000a      material to two exhibitions of\u000a      photographs, film, manuscripts and objects designed to offer an insight\u000a      into the topic. The two\u000a      exhibitions, `Ancestors and Hungry Ghosts' (Bristol, 23\/10-11\/11\/09, ca.\u000a      150 visitors; Leeds 1-25\/2\/10,\u000a      ca. 650 visitors) [h] and `Tod und Sterben im Buddhismus' (Hamburg,\u000a      8\/10-18\/12\/09, ca.\u000a      2,000 visitors) were aimed at the general public as well as those with a\u000a      specific interest in the\u000a      subject. The venues (Photographique gallery in Bristol, Department of East\u000a      Asian Studies at the\u000a      University of Leeds and the foyer of the University of Hamburg main\u000a      building) were chosen for their\u000a      public outreach potential [h]. The most accessible and accessed venue\u000a      (Hamburg), with its\u000a      spectacular set-up of large photo boards on two levels of the foyer of the\u000a      University's main\u000a      building, attracted the widest audience and appealed particularly to\u000a      `mature, experienced travellers'\u000a      [g]. The Bristol exhibition was publicized by way of an interview in a\u000a      programme called 'Face to\u000a      Faith' on BCFM Bristol community radio. The films and images have\u000a      attracted interest and have\u000a      been shown at various venues including the universities of Bristol, Leeds\u000a      and Hamburg; the Max\u000a      Planck Institute (Halle); Ecole fran&#231;aise d'Extr&#234;me-Orient (Paris); and\u000a      the Conference of the\u000a      International Association of Buddhist Studies (Atlanta, USA). The\u000a      discussions during and after the\u000a      events indicated that the public view of Buddhism had been changed.\u000a      Buddhism is often labelled a\u000a      `philosophy' rather than a `religion' and evidence shows that recent\u000a      research has begun to\u000a      challenge this. The project also invites reflections on death and dying\u000a      more generally, which\u000a      prompted the organizers of the Edinburgh Festival 2011 to ask Langer to\u000a      take part in a panel\u000a      discussion (Ritual and Memory, ca. 100 audience). The audio-visual\u000a      material has been available\u000a      online on the website since 2010 [4] and the site was refreshed and\u000a      refurbished in 2013 with a\u000a      number of additional features (image archive, audio section, tabs for\u000a      target audiences). The results\u000a      of the anonymous Bristol Online Survey available on the project website\u000a      [e] showed that the\u000a      resources were used in a great variety of contexts, including GCSE\u000a      preparation, chaplaincy work,\u000a      undergraduate projects, school and undergraduate teaching, publishing\u000a      work, school visits at\u000a      monasteries and inspiration for e-learning material. Of those surveyed,\u000a      82.2% said they would use\u000a      the resources again; 46.3% said the resources had changed their attitude\u000a      or practice and backed\u000a      this up with personal statements such as `I have started to contemplate\u000a        death more often and\u000a        started chanting too'. It is significant that the resources appealed\u000a      to non-Buddhists and Buddhists\u000a      alike (57% of participants considered themselves Buddhist) and to a great\u000a      range of nationalities\u000a      including Australian, Sri Lankan and Thai [e]. The download statistics for\u000a      SoundCloud (3,225\u000a      downloads), Vimeo and YouTube (combined downloads 1,329) indicate that the\u000a      material has\u000a      international appeal. The chants were played in a total of 50 countries\u000a      including the USA, Russia,\u000a      Egypt, Laos, Canada, Sri Lanka, Australia, Germany, China and Latvia [f].\u000a      Easy online access and\u000a      the increasing number of links to the research material in blogs and on\u000a      Twitter has led to a\u000a      widening audience and user base. The secretary of a Buddhist temple in the\u000a      UK said: `It is\u000a        wonderful to have such a free resource for teaching, chaplaincy and\u000a        personal education for users\u000a        ... We have residential family events at the monastery as well as\u000a        frequent school visits. So I have\u000a        passed on your email and the link to the website to the various monks\u000a        and nuns who are involved\u000a        in these areas, as well as adding it to our general resources for all to\u000a        use' [a]. Some people shared\u000a      moving testimonies of how the resources had affected them personally: `I\u000a        had been witness to a\u000a        ceremony while in Sri Lanka and wanted to know what had happened. I was\u000a        deeply affected by\u000a        what I now know was a funeral, so this film has been really helpful to\u000a        me.' [e]. Traffic has more\u000a      than doubled since the launch of the new web pages; the number of\u000a      referrals shows that there is a\u000a      sustained need for the project materials [f].\u000a    B. Multi-faith Chaplaincies: The Government Office for National\u000a      Statistics refers to the 2001\u000a      Census which states that there were 149,000 Buddhists living in Great\u000a      Britain, which is 0.3 % of\u000a      the population. However, the World Buddhist Directory lists 513 Buddhist\u000a      temples, organisations\u000a      and meditation groups in the UK, which indicates that a considerably\u000a      higher number of people are\u000a      involved in the practice of Buddhism. Consequently, there is a greater\u000a      need for information on the\u000a      care of ill and dying Buddhist patients, and training is under way. Short\u000a      videos of interviews with\u000a      chaplains and a downloadable pamphlet [4] were developed in cooperation\u000a      with NHS chaplains\u000a      and hospice workers to provide background information. The pamphlet has\u000a      been endorsed by the\u000a      Multi-faith Group for Healthcare Chaplaincy (MFGHC), which in turn informs\u000a      organisations such as\u000a      the NHS, the Army and the Prison Service and is instrumental in the\u000a      training of chaplains [c]. The\u000a      material was regarded as exemplary and has prompted a forum discussion\u000a      about the feasibility of\u000a      developing similar materials for other religions such as Hinduism. The\u000a      Chairman of the Buddhist\u000a      Healthcare Chaplaincy Group (and member of the MFGHC) [c] is involved in\u000a      the training of NHS\u000a      Buddhist chaplains: `The research work presented via this media was\u000a        incredibly useful and\u000a        informative to these Chaplains whose understanding of the various\u000a        cultures was greatly developed\u000a        from this experience. In due course the material will be used again,\u000a        with the University of Bristol's\u000a        permission, as part of on-going Buddhist Chaplaincy training.'\u000a      Again, personal testimonies from\u000a      chaplains indicate that the material affected individuals on a deeper\u000a      level: `the resources would be\u000a        useful in understanding what Asian families need at the time of death to\u000a        support them'; `I would\u000a        also recommend this site to anyone who is working closely with Buddhists\u000a        in hospitals or in the\u000a        wider community'; `I have been a Buddhist Chaplain at a prison,\u000a        this has inspired me maybe to be\u000a        a chaplain at a hospital'; `The Chaplaincy booklet is a useful\u000a        resource as I do get asked to lead\u000a        Buddhist funerals outside my own tradition' [e].\u000a    C. Educators: Many of the documented rituals are not specific to\u000a      the death context and the project\u000a      material is suitable for teaching the more practical aspects of Buddhism.\u000a      The audio-visual material\u000a      [2, 3, 4] and the subject matter (particularly ghost festivals) are\u000a      both accessible and well-suited to\u000a      outreach activities. In cooperation with teachers, project findings were\u000a      translated into e-learning\u000a      materials. The head of religious studies at a UK secondary school [d]\u000a      piloted the study resources\u000a      with A-level Buddhism students: `I know I will be both using and\u000a        directing my students to use the\u000a        resources in the future. Even with a number of years' experience\u000a        teaching A level Buddhism, it is\u000a        always good to have an injection of new resources to breathe new life\u000a        into one's work.' The head\u000a      of RS at another secondary school [b], not currently offering Buddhism at\u000a      A-level, states: `After\u000a        looking at the resources available I am considering adapting our\u000a        existing work on Buddhism in\u000a        KS3-4 and introducing it as a unit of work in KS5 [A-level]. The\u000a        resources would support me\u000a        greatly as a teacher, and the lesson plans and resources are easy to use\u000a        and adapt to fit with our\u000a        lessons and the introduction of a new scheme of work at A-level.'\u000a      And yet another head of RS at a\u000a      secondary school decided to move over to an examinations board which\u000a      allows more Buddhist\u000a      content and approached the department with the idea of a collaborative\u000a      project to develop more e-learning\u000a      resources for the study of Buddhism. The overwhelmingly positive\u000a      reaction of educators\u000a      and students to the website indicates that high-profile research can be\u000a      made accessible to schools.\u000a      Some comments from the online survey: `Photos, films, chants, lesson\u000a        plans. Excellent and rich\u000a        resources &#8212; immensely useful for my teaching practice'; `Has lead\u000a        me to a more hands-on\u000a        approach when teaching. Possibility to show students images, films,\u000a        etc., I deem now as very\u000a        important'; `I have no doubt that my religious studies GCSE grade\u000a        was significantly helped by\u000a        these resources'; `I gained ideas about current practices.\u000a        Usually, I have rather a (classical) text-based\u000a        view on Buddhism' [e]. The material is highly adaptable and equally\u000a      valuable in\u000a      undergraduate teaching provision, as a UK lecturer in Thai language and\u000a      culture [h] observes:\u000a      `These resources are very valuable for our students taking my Buddhist\u000a        module. Students can get\u000a        in-depth insights into this important topic thanks to the fantastic work\u000a        you and your team have\u000a        done. I am particularly impressed with the film material. This will\u000a        certainly help to enthuse students\u000a        in their study of Buddhist ritual and thought world. Having\u000a        access to these films now will enable me\u000a        to make some significant changes to the way I teach my Buddhism module.'\u000a      A lecturer at a\u000a      German university remarked in an email how the material changed the\u000a      perception of the students\u000a      and helped them move away from labelling Buddhism as simply `a\u000a      philosophy'. Apart from\u000a      benefiting individual educators and students, the material attracted the\u000a      attention of educational\u000a      publishers and exam board representatives: `Although as free resources\u000a        they compete with our\u000a        commercial publications, actually for a less studied area like Buddhism\u000a        it is good when resources\u000a        are created and distributed freely, as they would not be viable\u000a        otherwise. We would certainly\u000a        reference them in relevant publications and direct teachers and students\u000a        to them' [i]. This goes to\u000a      show that there is demand for high-profile research in the field of\u000a      Buddhist Studies and that making\u000a      the findings of just one project widely available can have a large-scale\u000a      impact.\u000a    D. Personal development: Two of the Research Assistants moved to\u000a      posts at prestigious\u000a      institutions before the end of the project: Langer was appointed full-time\u000a      lecturer at the University\u000a      of Bristol and received &#163;25,459 funding under the AHRC Research Leave\u000a      Scheme for a four-month\u000a      follow-up project (`Preacher and Ritualist: the role of Theravada Buddhist\u000a      monks', 2010).\u000a      Ladwig followed Langer as RA and was offered a research position at the\u000a      Max Planck Institute for\u000a      Social Anthropology in Halle (Germany). Kieschnick was appointed professor\u000a      at Stanford\u000a      University (USA) and Heise was offered a two-year postdoctoral position in\u000a      Taiwan. The high\u000a      quality research outputs have also contributed to the University of\u000a      Bristol's Centre for Buddhist\u000a      Studies' growing status as an institutional centre of knowledge. The\u000a      centre was founded in 1993,\u000a      was the first of its kind in the UK and has hosted visiting scholars from\u000a      Croatia, India, Japan and\u000a      the USA and continues to attract scholars from abroad. The research\u000a      project was also publicised\u000a      on the AHRC website as one of the first case studies and as such served as\u000a      an example for other\u000a      projects in the field [j].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Buddhists and non-Buddhists across the world, educators, students and\u000a      chaplains are among\u000a      those who have benefited personally, academically and professionally from\u000a      the imaginative\u000a      dissemination of Bristol's pioneering research into Buddhist Death Rituals\u000a      in Southeast Asia and\u000a      China.

The PI was Paul\u000a      Williams (Professor of\u000a      Indian and Tibetan Philosophy, 1985-2011) and the Co-I was John Kieschnick\u000a      (Reader in Buddhist\u000a      Studies, 2007-11). The Research Assistants were, in chronological order,\u000a      Dr Rita Langer, Dr\u000a      Patrice Ladwig and Ailsa Laxton. The outcome of this work was formally\u000a      assessed as `good' and\u000a      the project became an exemplar for funded research on the AHRC website\u000a      [j], attracting\u000a      international academic and non-academic attention [e, f].\u000a    The project was the first comparative academic study of Buddhist death\u000a      rituals in the two distinct\u000a      cultural areas of Southeast Asia and China and drew interest not only from\u000a      academics but also\u000a      from the general public and the growing number of UK Buddhists.\u000a    Langer (Research Assistant, 2007) worked on the project from the\u000a      beginning and remained closely\u000a      involved with it until its completion. She is a textual scholar and\u000a      examined texts and chants used in\u000a      Theravada funerals (in Laos, Thailand, Sri Lanka and Myanmar). She\u000a      documented and defined a\u000a      common core of Theravada rites [1] and built up a collection of images and\u000a      chants which featured\u000a      in exhibitions and outreach events that took place throughout the project.\u000a      All the images, chants\u000a      and online exhibitions are now available on the website [4].\u000a    Ladwig, an anthropologist (Research Assistant, 2007-09), conducted\u000a      fieldwork in 2007\u000a      documenting two festivals for the dead in Laos which had never previously\u000a      been recorded. His\u000a      documentary, `Caring for the beyond' [2], is therefore a unique research\u000a      output and is\u000a      supplemented by a research article which examines the interplay of the\u000a      material and the immaterial\u000a      in dealings with the dead [1].\u000a    Similarly, Heise, a sinologist (PhD student, 2007-12), conducted research\u000a      on festivals for the dead\u000a      in China (2008), directing a documentary called `The Spirit's Happy Days'\u000a      [3] and writing a\u000a      dissertation and a research article that critically examines the dynamic\u000a      and changing roles of the\u000a      festivals [1]. This facilitated comparative work between Southeast Asia\u000a      and China, which is\u000a      reflected in the edited volume of papers on Buddhist funerals [1].\u000a    Kieschnick's role was primarily as PhD supervisor of Heise and referee of\u000a      articles for the edited\u000a      volume.

His research expertise was used to support\u000a        the CBC Interreligious Adviser on the UK Papal visit (2010),\u000a        specifically the meeting of faith leaders (Twickenham), and the\u000a        Westminster address (Westminster, London). The researcher made e-media\u000a        outputs on both events for the general public through the Clifton\u000a        Diocese website [i], ensuring impact on the UK Catholic population in\u000a        understanding their Church's teachings and social attitudes.

The CBC Interreligious Adviser\u000a        notes that the researcher's advice to the Archbishop overseeing\u000a        interfaith matters has `informed and benefitted his work nationally and\u000a        internationally' specifically in relation to Jewish relations and\u000a        interfaith prayer [b].\u000a      The researcher's work has also impacted on the wider UK Christian\u000a        community. The national conference of `Churches Together in Britain and\u000a        Ireland' (Swanick, 2010) invited Archbishop Vincent Nichols and the\u000a        researcher as keynote speakers on `Church in the Public Square'. The CBC\u000a        Interreligious Adviser testifies that the researcher's input to this\u000a        event `shaped the discussions of the Interreligious Network UK' on this\u000a        theme [b]. 300 delegates attended and the talk was disseminated widely\u000a        [h].\u000a    \u000a    Local &#8212; Avon\u000a    \u000a      The researcher acts as adviser and resource to the Clifton Diocese\u000a        Interfaith Officer (CDIO), (2000-13) and to the Clifton Diocese Director\u000a        of Adult Education (CDDAE).

The first area is related to Roman Catholic theological attitudes to\u000a      the world religions in both official Catholic teachings since 1963 (marked\u000a      by the Second Vatican Council) and by Catholic theology of religions. This\u000a      research addresses three related sub-areas:\u000a    \u000a      The research findings call into question the influential three-fold\u000a        paradigm for understanding Christian attitudes to other religions. The\u000a        research proposed an alternative theologically oriented typological\u000a        approach, showing the earlier paradigm had implicitly favoured one\u000a        approach. See [1], [4] (all cross references to section 3 below).\u000a      The research findings question a major current of interpretation of\u000a        the Second Vatican Council which proposed the Council viewed other\u000a        religions as a means of salvation. The researcher shows the Council\u000a        regarded these religions as de facto, not de iure, means\u000a        of salvation at best. This has significant implications regarding\u000a        theology of religions and the practice of mission and interreligious\u000a        dialogue. See [1], [3], [4].\u000a      The research findings have shown continuity and discontinuity to exist\u000a        within Catholic teachings on Jews and Muslims. There is radical\u000a        discontinuity in pastoral and social attitudes. There is significant\u000a        continuity in terms of the doctrine of God. This acknowledgment of `one\u000a        God' also generates a new research question related to interfaith\u000a        prayer. The practice of interfaith prayer has often arisen as a response\u000a        to common disasters (`9\/11', the London Tube bombings, the 2004\u000a        tsunami). The researcher has developed a novel analysis of interfaith\u000a        prayer and worship within theistic religions. See [1], [3], [4], [5],\u000a        [6].\u000a    \u000a    2. The second area has grown out of the first. It deals with religious\u000a      pluralism in the public square. This research addresses two related\u000a      sub-areas.\u000a    \u000a      What is the nature of Catholic public theology? The researcher has\u000a        examined the role of the Catholic university in a pluralist public\u000a        square, finding that such tradition-specific development of `knowledge'\u000a        facilitates genuine difference in pluralist societies. Following\u000a        Alasdair MacIntrye, the researcher has shown that at its best, this type\u000a        of Catholic learning is open to other religions. It can learn from and\u000a        be engaged with these religions through dialectics. See [1], [2].\u000a      Can Catholic public theologies contribute to the debate in the social\u000a        sciences regarding pluralism and the public square? The researcher\u000a        develops one particular approach, drawing from his work on the Christian\u000a        university, engaging critically with social scientists like Rawls and\u000a        Habermas. The research advances a cautious acceptance of translating\u000a        Christian language into public discourse, but only by using natural\u000a        theology. The research approach is acutely aware of the secularising\u000a        force of such a process. Genuine plurality requires multiple forms of\u000a        discourse. See [1], [2], [6]. To demonstrate how religions might\u000a        positively and constructively contribute to social and political\u000a        culture, the researcher has explored this in Catholic and Muslim social\u000a        theology. The research suggests that religious contributions could both\u000a        enhance democracy and the substantive values that make up the common\u000a        good within a pluralist society.

The QP network is an on-going research and activism\u000a      project that started in 2008 in response to debates over Civil Partnership\u000a      ceremonies at the University's licensed wedding venue. The crucial aspect\u000a      of the QP network is its commitment to linking queer insights to specific\u000a      political struggles (A, B).\u000a    The QP network through Scherer's activism at CCCU has contributed to\u000a      progressive LGBTIQ related policies and practices which has inspired more\u000a      progressive policies at other HEIs in the UK and US (C).\u000a    Global impact has been achieved through the organisation of three further\u000a      international QP conferences, all mentored and co-organised by Scherer\u000a      (Brisbane 2010; New York 2011; and Rio de Janeiro 2012; and one regionally\u000a      affiliated event in Quito 2012). The QP network has demonstrated a\u000a      sustained and ongoing engagement with a group of scholars and activists\u000a      that has led to a significant increase in participation in the QP\u000a      conferences, from 30 participants at the first QP conference held in\u000a      Canterbury in 2008 to 500 registered participants in Rio de Janeiro in\u000a      2012. The QP conferences are explicitly open to the general public and in\u000a      particular welcome the presence of local activists and artists, and\u000a      organisers actively engage with media (interviews, social media such\u000a      Facebook and Twitter). Importantly, the network is committed to including\u000a      perspectives from outside the `Global North'.\u000a    QP research outputs present challenging and innovative developments of queering\u000a      from across a variety of academic disciplines and political spheres and\u000a      move from Queer Theory to Applied Queer Studies (ref. vi), As one reviewer\u000a      puts it, QP is \"... not only saying, but doing language, in order to give\u000a      queers around the globe voices of their own.\" (D). An example of\u000a      the impact of QP in changing awareness, underpinned by (ref. vi), is\u000a      demonstrated by the direct challenge to complacent homonormativities &#8212;\u000a      LGBT assimilationist tendencies. In Germany, Scherer published a\u000a      provocative QP essay on Queer in the mainstream Gay magazine M&#228;nner\u000a      (issue January 2012). It received within 3 days 73 comments from gay men,\u000a      many of them assimilationists and hostile to the queer project (E);\u000a      the ensuing discussions clearly evidence awareness change and challenge to\u000a      established patterns of thought (F).\u000a    The main beneficiaries of Scherer's QP activities are global and local\u000a      LGBTIQ communities. Since the beginning of the impact period Scherer has\u000a      been invited worldwide to give over 30 public lectures in different forums\u000a      on gender and sexuality.\u000a    The QP project has led to changes in societal awareness and contributed\u000a      to policy debates. It has also had an impact on policy making by informing\u000a      and influencing policy debate on the nature of sexual discrimination. For\u000a      example, the former Australian High Court Judge Michael Kirby, an\u000a      influential public voice on social justice, noted in his keynote address\u000a      at the second QP conference in Brisbane, Australia, the importance of\u000a      policy changes to ensure full equality of citizenship. He pointed out that\u000a      despite abolishing laws from Australia's colonial past, it still had some\u000a      way to go, stressing that `Legislation that does not allow gay marriage is\u000a      unacceptable'. The comments were reported in the Australian national and\u000a      local media, including the Brisbane Times and ABC (Brisbane) and The\u000a      Australian and The Age (national). (A) Scherer consciously chose\u000a      to develop the QP conference series on different continents so that\u000a      participants can be exposed to and impact on new contexts and cultural\u000a      conditions. Importantly, every conference is organized by local academics\u000a      and activists, leading to a sense of local ownership without an imposed\u000a      agenda. The strong support for and presence of activists (B; C; H),\u000a      artists and politicians from High Court Judges (Australia; A),\u000a      African and South American LGBT leaders and artists (USA, Brazil B, I),\u000a      and government ministers (Quito) further exemplifies QPs impact on\u000a      societal and policy debates. For example, in 2011, QP3 empowered\u000a      African activists (including funding) in their work (G); the\u000a      associated 2012 Quito colloquium was opened by both Scherer and the\u000a      Ecuadorian Health Minister Carina Vance Mafla; after attending QP4,\u000a      Argentinean Anarcho-queer activist Pao Lin organized a QP empowering\u000a      workshop in August 2012 for the local activists in Buenos Aires (H);\u000a      Scherer's key note at QP4 inspired young Brazilian LGBT activists to fight\u000a      against homo-and transphobia at universities in Rio de Janeiro in 2012.\u000a      She writes (translated from the Portuguese): [At QPIV,] I met B[] and\u000a        we had a conversation, from which I left with a different worldview. A\u000a        conversation of hope that I regard as a \"politico-philosophical\u000a        \"salvation, because I could finally see the horizon from my own life\u000a        experience . B[] spoke about the challenges of gender transition , said\u000a        how important it was for us to stand on issues that are dear to many\u000a        people and how important it was to participate in conferences that allow\u000a        these issues to be discussed and addressed from the perspective not only\u000a        of academia but of different social fields. [...]In that conversation I\u000a        had with B[] I was able to see [..] a way though education and activism!\u000a        Three months after QPIV I [..] organized a major meeting at my\u000a        university to discuss the problems and potential of trans identities ,\u000a        the name of the event was \"For the UFRJ for everyone: LGBT identities in\u000a        HE.\" From there I went to [..] social activism for many trans people! We\u000a        formed a sort of collective that seeks to combat homophobia ,\u000a        transphobia and lesbophobia in various spaces of UFRJ. I used the\u000a        knowledge acquired in the QP to organize various round tables and\u000a        debates on the subject of transsexuality. I was invited to give lectures\u000a        to raise awareness [.]. I started to feel like a human being, a true\u000a        citizen of otherness whose displacement is very powerful! (I).\u000a    An example of a major impact on religious attitudes can be seen\u000a      in Scherer's challenge to Newari Buddhist leaders in the Kathmandu valley\u000a      (Nepal) on their restrictive perspectives on sexualities in a public\u000a      address January 2013 underpinned by (ref. iv-vi), which provoked a\u000a      thoughtful debate and awareness change as evidenced by its coverage in the\u000a      national Nepali newspaper and by Nepali NGOs (Mitini and Green Tara Trust\u000a      Nepal) testimonies about Scherer's QP activities in January and June in\u000a      Kathmandu 2013. The LBT women NGO Mitini writes: \"Thank you so much\u000a        for making the time on your second visit to Nepal this year in June for\u000a        intense talks and plannings with and in support of Mitini. Your Lecture\u000a        at Patan Archeological museum on Buddhism and Sexuality, 2 January 2013,\u000a        has created a wonderful opportunity of dialogue and openness to discuss,\u000a        and change awareness and behaviour in Buddhist communities (in\u000a        particular the strongly represented Newari Buddhist community) towards\u000a        gender equality and acceptance of LGBT Buddhists. The senior reform\u000a        priest Naresh Bajracharya has in June already promised to you and us to\u000a        give LGBT persons his spiritual support, protection and guidance. We\u000a        understand that your activities are linked to the broader Queering\u000a        Paradigms project and we feel very excited about this; hopefully we can\u000a        hold a Queering conference in Nepal in the future and build on that to\u000a        create more social justice change. Your triangle talks-Queering\u000a        Paradigms, Green Tara Trust and Mitini has initiated our collaborative\u000a        shelter project for the well-being of LBT women for which we are now\u000a        started to collect funds. Thank you so much for all your hard work for\u000a        the queer community in Nepal!\" Hence, the tangible change of\u000a      religious attitudes manifests in the fact one of the most senior Newari\u000a      priest has in June 2012 given his pastoral protection to LGBTIQ Newaris\u000a      and that to equality focused local NGOs have started formal social justice\u000a      cooperations (J).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The LGBTIQ Social Justice project Queering Paradigms (QP) grew\u000a      out of the research theme on Sexuality, Gender and the Body.

Most\u000a      members of the UoA have published on some aspects from their specific\u000a      discipline, including Robert Beckford (Reader 2011 - present, on social\u000a      justice and political activism from the perspective of Black Theology),\u000a      Brian Capper (1993 - present on social justice in the context of the early\u000a      Church) and Maria Diemling (2006 - present, on the body in\u000a      Jewish-Christian relations). Gareth Jones (Professor of Christian\u000a      Theology, 2001-2011) critically reflected on the workings and problems of\u000a      episcopal authority and the question of human sexuality in the Church of\u000a      England and found that it is the theological possibility and prerogative\u000a      to fully reconcile LGBT identities with communicant Anglican identity\u000a      (ref. i). Ralph Norman (at CCCU in academic posts since 2000, since 2011\u000a      as Principle Lecturer in Theology) has published on sexual\u000a      symbolism in Christian theology and has demonstrated how the current ideas\u000a      of sexuality in theological discourse have been historically shaped and\u000a      normatised (ref. ii, iii).\u000a    B. Scherer (at CCCU in academic posts since 2003; since 2012 as Professor\u000a        in Comparative Religion, Gender and Sexuality) has developed\u000a      research interests in Gender and Sexuality into a global network, the\u000a      Queering Paradigms network (QP) which is the main focus of this Impact\u000a      Case Study.\u000a    Scherer's research in 2003-2006 focused on LGB and Transgender\u000a      expressions in Early Buddhist narratives to argue for the possibility of\u000a      trans-inclusivity in contemporary Buddhism (ref. iv). These insights led\u000a      to further research (from 2006 onwards) on Gender and Sexuality in which\u000a      Scherer analysed the relationship and tension between Buddhist `Theology'\u000a      and homo-\/transphobic realities in a neo-orthodox modern Buddhist\u000a      movement. Scherer's Queer Buddhist `Theology' challenges the prevalence of\u000a      some anti-LGBT attitudes in contemporary Buddhist movements, while Queer\u000a      Buddhist voices struggle to assert themselves (ref. v). In addition,\u000a      Scherer developed a distinct approach to Queer Theory as Applied Queer\u000a      Studies. This is an interdisciplinary, social activism-centred approach\u000a      presented in the introductions to the first two Queering Paradigm books\u000a      Scherer edited.

As queer subjects defy the\u000a      `seduction of identity by exclusion' and celebrate `the whole potential of\u000a      sexuality and gender fluidity and diversity', they explode the limits of\u000a      normative discourses and break new ground in research and activism for\u000a      social change (ref. vi).

One of its key aims is to tackle racial\u000d\u000a      discrimination, disadvantage and social exclusion in the city of\u000d\u000a      Birmingham.

Dr Beckford has\u000d\u000a      devised workshops which have helped BRAP to review equality theories as a\u000d\u000a      means to support the charity to develop more progressive practice. He\u000d\u000a      facilitated a session which was attended by 200 young people and which\u000d\u000a      explored the link between Hip Hop as a signifier of popular youth culture\u000d\u000a      and crime.

His work has affected the\u000d\u000a        thinking and preaching of ministers of the church and contributed\u000d\u000a        to rethinking of Pentecostal thought and practice by identifying how\u000d\u000a      colonial Christianity impacted Pentecostal preaching and teaching. His\u000d\u000a      work has had an impact on the church's leadership team to engage in both\u000d\u000a      local and national politics leading, for example, the Birmingham-based New\u000d\u000a      Testament Church of God to cooperate with Operation Black to mobilise\u000d\u000a      black voters in Birmingham for the next general elections. He has also\u000d\u000a      argued that a proper theological education means resisting the theological\u000d\u000a      ignorance of colonial Christianity which has led to church leaders\u000d\u000a      studying for advanced degrees in Theology. The impact of Dr Beckford's\u000d\u000a      research is on the education of clergy of British black Pentecostal\u000d\u000a      churches and the public discourse that enhances the understanding of the\u000d\u000a      church's history and empowers members to work towards political and social\u000d\u000a      changes [corrob. 5.9].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Dr Robert Beckford's research triangulates black liberation theology,\u000d\u000a      documentary film and racial justice practice.

Black\u000d\u000a      Pentecostals represent the fastest growing Christian demographic in\u000d\u000a      Britain and comprises of African and African Caribbean adherents. However,\u000d\u000a      as a migrant Christian tradition originating from former British colonies,\u000d\u000a      black Pentecostalism is blighted by the residual remains of colonial\u000d\u000a      Christianity, namely, an irrational anti-intellectualism and apoliticism.\u000d\u000a      This research seeks to challenge the present malaise by reframing colonial\u000d\u000a      Christianity through the lenses of slave narratives and the philosophy of\u000d\u000a      religion as a nefarious spiritual force that continues to `bewitch' former\u000d\u000a      colonial subjects and their descendants in Britain. To identify and\u000d\u000a      critique the influence of colonial Christianity, the research appropriates\u000d\u000a      theoretical tools from anthropological African witchcraft studies,\u000d\u000a      including the idioms of the cannibal and zombie. To construct an\u000d\u000a      alternative to colonial Christianity, uniquely, the research identifies\u000d\u000a      `exorcising' practices in the documentary film canon of Dr Robert\u000d\u000a      Beckford. The research reveals how a critique or `exorcism' of colonial\u000d\u000a      Christianity was `encoded' in the researcher's television documentary\u000d\u000a        films. The original critique of black Pentecostalism was published\u000d\u000a      as \"From maintenance to mission: resisting the bewitchment of colonial\u000d\u000a      Christianity\" (2013) and refined in the book, Documentary as Exorcism:\u000d\u000a        Resisting the Bewitchment of Colonial Christianity (2013).\u000d\u000a    The key findings were:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000aA contextual black liberation theology emphasising a\u000d\u000a        bewitchment-exorcism nexus. Black theology while a fledgling discipline\u000d\u000a        in Britain has often relied on themes and concepts from African American\u000d\u000a        or Latin American theologians. This research represents a first\u000d\u000a          truly indigenous black liberation theology. It does so by\u000d\u000a        appropriating theological sources from the Caribbean diaspora in\u000d\u000a        Britain, including language familiar to most black Pentecostals such as\u000d\u000a        `bewitchment' and `exorcism' &#8212; but used in ways that are unfamiliar to\u000d\u000a        them. Black liberation theology is a political theology, which seeks to\u000d\u000a        resist and overturn oppressive forces in Christian theology and the\u000d\u000a        social world. This research continues this liberation tradition by\u000d\u000a        critiquing the continued influence of colonial theology in black\u000d\u000a        Pentecostalism and contouring a new socio-political practice for these\u000d\u000a        churches.\u000d\u000a      \u000aA theory of colonial Christianity as malevolent spirituality.\u000d\u000a        The legacy of the British Empire in Christian theology has received\u000d\u000a        little attention in post-war British Christian academic theology.

This is to identify the postcolonial influence\u000d\u000a        of colonial Christianity on contemporary black Pentecostalism. Through\u000d\u000a        archaeology of textual sources and ethnographic study of urban churches,\u000d\u000a        the research identifies the intellectual and political fall-out from\u000d\u000a        colonial Christianity's complicity with colonial Christianity in the\u000d\u000a        English speaking Caribbean. These include a Pentecostal apoliticism (non\u000d\u000a        prophetic ministry) and an anti-intellectualism (academic\u000d\u000a        theology-phobia).\u000d\u000a      \u000aDocumentary film as a theological practice. In the quest to\u000d\u000a        construct a contextual liberation theology, the research makes use of\u000d\u000a        visual texts, that is, the religious and political television\u000d\u000a        documentary. The analysis of these films is grounded in auteur criticism\u000d\u000a        rather than textual or audience analyses. The research identifies how\u000d\u000a        authors create meaning and how the author as a filmmaker in turn creates\u000d\u000a        meaning in documentary film. One outcome is a new mode of documentary,\u000d\u000a        where documentary film represents a visual theological practice. To\u000d\u000a        reformulate this process, the researcher appropriates the African\u000d\u000a        diaspora concept of 'conjure.' Conjure describes the spiritual use of\u000d\u000a        cultural products and encompasses the role of religious icons, clothing,\u000d\u000a        food and in this case, films. Through an analysis of twenty-three\u000d\u000a        documentary films, the research reveals how the author inscribes meaning\u000d\u000a        on documentary texts in the documentary's narrative, so that at a\u000d\u000a        subliminal level of engagement, these films are a critique of continued\u000d\u000a        colonial influence and their overcoming.\u000d\u000a      \u000aTranslation of exorcism into a contemporary visual aesthetic.\u000d\u000a        In order to show that the bewitchment-exorcism motif has practical\u000d\u000a        application to church life, including and beyond black Pentecostalism,\u000d\u000a        the study goes in search of the bewitchment-exorcism theme in\u000d\u000a        contemporary church art.

This\u000a      appealed to Penny for two reasons. First, it would provide the Gallery,\u000a      with its world-leading collection of religious art, access to Quash's own\u000a      research expertise in the area of theology. This is often deficient in\u000a      art-historical approaches (and has been one of the reasons why the Gallery\u000a      rarely collaborates with University departments of art-history &#8212; as it has\u000a      its own art historians &#8212; but was keen on a collaboration with a Theology\u000a      and Religious Studies Department). Second, Penny recognized that King's\u000a      College London, at Department, School and College levels, had the\u000a      resources and expertise to aid in generating high-quality online\u000a      educational materials, which the Gallery was keen to adapt for its website\u000a      at the time.\u000a\u0009  This initial contact led to further meetings between Quash,\u000a      Penny and the full team of senior curators at the Gallery. At these\u000a      meetings Quash put forward his unique two-fold research approach on which\u000a      this impact case is based &#8212; the relationship between 'Art in Christianity'\u000a      and 'Christianity in Art'. This resulted in the development of a joint MA,\u000a      approved by King's College London and the National Gallery in 2009, in a\u000a      signing ceremony involving King's Principal Rick Trainor and Nicholas\u000a      Penny. (In the wake of this, in June of that year, Quash was interviewed\u000a      on BBC1's Songs of Praise programme about teaching Christianity and the\u000a      Arts to undergraduates in London, with footage of King's College London\u000a      students being taught outside the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square\u000a      (see Section 5.3.1).\u000a    Since then the collaboration, underpinned by Quash's two-fold research\u000a      approach has transcended the MA degree and now can be divided into five\u000a      distinct but overlapping types of impact. In the words of Susan Foister\u000a      (5.1.1) the National Gallery's Deputy Director and Director of Public\u000a      Engagement, the Gallery has been `extremely pleased with the considerable\u000a      public impact brought about by its innovative and fruitful collaboration\u000a      with Professor Ben Quash and King's, and looks forward to its\u000a      continuation'. Dr Jennifer Sliwka, Ahmanson Fellow in Art and Religion at\u000a      the National Gallery, has credited Quash's expertise as having `already\u000a      yielded several innovative and pioneering projects' and looks forward to\u000a      further `joint ventures' (5.1.2).\u000a    Impact A\u000a    In 2010, the National Gallery identified `Art and Religion' as one of its\u000a      four central research priorities for the following 10 years. The Gallery\u000a      explains the aims of the theme on its website: 'The Art and Religion\u000a      research theme focuses on interpretation of paintings that are of sacred\u000a      subjects, nearly all of which are Christian. Christianity became the\u000a      predominant power shaping European culture after classical antiquity,\u000a      inspiring artists and patrons to evoke the nature of these sacred\u000a      mysteries in visual terms' (see 5.2.1).\u000a    This commitment to the theme of Art and Religion is largely the result of\u000a      the ongoing collaboration of the Gallery with Quash. This has been summed\u000a      up by Susan Foister: `the engagement with Ben Quash has made an extremely\u000a      important contribution to the Gallery's decision to initiate, to renew and\u000a      to strengthen the topic of \"Art and Religion'\" as one of its four main\u000a      research themes and priorities in...the period covering the Gallery's\u000a      current research strategy as presented to its board of trustees' (5.1.1).\u000a      The Principals of the Ahmanson Foundation (the lead donor to the National\u000a      Gallery in this area) also acknowledge the `major impact' that Quash's\u000a      research has had on the `way the National Gallery has developed and\u000a      expanded its work' in the area of art and religion (5.1.4), while Nicholas\u000a      Penny, Director of the National Gallery, speaks of the `real impact' Quash\u000a      has had on the Art and Religion theme, which in turn has `opened up all\u000a      sorts of possibilities' for future collaboration (5.1.3)..\u000a    Impact B\u000a    Quash's research, in collaboration with the National Gallery, also fed\u000a      into the way that the Gallery's major 2011 summer exhibition `Devotion by\u000a      Design: Italian Altarpieces until 1500' was curated. This included the way\u000a      that the works in the exhibition were presented, hung above altar-like\u000a      structures, with candle-like lighting, the accompaniment of liturgical\u000a      music, and an altar cross. As Dr Jennifer Sliwka, Ahmanson Fellow in Art\u000a      and Religion at the National Gallery has noted, Quash's expertise had a\u000a      `direct impact both on the exhibition display and the accompanying film'\u000a      (5.1.2).\u000a    The feedback was impressive. `So beautiful that it would be easy to miss\u000a      the audacity of the installation', wrote Richard Dorment of the Daily\u000a      Telegraph; `one of the most beautiful exhibitions I have ever seen about\u000a      the Quattrocento', said the presenter of Avant-Premi&#232;res on France 2\u000a      T&#233;l&#233;vision). The related exhibition page was viewed 53,500 times, and the\u000a      exhibition film was viewed 4,000 times online.\u000a    Quash was one of those mentioned in the acknowledgements section of the\u000a      major 2011 catalogue of The Italian Paintings Before 1400 by Dillian\u000a      Gordon (see 5.2.3). Quash's research was also incorporated in a National\u000a      Gallery podcast about the exhibition, and a Radio 4 broadcast `Sunday\u000a      Worship: The Art of Worship', on 3 July 2011, live from St\u000a      Martin-in-the-Fields. Timed to coincide with the National Gallery's summer\u000a      exhibition, `Devotion by Design', in this programme Quash spoke about the\u000a      devotional significance of altarpieces (see 5.3.2).\u000a    Impact C\u000a    The National Gallery has commissioned a series of 10 short films on John\u000a      the Baptist in art, written and presented by Quash and Dr Jennifer Sliwka\u000a      of the Gallery, totalling just under an hour of material. This has been\u000a      described by Dr Sliwka as `the most ambitious investment to date by the\u000a      National Gallery in online education' (5.1.2). The decision to commission\u000a      this `groundbreaking' podcast series (5.1.4) was born out of the Gallery's\u000a      appreciation of the importance of Quash's research and teaching on Art as\u000a      a Theological Medium, with its special focus on the figure of John the\u000a      Baptist. Quash already has extensive experience of different mediums to\u000a      disseminate research (see for example 5.3.3 and 5.3.4). As Susan Foister\u000a      (5.1.1) has said, `This is a major step beyond the Gallery's existing\u000a      programme of monthly podcasts and we see it as an important experiment in\u000a      reaching a wider public with more sophisticated, deeper content, one that\u000a      not only places Art and Religion at the centre of the Gallery's Public\u000a      Engagement strategy, but is a new departure directly linked to the\u000a      Gallery's evolving relationship with Ben Quash'.\u000a    Impact D\u000a    The Gallery has secured 10 years' worth of funding for a series of five\u000a      2-year post-doctoral research fellows in Art and Religion from the Howard\u000a      and Roberta Ahmanson Fellowship in Art and Religion, which in the words of\u000a      Susan Foister have arisen `quite specifically from the Gallery's\u000a      collaboration with Professor Quash', as the donors were deeply impressed\u000a      by the particularly theological character of the questions Quash's\u000a      research explores. As these donors have explained, Quash's research on art\u000a      and religion `validated' their funding of the National Gallery in this\u000a      area (5.1.4).\u000a    Impact E\u000a    Quash's research outputs also impacted on the way that the National\u000a      Gallery's education programme was developed around the `Devotion by\u000a      Design' exhibition. In particular it significantly influenced the way the\u000a      Gallery's educational department is now looking more intentionally to\u000a      address the historical and contemporary interests of religious `audiences'\u000a      for painting (see 5.1.2 and 5.2.1). Quash presented a paper at one of the\u000a      Gallery's major public study days on the exhibition, and also presented at\u000a      a private study day for international academics (also centred on the\u000a      exhibition). The `Art and Religion' theme has encouraged the Gallery to\u000a      offer subsequent public study days on theological themes (see 5.2.4).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The developing collaborative strategic relationship between Professor Ben\u000a      Quash and the National Gallery stemming from Quash's research, in\u000a      particular his unique exploration of religious art &#8212; or specifically\u000a      `Christian' art along the dual lines of 'Art in Christianity' and\u000a      'Christianity in Art' &#8212; has impacted on the approach of this world-leading\u000a      cultural institution in a number of ways. It has been central to the\u000a      Gallery's decision to make `Art and Religion' one of its four lead\u000a      research themes. It has been responsible for attracting significant\u000a      financial support from donors impressed by the theological character of\u000a      the questions Quash's research explores. It has resulted in the Gallery's\u000a      commissioning of its most ambitious educational investment to date in a\u000a      series of online educational resources; and it has influenced the\u000a      Gallery's staging of its highly successful 2011 summer exhibition\u000a      `Devotion by Design'. Finally, Quash's research has impacted on how the\u000a      National Gallery's education department organizes the public study of\u000a      religion and art.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    King's College London\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"King's College London","InstitutionName":"King's College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10003645}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1) `The\u000a        De-sublimations of Christian Art' in N.

The underpinning\u000a      research has argued that a theological approach to the visual arts\u000a      introduces questions and insights to the study of Christian works of art,\u000a      both from the past and also contemporary art, that are not habitually\u000a      articulated in art-historical approaches. In particular it outlines an\u000a      approach to the study of Christian art, which makes two lines of enquiry\u000a      central; the combination of both is genuinely innovative.\u000a    \u000a      The first can be summarized as examining `Art in Christianity'. It\u000a        asks questions about the ecclesiastical settings, spaces for private\u000a        devotion, and liturgical uses for which particular works of art were\u000a        commissioned and made. This requires knowledge of church history, of\u000a        theological writings and statements of the periods in question, the\u000a        contents of sermons and other forms of popular piety &#8212; and the complex\u000a        ways in which they feed into the art. There is some consideration of\u000a        these questions in existing art-historical scholarship, but considerably\u000a        less than there should be.\u000a      The second line of enquiry can be summarized as examining\u000a        `Christianity in Art'. This asks questions about how works of art\u000a        themselves are `doing theology'; that is to say, expressing, developing,\u000a        modifying and transmitting Christian viewpoints in a distinctively\u000a        visual medium. It asks how, for example, a painting might be considered\u000a        exhortatory &#8212; having some of the characteristics of a sermon; how it\u000a        might seek to move or instruct; and above all how not only its visual\u000a        content (or subject matter) but its very medium permits the exploration\u000a        of theological truth claims and commitments.\u000a    \u000a    Both are brought together innovatively through Quash's application of\u000a      what he terms a `theological hermeneutic' that examines how theological\u000a      meanings (both historical and contemporary) are generated, justified and\u000a      transmitted in Christian tradition and then applied to the interpretation\u000a      of works of art. This approach is unique and sensitive to both the\u000a      devotional motivations that may have governed the making of such objects,\u000a      but also to the value of later receptions of them by religious\u000a      interpreters in subsequent periods of history. Paintings in the National\u000a      Gallery collection that Quash has interpreted both theologically\u000a      ('Christianity in Art') and in some cases also art historically ('Art in\u000a      Christianity') include Leonardo da Vinci's `The Virgin of the Rocks', an\u000a      entrancing, intense exploration of how beauty unfurls in seemingly barren\u000a      and unpromising surroundings that plays off the forbidding and the\u000a      exquisite against each other. Quash has also applied this approach to\u000a      Piero della Francesca's supremely poised `The Baptism of Christ'.

In corroborating letters\u000a        to us, they report that the capabilities approach developed by Sedmak\u000a        has been used to build capacity in numerous ways on the ground,\u000a        resulting in an improvement in both the culture and quality of care.\u000a      \u000a        In general, the whole focus of the Villages (each with schools for\u000a          their children) has shifted from `unified school-success criterion' to\u000a          the individual capabilities of children and their individual\u000a          development paths. On specifics, they report that as a result of this\u000a          shift:\u000a        Children are now exposed to a wider range of professional career\u000a          possibilities, and have access to more computers and computer literacy\u000a          programmes.\u000a        They are provided with improved life plans, long-term perspectives\u000a          and decision-making skills.\u000a        SOS children are benefitting from Sedmak's recommendation that the\u000a          institutional profile of SOS is reduced in the community (where\u000a          identification as a foster child often caries with it a certain\u000a          stigma) and that the children are integrated into wider society.\u000a        Children are now encouraged to meet with their biological families\u000a          and to bring friends into the village, and SOS logos have been removed\u000a          from vehicles used by children.\u000a        There is now also an organised effort to discuss issues of cultural\u000a          pluralism and gender, and to challenge traditional gender roles, with\u000a          the initial result of the appointment of a woman as Child and Youth\u000a          Development coordinator in the SOS village, Windhoek.\u000a      \u000a      2. SOS children who participated in the workshops and interviews during\u000a        the evaluation field trip to villages of Windhoek and Tsumeb, Namibia\u000a        (undertaken by Sedmak and three SOS International and National Directors\u000a        between 25-31 August 2013) were overwhelmingly positive. The repeatedly\u000a        recurring theme of responses from recorded interviews with children in\u000a        these villages were that the pilot project had been `life-changing'.\u000a        Specifically, they testified, for example, that the project has provided\u000a        them with `a sense of direction' (workshop 2, children); had `changed my\u000a        life' (workshop 2, children); `changed a lot of things in my life' (SOS\u000a        youth, interview); `changed my life in many ways' (SOS child,\u000a        interview); and `helped me think about the future' (SOS child,\u000a        interview).\u000a      3. According to (5.1.3) Reinhold Bauer, former Managing Director of SOS\u000a        Germany and currently a consultant to the organisation, the version of\u000a        the capabilities approach presented in Sedmak's research has `changed\u000a        greatly' the way in which SOS now approaches its Family Strengthening\u000a        Programme (FSP). He reports that this vital programme, which goes beyond\u000a        foster care in supporting vulnerable children and their families in the\u000a        communities, is now more focused on capacity building and fostering\u000a        self-efficacy and a sense of autonomy. Specific examples are:\u000a      \u000a        In Tsumeb, a community of 200 families &amp; 400 children, and in\u000a          the `One Nation' District of Windhoek, home to 240 families and 580\u000a          children, income-generating activities such as sewing, gardening, and\u000a          bread-baking that help to develop a sense of responsibility have been\u000a          introduced.\u000a        Sedmak's CA has been used in two new projects in Tsumeb &#8212; a\u000a          counselling project with children in the SOS village and a\u000a          capacity-building project led by volunteers. This includes projects\u000a          such as `making a movie', established as a direct response to a\u000a          recommendation by Sedmak that children should be challenged in their\u000a          spare time and that creativity should be fostered.\u000a      \u000a    Impact B: The research changed the programme policy of the\u000a      international programme department of the headquarters of SOS Children's\u000a      Villages.   \u000a      1. The research developed a basic theory for the work of the entire SOS\u000a        Children's Villages worldwide, in the process impacting on the\u000a        organisation's effectiveness and efficiency as a global civil society\u000a        actor. According to Christian Posch (5.1.1), the International Director\u000a        of SOS Children's Villages International), Sedmak's research has not\u000a        only made a `significant impact for our international programme\u000a        building' but has been `policy defining at every stage'.\u000a      \u000a        This can be demonstrated in relation to the impact of Sedmak's\u000a          research on the SOS Child Development Plan (CDP). This sets out the\u000a          interaction between caregiver and child to assess the child's future\u000a          aspirations and is a standard procedure across all 133 countries and\u000a          territories. According to (5.1.3), Sedmak's research had a\u000a          `significant impact and brought changes', to how CDP is used. This\u000a          view has been endorsed by SOS care workers who participated in the\u000a          August 2013 workshops and interviews in Tsumeb and Windhoek. These\u000a          practitioners expressed the view that Sedmak's research project had\u000a          `changed CDP', had made it `less superficial' (Workshop 1, care\u000a          givers), and had made `child participation very important' (Workshop\u000a          4, care givers).\u000a        Sedmak's research has also led SOS to introduce a new stage of\u000a          `rethinking institutionalization', fostering a culture of decreasing\u000a          institutional features that gives more voice to care givers and\u000a          embraces the `children first' approach of Sedmak's research. It has\u000a          even led the organisation as a whole to consider how best to\u000a          facilitate the promotion of individuals, not least by introducing a\u000a          culture of self-evaluation and exchange at all levels of the\u000a          organisation.\u000a        His research project has also served as a focus for the NGO's\u000a          interaction with government and authorities in implementing strategy.\u000a          In 2010, SOS staff met in Nicaragua with the Nicaraguan minister of\u000a          children to discuss in detail the possible implementation of Sedmak's\u000a          research. In Namibia, findings of the project evaluation trip showed\u000a          that Sedmak's research has led to the establishment of new links with\u000a          national organisations such as the Namibia Institute of Mining\u000a          Technology and has improved the culture of cooperation with the\u000a          University of Namibia.\u000a        It has also forged a new relationship between SOS and the Namibian\u000a          Ministries of Family, Health and Social Service. As a social worker\u000a          (5.3.2) employed in the latter reports, noted, Sedmak's research `has\u000a          been influencing me in my work...especially in the analysis of\u000a          capabilities and in applying tools for making minors participate in\u000a          decision-making processes'. According to Greg Clayton (5.1.2),\u000a          National Development Coordinator, Namibia, this has strengthened SOS'\u000a          position as a `theory-based' and `reflective NGO'; and Reinhold Bauer\u000a          (5.1.3) reports the cumulative impact of the project has led SOS to be\u000a          taken more seriously at an official level in Namibia.\u000a      \u000a      2. In view of these successes, with their highly positive impacts, the\u000a        NGO is now in the process of implementing the basic policy document\u000a        yielded by Sedmak's research across its International SOS Children's\u000a        Villages programme worldwide. As Dr. Barbara Schratz (5.1.4) programme\u000a        director and scientific advisor for SOS has remarked, Sedmak's research\u000a        `will influence programme planning and programme evaluation in all 2,407\u000a        programmes in more than 100 countries'. And Greg Clayton (5.1.2)\u000a        likewise comments: `I am quite proud that Namibia has become a pilot\u000a        country since the approach tested here will be taken to other countries\u000a        and an international level.'\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Between 2009 and 2012 Clemens Sedmak was lead coordinator of a research\u000a      project in collaboration with the international development NGO `SOS\u000a      Children's Villages International'. Founded in 1949, this organisation is\u000a      a service provider in the areas of care, education and health for\u000a      children, as well as a child rights actor advocating for vulnerable\u000a      children's rights. It runs 2,407 programmes in 133 countries and\u000a      territories, providing over 80,000 children and youth with family-based\u000a      care worldwide. It has been nominated 16 times for the Nobel Peace Prize\u000a      and is recipient of numerous highly esteemed international awards (see\u000a      5.2.4 below). In 2011, total income was &#8364;886.8 million (see 5.2.1).\u000a      Sedmak's research underpinned the design and implementation initially of a\u000a      pilot project to improve quality of foster care in SOS Children's Villages\u000a      in Namibia and Nicaragua. Specifically, the research applied Sedmak's own\u000a      reworkings of the `capability approach' (discussed below) to children aged\u000a      8-13 and youths aged 14-18 who have lost parental care or are at risk of\u000a      losing it. The beneficiaries of Sedmak's research are the NGO and also\u000a      foster children and their families. The final report, published in\u000a      February 2012, identified major challenges and opportunities for programme\u000a      planning and evaluation. It also developed a theoretical framework based\u000a      on primary data for subsequent application across the SOS Children's\u000a      Villages globally.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    King's College London\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"King's College London","InstitutionName":"King's College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10003645}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"3352136","Name":"Windhoek"}],"References":"\u000a    3a) From a wide range of Sedmak's initial underpinning research\u000a      (2005-08) which provided the broader theoretical basis for the further\u000a      specific research for the NGO, we submit two:\u000a    \u000a1) C.

One of the three primary areas of Sedmak's\u000a      research is social ethics with special emphasis on poverty research,\u000a      theories of justice and aspects of social exclusion. Among the key\u000a      elements informing this aspect of his work since 2005 have been Sedmak's\u000a      innovatively focused reworkings and applications of what is known as the\u000a      `capability approach' (CA, also known as the `capabilities approach').\u000a    Originally pioneered by the economist and philosopher Amartya Sen in the\u000a      1990's, CA was explicitly meant as an alternative to neo-liberal and\u000a      utilitarian policy prescriptions in the field of human development. It\u000a      suggests that the evaluation of social states of affairs should be based\u000a      on the real options people have to live the life they have reason to\u000a      value, and not &#8212; as often practiced &#8212; on the growth of individual incomes,\u000a      the availability of commodities or on happiness. In other words, CA puts a\u000a      focus rather on what people are effectively able to do and to be &#8212; that\u000a      is, on their capabilities &#8212; instead of what they have or feel. The CA has\u000a      been significantly developed by many scholars across the humanities and\u000a      social sciences (notably Martha Nussbaum), and is seen as one of the most\u000a      promising normative theories to address questions of justice, development\u000a      policies and poverty reduction. It has been incorporated into many\u000a      international surveys and official reports and has formed a conceptual\u000a      base for the UN Human Development Index.\u000a    Sedmak's own work on CA since 2005 &#8212; which falls into two periods: his\u000a      theoretical work on CA from 2005-08 (see `3a' below), and also the further\u000a      development of this work from 2008-13, fed by empirical research with the\u000a      NGO (see `3b&amp;c' below) &#8212; goes importantly beyond what others have done\u000a      in this field. As a basic grounding for what Sedmak would eventually come\u000a      to call a `Co-Capability Approach' (which is specifically developed as a\u000a      `theory' for foster-care, although it also has ramifications well beyond\u000a      that), Sedmak's work has been earmarked by particular considerations for\u000a      CA of: (i) social context and its intangible infrastructure; (ii) human\u000a      interiority as a key element of the being human; and (iii) its\u000a      identification of key capabilities (such as decision making, imagination,\u000a      friendship). Sedmak's approach as such has come to serve as the basic\u000a      theoretical underpinning for the revised policy documents of the NGO for\u000a      foster-care delivery.\u000a    As implied above, Sedmak's underpinning research falls into two\u000a      categories:\u000a    1) Research 2005-08 &#8212; In 2008, on the basis of his familiarity\u000a      with Sedmak's previous published work (see `3a' in section 3), Christian\u000a      Posch, SOS Children's Villages International Director, approached Sedmak\u000a      initially to be an academic advisor to the NGO as it was then seeking to\u000a      re-evaluate its approaches to foster care. After an initial seminar led by\u000a      Sedmak, however, in which he put forward his vision, based on his own\u000a      research, for a fundamental reorientation of approach for the NGO, he was\u000a      asked to become the lead coordinator of a research project, incorporating\u000a      two pilot studies in Namibia and Nicaragua, which under Sedmak's\u000a      leadership would come to be titled `Capabilities Approach and Foster\u000a      Care'.\u000a    2) Research 2008-13 &#8212; This initiative undertaken together with the\u000a      NGO (funded in part by the IFZ in Salzburg [see 5.2.5] and by SOS\u000a      Kinderdorf eV in Munich), and importantly based on Sedmak's earlier work,\u000a      then yielded further underpinning research (published 2011-13), which\u000a      initially served as the basis for designing and implementing the pilot\u000a      projects in Namibia and Nicaragua, but which in its published forms is\u000a      also in part the product of findings generated by these pilot projects. It\u000a      is on this basis that the underpinning theoretical framework has been\u000a      formulated, which, after the successes in the above two countries is now\u000a      in the process of being rolled out by this NGO as a basic policy document\u000a      for its International SOS Children's Villages programme worldwide.\u000a    This second level of research was undertaken by Sedmak in cooperation\u000a      with Christian Posch, Bernhard Babic and Silvia Exenberger from SOS\u000a      Children's Villages International. The research took place between\u000a      2009-2012 and consisted of four parts: (i) operationalization of the CA in\u000a      SOS Children's Villages settings; (ii) two field studies carried out in\u000a      Namibia (Gunter Graf, 2010) and Nicaragua (Oscar Germes-Castro, 2010) to\u000a      test the operationalization and to generate primary data (this field work\u000a      was carried out in cooperation with local universities and was based on\u000a      interviews with both children and educators); (iii) a systematic analysis\u000a      of the findings into a theory framework; and (iv) a translation of the\u000a      findings for the programme policy level.\u000a    The final policy paper `Creating Co-Capabilities' &#8212; written by Sedmak and\u000a      based on both the 2009-12 research and on several other related\u000a      publications from 2011-13 &#8212; was published in May 2013. With an eye\u000a      especially to both the social context and the inner resources of children,\u000a      this `Co-Capabilities' approach views children as `vulnerable co-agents'\u000a      and bases their realization of capabilities on two main concepts, `robust\u000a      identity' and `intangible infrastructure'. It identifies seven key\u000a      principles for the work of SOS: (i) a principle of inclusive\u000a      particularity (each child counts); (ii) a principle of source\u000a      recognition (child as source of joy); (iii) a principle of primacy\u000a      of childhood (children as children); (iv) a principle of 2nd\u000a      opportunities (real and repeated chances); (v) a principle of\u000a      primacy of family (intangible infrastructure &#8212; key element: trust); (vi)\u000a      a principle of promises (accountability and commitment); and (vii)\u000a      a principle of transformation (development encompassing the whole person).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41293","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"163843","Name":"Syria"},{"GeoNamesId":"285570","Name":"Kuwait"},{"GeoNamesId":"1149361","Name":"Afghanistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"248816","Name":"Jordan"},{"GeoNamesId":"272103","Name":"Lebanon"},{"GeoNamesId":"1168579","Name":"Pakistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The `Conversation with Diplomacy' project, the vehicle for disseminating\u000d\u000a      Kerr's research to the\u000d\u000a      FCO, is both distinctive and innovative.

The objective of the conference was to inform UK\u000d\u000a      foreign policy makers of\u000d\u000a      the long-term challenges they face in bringing about a peaceful democratic\u000d\u000a      transition in Syria and\u000d\u000a      preventing conflict spilling into Lebanon, and to increase awareness of\u000d\u000a      the issues and challenges\u000d\u000a      for transitional justice processes in Syria. These policy discussions fed\u000d\u000a      directly into the UK foreign\u000d\u000a      policy making process. Ambassador Frances Guy (5.1.3) commented on the\u000d\u000a      event: `The\u000d\u000a      collaboration was extremely successful and we received an enormous amount\u000d\u000a      of positive feedback\u000d\u000a      from both from the FCO and those attending.

It was no\u000a      accident in this context that\u000a      the new 2008 edition of Burridge's John commentary was chosen by\u000a      the Archbishop of Canterbury,\u000a      Rowan Williams, as the key text to be used by all delegates in preparation\u000a      for the conference (see\u000a      5.3.3 below). Accompanied by a daily reading plan,1,632 copies of the book\u000a      were sent by the\u000a      Archbishop of Canterbury, between January and July 2008, to all Anglican\u000a      bishops and other\u000a      delegates. During the course of the conference the work was also used in a\u000a      series of Bible Study\u000a      seminars and workshops for all delegates, focusing on living together with\u000a      difference. One of the\u000a      key implications of the biographical approach, as outlined in section 2 &#8212;\u000a      that using biblical texts to\u000a      dismiss opponents is itself unbiblical &#8212; had the impact of providing a\u000a      basis (as shown in the\u000a      testimonials presented) for enabling bishops of strongly diverging views\u000a      on matters of Christian\u000a      practice to listen to each other in new ways, and even while not reaching\u000a      consensus, to live and\u000a      converse attentively together despite these persisting differences.\u000a    In addition, Burridge's work on NT ethics (2007) was also used in\u000a      confidential sessions\u000a      among bishops seeking to tackle issues of human sexuality and the Bible,\u000a      with reference\u000a      analogously especially to the book's analyses of how the Bible has been\u000a      used both to justify and\u000a      critique apartheid in South Africa. Tim Thornton, The Bishop of Truro (see\u000a      5.1.2) underlined this,\u000a      acknowledging that `the early morning bible studies in small groups was a\u000a      key element of the\u000a      Lambeth Conference. They enabled strong relationships to be built between\u000a      bishops'. As Chuck\u000a      Robertson, Canon to the Presiding Bishop, The Episcopal Church (5.1.4),\u000a      has also noted, `works\u000a      offered by Prof. Burridge, have proven themselves to be invaluable tools\u000a      for my own bridge-building\u000a      work and that of others'. Canon Kenneth Kearon, Secretary General of the\u000a      Anglican\u000a      Communion (5.1.3) endorsed this view: `Professor Burridge's commentary on\u000a      St John's Gospel\u000a      was presented to all bishops, and became the background text on the Bible\u000a      for the whole\u000a      Conference'. This view was likewise endorsed by the Archbishop of\u000a      Canterbury (5.1.1) at the time\u000a      of the conference, who emphasised Burridge's `important involvement' in\u000a      the Conference,\u000a      maintaining that `both before and during the conference', the commentary\u000a      was of `great importance\u000a      in helping to provide a common vocabulary and field of reference for this\u000a      extremely diverse and\u000a      sometimes conflicted gathering'.\u000a    Impact B: Living together with difference: The Bible in the Life of\u000a        the Church\u000a    In the wake of the 2008 conference, Burridge became an external\u000a      consultant to the `Bible in the\u000a      Life of the Church' project (2009-2012, and ongoing), undertaking research\u000a      on how Anglicanism\u000a      has interpreted the Bible, analysing all its foundational and subsequent\u000a      statements about scripture,\u000a      and attempting to discover a methodology for the church to discuss the\u000a      Bible and complex moral\u000a      issues such as creation and the environment (through 2010\/11), issues of\u000a      justice and the\u000a      millennium development goals (2011\/12). The report (Deep Engagement,\u000a        Fresh Discovery: the\u000a        report of the Anglican Communion `Bible in the Life of the Church'\u000a        project, see 5.3.1) was\u000a      presented to the Anglican Consultative Council in Auckland, NZ (October\u000a      2012).\u000a    The `Bible in the Life of the Church' project is now undertaking new\u000a      research looking\u000a      towards the Lambeth Conference of 2018. Burridge's key impact in this\u000a      comes in terms of\u000a      relationship building and creating an environment for recognising\u000a      difference. The Coordinator of\u000a      the project (5.2.3), has strongly affirmed the impact of Burridge's\u000a      contribution, maintaining that it\u000a      `laid a foundation of trust among the small groups of 8 bishops'. This, in\u000a      turn, he continued,\u000a      `enabled \"hard questions\" i.e. those that have had a divisive effect on\u000a      the life of the Anglican\u000a      Communion, to be explored creatively and with a mind to what Scripture, as\u000a      a foundational\u000a      resource, might be speaking into these conversations'. Dr Rowan Williams,\u000a      the former Archbishop\u000a      of Canterbury (5.1.1) was no less clear as to the impact of Burridge's\u000a      research on this project,\u000a      maintaining that his work `played a crucial role' by providing `a more\u000a      nuanced and creative use of\u000a      the Bible and a better understanding of the actual varieties of ways in\u000a      which it is read'. He is\u000a      confident that this impact can be measured globally in `communities across\u000a      the world'. Indeed, he\u000a      believes that Burridge's role in connection with this project through\u000a      drawing on the John\u000a      commentary to provide `grass-roots clergy training across the world has\u000a      had a serious and\u000a      continuing effect on a major international family of churches as well as\u000a      on the church more locally,\u000a      and it has offered a model of good context-sensitive biblical exposition'.\u000a      This view is reiterated by\u000a      Archbishop David Moxon (5.1.5), the Archbishop of Canterbury's\u000a      Representative to the Holy See\u000a      and Director of the Anglican Centre in Rome (previously Archbishop and\u000a      Primate of New Zealand),\u000a      who has noted that Burridge's research has made `a quality difference to\u000a      the life of the world wide\u000a      church'. Specific examples of this can be found in Burridge's provision of\u000a      training for clergy on a\u000a      local level globally from the UK to Hawaii and New Zealand to Hong Kong.\u000a      In particular, the\u000a      Archbishop of Brisbane and Primate of Australia convened a weeklong\u000a      residential conference led\u000a      by Burridge and attended by all clergy in the diocese to discuss his\u000a      research on `being biblical' and\u000a      living together with difference.\u000a    Impact C: Living together with difference: From Church to Church\u000a    Burridge's work on living together with difference has impacted on\u000a      relations between the Anglican\u000a      and Roman Catholic Churches. This has been acknowledged by Archbishop\u000a      David Moxon (5.1.5),\u000a      the Archbishop of Canterbury's Representative to the Holy See and Director\u000a      of the Anglican Centre\u000a      in Rome. It has also been recognised by the 2012 President of the\u000a      International Society for New\u000a      Testament Studies (SNTS), who hosted a major conference in Barcelona in\u000a      celebration of\u000a      Burridge's work &#8212; `The Jesus Tradition and the Gospels' &#8212; at which\u000a      Burridge gave the opening\u000a      keynote address (May 2012). Burridge will also deliver the keynote speech\u000a      at the Ratzinger\u000a      Foundation conference on `The Gospels: Historical and Christological\u000a      Research' in Rome at which\u000a      Pope Francis will present him with the Ratzinger Prize for Theology,\u000a      announced 21 June 2013,\u000a      (see 5.3.2). This honour makes him the first non-Catholic to receive this\u000a      prestigious award and\u000a      marks the impact his work has also had upon the Roman Catholic church,\u000a      especially in the wake of\u000a      the publication of the similarly biographically focused three-volume\u000a      biography of Jesus by\u000a      Ratzinger\/Benedict XVI (2007, 2011, 2012). As the Academic Committee\u000a      President of the\u000a      Ratzinger Foundation commented, Burridge `has made a great contribution in\u000a      that decisive area of\u000a      the historical and theological recognition of the Gospels' inseparable\u000a      connection to Jesus of\u000a      Nazareth'.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Revd Professor Richard Burridge's work on the biographical genre of\u000a      the Gospels in\u000a      comparison to Graeco-Roman literature has impacted significantly on how\u000a      the Gospels are used\u000a      within churches and wider society, nationally and internationally. Ideas\u000a      emanating from this\u000a      research &#8212; specifically through Burridge's commentary on John's Gospel and\u000a      subsequent writings &#8212; have provided ways for the Anglican Communion across\u000a      the globe to build relationships and live\u000a      together through a period of deep disagreement and potential division,\u000a      especially over women's\u000a      leadership in the Anglican Church and homosexuality. This was particularly\u000a      evident in both the run-up\u000a      to and during the Lambeth Conference of 2008, and also in the course of\u000a      the subsequent `Bible\u000a      in the Life of the Church' project across the Anglican Communion\u000a      worldwide. Furthermore, the\u000a      impact of this research on Anglican relations with the Roman Catholic\u000a      church was made clear by\u000a      the announcement on 21 June 2013 that Burridge had been chosen as the\u000a      first non-Catholic\u000a      recipient of the prestigious Ratzinger Prize, viewed by the Vatican as\u000a      `the Nobel Prize for\u000a      Theology'.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    King's College London\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"King's College London","InstitutionName":"King's College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10003645}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"294098","Name":"Nazareth"},{"GeoNamesId":"2174003","Name":"Brisbane"},{"GeoNamesId":"1819729","Name":"Hong Kong"},{"GeoNamesId":"2193733","Name":"Auckland"},{"GeoNamesId":"5855797","Name":"Hawaii"},{"GeoNamesId":"3128760","Name":"Barcelona"}],"References":"\u000a    Many of Burridge's writings have been published in a number of versions\u000a      internationally (UK,\u000a      American, Australian) translated into Italian, Korean, Indonesian,\u000a      Russian, and have been the\u000a      subject of several revised and updated editions.

A\u000a      Category A staff member,\u000a      he has been a full time, research-active member of staff at King's since\u000a      1994.\u000a    For most of the twentieth century prior to the 1990s, scholarly orthodoxy\u000a      typically viewed\u000a      the Gospels as constituting a unique, `sui generis' form of literature,\u000a      with the focus often on the\u000a      pronouncements, `sayings', or parables of Jesus, and certainly not as\u000a      biographies of Jesus. For the\u000a      last two decades, Burridge has been a principal proponent of the view that\u000a      the Gospels should be\u000a      read primarily as a form of Graeco-Roman biography. He has explored and\u000a      developed this view\u000a      through a series of ground-breaking books and articles involving literary,\u000a      historical and exegetical\u000a      research, which, in its later stages &#8212; including a revised and expanded\u000a      edition of What are the\u000a        Gospels? (2004) &#8212; sought to articulate what was to become an\u000a      emerging consensus within this\u000a      scholarly debate.\u000a    By looking at literary genre theory and at Graeco-Roman biography, the\u000a      research sought to\u000a      demonstrate the biographical nature of the four canonical Gospels,\u000a      establishing narrative\u000a      Christology at the heart of their hermeneutic. Thus their portraits of\u000a      Jesus are central to their\u000a      interpretation, and their account of his deeds and actions are as\u000a      important as his words and\u000a      teachings. This requires continuous narrative reading rather than picking\u000a      isolated verses or\u000a      paragraphs (pericopae). Burridge disseminated this approach more widely\u000a      around the world\u000a      through the various editions and translations of the more accessible Four\u000a        Gospels One Jesus?\u000a      (1994, 2005, 2013) and in his Commentary on John's Gospel (1998b).\u000a    What was especially striking about this new `biographical' approach to\u000a      reading the Gospels\u000a      was the new kinds of orientations it was able to provide &#8212; directly from\u000a      within the discipline of\u000a      Biblical Studies &#8212; for assessing how questions of Christian orthodoxy and\u000a      orthopraxy, or questions\u000a      of right Christian teaching and living, should be judged. More precisely,\u000a      the suggestion advanced\u000a      by this `biographical' reading &#8212; that the deeds and actions of Jesus must\u000a      be as normatively\u000a      foundational for assessing questions of right Christian belief,\u000a      interpretation and action as are his\u000a      words and teaching &#8212; meant that the guiding norms for adjudicating\u000a      differences of view among\u000a      Christians must be as much ethical (i.e., with attention to the life that\u000a      Jesus lived) as they are\u000a      doctrinal. Thus, one of the most important features of this new approach\u000a      to interpreting the\u000a      Gospels, beyond its impact in Biblical Studies per se, was the new\u000a      biblically grounded basis it laid\u000a      for living together with difference, even deep and seemingly intractable\u000a      difference in matters of\u000a      Christian practice. The fuller ramifications of this were explored in what\u000a      would later become an\u000a      inclusive `New Testament Ethics' in Burridge's Imitating Jesus,\u000a      2007. Burridge is currently\u000a      undertaking new research into Anglican ways of interpreting the Bible\u000a      around the world, with\u000a      especial attention to how the New Testament under this new interpretation\u000a      can be used in\u000a      constructive new ways for speaking to contentious moral debates about\u000a      money, sexuality, war and\u000a      violence, abortion and euthanasia.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42029","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research has expanded knowledge of the Tamil people's languages and\u000a      cultures in early 18th century South India, and their reciprocal\u000a      interactions with German missionary scholars. It emerges from a conviction\u000a      that archival research acts to reclaim cultural memory, which is essential\u000a      to community self-understanding, identity, and positive pride. There are\u000a      three primary spheres in which this work has had benefit and impact.\u000a      Firstly, the work on manuscript recovery has contributed to academic\u000a      practice and discourse among professional archivists and librarians,\u000a      particularly in relation to palm leaf manuscripts. Secondly, it has\u000a      contributed to public discourse on the Tamil language: its development,\u000a      literary heritage, and reception and representation by European\u000a      (particularly Germans, Danes, and the Portuguese). It also brings to light\u000a      a very significant aspect of Indic studies: the dominance of Sanskrit\u000a      study has minimized the importance of Tamil Studies in Europe, where,\u000a      however Tamil was the first Indian language to be taught. Thirdly, this\u000a      research highlights the contributions of a minority community, namely\u000a      Protestant Christians, to nation building: Christians have introduced new\u000a      patterns of thinking and living that have caused redefinition of inherited\u000a      beliefs, customs, and practices. The prominent position of the Tamil\u000a      vernacular in the activities of the Tamil Christians stirred up a new\u000a      Tamil consciousness; their indigenous Christian communities provided\u000a      alternative ways of being Indians and Christians at the same time. The\u000a      research brings new insights and awareness regarding this into the\u000a      international public sphere. The specific impacts are described below\u000a      under four headings: 1) Manuscript Recovery; 2) Translation of\u000a      Ziegenbalg's Grammatica Damulica; 3) Documentary Video Beyond\u000a        Empires; 4) Public Speaking in Christian Contexts.\u000a    Manuscript Recovery. The Francke Foundations in Halle arranged for\u000a      special protection of the palm leaf manuscripts discovered by Jeyaraj\u000a      because their linguistic and cultural value is unique and irreplaceable.\u000a      Jeyaraj chose key palm leaf manuscripts for microfilming and the microfilm\u000a      reels are kept in the Lutheran Heritage Archives in Chennai, Tamil Nadu,\u000a      available free of charge to the general public and to scholars. This\u000a      represents a significant widening of access, as those interested do not\u000a      need to travel or obtain the Schengen Visa. Jeyaraj was further invited to\u000a      the National Library of M&#252;nich for the first week of July 2013, in order\u000a      to identify hitherto unidentified palm leaf documents.\u000a    The palm leaf collections have inspired technical initiatives for the\u000a      safe-keeping of similar documents, e.g. using modern technology to protect\u000a      from pests. As part of the Germany-India Year 2011-2012, the Foreign\u000a      Office, Federal Republic of Germany, sponsored a workshop entitled\u000a      \"Science Transfer as Cultural Dialogue\" (23-24.2.12)1 directly\u000a      inspired by Jeyaraj's continuing work with the palm leaf manuscripts. The\u000a      workshop aimed to analyse sources of common cultural history preserved in\u000a      Indian and German archives and to explore avenues for closer cooperation\u000a      between Indian institutions and the Francke foundations. The Zentrum\u000a      Moderner Orient in Berlin, the Roja Muthaiah Research Library, the Francke\u000a      Foundations, and archivists of leading libraries in India participated in\u000a      this workshop. Jeyaraj was invited to give the only public lecture\u000a      (\"Introducing Indian Teachings and Ways of Life to Europeans: Exchange of\u000a      Ideas between Tamil Pundits and European Missionaries in pre-colonial\u000a      India\"). This lecture stressed the importance of recovering, preserving\u000a      and spreading memories of people in cross-cultural contexts to deepen\u000a      awareness of interdependence and learn best practices from one another.\u000a      Public interest in these palm leaf manuscripts persists in the UK and in\u000a      Halle; the Francke Foundations will host a further workshop entitled Palm-leaf\u000a        Manuscripts in Europe and India (7-8.9.13). Jeyaraj was invited\u000a      (April 2013) to speak about the palm leaf collections and their\u000a      preservation.2\u000a    Translation of Ziegenbalg's Grammatica Damulica.\u000a      This has attracted significant attention beyond academia. A reviewer for\u000a      the Berlin Society for Mission History (March 2013) commented that the\u000a      book recovered \"a forgotten aspect of the Tamil cultural heritage,\" and\u000a      offered a valuable case study for practitioners of mission and ecumenism\u000a      (as well as scholars) of the \"transcontinental role of a grammar in\u000a      communicating and simultaneously preserving Tamil language, culture and\u000a      memories.\"3 Of particular note is the interest that arose from\u000a      the organizers of the First World Classical Tamil Conference (June\u000a      2010) in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. The Government of Tamil Nadu initiated\u000a      and sponsored this mega-conference, with 913 papers and 2605 delegates, to\u000a      celebrate the classical status of the Tamil language and to evolve\u000a      strategies for the future in accordance with policies of the Government of\u000a      India. Jeyaraj was one of two representatives invited from the United\u000a      Kingdom, in order to speak on the Grammatica Damulica. The\u000a      conference itself and a personal interview with Jeyaraj were featured in\u000a      FRONTLINE (30.7.10),4 the leading bi-monthly national magazine\u000a      of India with an average issue readership of 152, 000. The conference\u000a      itself was said to be \"surcharged with Tamil pride\", and included\u000a      \"euphoria caused by the cultural programmes got up to ensure public\u000a      participation on a large scale\". The plenary chair emphasized the\u000a      importance to the Tamil diaspora of highlighting the \"antiquity and\u000a      greatness of the Tamil language in all UNESCO-recognised languages.\" The\u000a      personal interview with Jeyaraj, \"Of the German who took Tamil to\u000a      Europeans\", brought Jeyaraj's research on Ziegenbalg to the attention of\u000a      the broader Indian public, and thereby brought into greater prominence a\u000a      significant figure in Indian cultural history. Jeyaraj continues to\u000a      receive public enquires and feedback in response to this article.\u000a    Documentary Video Beyond Empires. Jeyaraj's\u000a      research also led to a request from an independent producer and director\u000a      in the USA, Christopher Gilbert (of LampPost Media), to act as research\u000a      consultant for a documentary video on Ziegenbalg, Beyond Empires-itself\u000a      inspired by reading Jeyaraj's work. The film is now complete and release\u000a      is planned for December 2013, first on ACCTV in Australia and then in\u000a      other countries. Gilbert commented that \"when just some of [Ziegenbalg's]\u000a      achievements and the celebration of them by an emerging global power like\u000a      India is known, his invisibility in the west seems an incomprehensible\u000a      injustice\".5 Jeyaraj's research is, then, instrumental in\u000a      addressing this \"incomprehensible injustice\" and bringing Ziegenbalg's\u000a      life and works to a broader audience. As Gilbert says: \"There are few\u000a      experts on Ziegenbalg's life, the foremost, Dr. Daniel Jeyaraj... has\u000a      agreed to be the primary expert witness on this project on location in\u000a      India.

Gilbert\u000a      attests that the film crew received significant attention from Indian\u000a      newspapers and from Reuter's television news, Indian division.

Ziegenbalg, but more\u000a      so to participate and provide momentum to the social reform movements\u000a      already taking place in India, vis-&#224;-vis the Dalit liberation and\u000a      education revolution.\"\u000a    The Beyond Empires team publicized the forthcoming documentary on\u000a      YouTube;7 the site hosts eleven videos with total views\u000a      exceeding 4110. One video, \"A Reason to Tell the Story: Beyond Empires\" is\u000a      narrated by Jeyaraj himself, Andrew Walls and Theodore Bhaskaran; this\u000a      feature, with 870 views, includes testimony from Christians, Hindus and\u000a      Muslims about the significance of Ziegenbalg's contributions to Tamil\u000a      culture (and hence, indirectly, about the significance of Jeyaraj's role\u000a      in contributing both to knowledge of Ziegenbalg's life and work, and to\u000a      assisting in bringing this knowledge to a wider audience). A further\u000a      indicator of the significance and reach of this impact is that funding for\u000a      the post-production phase of the documentary was crowdsourced via\u000a      Kickstarter (a specialist fundraiser site for independent creative\u000a      projects). In 2011, 103% of the target amount was reached within one\u000a      month, with $7688 raised from 57 backers.8\u000a    Public Speaking in Christian Contexts. Jeyaraj also delivers\u000a      seminars and lectures for the interested public. As a consequence of the\u000a      publication of `The Malabarian Correspondence', the Madras Christian\u000a      College invited Jeyaraj to give their annual Dr. Michael C. Lockwood\u000a      Endowment Lecture (26 August 2011).9 He expounded the theme\u000a      \"Bartholom&#228;us Ziegenbalg's explorations into South Indian Culture,\u000a      Philosophy and Religion. This was featured in a Times of India\u000a      article (27.8.11).10 On 20 April 2012, he gave a further\u000a      seminar to the Madras Christian College on the subject of India-initiated\u000a      churches, which brought together academics and clergy, as well as\u000a      representatives of leading mission agencies. The Tiruvarambur Pastorate of\u000a      the Tamil Evangelical Lutheran Church invited him to give four lectures in\u000a      Tamil to a church in Trichy, India, on \"Contributions of Ziegenbalg's\u000a      Family to Indian Society\" (20.8.12). TELC is a government-funded\u000a      educational provider; as a consequence of these talks, the Secretary of\u000a      the Church Council invited Jeyaraj to share his insights with the teachers\u000a      of the Tamil Evangelical Lutheran Church during their retreat\u000a      (24-27.8.12), commenting that his work on Ziegenbalg was \"very useful\" for\u000a      school teachers in teaching their students about him.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The research, on early 18th century South India through the\u000a      writings of German missionary scholars, has expanded knowledge of the\u000a      Tamil people, languages and cultures; identified more than 160 Tamil and\u000a      Telugu texts engraved on palm leaves; and recovered numerous paper\u000a      manuscripts that were considered lost. The work on manuscript recovery has\u000a      contributed to the professional practice and discourse of professional\u000a      archivists and librarians and, through examining these manuscripts in\u000a      Tamil, German, Latin, Portuguese, and English, a new picture about the\u000a      Tamil emerges. This has important implications for Tamil cultural\u000a      identity, heritage and pride, currently a matter of social and political\u000a      emphasis in the Indian public sphere.

Walls Centre for the Study of Asian and African Christianity. In\u000a      the context of the dynamics of Christian engagement with peoples of other\u000a      cultures and religion, Jeyaraj has sought to recover cultural history and\u000a      memory in relation to reciprocal interactions and impacts between German\u000a      Lutheran missionaries and the Tamils. He has deployed techniques of\u000a      manuscript recovery and preservation and historical-critical methods of\u000a      textual analysis, translation and social studies. In particular, he has\u000a      studied the formation of an indigenous Christian worshipping community in\u000a      Southern India and the life and works of the first ever Protestant\u000a      Lutheran missionary to arrive in South India, Bartholomaus Ziegenbalg, who\u000a      settled at the Danish port of Tranquebar after his arrival in 1706.\u000a      Ziegenbalg's pioneering work was profoundly significant to Indian cultural\u000a      and religious history and identity in a number of ways: he learned the\u000a      Tamil language, imported India's first printing presses for Tamil\u000a      literature, designed a prose form of the vernacular language (now used in\u000a      popular Tamil newspapers and magazines), created the first schools in\u000a      India for girls, translated and taught the Bible to Tamils, and was\u000a      instrumental in the founding of the first indigenous Protestant church.\u000a      Remarkably, however, his contribution has been largely neglected and\u000a      overlooked in the English- and German-speaking worlds.\u000a    The background to the ongoing research on which this case study rests\u000a      dates to 1991 and includes the recovery and identification of numerous\u000a      paper and palm leaf manuscripts written in Tamil, Telugu, German, Latin,\u000a      Danish, Portuguese, and English. These manuscripts contain important\u000a      first-hand information on the South Indian church, society, spoken\u000a      language and culture, and include the discovery of a vast collection of\u000a      hitherto unknown Tamil manuscripts engraved in palm leaves (1709-1741) in\u000a      the Mission Archives of the Francke Foundations, Halle (Salle), Germany,\u000a      the Royal Library in Copenhagen, and in the British Library. Jeyaraj\u000a      developed a particular method to prepare a trilingual catalogue for all\u000a      Tamil palm leaf manuscripts in Halle and prepared a summary of the texts\u000a      (book-wise and chapter-wise) in Tamil, Germany and English. The discovery\u000a      of new original documents for the study of Tamils and Tamil culture\u000a      continues, as does Jeyaraj's work in recovery, preservation, cataloguing\u000a      and dissemination.\u000a    Within this ongoing research trajectory, Jeyaraj has produced the first\u000a      English translation, with annotation, of Ziegenbalg's Grammatica\u000a        Damulica ([1716] 2010). Ziegenbalg composed this, the first Tamil\u000a      grammar printed outside of India, in order to teach Tamil to his\u000a      contemporaries in Europe. This, and other such grammars produced by\u000a      Christian missionaries, represent rare attempts on the part of Europeans\u000a      to learn Tamil and build a cross-cultural bridge between Europe and South\u000a      India. In this context, Ziegenbalg's Grammatica is an important\u000a      piece of Tamil cultural history, never fully studied. The translation from\u000a      Latin to English was in the interests of making this significant text more\u000a      widely available both within and beyond academia.\u000a    The next major research initiative was, with Richard Fox Young, the\u000a      production of an English translation and critical edition of all 99 Tamil\u000a        Letters gathered and translated into German by Ziegenbalg and his\u000a      colleague Gr&#252;ndler (the `Malabarian Correspondence'). These letters are\u000a      indispensable for our knowledge of intercultural interactions on the Tamil\u000a      littoral in early 18th century South India. They represent\u000a      reciprocal Hindu-Christian self-disclosure between the two missionaries\u000a      and members of the Tamil people, and mark the former's commitment to\u000a      engaging Europeans with the Tamil, not simply bringing Christianity to\u000a      India. Besides offering a new translation, this edition differs\u000a      substantially from the existing corpus of scholarship on the Tamil\u000a        Letters because, in drawing upon a wide variety of original source\u000a      materials both in German and Tamil, it not only clarifies their origin and\u000a      meaning but also situates and evaluates them within a broad framework of\u000a      contexts: socio- historical, linguistic, religious, and theological. This\u000a      brings to light indigenous voices not heard in European contexts and also\u000a      offers a model for Hindu-Christian dialogue.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42066","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"},{"GeoNamesId":"69543","Name":"Yemen"},{"GeoNamesId":"1733045","Name":"Malaysia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1168579","Name":"Pakistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact sought from the research was not with policy makers post 9\/11\u000a      and 7\/7, but rather the enrichment and expansion of the cultural life of\u000a      British Muslims, and psychological and social impact on the communities of\u000a      Muslims when provided with positive self-images of their historic presence\u000a      in Britain. In 2007 I was becoming increasingly aware of community\u000a      sensitivities and the need that scholars of religion should `put something\u000a      back' into these communities and offer some reciprocal benefit. I had\u000a      recognised that Abdullah Quilliam and his Liverpool Muslim Institute were\u000a      significant to the identity quests of British-born second and third\u000a      generation Muslims because (i) they increasingly saw him as an iconic\u000a      figure whose conversion to Islam marked him out as neither economic\u000a      migrant nor a refugee fleeing persecution or war, but demonstrated a\u000a      Muslim presence in the UK that predated the WWII migrations. (ii) Quilliam\u000a      reflected upon the nature of being Muslim in Britain during a period of\u000a      international conflict between Britain and Muslim territories and examined\u000a      British Muslim identity, citizenship and conflicting loyalties. Quilliam\u000a      was significant in attempts by Muslims to reclaim their history in the\u000a      West and as a figure who cements Islam in Britain as a religious\u000a      conviction.\u000a    Individual Muslims and some organisations, for example, the Quilliam\u000a      Foundation, perceived him as an ideal of an integrated and moderate\u000a      Muslim, able to provide an exemplary bulwark against extremism. Quilliam\u000a      was also significant because he was a leader of British Muslims in an\u000a      urban environment rapidly transforming into a multi-cultural city. I\u000a      wanted to tell this story to British Muslims in a milieu in which negative\u000a      narratives were becoming the norm. Kube Press was chosen for publication,\u000a      as it could access a wide Muslim readership. The book launch (16th\u000a      April 2010) at Liverpool Hope University was announced at juma'a prayers\u000a      in the central mosque Liverpool and attracted around 250 to attend,\u000a      including a number of Muslim leaders from the city and beyond. Enquiries\u000a      to provide community lectures to various Muslim audiences (religious and\u000a      ethnic) concerning the impact of Abdullah Quilliam for 21st\u000a      Century Muslims arrived from 2010. To date over 35 lectures have been\u000a      delivered within a variety of Muslim audiences including summer camps\u000a      (attendance 5000) to retreats (attendance 25). The invitations have\u000a      crossed ethnic boundaries with lectures to Yemeni, Turkish, Pakistani,\u000a      Indian, and Bangladeshi societies in London, Birmingham, Manchester,\u000a      Cambridge, and Preston (https:\/\/info.hope.ac.uk\/aps\/user.php?id=geavesr).\u000a      There was also a lecture invitation to address the foreign office on\u000a      contemporary resonances between British foreign policy in the 19th\u000a      Century and the Gulf Wars (4th November 2010) .\u000a    The impact of the book continues with such invitations in 2013 and was\u000a      further disseminated by two BBC radio documentaries (Radio 4 and BBC World\u000a      Service ) in 2010 and 2011 on the subject of Abdullah Quilliam. In 2012,\u000a      BBC 1 put out a documentary Great British Islam with me as one of\u000a      the `talking heads' to mark the first night of Ramadan. The programme\u000a      focused on the significance of Abdullah Quilliam. The overall theme of the\u000a      programme was the historic importance of Muslim communities in Britain\u000a      prior to the post WWII migrations. The programme attracted 776,000 viewers\u000a      even though it went out at 11pm. A further 106,000 have watched the\u000a      programme on You-Tube to the present. These programmes have been utilised\u000a      by the Abdullah Quilliam Society in Liverpool to reclaim the historic\u000a      mosque (the first in Britain) from the City Council, and the book forms a\u000a      considerable presence on the Abdullah Quilliam Society website. The\u000a      society exists to further Muslim heritage in Britain by promoting\u000a      Quilliam's activities in Liverpool and to re-establish the building in\u000a      which he promoted Islam as a mosque and heritage centre for British\u000a      Muslims. The Society has drawn upon my status as the author of Quilliam's\u000a      biography to assist in their campaigns to recover and restore the mosque.\u000a      To mark the 80th anniversary of Quilliam's death in April 2012 the society\u000a      invited me to give the first of a series of annual Memorial lectures and\u000a      made an Honorary Award. This consisted of a Communication Award given to\u000a      me as the biographer of Sheikh Abdullah Quilliam, and an Engagement Award\u000a      to Bishop James Jones, a long time supporter of the Muslim community and\u000a      the Abdullah Quilliam Society. The communication award is offered to an\u000a      individual who has either communicated Islam or Muslim life and issues in\u000a      a positive or creative way to a non-Muslim audience (http:\/\/www.abdullahquilliam.com\/wp\/pdfs\/AQ-Awards-2012-screen.pdf).\u000aThe\u000a      Muslim book review site (kitaabun.com) states that the book is: `A Must\u000a      Read For All Muslims in Britain' (http:\/\/kitaabun.com\/shopping3\/product_info.php?products_id=3317).\u000a    In November 2012 I was invited to speak on Quilliam in Manchester and\u000a      give away the 2013 awards to the winners, the journalist Victoria Brittain\u000a      and the Liverpool Cily Councillor, Alan Dean. In addition I have been\u000a      interviewed on Quilliam and his contemporary significance by the Muslim\u000a      cable television networks (ATN Bangla UK, Muslim Television Ahmadiyya\u000a      (MTA) and Jordan Radio and TV). In 2013, I was interviewed by Malaysian\u000a      State Television on Abdullah Quiliam and the subsequent programme Syahadah\u000a      opened Ramadan in Malaysia on 9th July 2013, an extremely\u000a      unusual honour for a non-Muslim. On 28th June 2013, I took part\u000a      in Episode 4 of Britain's Secret Homes, where I was interviewed by\u000a      Rageh Omar in the ruins of Quilliam's mosque as part of ITV and English\u000a      Heritage series (9pm-10pm Friday nights) looking at houses across the\u000a      British Isles that have had an impact on British social life.

William Henry Quilliam, a local Liverpool solicitor, converted to\u000a      Islam in 1887 after returning from a visit to Morocco, taking on the name\u000a      Abdullah. Abdullah Quilliam established the mosque at No. 8 Brougham\u000a      Terrace and later bought the remainder of the terrace, to include a\u000a      school, printing press and science laboratory. The activities in this\u000a      house stirred mixed feeling within the local community but quickly became\u000a      the first centre of Islam in Britain.\u000a    Building upon twenty-five years of research that has explored the various\u000a      Islamic movements in Britain and their influence on the Muslim presence in\u000a      Britain throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries (see below), I\u000a      was aware that there was a Muslim community in Liverpool in the nineteenth\u000a      century. I was also aware that young second\/third generation British\u000a      Muslims were becoming aware of the founder of that community, William\u000a      Abdullah Quilliam, and drawing upon his life to discover an iconic\u000a      exemplar of being British and Muslim. In addition, the community in\u000a      Liverpool provided a narrative of belonging and identity that extended\u000a      further back in time than the post-WW2 South Asian migrations. I was\u000a      appointed to Liverpool Hope University in 2007 and, prior to commencing\u000a      this research, I had been drawn into public policy debates after the 2007\u000a      London bombings. I had been invited to attend meetings with the Secretary\u000a      of State for Communities and Local Government in the aftermath of the\u000a      bombings as part of the Government's PVE (Preventing Violent Extremism)\u000a      strategy. I was part of the team of `Theologians and Community Leaders'\u000a      chosen to focus on the training of Muslim faith leaders and remained an\u000a      advisor on PREVENT between 2008-2010.. I was appointed an advisor to the\u000a      DCLG's report `The training and development of Muslim Faith Leaders:\u000a      Current practice and future possibilities' published in 2010. These\u000a      initiatives resulted in invitations to the Foreign Office and 10 Downing\u000a      Street between 2008-2010. My initial drive for the research on Abdullah\u000a      Quilliam was to explore an example of a `model' Muslim faith leader. The\u000a      research explored primary and secondary historical sources to discover and\u000a      analyse the depth, breadth and significance of the Liverpool Muslim\u000a      Institute and its charismatic founder Sheikh Abdullah Quilliam (1888-1908)\u000a      and the further period (1908-1933) when Abdullah Quilliam operated under\u000a      the pseudonym of Henri de Leon with the World Muslim Mission in Woking.\u000a      The research was undertaken between 2007 and 2009, seeking for primary and\u000a      secondary sources to uncover the life and significance of Abdullah\u000a      Quilliam and the Muslim presence in Britain from 1888-1908, in particular.\u000a      The sources consisted of The Crescent, published weekly between\u000a      1893 and 1908 from Liverpool and distributed to over eighty Muslim\u000a      nations, and the Islamic World, a journal publication. These two\u000a      separate resources were sufficient to uncover Quilliam's activities, his\u000a      writings, the lives of the converts, the daily activities of the Islamic\u000a      centre in Liverpool, Quilliam's lecture tours, his contacts in the Muslim\u000a      world, his dealings with politicians in Britain, his relations with\u000a      Christian churches, the extent of his multi-culturalism, relations with\u000a      the Ottoman empire, and his fatwa issued in protest against various\u000a      conflicts between the British and Muslim nations, for example, North West\u000a      Frontier, Sudan, the Balkans. In 2010 the monograph Islam in Victorian\u000a        Britain was published by Kube Press. Due to Muslim public demand a\u000a      second work is underway that will present a volume of Abdullah Quilliam's\u000a      selected writings due to be published in 2014. In 2013 the first book will\u000a      reprint as the second edition. Although respected in academic circles, the\u000a      book's greatest demand has been with second generation British Musllims,\u000a      many of whom are community activists.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42785","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"99237","Name":"Iraq"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Since the invasion of 2003, Iraq's Mandaean community, present in the\u000d\u000a      south of the country for over two thousand years, has faced violent\u000d\u000a      persecution, including incidents of forced conversion to Islam, rape and\u000d\u000a      murder. A large majority has since fled the country; of an estimated\u000d\u000a      60-70,000 Mandaeans in Iraq in the early 1990s, only 5-7000 remain. In\u000d\u000a      Iran, similar, less violent persecution has nevertheless also resulted in\u000d\u000a      mass exodus. An Iranian law of 1985, for example, has seen Mandaeans\u000d\u000a      prohibited from fully participating in civil life for almost three\u000d\u000a      decades. Consequently, a large number of Mandaeans from both Iraq and Iran\u000d\u000a      have settled in the West, with around 1000 living in the UK. (7, below)\u000d\u000a    Hunter's extensive research into the history, language and culture of the\u000d\u000a      Mandaeans has equipped her with a unique understanding of the community\u000d\u000a      which has, in turn, enabled her to develop a strong rapport with its UK\u000d\u000a      members. Hunter has provided valuable support to the community by raising\u000d\u000a      awareness of their persecution in Iraq and Iran and their little\u000d\u000a      understood religion. This she has done in a number of contexts, including\u000d\u000a      asylum tribunals and public events. Hunter has acted as an expert witness\u000d\u000a      in 6 court hearings of Mandaeans seeking asylum in the UK, all of which\u000d\u000a      have been successful. In January 2008, Hunter gave evidence in support of\u000d\u000a      a young Iraqi Mandaean woman who had requested asylum in the UK on the\u000d\u000a      grounds that she would face violent persecution, even death, if forced to\u000d\u000a      return to Iraq. Hunter wrote a comprehensive letter outlining the dangers\u000d\u000a      faced by female Mandaeans in Iraq, as well as their historical and\u000d\u000a      religious background, and acted as expert witness in court. In the initial\u000d\u000a      court hearing, the judge approved the application based on Hunter's\u000d\u000a      evidence, although this decision was later overturned by the Home Office.\u000d\u000a      The case was referred to the High Court, where the applicant was again\u000d\u000a      granted permanent residency, with the judge citing Hunter's evidence as\u000d\u000a      having greatly informed their decision, such is also corroborated by\u000d\u000a      Trevor Wornham, solicitor for the applicant (1, below):\u000d\u000a    \"Erica was the only expert witness called; she is unique in her\u000d\u000a        expertise on the Mandaeans. She was very methodical in countering the\u000d\u000a        Home Office's arguments point by point. Her evidence was crucial to\u000d\u000a        winning the case.\"\u000d\u000a    Waleed al-Murrani, the applicant's father, further substantiates\u000d\u000a      Wornham's statement (2):\u000d\u000a    \"Erica Hunter's contribution was extremely helpful. She was one of the\u000d\u000a        major factors in the success of the whole case. The judge commented that\u000d\u000a        what she had written was convincing and true. My daughter will soon be\u000d\u000a        eligible to apply for British citizenship.\"\u000d\u000a    Hunter has also represented the Mandaean community at public events with\u000d\u000a      the aim of drawing attention to their plight in Iraq and Iran. In October\u000d\u000a      2012, Hunter presented on the Mandaean situation in Iraq and the UK's\u000d\u000a      asylum policy at the Minority Rights Group International Conference held\u000d\u000a      at the House of Lords, helping to make their case known in the UK and in\u000d\u000a      Europe. Moreover, Hunter participates with Mandaean community members in\u000d\u000a      conferences organised by ARAM at the University of Oxford, an independent,\u000d\u000a      non-profit-making society concerned with all aspects of Syro-Mesopotamian\u000d\u000a      cultures. She also invites their participation (presenting their current\u000d\u000a      situation) in the annual Christianity in Iraq Seminar Day, that she has\u000d\u000a      hosted since 2004 at SOAS. Hunter's efforts to involve Mandaeans in these\u000d\u000a      events has afforded them an arena in which to share their experiences,\u000d\u000a      while also bringing to light the social and cultural aspects of the\u000d\u000a      Mandaean community to a UK audience. Dr Layla al Roomi, spokesperson for\u000d\u000a      the Mandaean Human Rights Group (MHRG) who has presented at both\u000d\u000a      conferences, attests to the support Hunter has offered Mandaeans in the UK\u000d\u000a      since 2003, both through her research and her involvement in asylum cases\u000d\u000a      and events (4, 5):\u000d\u000a    \"Her research has been well read internationally which helps to put\u000d\u000a        the Mandaeans on the map of minority groups in Iraq. She has helped to\u000d\u000a        dispel ignorance about the Mandaeans and other gnostic religions. She\u000d\u000a        has been pivotal in opening up to the world this ancient religion which\u000d\u000a        is rarely heard of. She is very supportive and enjoys mixing with the\u000d\u000a        community, participating in many Mandaean social events, such as\u000d\u000a        baptisms. We are very grateful to her for taking up our case and\u000d\u000a        listening to our problems.\"\u000d\u000a    Hunter's continued endeavours to raise awareness of the suffering of\u000d\u000a      Mandaeans in their homelands and her involvement in several asylum cases\u000d\u000a      constitutes an important, concrete contribution to efforts to protect the\u000d\u000a      rights of Mandaeans in Iraq, Iran and the diaspora. As Nasir Shathur, an\u000d\u000a      Iraqi Mandaean refugee living in Wales and former member of the MHRG,\u000d\u000a      affirms (6): \"There is no doubt about it that in her involvement as an\u000d\u000a      expert witness Erica Hunter has saved the lives of many refugees.\"\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Mandaeism is a little understood minority religion whose followers have\u000d\u000a      resided for centuries in southern Iraq and Iran, where, particularly since\u000d\u000a      2003, they have faced rising levels of often violent persecution.

Hunter is fluent in a number of Semitic languages, ancient and\u000d\u000a      modern, including Aramaic, Mandaic, Syriac and Hebrew.\u000d\u000a    Much of Hunter's research focuses on the Gnostic Mandaeian religion and\u000d\u000a      its followers, an interest which stems from a year spent studying Mandaean\u000d\u000a      language and literature at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1982-1983.\u000d\u000a      Mandaeans are an ancient ethno-religious group indigenous to present-day\u000d\u000a      southern Iraq and Iran. Their scriptures are written exclusively in\u000d\u000a      Mandaic. Their religion, which recognises Adam, Noah and John the Baptist,\u000d\u000a      pre-dates both Islam and Christianity yet, unlike Christians and Jews, the\u000d\u000a      Mandaeans are not seen by Islam as `peoples of the book' and thus face\u000d\u000a      severe persecution in their homelands.\u000d\u000a    Hunter's first encounters with Mandaean communities occurred when, as\u000d\u000a      Gertrude Bell Fellow of the British School of Archaeology in Iraq,\u000d\u000a      1989-1991, she worked on the 700-odd collection of incantation bowls\u000d\u000a      (Aramaic, Mandaic and Syriac) in the Iraq Museum, Baghdad. In 2000 and\u000d\u000a      2002, Hunter delivered public lectures, at the request of Mandaean elders,\u000d\u000a      at the Mandi (Mandaean place of worship) in Baghdad, outlining her\u000d\u000a      research on the history and development of the community.\u000d\u000a    Her continued research on Mandaic incantation bowls, housed in the Iraq\u000d\u000a      Museum and the British Museum, has enabled her to establish that the\u000d\u000a      Mandaeans in the 6th-8th centuries formed a sizeable\u000d\u000a      community, possibly 25%-30% of the population of southern Mesopotamia.\u000d\u000a      This figure contrasts with many scholars' assumptions of the Mandaeans as\u000d\u000a      a tiny, Gnostic splinter group (their modern situation). Her work on\u000d\u000a      Mandaean incantation bowls excavated in Nippur in 1989, shows that Mandaic\u000d\u000a      and Aramaic groups did not live in enclaves, findings presented in output\u000d\u000a      a. She also illustrates the textual contiguity between Mandaean and Jewish\u000d\u000a      Hekhalot literature, a very early Jewish literary genre related to visions\u000d\u000a      of the heavenly ascent of Enoch and other Biblical figures (which later\u000d\u000a      informed the Kabbalah school of thought), thus contributing to the\u000d\u000a      on-going debate about the community's purported `origins' in Palestine.\u000d\u000a    In her pioneering work on the typology of Mandaic incantation bowls,\u000d\u000a      Hunter also upholds the integration of the community within the larger\u000d\u000a      Sassanian repertoire of material culture, whilst her analysis of\u000d\u000a      iconography indicates that the Mandaeans had acquired, by the 6th-8th\u000d\u000a      centuries, the cultural attributes of a distinctive community in\u000d\u000a      Mesopotamia (also output a). She has also examined the community's\u000d\u000a      distinctive linguistic traits (output b). In her latest publication,\u000d\u000a      output c, Hunter demonstrates the embedding of `classic' Mesopotamian\u000d\u000a      influences within Mandaean religious literature, indicative of their wider\u000d\u000a      acculturation within the Tigris-Euphrates region.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43374","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1282988","Name":"Nepal"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Through a series of conference papers, publications, appointments to\u000a      leading international organizations and community-based research projects,\u000a      Tuladhar-Douglas' research has generated impact by bringing a new\u000a      awareness to NGO's of cultural diversity and its implications into their\u000a      processes of policy making regarding sacred landscapes, hence improving\u000a      the protection of the biodiversity of these sites. This impact has arisen\u000a      from research on the theoretical, methodological and practical\u000a      implications of biocultural diversity and the obstacles to its\u000a      understanding imposed by secular norms of personhood, and the down-grading\u000a      of practices to the `religious'.\u000a    Much of the cultural diversity in these landscapes is bracketed by\u000a      conservation NGOs as `religious' (and undervalued as a result). Yet it is\u000a      exactly those social practices involving non-human persons that have the\u000a      strongest impact on sustainable biodiversity. For example, in a landscape\u000a      where trees are respected, where one must gain permission from medicinal\u000a      plants before harvesting them, and where animals are connected to humans\u000a      through kinship relations, social practices may tend to restrict excessive\u000a      harvesting and unsustainable extraction. However, if such behaviour is\u000a      downgraded to the category `religion' then it is, by definition, not\u000a      considered accessible to `secular' conservation management practices.\u000a      Furthermore, such secular discourse and assumptions are a mark of western\u000a      privilege, leading conservation managers recruited from local communities\u000a      to disparage local values in order to bolster their authority. The\u000a      research of Tuladhar-Douglas challenges this status quo and\u000a      enables a recognition of such diversity, thereby rendering conservation\u000a      plans in sacred sites intelligible to all parties (both for indigenous\u000a      peoples in relation to conservation NGOs, and for conservation NGOs in\u000a      relation to indigenous peoples) through his emphasis on the importance of\u000a      the religious thought of indigenous peoples in relation to their\u000a      landscapes and the different understandings of personhood used by\u000a      stakeholders. The recognition of the importance of local practices and\u000a      beliefs for conservation transforms traditional peoples living in\u000a      conservation sites from paper stakeholders into genuine participants. The\u000a      impact of these insights enriches the models used for conservation\u000a      management.\u000a    Having established in his fieldwork the importance of cultural variation\u000a      and the conceptualization of `personhood' in conservation work, Tuladhar-Douglas\u000a      was recruited to the IUCN in 2010. The IUCN supports scientific research\u000a      globally and brings governments, NGOs, UN agencies, companies and local\u000a      communities together to develop and implement policy. The IUCN is the\u000a      world's oldest and largest global environmental network, with more than\u000a      1,000 government and NGO member organizations, and almost 11,000 volunteer\u000a      scientists in more than 160 countries. In 2008, its revenue was 133\u000a      million CHF. Tuladhar-Douglas was asked to use his research to\u000a      move the working group on Cultural and Spiritual Values of Protected Areas\u000a      (CSVPA) past a na&#239;ve faith-or-secular model of sacred landscapes. CSVPA\u000a      agreed to co-sponsor the Florida conference on ethnobiology and religion,\u000a      and its output (a 2013 special issue of Religion Nature and Culture,\u000a      see above) is now being used by IUCN staff to revise policy. Documents\u000a      from the symposium are being used in the run-up to the WILD 10 conference\u000a      in Salamanca, and in preparing for the World Parks Congress in Sydney in\u000a      2014.\u000a    The effect of Tuladhar-Douglas' research into conservation and\u000a      indigenous peoples on public policy has led to five discrete shifts in\u000a      conservation management:\u000a      a) Tuladhar-Douglas' research has driven critical reflection\u000a      within Cultural and Spiritual Values of Protected Areas (CSVPA). Due to Tuladhar-Douglas'\u000a      work the CSVPA steering group have agreed to rethink the CSVPA's\u000a      fundamental remit, moving away from the language of `values' and towards a\u000a      less patronising understanding of traditional and local knowledge. At the\u000a      same time, Tuladhar-Douglas, on the basis of these research\u000a      insights, helped negotiate an agreement between UNESCO and IUCN that\u000a      establishes CSVPA as the group that links cultural and biological\u000a      diversity in heritage site assessments.\u000a    b) As a result of his Himalayan research and work on montane social\u000a      science, in 2011 Tuladhar-Douglas was appointed a visiting\u000a      scientist at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development\u000a      (ICIMOD), an international NGO working in all seven countries of the\u000a      Himalayan region. While at ICIMOD he has been closely involved in\u000a      trans-boundary landscape projects, especially the Kailash Sacred Landscape\u000a      Initiative. This landscape covers a large and complex protected area of\u000a      31,175 square kilometres in China, India and Nepal. It is orientated\u000a      around Mount Kailash, sacred to nearly a billion people in multiple\u000a      traditions (Buddhist, Jain, Hindu and Bon), and the source of the Ganges,\u000a      Sutlej and Indus rivers. Tuladhar-Douglas' work has been used to\u000a      clarify project planning for sacred sites; to train staff in methods to\u000a      expose causal links between biological and cultural diversity; and, with\u000a      ICIMOD staff and representatives of three governments, to establish\u000a      methods for discovering culturally relevant and commensurable indicators\u000a      of biocultural diversity to measure the ecological health of the Kailash\u000a      region over time.\u000a    c) Prior to the 2010 Perth Mountains conference, Tuladhar-Douglas\u000a      was recruited to the GLORIA project (a long-term study of montane\u000a      biodiversity change due to global warming) to help ecologists learn to\u000a      work with traditional knowledge holders to achieve a better picture of how\u000a      changing climate affects montane ecosystems. Discussions at the 2010\u000a      meeting resulted in the formal agreement to include social research\u000a      protocols, arising from Tuladhar-Douglas' research, in the GLORIA\u000a      project manuals&#8212;increasing both the accuracy and the relevance of\u000a      GLORIA's work in some 200 mountain areas worldwide (see GLORIA's draft\u000a      field manual version 5, which for the first time includes assessment of\u000a      traditional knowledge, for which Tuladhar-Douglas' research has\u000a      argued: http:\/\/www.gloria.ac.at\/?a=20).\u000a    d) Tuladhar-Douglas' research insights have caused conservation\u000a      professionals to reconsider assumptions, including: that religion is about\u000a      belief; that there are no indigenous Buddhists; that any community has a\u000a      single religious identity; and that sacred sites are intrinsically\u000a      biodiverse. His research has led directly to changes in the next edition\u000a      of published guidelines for protected area managers: the 2008 edition of\u000a      Sacred Natural Sites: Guidelines for Protected Area Managers is currently\u000a      under revision in light of Tuladhar-Douglas' findings. These\u000a      changes have already led to more involvement of indigenous peoples in\u000a      conservation work: they have led to open conversations between indigenous\u000a      leaders and protected area managers, as can be seen in the meetings in\u000a      2011 in Nepal between TILCEPA (the Strategic Direction on Governance,\u000a      Communities, Equity and Livelihood Rights in Relation to Protected Areas)\u000a      and indigenous leaders; engagements between indigenous Tamang and Sherpa\u000a      leaders and protected area managers; and increased indigenous\u000a      participation at WIN 2013 &#8212; a major indigenous forum as part of the\u000a      lead-in to the World Parks Congress 2014, which will provide opportunity\u000a      for indigenous peoples and conservationists to come together, connect and\u000a      share stories and experiences. The apex of these changes can be seen in\u000a      eight traditional stewards of sacred sites being invited to participate as\u000a      part of the Sacred Natural Sites initiative, and asked to provide input\u000a      for the Theme on Indigenous Peoples, Local Communities, Equity and\u000a      Protected Areas (TILCEPA) mountains working group at the 2012 World\u000a      Conservation Congress at Jeju.\u000a    e) Because of the effect of Tuladhar-Douglas' research on\u000a      the policy of the IUCN on conservation work with traditional communities,\u000a      worldwide cooperation among mountain communities, traditional stewards and\u000a      ecologists has begun to create a framework within which local knowledge is\u000a      accepted as an equal partner in conversation with secular experts at world\u000a      forums. For example, while working with the CVSPA, Tuladhar-Douglas\u000a      was recruited, because of his work on indigenous notions of personhood in\u000a      sacred landscapes, as a commissioner in the Commission on Environment,\u000a      Equity and Social Policy (CEESP) and the World Commission on Protected\u000a      Areas (WCPA). At the Jeju conference, he was appointed co-chair of the\u000a      Mountains working group within TILCEPA and, together with Miriam Torres\u000a      and Ed Birnbaum, established a new Mountain Trails Network that co-ordinates biocultural stewardship of long-range heritage trails on every\u000a      inhabited continent. As a result of Tuladhar-Douglas' research,\u000a      representatives from the Himalayas and the Andes are already collaborating\u000a      on questions of indigenous knowledge and tenure, landscape connectivity,\u000a      and ecotourism. The impact of this is ongoing: the TILCEPA Mountains\u000a      working group will make a major presentation at the 2014 World Parks\u000a      Congress highlighting traditional trade routes and new trails in the\u000a      Appalachians, Altai Shan, Andes, Himalayas, and Ruwenzoris.\u000a    Beneficiaries of this research include: the international organizations\u000a      working towards the conservation of the most fragile ecosystems on the\u000a      planet IUCN (CSVPA, TILCEPA, CEESP, WCPA, SSG); ICIMOD; and the\u000a      communities living in sacred landscapes and montane protected areas\u000a      worldwide (human or otherwise) &#8212; especially Himalayan indigenous\u000a      communities and traditional stewards of sacred landscapes.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research by Dr William Tuladhar-Douglas on biocultural diversity\u000a      and religion in sacred landscapes in the Himalayas has had significant\u000a      impact on conservation policy and practices for ecosystems in the\u000a      Himalayas. His research has reinvigorated debate about culturally\u000a      appropriate modes of engagement and challenged the concept of `religion'\u000a      that conservationists use in their work with indigenous communities. This\u000a      is particularly the case in terms of concepts of personhood which are held\u000a      by certain indigenous peoples in relation to non-human creatures, and the\u000a      ways in which traditional practices engage with non-human persons in the\u000a      form of animals, plants and deities. Through directly influencing the\u000a      policy and practice of the World Conservation Union (the leading\u000a      international body in world conservation), Tuladhar-Douglas'\u000a      research has led to culturally appropriate understandings of `personhood'\u000a      being recovered into the management of protected areas. This has changed\u000a      the interplay between local cultural variation, threats to biodiversity,\u000a      indigenous perspectives and international conservation norms. Furthermore,\u000a      his work has determined that there is greater capacity to engage with\u000a      traditional peoples in conservation, helping to transform them from being\u000a      `paper stakeholders' to genuine participants. The resulting policy changes\u000a      are likely to help achieve resilient and successfully protected sites.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Aberdeen\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Aberdeen (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Aberdeen","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"Scotland","UKPRN":10007783}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"4155751","Name":"Florida"},{"GeoNamesId":"2063523","Name":"Perth"},{"GeoNamesId":"2147714","Name":"Sydney"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1) Tuladhar-Douglas, W. 2008. `The use of bats as medicine among the\u000a      Newars of Nepal' Ethnobiology, 28(1), 68-91.\u000a    \u000a\u000a2) Tuladhar-Douglas, W. 2010. `Collusion and bickering: landscape,\u000a      religion and ethnicity in the central Himalayas' Contemporary South\u000a        Asia, 18(3), 319-32.\u000a    \u000a\u000a3) Tuladhar-Douglas, W. 2012.

While anthropology is said to be the study of human\u000a      societies, local communities regard a wide and variable range of non-human\u000a      persons to be legitimate social agents: concepts of personhood simply do\u000a      not equate straightforwardly with certain western assumptions about the\u000a      distinction and interaction between human and non-human agents. In the\u000a      central Himalayas, for example, the social processes underlying religious\u000a      identity were founded in rituals and narratives that required action by\u000a      goats, gods and trees as much as they did humans.\u000a    However, `secular' bodies (such as conservation NGOs) tend to draw on\u000a      certain western secular assumptions to explain this form of interaction by\u000a      using the terminology of `religion'. This category is not value neutral:\u000a      relegating non-human persons to the category of religion is a defensive\u000a      rhetorical strategy rather than an empirically grounded claim in relation\u000a      to the traditional communities themselves. Indeed, the claim that humans\u000a      are the only persons (`human exceptionalism') is part of secularist\u000a      ideology: it is a feature of international conservation and development\u000a      work, which depends on the supposed neutrality of `secular' language to\u000a      achieve international agreements. The hidden assumptions of secularist\u000a      humanism, however, are not shared by the members of the traditional\u000a      communities where the conservation work is undertaken, and the\u000a      difficulties imposed by secularist norms become especially challenging\u000a      when dealing with conservation projects in sacred landscapes.\u000a    This presents a critical challenge for conservation efforts because\u000a      conservation landscapes are often inhabited by local or indigenous\u000a      communities who use very different frameworks to understand their\u000a      landscapes: their traditional medical, agricultural and ritual knowledge\u000a      embody an understanding of local flora and fauna. Thus, there are strong\u000a      links between ecosystem health and the social practices of the traditional\u000a      communities that live there &#8212; a form of `mutualism' between human and non-\u000a      human `persons'. The inconsistency between the language and\u000a      conceptualization of secular agencies (such as conservation NGOs) and that\u000a      of indigenous peoples suggests that human exceptionalism needs to be\u000a      recognized as a particular, culture-bound, attitude within a spectrum of\u000a      possibilities; other ways of understanding and describing the environment\u000a      in which conservation is taking place need to be found and explored in\u000a      order to respect, involve and include indigenous peoples (in terms that\u000a      are culturally relevant to them) in the conservation of the sacred\u000a      landscapes they inhabit.\u000a    Around 2001, Tuladhar-Douglas came to the conclusion that\u000a      ethnobiology (a reflexive, practical and collaborative discipline that\u000a      involves indigenous intellectuals, stewards and healers as collaborators)\u000a      offered a response to this challenge. It allowed an opportunity for\u000a      rigorous methods and results that would be relevant to conservation\u000a      biologists while also challenging these implicit secularist assumptions in\u000a      relation to indigenous knowledge. In pursuit of the link between\u000a      ethnobiology and anthropology of religion in the Himalayan region, in 2005\u000a      Tuladhar-Douglas teamed up with Mark Watson of the Royal Botanic\u000a      Gardens in Edinburgh to establish a transdisciplinary research group, the\u000a      Scottish Centre for Himalayan Research (SCHR). The SCHR has been a\u000a      platform for the critical study of eco-social interactions. The 2009\u000a      Edinburgh SCHR conference, `Health in a Suffering Landscape', overtly\u000a      linked questions of climate science, the living landscape, and ethics.\u000a      This research not only addressed the problems of secularist assumptions\u000a      about religion and understandings of personhood, but also enabled\u000a      indigenous knowledge systems to be engaged, and practices by\u000a      conservationists to be undertaken sensitively in relation to traditional\u000a      peoples in areas where conservation is enacted.\u000a    By 2010, Tuladhar-Douglas' work on bats was well-received among\u000a      ethnobiologists and his work on historical anthropology of sacred sites\u000a      was fundamental to Himalayan anthropology. In 2010, Tuladhar-Douglas\u000a      convened a panel of international academics on `Biocultural diversity and\u000a      montane social science' in the Mountains II conference at Perth. In that\u000a      same year, Tuladhar-Douglas, together with Rick Stepp and Bron\u000a      Tylor (both University of Florida), organized an international conference\u000a      at the University of Florida that yoked ethnobiology and anthropology of\u000a      religion to develop useful tools or case studies for working with\u000a      indigenous peoples in conservation work in areas of sacred landscapes. The\u000a      insights derived from these collaborations were refined and applied\u000a      through meetings with sacred site managers and other IUCN (the World\u000a      Conservation Union) officials at the World Conservation Congress in Jeju,\u000a      and changed how protected sites that claim `sacred status' as part of\u000a      their cultural inventory are proposed, bounded and monitored.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43375","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Impacts of this research from Aberdeen on church leadership can be seen\u000d\u000a      in the following ways:\u000d\u000a    A. McDonaldization The body of research arising from Drane's\u000d\u000a      primary research insight into the\u000d\u000a      relationship between the McDonaldization thesis and the church (2000) has\u000d\u000a      significantly impacted\u000d\u000a      church leadership in the Anglican and Methodist Churches, as well as the\u000d\u000a      Church of Scotland. The\u000d\u000a      diagnosis of the failings of contemporary ecclesial praxis which this\u000d\u000a      research provided has been\u000d\u000a      central to the Fresh Expressions of Church Movement, and its rethought\u000d\u000a      modes of ministry. This\u000d\u000a      has led to four principal pathways to impact in relation to church\u000d\u000a      leadership. The mechanism by\u000d\u000a      which this has come about is the effect of Drane's research on the\u000d\u000a      Fresh Expressions of Church \/\u000d\u000a      Emerging Church movement in the UK, USA and Australia, establishing him as\u000d\u000a      a leading scholar\u000d\u000a      and advisor for this international ecclesial movement.\u000d\u000a    (1.) Drane is no longer a university academic, but is now\u000d\u000a      (2004-present), on the basis of his\u000d\u000a      research and the impact it generates, a self-employed consultant working\u000d\u000a      with churches of many\u000d\u000a      different denominations throughout the United Kingdom as well as\u000d\u000a      internationally. As part of this\u000d\u000a      work, he teaches on spirituality and fresh expressions as a consultant for\u000d\u000a      a number of seminaries\u000d\u000a      (including Fuller Seminary, California and St John's College Durham),\u000d\u000a      training church leaders. The\u000d\u000a      insights in his consultancy and teaching are underpinned by his research\u000d\u000a      insights into\u000d\u000a      McDonaldization culture and church leadership. That Drane's\u000d\u000a      research has led him to be an\u000d\u000a      independent consultant on church leadership employed by church and\u000d\u000a      para-church organizations\u000d\u000a      internationally demonstrates the impact of his research on the church.\u000d\u000a    (2.) As a result of his research into the conditions in which the\u000d\u000a      church exists and the nature of a\u000d\u000a      McDonaldized culture, Drane was appointed to a significant\u000d\u000a      leadership role within the Church of\u000d\u000a      England which is focused on addressing decline in church attendance and\u000d\u000a      renewing and\u000d\u000a      reinvigorating the theory and practice relating to mission in the church.\u000d\u000a      He has been co-chair of the\u000d\u000a      Mission Theology Advisory Group (jointly sponsored by the Mission &amp;\u000d\u000a      Public Policy Committee of\u000d\u000a      the Archbishops' Council of the Church of England and by the Global\u000d\u000a      Mission Network of Churches\u000d\u000a      Together in Britain and Ireland) since 2002, with ongoing impact through\u000d\u000a      this census period. This\u000d\u000a      group is a partnership between the Church of England's Mission and Public\u000d\u000a      Affairs Division and the\u000d\u000a      Churches' Commission on Mission of Churches Together in Britain and\u000d\u000a      Ireland. MTAG offers\u000d\u000a      advice to the churches on matters affecting the mission of the whole\u000d\u000a      Church. Its particular focus is\u000d\u000a      on the relationship between the gospel and western culture, as the context\u000d\u000a      in which the gospel is\u000d\u000a      proclaimed in the UK; this is the focused area of Drane's research\u000d\u000a      insights. The approach of MTAG\u000d\u000a      arises directly from Drane's research insights into the church and\u000d\u000a      contemporary culture. For\u000d\u000a      example, included in this work has been the establishment of a website\u000d\u000a      `Spiritual Journeys'\u000d\u000a      (http:\/\/www.spiritualjourneys.org.uk\/ ), created by MTAG which reports to\u000d\u000a      be aimed at everyone\u000d\u000a      who wants to explore their spiritual journey or the spiritual journeys of\u000d\u000a      others; this draws on\u000d\u000a      Drane's research into spirituality and the church. The website\u000d\u000a      offers materials for visitors to the site\u000d\u000a      to explore, as well as resources for practising Christians (both lay and\u000d\u000a      ordained). Its aim is to\u000d\u000a      provide members of Christian communities with the opportunity to learn\u000d\u000a      more about their own\u000d\u000a      traditions of spirituality and explore those of others: this is clearly\u000d\u000a      contrary to the spirituality of a\u000d\u000a      McDonaldized church, responding to his critiques of predictability and\u000d\u000a      calculability.\u000d\u000a    (3.) Because of his research insights on McDonaldized ecclesial\u000d\u000a      cultures and practices of ministry\u000d\u000a      and because of his work on church and contemporary culture, Drane\u000d\u000a      was appointed as a member\u000d\u000a      of the board of Mission Shaped Ministry, which is part of the Fresh\u000d\u000a      Expressions initiative of the\u000d\u000a      Church of England and the Methodist Church. His appointment was to utilize\u000d\u000a      his research into how\u000d\u000a      to find new and creative ways to explore what it means to be a community\u000d\u000a      of the church beyond\u000d\u000a      the traditional parish system, such as in discussion groups meeting in\u000d\u000a      coffee shops; through arts\u000d\u000a      events; etc. He has engaged in this work throughout the census period. In\u000d\u000a      this role, Drane's\u000d\u000a      research has been used to provide training days and in syllabus formation\u000d\u000a      for church leaders\u000d\u000a      exploring new patterns of ministry. Drane currently teaches church\u000d\u000a      leaders across the UK, using\u000d\u000a      his research and applying it directly to church communities. Mission\u000d\u000a        Shaped Ministry is at present\u000d\u000a      running ecumenically in over 50 centres across the UK with more than 2000\u000d\u000a      students enrolled. The\u000d\u000a      one-year, part-time course seeks to take participants on a learning\u000d\u000a      journey as part of a supportive\u000d\u000a      community, in contradistinction to what Drane's research\u000d\u000a      understood to be McDonaldized ecclesial\u000d\u000a      cultures. In doing this, the course trains clergy for leadership in Fresh\u000d\u000a      Expressions of Church.\u000d\u000a      Fresh Expressions of Church, which Drane's research in part led\u000d\u000a      to, accounts for about 6% of\u000d\u000a      Anglican and Methodist churches in the UK, so the effect of this work is\u000d\u000a      widespread.\u000d\u000a    (4.) With Olive Fleming Drane, Drane's research has been\u000d\u000a      used in his report commissioned by the\u000d\u000a      Church of Scotland, Reformed, Reforming, Emerging, and Experimenting\u000d\u000a      (2011). This report offers\u000d\u000a      an account by the commissioners of why Drane was appointed,\u000d\u000a      highlighting his research in relation\u000d\u000a      to the appointment and the task required from the church. The report\u000d\u000a      highlights the take-up and\u000d\u000a      development of the Mission Shaped Ministry course. This Report was\u000d\u000a      commissioned by a Joint\u000d\u000a      Working Party of the Ministries Council and the Mission, and adopted in\u000d\u000a      May 2011. It explores\u000d\u000a      ways to re-engage with the contemporary culture, and challenges patterns\u000d\u000a      of ministry, offering\u000d\u000a      constructive suggestions for how these might be better improved.\u000d\u000a    B. Biblical Models of Leadership: Clarke's\u000d\u000a      historical and theological research into New\u000d\u000a      Testament texts and first-century contexts has key implications for the\u000d\u000a      development of new and\u000d\u000a      nurture of existing local church communities in semi-rural or\u000d\u000a      sparsely-populated rural areas of\u000d\u000a      Scotland. Clarke's research has been used in a Scottish culture, in which\u000d\u000a      critiques of hierarchy and\u000d\u000a      Baptist models of congregationalism have resulted in the Baptist Union of\u000d\u000a      Scotland's perception of\u000d\u000a      a crisis of confidence about leadership in churches; widespread\u000d\u000a      dysfunctionality among leaders;\u000d\u000a      and uncertainty about what characterizes a `healthy' community. Models and\u000d\u000a      expectations of\u000d\u000a      leadership have not adapted to declining numbers within congregations.\u000d\u000a      Clarke's work has been\u000d\u000a      applied as directly relevant to contemporary situations, especially for\u000d\u000a      those for whom biblical\u000d\u000a      models provide the ultimate authority of forms and practice, and has also\u000d\u000a      been used indirectly to\u000d\u000a      stimulate reflection and change in Scottish Baptist churches. Two examples\u000d\u000a      illustrate this:\u000d\u000a    (1.) Baptist Union of Scotland &#8212; national discussions. As\u000d\u000a      a result of his research insights into the\u000d\u000a      forms and practices of leadership in the earliest church communities, Clarke\u000d\u000a      was involved in\u000d\u000a      Baptist Union of Scotland `Leadership Consultations, 1 and 2' (Aug and Dec\u000d\u000a      2006). The focus was\u000d\u000a      on exploring what biblical values should shape leadership; defining a\u000d\u000a      distinctly Baptist\u000d\u000a      understanding of leadership; exploring the tension between strong\u000d\u000a      leadership and\u000d\u000a      congregationalism; and the shape of pastoral leadership in a\u000d\u000a      post-Christendom world. This\u000d\u000a      outcome provided a route to impact through the following three areas\u000d\u000a      during the REF census\u000d\u000a      period, and in each of these three instances, Clarke's research\u000d\u000a      made a distinct and material\u000d\u000a      contribution (both directly and indirectly) to the impact taking place,\u000d\u000a      such that the impact would not\u000d\u000a      have occurred or would have been significantly reduced without the\u000d\u000a      contribution of that research:\u000d\u000a    a. a collection of essays (commissioned by the Baptist Union):\u000d\u000a      Andrew Rollinson (ed.),\u000d\u000a      Transforming Leadership: Essays Exploring Leadership in a Baptist\u000d\u000a        Context (Glasgow: Baptist\u000d\u000a      Union of Scotland, 2008). These were circulated to all Scottish Baptist\u000d\u000a      churches, and have been\u000d\u000a      used as the formal basis for directing leadership in Scottish Baptist\u000d\u000a      settings, thereby enabling the\u000d\u000a      outcome (the publication) to have formal impact in ecclesial leadership\u000d\u000a      settings.\u000d\u000a    b. Clarke delivering a public lecture entitled `Biblical\u000d\u000a      Reflections on Christian Leadership' at a\u000d\u000a      series of national seminars on `Transforming Leadership', organized by the\u000d\u000a      Baptist Union of\u000d\u000a      Scotland (March\/April 2008). The work in this lecture arises from research\u000d\u000a      for a seminar entitled,\u000d\u000a      `Theological Reflections on Christian Leadership', delivered at the\u000d\u000a      national Baptist Union of\u000d\u000a      Scotland Annual Assembly (Nov 2007); DVD and MP3 of the lecture were made\u000d\u000a      available.\u000d\u000a    c. The Scottish Baptist College developing a new module on church\u000d\u000a      leadership, drawing from the\u000d\u000a      insights of Clarke's research.\u000d\u000a    (2.) A Specific Church Plant: Research, which subsequently\u000d\u000a      appeared in Clarke's 2008\u000d\u000a      monograph (A Pauline Theology of Church Leadership), was\u000d\u000a      foundational to establishing an\u000d\u000a      innovative set of principles of ecclesiology and models of ministry for a\u000d\u000a      pioneering church plant,\u000d\u000a      under the auspices of the Baptist Union of Scotland in September 2007\u000d\u000a      [http:\/\/www.gariochchurch.org.uk]. In particular, the Pauline focus on\u000d\u000a      multiple domestic settings for\u000d\u000a      all-age community life and worship (a key insight of Clarke's\u000d\u000a      research) was foundational, and\u000d\u000a      impinged on defining a fresh approach to the nature and ethos of local\u000d\u000a      church leadership. This\u000d\u000a      church model is regarded as a flagship within the Baptist Union of\u000d\u000a      Scotland. It provides an\u000d\u000a      alternative to traditional focus on large, plenary Sunday services, with\u000d\u000a      age-specific content, in\u000d\u000a      dedicated worship venues.\u000d\u000a    Continuing Work in Aberdeen on Church Leadership:\u000d\u000a      The University of Aberdeen continues to\u000d\u000a      support research into leadership in the church, providing further avenues\u000d\u000a      towards impact in this\u000d\u000a      area, and sustaining continued research in ecclesiastical polity. This is\u000d\u000a      seen in Clarke's continued\u000d\u000a      presence in the department, along with the appointments of Brittain\u000d\u000a      (2007-), Greggs (2011-) and\u000d\u000a      Nimmo (2013-). On the basis of his research into homosexuality in\u000d\u000a      the church, Brittain is a\u000d\u000a      member of the Faith and Order working group of the Episcopal Church of\u000d\u000a      Scotland, which is\u000d\u000a      working on church leadership and sexuality in the Anglican Communion. His\u000d\u000a      research has led to\u000d\u000a      his being invited to speak on BBC Scotland on conflict over moral issues\u000d\u000a      in the Church of Scotland.\u000d\u000a      Nimmo's research has contributed to his work with the Church of\u000d\u000a      Scotland Working Group on\u000d\u000a      Issues in Human Sexuality, and to his ecumenical work with the Joint\u000d\u000a      Doctrine Commission of the\u000d\u000a      Church of Scotland and the Roman Catholic Church. Greggs' research\u000d\u000a      in ecclesiology led to his\u000d\u000a      appointment as a Visiting Professor at St Mellitus College (a new Anglican\u000d\u000a      training college focused\u000d\u000a      on church leadership), London, where he helps in the training of Anglican\u000d\u000a      ministers.

McDonaldization:\u000d\u000a      In his research into the nature of the\u000d\u000a      contemporary church, Drane (2000) applies the four characteristics\u000d\u000a      of Ritzer's McDonaldization\u000d\u000a      thesis to the Christian Church. He finds these four characteristics\u000d\u000a      manifest in a large number of\u000d\u000a      churches. He consequently argues that these churches have become\u000d\u000a      McDonaldized: they have\u000d\u000a      become indistinguishable from consumer culture. Drane describes\u000d\u000a      the identity of these churches\u000d\u000a      and their leadership in detail in relation to four features: efficiency\u000d\u000a      (which confuses efficient\u000d\u000a      business with real human issues and authentic spirituality); calculability\u000d\u000a      (sixty-minute packaged\u000d\u000a      services rather than meaningful periods of time to engage in worship of\u000d\u000a      God and to connect with\u000d\u000a      the community of other Christians); predictability (routinized worship\u000d\u000a      which stifles creativity and\u000d\u000a      fresh engagements with God); and control (whether it is through `sound'\u000d\u000a      theology, crusade\u000d\u000a      evangelists or episcopal dictatorships). These four insights questioned\u000d\u000a      the models of church\u000d\u000a      leadership that are operative in the church, and their effectiveness for\u000d\u000a      serving the church in the\u000d\u000a      contemporary setting. This foundational research on McDonaldization gave\u000d\u000a      rise to further work,\u000d\u000a      which has created further avenues towards impact from the research carried\u000d\u000a      out at Aberdeen. We\u000d\u000a      see an example of this in Do Christians Know How to be Spiritual?: The\u000d\u000a        Rise of New Spirituality\u000d\u000a        and the Mission of the Church (2005), which offers a theological\u000d\u000a      reflection on the 'New Age'\u000d\u000a      phenomenon, focusing on how the Christian community can connect with\u000d\u000a      spiritual seekers in the\u000d\u000a      contemporary setting. In the book, Drane considers what an\u000d\u000a      effective church might be like for the\u000d\u000a      post-modern culture of the twenty-first century. Furthermore, stemming\u000d\u000a      from the diagnosis offered\u000d\u000a      by his research on McDonaldization (and particularly ch. 8 on the\u000d\u000a      future of the church), Drane\u000d\u000a      published in 2008, After McDonaldization which directly utilizes\u000d\u000a      his research at Aberdeen on the\u000d\u000a      McDonaldization thesis to provide the basis for a reinvigorated style of\u000d\u000a      ministry and mission.\u000d\u000a    B.) Biblical Models of Leadership: Clarke's\u000d\u000a      research focus on New Testament aspects of church\u000d\u000a      leadership includes consideration of structure, authority, status, power,\u000d\u000a      equality\/hierarchy, and the\u000d\u000a      task and tools of local church leadership (including persuasion and the\u000d\u000a      nature of discipline). The\u000d\u000a      research entails both: a) a social-historical, descriptive\u000d\u000a      investigation of first-century patterns of\u000d\u000a      community leadership (in the Graeco-Roman cities, the Romany colonies,\u000d\u000a      voluntary associations\u000d\u000a      [cf. trade unions], synagogues, and family\/domestic contexts) in\u000d\u000a      comparison with first-century\u000d\u000a      positive and negative depictions of church leadership; and, b) a\u000d\u000a      constructive, exegetical-theological\u000d\u000a      exploration of local church leadership from the New Testament Pauline\u000d\u000a      corpus. Key findings\u000d\u000a      include an emphasis on the significance of the domestic context within the\u000d\u000a      New Testament in its\u000d\u000a      teaching about and practices of church leadership &#8212; with significant\u000d\u000a      implications for the role of\u000d\u000a      women; the place of children; the nature of discipline; the importance of\u000d\u000a      community meals; the\u000d\u000a      context for, and consequently the nature of, teaching and worship; the\u000d\u000a      size of church communities;\u000d\u000a      and the importance for effective leadership of `shared lives'.\u000d\u000a    Dates research was carried out: The foundational research and key\u000d\u000a      research insights by Drane on\u000d\u000a      McDonaldization (2000) and the church and on spirituality (1999) were\u000d\u000a      carried out in Aberdeen\u000d\u000a      during Drane's time as a senior lecturer in practical theology\u000d\u000a      (1998-2004). Clarke (1995-) carried\u000d\u000a      out his research into church leadership as senior lecturer in New\u000d\u000a      Testament Studies at Aberdeen.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43376","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The publication of the book SAMHC led to two distinct streams of\u000d\u000a      impact. The first relates to the\u000d\u000a      impact of the ethos and approach of the research through The Kairos Forum\u000d\u000a      for People with\u000d\u000a      Intellectual or Cognitive Disabilities; the second through chaplaincy\u000d\u000a      provision in GP practices.\u000d\u000a    A. Learning Disability Impact: The Kairos Forum Impact from\u000d\u000a      SAMHC in relation to\u000d\u000a      intellectual disability has come about primarily through the formation and\u000d\u000a      work of The Kairos Forum\u000d\u000a      for People with Intellectual or Cognitive Disabilities. The route to\u000d\u000a      impact from this underpinning\u000d\u000a      research came through the commissioned reports outlined above (section 2).\u000d\u000a      Swinton and his\u000d\u000a      team were commissioned to carry out research and develop training and\u000d\u000a      teaching materials for a\u000d\u000a      number of organizations including the Mental Health Foundation, the\u000d\u000a      Scottish Executive, the NHS\u000d\u000a      and the Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales. The\u000d\u000a      commissioned reports informed\u000d\u000a      the work of religious communities, health and social care providers, and\u000d\u000a      families. The very\u000d\u000a      commissioning of the reports identified a clear need in society for\u000d\u000a      consultancy, policy formation and\u000d\u000a      advice for churches, para-church organizations and the government in\u000d\u000a      relation to specialist\u000d\u000a      provision for the spiritual lives of people with disabilities. These\u000d\u000a      reports had wide distribution, and\u000d\u000a      became central to the research and education stream that the Foundation\u000d\u000a      for People with Learning\u000d\u000a      Disabilities (which is part of The Mental Health Foundation) developed in\u000d\u000a      relation to spirituality and\u000d\u000a      religion from 2004 onwards. From the reports and the research, a number of\u000d\u000a      teaching materials\u000d\u000a      were produced for churches, schools, social care facilities and families,\u000d\u000a      aimed at enabling the\u000d\u000a      meeting of spiritual needs. These were made available free online and\u000d\u000a      widely utilized (419 page\u000d\u000a      views &amp; 601 downloads). Combined with a series of teaching sessions\u000d\u000a      carried out by Swinton,\u000d\u000a      these resources impacted health and social care professionals, and ensured\u000d\u000a      that a broad range of\u000d\u000a      service providers have access to the findings and the educational\u000d\u000a      materials. All the reports and\u000d\u000a      research projects took the model and understanding of spirituality laid\u000d\u000a      out in SAMHC as central,\u000d\u000a      since very few, if any, empirically based resources had been available\u000d\u000a      prior to these projects.\u000d\u000a    The effect of these projects clearly identified the need for finding\u000d\u000a      creative ways of\u000d\u000a      operationalizing the research findings in SAMHC and effectively\u000d\u000a      communicating it to people `on the\u000d\u000a      ground', in forms that facilitate understanding, education and effective\u000d\u000a      training, so as to enable\u000d\u000a      families, churches and social services to notice and respond to an area of\u000d\u000a      human experience that\u000d\u000a      frequently went unnoticed, was often not taken seriously, and for which\u000d\u000a      there were limited\u000d\u000a      resources to inform practice. This insight (arising from the above\u000d\u000a      projects that flowed from the\u000d\u000a      findings of SAMHC) led directly to the formation of the primary\u000d\u000a      impact entity: the creation of The\u000d\u000a      Kairos Forum for People with Intellectual or Cognitive Disabilities. The\u000d\u000a      Forum has been in\u000d\u000a      existence since April 2012, and uses the underpinning research to provide\u000d\u000a      specialist services and\u000d\u000a      resources designed to support the spiritual lives of people with\u000d\u000a      disabilities\u000d\u000a      (http:\/\/thekairosforum.com\/).\u000d\u000a      Reports and teaching materials from the research projects are now\u000d\u000a      available online and the research from SAMHC is currently being\u000d\u000a      delivered to a broad range of\u000d\u000a      health, social care and religious communities via the Kairos Forum, to\u000d\u000a      improve provision for the\u000d\u000a      spiritual needs of those with intellectual and cognitive disabilities\u000d\u000a      (see, for example,\u000d\u000a      http:\/\/thekairosforum.com\/content\/everybody-has-story).\u000d\u000a      The Forum is the first and only university\u000d\u000a      based, empirically supported specialist provider of resources, training,\u000d\u000a      continuing professional\u000d\u000a      development, consultancy, and expert policy advice in relation to the\u000d\u000a      spiritual lives of those with\u000d\u000a      disabilities. It facilitates the crafting and empowerment of `Communities\u000d\u000a      of Belonging', within both\u000d\u000a      religious and secular settings, and does this by providing specialist\u000d\u000a      services which enable and\u000d\u000a      empower people with disabilities to experience dignity, respect, care,\u000d\u000a      access and authentic\u000d\u000a      participation within well formed and empathic communities.

Kairos also contributed to the development of the\u000d\u000a        Transport for London Olympic\u000d\u000a        preparation consultation paper, providing two direct recommendations\u000d\u000a        relating to the training of\u000d\u000a        staff in effective communication and presenting information in symbols.\u000d\u000a      At the request of Archbishop Vincent Nichols, Kairos is now\u000d\u000a        represented on the executive board\u000d\u000a        of the John Paul II Foundation for Sport (JPIIFS), offering advice on\u000d\u000a        issues relating to disability\u000d\u000a        for the Roman Catholic Church. This means that, following on its work on\u000d\u000a        the 2012 Paralympics,\u000d\u000a        Kairos now has a direct impact on the Catholic Church's strategy on\u000d\u000a        theology and sport and is\u000d\u000a        providing support for the preparations and training for the next\u000d\u000a        Paralympics in Rio 2016.\u000d\u000a      At the request of Maria Miller (UK Minister for Disability 2011),\u000d\u000a        Kairos was invited to\u000d\u000a        Westminster to discuss its vision for the provision of services. As a\u000d\u000a        result of this, Kairos gave a\u000d\u000a        formal response to a UK government consultation paper named `Fulfilling\u000d\u000a        Potential':\u000d\u000a        odi.dwp.gov.uk\/docs\/fulfilling-potential\/discussion-so-far-rich-text.rtf\u000a\u000d\u000a      The Forum has been employed (2012-2013 renewable contract) by the\u000d\u000a        Catholic Bishops'\u000d\u000a        Conference of England and Wales as the adviser for all policy making and\u000d\u000a        Bishops' Conference\u000d\u000a        disability initiatives.\u000d\u000a      The Forum has been employed to provide consultancy and training for\u000d\u000a        agencies, clergy,\u000d\u000a        catechists and parents in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Leeds.\u000d\u000a      The Forum developed a programme of training on spirituality for\u000d\u000a        management and staff working\u000d\u000a        for Adelaide Care, a private healthcare provider.\u000d\u000a      The Forum is currently developing a training programme for the\u000d\u000a        Catholic Social Action Network.\u000d\u000a        Impact has taken place therefore in relation to: policy formation; the\u000d\u000a        form and content of\u000d\u000a        associations between people and groups within the church in relation to\u000d\u000a        those with intellectual\u000d\u000a        disabilities; cultural values and social assumptions locally, nationally\u000d\u000a        and internationally in relation\u000d\u000a        to the spiritual lives of those with disabilities and new forms of\u000d\u000a        religious expression; and the content\u000d\u000a        of the education of people, extending significantly beyond the\u000d\u000a        submitting HEI.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    B. Chaplaincy Impact: Community Chaplaincy Listening The\u000d\u000a      avenue to the impact of\u000d\u000a      SAMHC on healthcare and chaplaincy in the current census period\u000d\u000a      began prior to this period with a\u000d\u000a      series of invitations to Swinton to speak about the research in SAMHC\u000d\u000a      at various health and social\u000d\u000a      care conferences across Scotland and England, culminating in Aberdeen\u000d\u000a      University hosting an\u000d\u000a      international conference titled Spirituality in Healthcare Practices:\u000d\u000a        Integrating a Forgotten\u000d\u000a        Dimension (funded by the British academy: &#163;1,600). This in turn led\u000d\u000a      to the Scottish Executive to\u000d\u000a      commission a series of reports (see section 2 above), including specific\u000d\u000a      policy advisory documents\u000d\u000a      arising from the research in SAMHC: Spirited Scotland. An\u000d\u000a        initiative to raise chaplains and health\u000d\u000a        care professionals' consciousness to the importance of spirituality.\u000d\u000a      (Scottish Executive: &#163;41,000;\u000d\u000a      1\/4\/03); Religion and suicide in the highlands: An exploratory study of\u000d\u000a        the spiritual landscape of\u000d\u000a        suicide in the highlands.

This culminated in 2010\u000d\u000a      when, as a direct result of\u000d\u000a      work on the role of chaplaincy in healthcare, Swinton's research\u000d\u000a      formed the basis of the new NHS\u000d\u000a      Education for Scotland initiative &#8212; Community Chaplaincy Listening (CCL).\u000d\u000a      Initially, this project\u000d\u000a      placed chaplaincy `spiritual listeners' in twelve GP practices across\u000d\u000a      Scotland. These listeners\u000d\u000a      respond to patients who visit their GPs with vague issues and\u000d\u000a      existential\/spiritual questions which\u000d\u000a      the GP does not have either time or expertise to deal with. The feedback\u000d\u000a      and assessment via\u000d\u000a      PROMS (Patient Related Outcome Measures) indicates that the act of\u000d\u000a      listening is deeply\u000d\u000a      therapeutic and healing. Initial feedback came from 250 patients, six GP\u000d\u000a      practice focus groups and\u000d\u000a      thirteen chaplains; it reported very positively overall. All said they\u000d\u000a      would like to see CCL as part of\u000d\u000a      the continuing NHS service provision. As a result, in 2012, the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Government asked\u000d\u000a      Swinton to manage an extension of CCL across Scotland. This next\u000d\u000a      stage involves a minimum of\u000d\u000a      32 pilot sites with more than 600 patients benefiting in the first year.\u000d\u000a      29 chaplains have been\u000d\u000a      recruited and 30 CCL volunteers have been trained for this next stage, as\u000d\u000a      chaplaincy provision in\u000d\u000a      GP practices spreads across Scotland directly as a result of Swinton's\u000d\u000a      research; the project is\u000d\u000a      ongoing.\u000d\u000a    Impact has taken place, therefore, in relation to policy formation, and\u000d\u000a      the development and\u000d\u000a      delivery of public services to support the health and welfare of people in\u000d\u000a      society.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The issue of spiritual care is enshrined within both health and social\u000d\u000a      care policy in Scotland.

This impact case study relates\u000d\u000a      to two unique initiatives\u000d\u000a      arising from the research of Swinton that have sought to address\u000d\u000a      this gap in knowledge and\u000d\u000a      practice.

In 1999, he\u000d\u000a      was commissioned by the\u000d\u000a      Mental Health Foundation to explore the extent to which spiritual needs\u000d\u000a      should be considered\u000d\u000a      alongside physical and occupational needs in the lives of people with\u000d\u000a      learning difficulties\u000d\u000a      (published as A Space to Listen: Meeting the spiritual needs of people\u000d\u000a        with learning disabilities\u000d\u000a      (2001)). Through interviews with a series of focus groups (N=60) of people\u000d\u000a      with learning\u000d\u000a      disabilities, their carers and support workers, Swinton uncovered\u000d\u000a      the significance of spirituality for\u000d\u000a      this group of people. He established that people with all levels of\u000d\u000a      learning disabilities have a strong\u000d\u000a      interest in spirituality and that spirituality can function for them both\u000d\u000a      as a mode of language and a\u000d\u000a      form of self expression, affecting how they perceive themselves and their\u000d\u000a      place in the world, and\u000d\u000a      how they cope and respond to crucial events such as bereavement or grief.\u000d\u000a      The research resulted\u000d\u000a      in the development of a model through which agencies could train carers\u000d\u000a      and support workers to\u000d\u000a      recognize and meet spiritual needs. Following the results of this scoping\u000d\u000a      study, Swinton received\u000d\u000a      additional funding for a further piece of extensive research (N=120) which\u000d\u000a      resulted in the report:\u000d\u000a      Why We Are Here (2004). This has been followed by further funded\u000d\u000a      research into community\u000d\u000a      integration (Jerusalem Trust &amp; Porticus Trust) and an AHRC funded\u000d\u000a      project exploring the lives of\u000d\u000a      people with profound and complex learning disabilities. In this project Swinton\u000d\u000a      developed a unique\u000d\u000a      methodology for accessing the spiritual lives of people who are often\u000d\u000a      unable to use words to\u000d\u000a      communicate. Swinton is currently undertaking an AHRC Follow On\u000d\u000a      grant that seeks to transfer\u000d\u000a      the method developed in the AHRC project across to the lives of people\u000d\u000a      with advanced dementia\u000d\u000a      and develop teaching and training materials for families and health and\u000d\u000a      social care workers.\u000d\u000a    (B) Chaplaincy Provision: SAMHC also formed the\u000d\u000a      basis of Swinton's subsequent\u000d\u000a      research in relation to the 2002 Scottish Executive Health Department\u000d\u000a      (SEHD) guidance on\u000d\u000a      spiritual care. This guidance requested that spiritual care policies be\u000d\u000a      developed by the NHS to\u000d\u000a      ensure that responsive and sensitive services are available for patients,\u000d\u000a      relatives and carers.\u000d\u000a      Spiritual care had been seen as something provided by a chaplain or\u000d\u000a      appropriate religious leader,\u000d\u000a      mainly to patients. Up to then, spirituality had been seen as a\u000d\u000a      predominantly religious issue. The\u000d\u000a      new guidance recognized a broader definition of spirituality (centred on\u000d\u000a      meaning-making, values\u000d\u000a      and experience), and posed a challenge for the health and social care\u000d\u000a      sectors in terms of how\u000d\u000a      such spiritual care should be administered and how such support should be\u000d\u000a      focused. As a result,\u000d\u000a      chaplains were pushed to the centre of healthcare in Scotland. In order to\u000d\u000a      understand better the\u000d\u000a      service they provide, the Scottish Executive funded Swinton and a\u000d\u000a      team of researchers from the\u000d\u000a      University of Aberdeen (2003-2005) to describe and conceptualize the\u000d\u000a      present situation, with a\u000d\u000a      view to providing guidance on ongoing developments, in the area of\u000d\u000a      spiritual care and chaplaincy\u000d\u000a      in NHS Scotland. Swinton's team interviewed all 44 full-time\u000d\u000a      Health-Care Chaplains working in\u000d\u000a      Scotland twice over a period of 18 months. The final report, published as\u000d\u000a      What Do Chaplains Do?\u000d\u000a      (2005), detailed the key configuration of listening, presence, counselling\u000d\u000a      and accessibility that form\u000d\u000a      their duties within a secular NHS and outlined the challenges raised by\u000d\u000a      their shifting role.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43457","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Despite the comparatively small size of Jain religious communities,\u000a      numbering approximately four\u000a      million in India, 150,000 in the US and 30,000 in the UK, it has been\u000a      possible for the Centre of\u000a      Jaina Studies to make substantial impacts on these minority religious\u000a      communities in a short space\u000a      of time: the important annual lectures and workshops began in 1999 and the\u000a      Centre's founding in\u000a      2004.

It is the depth of his knowledge of\u000a      Jainism and breadth of subjects\u000a      covered in his research that has enabled Fl&#252;gel to create and sustain a\u000a      unique environment for the\u000a      development of research and study of Jainism. It specifically relies on\u000a      and strengthens reciprocities\u000a      between those studying the religion and those practicing it. The success\u000a      of the Centre and its\u000a      capacity to influence broad constituencies rest firmly on this knowledge\u000a      base and the respect it\u000a      commands.\u000a    The plurality of subjects treated in his own work on Jainism since\u000a      starting at SOAS in October\u000a      2000, and the Centre's dissemination of the research of others, reveal the\u000a      diversity of disciplinary\u000a      and methodological approaches &#8212; including those of anthropology, art\u000a      history, gender studies and\u000a      diaspora studies &#8212; that now influence and shape the exploration of this\u000a      lived religion.

Output b below, for example,\u000a      highlights the existence of a\u000a      syncretistic form of devotional Jainism that is markedly different from\u000a      the ascetic traditions outlined\u000a      in canonical Jain scriptures.\u000a    Careful consideration of the varieties of practice and belief within\u000a      Jainism is also evident in output\u000a      d, which contests the perceived uniformity implied by the term \"Jaina\u000a      Law\".

This high-profile organisation ran effective campaigns for\u000a      nun ordination, successfully re-established in Sri Lanka (1998) and\u000a      Thailand (2002). The opportunities for disseminating her research that\u000a      Kawanami thus acquired established her as a world-leading authority on\u000a      Buddhist nuns in Myanmar. This gave her the opportunity &#8212; in Myanmar's\u000a      highly religious, scripture-centred context in which academic authority is\u000a      highly valued &#8212; to collaborate with three senior nuns in founding (1998)\u000a      the nunnery school, [text removed for publication], one of Myanmar's\u000a      monastic educational centres.\u000a    Kawanami's research has guided the school in several ways. (i) Kawanami's\u000a      historical research enabled the co-directors to refound the school on an\u000a      ancient site of nun education. (ii) The co-directors were convinced by her\u000a      research (on the historical problem of the penetration of kinship) to base\u000a      the school on a `one-pot' (ta-&#242;) system. This brings all resident\u000a      nuns into the `pot' regardless of their kin relations, curbing worldly and\u000a      individualistic tendencies and reducing time on chores, enabling nuns to\u000a      concentrate on scriptural study. (iii) Based on Kawanami's historical\u000a      research on why nunnery schools have often declined, the directors since\u000a      2008 have instituted a legal constitution to select executive members by\u000a      merit, not by family or kin connections.\u000a    Since 2008 especially, this nunnery school has grown and become a role\u000a      model for Buddhist nuns in Myanmar. It has developed an outstanding\u000a      reputation for academic excellence, in which the nuns excel due to\u000a      Kawanami's `one-pot' system, which has enabled increasing numbers of nuns\u000a      (currently around 20 each year) to pass the state scriptural exams. With\u000a      many lay donors coming to see the beneficial outcomes, the school is now\u000a      self-sustaining, entirely supported by lay donations within Myanmar. As of\u000a      2013 there are 200 resident students. The school's graduate students have\u000a      opened two branch nunneries since 2008, and the school is affiliated with\u000a      an orphanage. Altogether, 500 noviciates have trained at the school\u000a      between 2008 and 2013.\u000a    The principal beneficiaries of Kawanami's research are (1) these nuns and\u000a      trainee nuns, for whom the school offers a safe single-sex environment for\u000a      studying the scriptures, pursuing a religious vocation and affiliating\u000a      with lay supporters. Further beneficiaries include (2) Myanmar's 50,000\u000a      nuns more broadly, whose spiritual standing and so also financial and\u000a      social support has been enhanced by the reputation, growth and financial\u000a      success of the [text removed for publication] school. More broadly still,\u000a      the beneficiaries include (3) girls and women in Myanmar, for whom\u000a      monastic life increasingly provides an opportunity for education and a\u000a      career as nunnery schools gain in status and financial sustainability.\u000a    Thus, Kawanami's engaged research has led to improvements in nuns' and\u000a        women's status. According to Dr Elizabeth Harris (Associate\u000a      Professor, Religious Studies, Liverpool Hope University), who has visited\u000a      the school, `Kawanami's contribution to the advancement of Buddhist nuns\u000a      in Myanmar is considerable' (Ref. 1). Evidence of the school bringing this\u000a      benefit to girls across Myanmar comes from, e.g. Dr. Sik Fa Ren (teaching\u000a      consultant, Centre of Buddhist Studies, University of Hong Kong) who in\u000a      2011 escorted 30 Buddhists (from Dharma Nature Preaching Hall, Ching Fat\u000a      Buddhist Lotus Centre and other Buddhist circles) to visit the nunnery. Fa\u000a      Ren reports that: `Children have aspirations to study the Buddhist\u000a      teaching and even become a monastic when they are young. We saw young nuns\u000a      ... It turned out that it was (they) who insisted to become a nun and it\u000a      was their goal to attend the nunnery school. ... The nuns told us that it\u000a      was competitive to get into the nunnery school and it was like a dream\u000a      come true when they were enrolled' (Ref. 2). Blogging in 2012, visitor\u000a      Dianne A confirms the importance of this opportunity to the girls, for a\u000a      well rounded education as well as for Buddhist study: `We met the youngest\u000a      nun - a nine-year-old girl ... She had come to the Nunnery to learn to\u000a      speak Burmese fluently as she only spoke Shan. She said she was happy to\u000a      be there' (Ref. 3).\u000a    The school now also contributes significantly to Myanmar's cultural\u000a        life and to tourism. This is shown by large attendance figures at\u000a      regular ceremonies at the school (e.g., 1000 monks and nuns attended a\u000a      ceremony during Fa Ren's 2011 visit) and from tourism. Although the\u000a      military regime controlled tourism tightly until recently, the Sagaing\u000a      Hills complex of monasteries and nunneries features highly on the\u000a      now-developing tourist itinerary. Operators whose tours now feature visits\u000a      to [text removed for publication] the school include Travel IndoChina,\u000a      World Expeditions, Wandertours and, especially, Cardinal Photos, which has\u000a      run regular photographic tours to the school since 2005, bringing new\u000a      financial benefits to this developing country. A documentary about the\u000a      school aired on Sky Net television in Myanmar in September 2013.\u000a    There is a high level of international interest in the school, evidenced\u000a      by audience figures for Kawanami's recent media broadcasts on the topic -\u000a      e.g., on Radio National (Australia), 4\/11\/2008, audience c. 250,000 plus\u000a      10,000 podcast downloads; BBC World Service 10\/4\/2010, audience c. 1.5m; Sunday\u000a        Morning on Radio Scotland 11\/3\/2012, audience c. 300,000) (source:\u000a      Radio Joint Audience Research). The school was recently the subject of a\u000a      substantial feature in Elle magazine (Belgium and France) (Ref.\u000a      4), which discusses Kawanami's research. Further evidence of international\u000a      recognition is the regular visitor groups (such as Fa Ren's in 2011) from\u000a      various countries and their donations (e.g., c. US$30,000 from the Hong\u000a      Kong group alone). The school is thus raising Myanmar's cultural\u000a        profile and reputation internationally.\u000a    Also, the school is contributing significantly to the growth of civil\u000a        society in Myanmar, which is currently undergoing a process of\u000a      opening and reform that began in 2010 with the release of opposition\u000a      leader Aung San Su Kyi from house confinement. In this period the school\u000a      has provided a public venue for Myanmar people to meet and participate in\u000a      religious activities, and even to discuss politics and social affairs in a\u000a      safe environment, because the political authorities regard Buddhist nuns\u000a      as non-political in contrast to monks. Thus the school is contributing to\u000a      the process of creating a public sphere free of government control.\u000a    Finally, due to the school's success in becoming financially\u000a      self-sustaining, numerous international NGOs regard it as a model of\u000a        indigenous capacity building. For instance, in 2008 the Unitarian\u000a      Service Committee, Boston, visited the school. Increasing NGO interest and\u000a      recognition of Kawanami's research and role resulted in her being asked to\u000a      host an NGO workshop at the school in Feb 2013: Gender, Buddhism,\u000a        INGOs and Civil Society. Representatives of twenty aid agencies and\u000a      NGOs - including Oxfam, UNICEF, and the Gender Equality Network Myanmar -\u000a      participated to learn how to take forward this model of development.\u000a      Further NGO interest resulted in a follow-up workshop held with ActionAid\u000a      in Yangon in March 2013. These NGOs in international development and the\u000a      communities with which they work are thus beneficiaries of Kawanami's\u000a      research and the developments that it has enabled. As NGOs learn from the\u000a      model of the [text removed for publication] school, the impact of\u000a      Kawanami's work is extending beyond Myanmar.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research by Dr Hiroko Kawanami into the religious and social standing of\u000a      nuns in Myanmar has helped to empower women in that country by guiding the\u000a      work of what is now Myanmar's most prestigious Buddhist nunnery school,\u000a      [text removed for publication], which Kawanami co-directs.

It is highly\u000a      religious: 85% of its population of over 60m are Buddhists, with half a\u000a      million vocational monks and 50,000 nuns. At 1% of the total population,\u000a      this is the largest concentration of monastics in any Buddhist country,\u000a      depending entirely on lay donations (made within the country). Kawanami's\u000a      research shows that the monastic community is pivotal for the\u000a      socio-religious life of the Buddhist population, operating through a\u000a      network of monks, nuns and lay supporters extending to the remotest\u000a      villages.\u000a    Numerous as Myanmar nuns are, Kawanami finds that their progress and\u000a      unity have been hampered by their lesser status compared to monks, which\u000a      has assigned nuns a half-way position between pious laywoman and religious\u000a      mendicant. Kawanami examines different strategies for improving nuns'\u000a      religious and social standing and advocates that, instead of simply\u000a      pursuing either ordination or secular education, nuns should deepen their\u000a      scriptural education to become more credible monastics and thereby enhance\u000a      their social and religious capital.\u000a    As Kawanami shows, the historic difficulty that nuns have had doing this\u000a      is that, unlike monasteries, nunneries have tended to decline and fragment\u000a      after two generations of abbesses, struggling to pass on their\u000a      institutional and educational heritage to the next generation. Based on\u000a      study of the developmental cycles of 200 formerly existing nunnery\u000a      schools, conducted over 25 years, Kawanami ascertains that this happens\u000a      because nunneries tend to become infiltrated by nuns' families and kin,\u000a      compromising nuns' religious position and producing tensions between\u000a      institutions' collective, academic and religious ideals and the private\u000a      interests and kin ties of resident nuns (see Kawanami 2013 for her\u000a      definitive account). Historically the tensions intensify when the transfer\u000a      of authority within a nunnery school takes place, often producing\u000a      institutional turmoil and collapse. This problem, Kawanami finds, is\u000a      connected with the traditional Myanmar system that accommodates separate\u000a      households on the common nunnery premises (called &#242; kwe- s&#224;-thi,\u000a      `eating from separate pots') - implying that a nunnery is a confederation\u000a      of many independent households that convene only on ceremonial occasions.\u000a      Kawanami's proposed solution is that nunneries should instead employ a\u000a      `one-pot' system that pools and shares all resources.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43566","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Archard's research underpins the recommendations in Chapter 2 of the Critical\u000a        Care Decisions report and informs its overall recommendations on\u000d\u000a      palliative care and involving parents in decision-making.\u000d\u000a    Before the report was published, clinical care of extremely premature\u000d\u000a      babies in 222 UK neonatal units, and information given to parents, varied\u000d\u000a      greatly at different hospitals. The report's guidelines have led to much\u000d\u000a      more consistent practice. Although non-mandatory, the guidelines have\u000d\u000a      during 2007-2013 become universally used as the framework for practice\u000d\u000a      across the NHS, as one neonatal consultant attests: `when it comes to\u000d\u000a      premature babies ... most decisions are based on guidelines from the\u000d\u000a      Nuffield Council on Bioethics' (Telegraph 29\/04\/2012).

The report's guidelines have shaped\u000d\u000a      clinical practice so pervasively by providing the basis for successive\u000d\u000a      further sets of medical guidelines. This happened as follows.\u000d\u000a    At the end of 2006 the report was favourably received by the medical\u000d\u000a      community (The Lancet editorial of 25\/11\/2006 called the report\u000d\u000a      `thoughtful, sensitive, and sensible') and other bodies including the\u000d\u000a      Church of England House of Bishops.

In response:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      In Oct 2008 the British Association of Perinatal Medicine (BAPM)\u000d\u000a        published a framework for clinical practice for Management of Babies\u000d\u000a          Born Extremely Preterm. Citing the Nuffield report (Ref. 3, p. 1,\u000d\u000a        p. 4), the framework's week-by-week guidelines (pp. 2-3) reflect those\u000d\u000a        of the Nuffield report. The framework is generally followed across the\u000d\u000a        NHS (as attested, e.g., in the Daily Mail 10\/09\/2009).\u000d\u000a      In 2008 the Neonatal Taskforce was established, made up of\u000d\u000a        practitioners across the NHS and members of special care baby charity\u000d\u000a        Bliss, supported by the Department of Health. The Taskforce published\u000d\u000a        the first NHS-wide comprehensive framework for improving neonatal\u000d\u000a        services (Toolkit for High Quality Neonatal Services, 2009; Ref.\u000d\u000a        4). The Toolkit states: `Recommendations for the care of babies born at\u000d\u000a        the threshold of viability, such as those produced by BAPM, should\u000d\u000a        inform local guidelines' (Ref. 4, p. 88).\u000d\u000a      In 2009 Bliss was granted Department of Health funding to produce\u000d\u000a        guidance for parents to support decisions around the management of\u000d\u000a        extremely premature birth. This resulted in a booklet for families, Making\u000a          Critical Care Decisions for Your Baby (2010, updated, 2011), now\u000d\u000a        used across the NHS for involving parents in decision-making. As Bliss\u000d\u000a        acknowledge (at www.bliss.org.uk\/improving-care\/professional-development\/making-critical-care-decisions-for-your-baby\/),\u000athe\u000a        production of this booklet follows the Nuffield report's recommendations\u000d\u000a        for `partnerships of care' with parents (Critical Care Decisions\u000d\u000a        8.54). These recommendations are informed by Archard's principle that\u000d\u000a        parents' interests, not only the baby's, carry weight.\u000d\u000a      The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) welcomed\u000d\u000a        the Critical Care Decisions report in a 11\/2006 press release:\u000d\u000a        `These guidelines will help maternity and neonatal staff to make\u000d\u000a        difficult decisions in consultation with parents, and to provide the\u000d\u000a        best care available to those that need it' (Ref. 5). The RCOG\u000d\u000a        established a working party whose 2010 report Termination of\u000d\u000a          Pregnancy for Fetal Abnormality incorporates the Nuffield\u000d\u000a        guidelines on prematurity (Ref. 5, p. 6).\u000d\u000a      The positive impact of these successive guidelines is shown by the\u000d\u000a        2009\/10 EU benchmarking report by the European Foundation for the Care\u000d\u000a        of Newborn Infants (EFCNI) (Ref. 6, pp. 84-90). EFCNI highlights the UK\u000d\u000a        as one of only two European countries with a national policy on\u000d\u000a        premature infants (the Toolkit &#8212; enabled by the Nuffield report) and one\u000d\u000a        of three countries representing best practice in neonatal care (Ref. 6,\u000d\u000a        esp. p. 89 and 94-95).\u000d\u000a      Today, the Nuffield report's conclusions remain widely endorsed in the\u000d\u000a        medical community: e.g., a 2010 Lancet editorial found that `a recent\u000d\u000a        study ... underline(s) the validity of the 2006 Nuffield Council on\u000d\u000a        Bioethics recommendations on resuscitation and care of extremely\u000d\u000a        premature babies' (The Lancet 1\/5\/2010).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The Nuffield report has received extensive media coverage. When it first\u000d\u000a      appeared coverage followed in the BBC News, CBC News (Canada), New\u000d\u000a        York Times, Irish Times, Sky News, Australian Broadcast\u000d\u000a      Corporation and all UK daily newspapers. To today the report is still\u000d\u000a      regularly discussed in articles in many UK broadsheets and tabloids (The\u000a        Mail, e.g. 10\/09\/2009, the Mirror, e.g. 09\/09\/2009). The\u000d\u000a      March 2011 BBC2 documentary 23 Week Babies: The Price of Life\u000d\u000a      (which dubbed the report `the Bible' on prematurity) drew 1.9 million\u000d\u000a      viewers.\u000d\u000a    The report receives extensive attention in the virtual sphere. The\u000d\u000a      Nuffield web-pages on Critical Care Decisions are widely viewed:\u000d\u000a      e.g., in 2011 they drew 2,323 visits, plus 1116 downloads of the full\u000d\u000a      report and 669 downloads of the summary. Likewise Jan-Jul 2012 saw 1393\u000d\u000a      visits and 516 report downloads. This shows the level of public interest\u000d\u000a      in the report and its beneficial effect on public understanding of care\u000d\u000a      for extremely premature babies.\u000d\u000a    Through its contribution to the Nuffield report, Archard's research\u000d\u000a        has helped to enable healthcare teams, especially maternity and neonatal\u000d\u000a        staff, to improve care for extremely premature babies, to involve\u000d\u000a        parents in difficult decisions, and to develop a unified approach to\u000d\u000a        such care and decision-making. Archard's research has thus helped UK\u000d\u000a      health authorities to offer better provision across the UK's 162 neonatal\u000d\u000a      units and 46 neonatal intensive care units, improving public services in\u000d\u000a      health and medicine. Archard's research has thereby contributed to\u000d\u000a      benefits in well-being for the many families and their babies who are\u000d\u000a      directly affected by neonatal services &#8212; extremely premature babies\u000d\u000a      constitute around 1% of newborns in the UK today (so, of 655,357 newborns\u000d\u000a      in 2006\/7 as a sample year, this means 6553 babies). The reach of these\u000d\u000a      benefits of Archard's research extends, then, to thousands of babies and\u000d\u000a      their families and hundreds of hospital staff.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research by Professor David Archard on the moral and legal status of\u000d\u000a      children has improved health policy and care for extremely premature\u000d\u000a      babies through its contribution to the Nuffield Council on Bioethics\u000d\u000a      report Critical Care Decisions in Fetal and Neonatal Medicine: Ethical\u000d\u000a        Issues, released in late 2006.

Archard (2004b) argues that it is wrong deliberately to\u000d\u000a      bring into existence an individual whose life will be of very poor\u000d\u000a      quality. Archard (2006a) argues that a child's best interests should be a\u000d\u000a      primary but, realistically, not the only consideration in how he or she is\u000d\u000a      treated. He argues for giving `at least equal consideration to the\u000d\u000a      interests of any adults affected by policies and actions promoting the\u000d\u000a      child's welfare' (2006a, sec. 7).\u000d\u000a    This research has had transformative impact on medical practice and\u000d\u000a      policy through its contribution to the Nuffield report Critical Care\u000d\u000a        Decisions in Fetal and Neonatal Medicine (Nuffield Council on\u000d\u000a      Bioethics 2006). This is so both indirectly, because the research led to\u000d\u000a      Archard's invitation to become Member then the Deputy Chair of the\u000d\u000a      relevant Working Party (2004-6), and directly, through Archard's joint\u000d\u000a      authorship of Chapter 2 of the report `Decision making: the ethical\u000d\u000a      issues' (with Alastair Campbell, now Emeritus Professor of Medicine,\u000d\u000a      University of Bristol) as well as Archard's broader input into the entire\u000d\u000a      report.\u000d\u000a    Context of the report. Major improvements in medical care have\u000d\u000a      given extremely premature newborns &#8212; those born before 29 weeks &#8212; better\u000d\u000a      survival chances yet often very limited life spans and\/or major\u000d\u000a      abnormalities, chronic illnesses or disabilities. These cases present\u000d\u000a      difficult decisions to families and health professionals: whether to\u000d\u000a      resuscitate such babies, or replace intensive with palliative care. In the\u000d\u000a      Netherlands the 2004 Groningen Protocol established criteria to guide\u000d\u000a      doctors in the active ending of life of severely ill newborn babies. This,\u000d\u000a      and increasing media attention to the issue, led the Nuffield Council to\u000d\u000a      commission the Critical Care Decisions report. Its overall aim was\u000d\u000a      to provide a sound ethical basis for critical care decisions. As such\u000d\u000a      Archard's input as a moral philosopher was crucial.\u000d\u000a    In Chapter 2, Archard and Campbell argue that `the best interests\u000d\u000a      of a baby must be a central consideration in determining whether and how\u000d\u000a      to treat him or her' (Critical Care Decisions 2.21) and that it is\u000d\u000a      against a baby's interests to be kept alive if this causes the baby\u000d\u000a      intolerable suffering. Parents' interests carry some weight, but the\u000d\u000a      baby's interest in avoiding an intolerable life has more weight\u000d\u000a      (2.29-2.30). These conclusions are based on Archard (2004a, 2004b, 2006a)\u000d\u000a      and they underpin the report's key conclusion, rarely openly stated\u000d\u000a      before, that intensive treatment should not always be given to seriously\u000d\u000a      ill and extremely premature babies who are unlikely to get any better\u000d\u000a      and\/or for whom death is inevitable, if the suffering caused by continuing\u000d\u000a      active treatment outweighs its benefits to the baby.\u000d\u000a    This principle, applied to current outcomes of treatment for premature\u000d\u000a      babies of different ages, underpins the report's week-by-week guidelines\u000d\u000a      on giving intensive care to babies born at 25 weeks and above, 24, 23, 22\u000d\u000a      and before 22 weeks.\u000d\u000a    In Chapter 2 Archard and Campbell also argue that deliberate ending of\u000d\u000a      life and withdrawing\/withholding treatment are not morally equivalent,\u000d\u000a      because while the latter is sometimes permissible given the importance of\u000d\u000a      the baby's best interests, the former contravenes doctors' obligations and\u000d\u000a      damages doctor-patient relationships (2.35). These arguments underpin\u000d\u000a      another key conclusion of the report, against active ending of neonatal\u000d\u000a      life even when that life is intolerable.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43567","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"6254930","Name":"Palestinian Territory"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of Woodhead's research has escalated in successive stages,\u000a      first improving religious education in schools. Central findings\u000a      of Heelas and Woodhead (2005) and Woodhead (2008) have been incorporated\u000a      into the A-level Sociology syllabus. They are a major part of Unit 3 of\u000a      the AQA Sociology GCE and are the basis of a Sociology of Religion unit in\u000a      the OCR Advanced Subsidiary GCE in Sociology (Unit G672). Woodhead (2005),\u000a      (2008) and others are discussed in major Sociology textbooks such as\u000a      Langley et al. Sociology AS for OCR (2nd edn. 2010: pp. 203-4,\u000a      215) and Haralambos and Holborn eds. Sociology: Themes and\u000a        Perspectives: AS and A2 Student Handbook (7th edn., 2008: p. 440,\u000a      pp. 422-5, inc. section `Linda Woodhead &#8212; female religiosity and gendering\u000a      secularization'). The latter is the market leading A-Level Sociology\u000a      textbook, bought and used by most centres teaching A-Level Sociology\u000a      according to publisher HarperCollins. Thus Woodhead's research has\u000a      enhanced the education of the c. 30,000 students taking A-level Sociology\u000a      in the UK annually.\u000a    In 2007, Woodhead was appointed Director of the AHRC\/ESRC Religion and\u000a      Society Programme. In light of her research and programme role, she was\u000a      commissioned to write policy reports advising the Equality and Human\u000a        Rights Commission (EHRC) on how to approach their new mandate for\u000a        religious equality. Her first report `Religion or Belief':\u000a        Identifying Issues and Priorities (2009; Ref. 1), which draws on her\u000a      research (pp. iii-iv, 5-7, 10-12), has:\u000a    (a) helped the EHRC to set its research priorities, including\u000a      commissioning the report Religious Discrimination in Britain and\u000a      setting up its Religion or Belief Network, now with 500+ members;\u000a    (b) led to Woodhead advising on the EHRC briefing paper `Religion or\u000a      Belief' and guide `Religion or belief in the workplace: a guide for\u000a      employers following recent European Court of Human Rights judgments' (Feb\u000a      2013).\u000a    (c) informed the EHRC's legal interventions. In `Religion or Belief'\u000a      (p. 30) Woodhead recommends that in dealing with clashes between equality\u000a      strands the principle of `proportionality' should be supplemented by that\u000a      of `reasonable accommodation', whereby employers should make reasonable\u000a      adjustments to accommodate people's needs to manifest their religion. The\u000a      EHRC took forward this recommendation in its submission to the European\u000a      Court of Human Rights concerning four widely reported UK legal cases\u000a      (Eweida and others); see EHRC press release, 07\/2011 (Ref. 2). Following\u000a      the European Court's subsequent ruling, the UK government is considering\u000a      changing the law on religious discrimination and the EHRC is working with\u000a      employers and employees on interpreting and applying the ruling.\u000a    Drawing on her research on public religion in Britain, Woodhead has since\u000a      2008 been widely consulted on religion and security, e.g. by the\u000a      Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism and (until 2009) by Paul Wiles,\u000a      former Chief Scientist at the Home Office. She advised against conducting\u000a      intrusive research on Muslim communities when a Home Office survey of all\u000a      Muslim mosques and communities was planned, thus contributing to improved,\u000a      more sensitive security policy.\u000a    The impact of Woodhead's research has increased greatly since 2012 as an\u000a      outcome of her direction of the Religion and Society Programme, which\u000a      required her to disseminate Programme findings. The vehicle that she and\u000a      the former Home Secretary Charles Clarke designed was the Westminster\u000a        Faith Debates of 2012 and 2013. (Elizabeth Hunter from Theos\u000a      assisted with media relations in the 2012 series.)\u000a    The Debates were described by the Guardian's religion writer\u000a      Andrew Brown as `the most interesting and successful attempt ... to talk\u000a      about what all people believe and why this really matters' (Ref. 3). Each\u000a      Debate pairs Programme award-holding academics with public figures to\u000a      address contemporary issues in Religion and Public Life (2012) and\u000a      Religion and Personal Life (2013) before audiences including MPs, civil\u000a      servants, journalists, think-tank researchers, teachers, and faith\u000a      communities, representing over 400 organisations. Woodhead's research has\u000a      fed into the Debates' far-reaching impact on public discussion not only\u000a      indirectly, in that the Debates result from her role as Programme\u000a      Director, but also directly, in that her research has informed the design\u000a      of the Debates.\u000a    The Debates, whose participants have included Tony Blair, Rowan Williams\u000a      and Richard Dawkins, have: been attended by over 2000 people; been viewed\u000a      around 19,000 times on YouTube; received 1.8 million hits online, with\u000a      thousands of views each week (e.g. 4258 and 2403 in the first two weeks of\u000a      2013). Media coverage has been exceptional: the 2013 Debates were reported\u000a      over 69 times in mainstream media (Ref. 4); for example, the 2012 debate\u000a      on religious education in schools made headlines in the Daily Mail\u000a      and Guardian (22\/2\/2012) and the closing 2012 debate made the Telegraph\u000a      front page (24\/07\/2012). The Debates have been reported internationally in\u000a      Austria, Denmark, Germany, India, Switzerland, and the USA (Time, Washington\u000a        Post). Viewers from over 58 countries have accessed the online\u000a      Debates, which are used in teaching in India, the Netherlands, and\u000a      Palestine. As a result Woodhead has become a regular media commentator,\u000a      on, e.g., BBC1 The Big Questions (11\/03\/2012, 15\/01\/2012), BBC\u000a      Radio 4 (e.g. Thought for the Day 26\/12\/2012, Sunday\u000a      5\/5\/2013); in the Guardian (e.g. 07\/05\/2012, 07\/11\/2012,\u000a      12\/2\/2013), The Tablet, and other venues including the 2013 Davos\u000a      World Economic Forum.\u000a    As this level of media coverage shows, the Debates have greatly\u000a        increased public recognition of religion's continuing public presence.\u000a      This is confirmed by Dominic Grieve QC MP, Attorney General: `This series\u000a      has been extremely successful in raising the level of public debate about\u000a      religion, on topics of great importance for our national life' (Ref. 5).\u000a      Again the BBC's Commissioning Editor for Religion confirms that the\u000a      Debates have `made it more acceptable to \"do religion\" in public. This can\u000a      be seen in the media, from more newspaper opinion pieces to\u000a      religion-related programmes' (Ref. 6). Further evidence of enhanced public\u000a      discourse is the extensive discussion that continues online, in, inter\u000a        alia, the Guardian Comment is Free and many blogs (New\u000a      Statesman, National Secular Society &#8212; see, e.g., 5\/7\/2013).\u000a    Through the 2013 Debates, Woodhead's research has had further impacts\u000a        on ongoing political debates on assisted dying and same-sex marriage.\u000a      Woodhead commissioned YouGov polls on these topics, publicised in press\u000a      releases, to inform the relevant debates. The results confirmed her view\u000a      of the gap between the `unchurched majority' of religious people and the\u000a      `strictly religious' minority. The results were widely discussed in the\u000a      Anglican church (e.g. in Church Times, Thinking Anglicans, Modern\u000a        Church), in UK newspapers and on BBC news online. The finding that\u000a      70% of Britons and 72% of Anglicans support assisted dying (discussed in New\u000a        Statesman 14\/5\/2013) was cited in three court cases (Lamb et al.)\u000a      requesting relaxation of right-to-die guidelines. The Home Office's Chief\u000a      Scientific Advisor confirms that `the finding [on euthanasia] had\u000a      world-wide press coverage [and] it is hard to imagine that this will not\u000a      feed into the forthcoming debates in Parliament and elsewhere' (Ref. 7).\u000a      Woodhead's finding that most religious people support same-sex marriage\u000a      was repeated in the Evening Standard editorial of 8\/5\/2013 to\u000a      persuade the Cameron government to continue with the bill to legalise it.\u000a      As the Chief Scientist noted, Woodhead's finding here `has been\u000a      influential in discussion and debate which will have informed government\u000a      as the legislation has progressed' (Ref. 7).\u000a    Through its effect on the Debates, Woodhead's research has contributed to\u000a      enhanced public understanding of changing forms of religion amongst\u000a      policy-makers, politicians, journalists, the general public, and religious\u000a      communities. As a whole, Woodhead's research has led to improved and\u000a      updated school teaching on religion; has influenced policy, especially on\u000a      equalities issues and on religion and security; and has significantly\u000a      helped to reshape media, public and political debate on religion.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    In research on religion and society, Professor Woodhead has argued for an\u000a      updated, expanded understanding of `religion' and `belief' in the UK\u000a      today. In part by leading to Woodhead's direction of the AHRC\/ESRC\u000a      Religion and Society Programme, the research has led to major impacts\u000a      throughout 2008-13. In particular it has influenced the Equality and Human\u000a      Rights Commission's handling of new equalities legislation, and it has\u000a      significantly enhanced public discussion about religion through the\u000a      high-profile Westminster Faith Debates, co-organised by Woodhead and the\u000a      Rt Hon Charles Clarke. The Debates have reached millions, increasing\u000a      recognition of religion's ongoing presence in public life and generating\u000a      further policy impacts.

Yet many\u000a      people still think of religion in the UK in terms of church membership,\u000a      even assimilating other world religions to this model. Woodhead has\u000a      challenged this `ecclesiastical captivity' of thought, illuminating the\u000a      more varied religious landscape of the post-war period. Key elements of\u000a      this contribution are:\u000a    \u000a      a taxonomy (Woodhead and Heelas 2000), now widely adopted,\u000a        distinguishing between `religions of difference', `religions of\u000a        humanity' and `spiritualities of life'\u000a      applying this taxonomy to original empirical research on churches in\u000a        the UK, showing wide variety within the `congregational domain' (Heelas\u000a        and Woodhead 2005)\u000a      empirical research in Kendal, UK, showing how significant\u000a        post-Christian forms of holistic or mind-body-spirit forms of\u000a        spirituality have become since the 1980s, and offering an explanation:\u000a        the `spiritual revolution' thesis (Heelas and Woodhead 2005)\u000a      attending to the previously neglected importance of women in religion,\u000a        their key role in church decline and holistic growth, and developing a\u000a        new theory to explain this (Woodhead 2008)\u000a      advancing analysis of the `unchurched majority' in the UK: the ethnic\u000a        majority who identify as Christian in the census (72%), but are not\u000a        members of religious bodies and combine religious and secular\u000a        commitments in ways which have `practical and emotional logics' rather\u000a        than creedal ones (Riis and Woodhead 2010, Woodhead and Catto 2012)\u000a      offering a new integrated analysis of religion and society in post-war\u000a        Britain, replacing previous studies which took secularization as their\u000a        paradigm and the churches as their focus (Woodhead and Catto 2012)\u000a      challenging theories of the privatisation of religion and showing how,\u000a        post-war, religion has remained integral to public life &#8212; in, e.g.,\u000a        education, law, the workplace, consumption, health and healing (Woodhead\u000a        and Catto 2012).\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44533","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Jones's bioethical research has helped inform and shape thinking in the\u000a      Catholic community and other faith communities; that of legislators,\u000a      regulators and healthcare professionals; and thus has had a significant\u000a      impact on those who access healthcare services or who support those who\u000a      do. Jones has engaged widely with audiences outside the academy. He has\u000a      given over 100 talks unconnected to any higher educational programme since\u000a      January 2008 (to medical professionals, to Church groups and at interfaith\u000a      events, to sixth form students, as well as open lectures for members of\u000a      the public). In the same period, Jones wrote 27 articles for wider\u000a      audiences, both religious (for example in The Tablet; The\u000a        Pastoral Review; or Faith Today) and secular (for example in\u000a      BioNews; Bioedge; or The Times Higher Education).\u000a    During this period Jones has also authored 26 responses to consultations\u000a      by parliament, regulatory or professional bodies and other organisations\u000a      and on nine occasions has spoken in parliament and\/or given oral evidence\u000a      to parliamentary committees.\u000a    Jones has also authored a number of public letters, for example, one\u000a      signed by 26 bioethicists from around Europe on the patentability of human\u000a      embryo research (Nature 30 June 2011). Jones has also appeared on\u000a      numerous occasions in the national media (for example on Newsnight, the\u000a      Today programme, Beyond Belief) and has been cited in debates in\u000a      parliament, for example in the closing speech of the debate on the human\u000a      fertilisation and embryology bill (22 Oct 2008: Hansard Column 411). Since\u000a      2009 he has also been Vice-Chair of the MoD Research Ethics Committee.\u000a      Three times in this period, guidance drafted by Jones has been sent to\u000a      every Catholic parish in England and Wales (over 2,500 parishes). There is\u000a      evidence that this encouraged participation in public policy, for example,\u000a      in the Crown Prosecution Service consultation on assisted suicide, in that\u000a      (1) the number of responses in that consultation was unusually high (over\u000a      four thousand) despite the complexity of the consultation document (2) the\u000a      pattern of Yes\/No answers most commonly adopted was that advocated in\u000a      Jones's guidance, and (3) the most common suggestion by the public was one\u000a      highlighted in Jones's guidance.\u000a    In relation to end-of-life care, Jones undertook `the lion's share of the\u000a      drafting' of The Mental Capacity Act &amp; `Living Wills': A practical\u000a        Guide for Catholics (2008) for the Department of Christian\u000a      Responsibility and Citizenship of the Catholic Bishops Conference of\u000a      England and Wales, at their request: and helped draft A Practical\u000a        Guide to the Spiritual Care of the Dying Person (2010). These\u000a      booklets are available online and have been widely distributed especially\u000a      through hospital chaplaincies. The Spiritual Care of the Dying Person\u000a      has also been translated into Italian and Spanish.\u000a    Jones also helped draft the General Medical Council guidance Treatment\u000a        and Care Towards the End of Life (2010). Jones's influence on this\u000a      guidance, though real, is not easy to quantify, being one member of a\u000a      working group, but the impact of the guidance is significant. The GMC sets\u000a      the standards to which all doctors in the United Kingdom must adhere.\u000a    An example of impact that is more quantifiable is Jones's involvement in\u000a      the revision of the Interim Policy for Prosecutors in Respect of Cases of\u000a      Encouraging or Assisting Suicide. Jones was principal author of a\u000a      submission to the Crown Prosecution Service which both analysed the\u000a      Interim Policy and suggested specific changes. The submission was\u000a      discussed and agreed by all the Catholic bishops of England and Wales and\u000a      was sent to all Catholic parishes. The submission emphasised that the life\u000a      of all citizens merited the same degree of respect and protection by law\u000a      irrespective of whether they are disabled or terminally ill. During the\u000a      consultation period Jones, together with Archbishop Peter Smith, met\u000a      privately with Kier Starmer QC, the Director of Public Prosecutions, and\u000a      Jones subsequently engaged in an email correspondence with a member of\u000a      staff at the CPS to clarify the ethical issues at stake. The final policy\u000a      accepted all of the proposed changes in the bishops' submission. This can\u000a      be verified by a comparison of the Interim Policy, the bishops'\u000a      submission, and the Final Policy.\u000a    Another issue where Jones's research has had a major impact is the\u000a      controversy surrounding the Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient\u000a      (LCP). Jones has been a member of the LCP's National Reference Group from\u000a      2009 and his ethical analysis of the LCP was cited in a parliamentary\u000a      debate on the issue (8 Jan 2013: Hansard Column 47WH). At the request of\u000a      the Department of Christian Responsibility, Jones prepared a substantial\u000a      submission (18,000 words and 150 footnotes) for the Independent Review of\u000a      the LCP. Baroness Julia Neuberger, the chair of that review, found the\u000a      submission `a really thoughtful and detailed analysis of ethical issues'.\u000a      She invited Jones to meet with members of the Review panel and later\u000a      revealed that, `Prof Jones's submission was among several that were\u000a      particularly helpful to us in reaching our conclusions'.\u000a    The Independent Review made wide ranging recommendations, including the\u000a      replacement of the LCP, recommendations accepted by the government, the\u000a      Royal Colleges, the Care Quality Commission, the new Chief Inspector of\u000a      Hospitals, the regulatory bodies for healthcare professionals and other\u000a      interested parties. These recommendations are already starting to have a\u000a      major impact on care of the dying in England.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study will focus primarily on the ethics of end-of-life care as\u000a      an illustration of the impact of David Albert Jones' research.

He has written on the ethics of\u000a      organ donation from a Catholic perspective, including the problem of\u000a      diagnosing death in patients whose heart is still beating. He has also\u000a      contributed to reflection on the perplexing moral status of embryonic\u000a      creatures that are part-human, part-nonhuman. In each of these areas his\u000a      research has had a significant impact. This case study will focus\u000a      primarily on the influence of his research on end-of-life care.\u000a    Jones' doctoral research at Oxford University (1997 to 2001) examined the\u000a      theology of death. Between 2002 and 2013 Jones expanded this research and\u000a      applied it more specifically: to proposals for legislative change in\u000a      relation to assisted suicide and euthanasia; and to the ethical analysis\u000a      of end-of-life care.\u000a    There is a paradox in Christian theological reflection on death, in that\u000a      while the gospel promises hope of redemption through and from death, the\u000a      Church has consistently opposed suicide and mercy killing, more so than\u000a      either ancient pagan culture or than modern secular society. This paradox\u000a      discloses a truth that is also accessible to reason: an ethical approach\u000a      to the end of life must simultaneously respect life and accept death. The\u000a      former requirement implies, among other things, that death should never be\u000a      the aim of our action or inaction. The latter implies that we should not\u000a      flee from the inevitable by seeking every possible treatment. It is\u000a      sometimes thought that respect for life and acceptance of death are\u000a      incompatible so that one must choose between them, and it is common for\u000a      people to emphasise one or the other (and fall into the opposite failures\u000a      of undertreatment or overtreatment). However, virtue consists in\u000a      recognising the validity of both principles.\u000a    In relation to assisting suicide and euthanasia, Jones has shown how\u000a      legislative proposals typically fail to grant equal respect for the lives\u000a      of those who are disabled or terminally ill. In relation to end-of-life\u000a      care, he has argued that problems associated with end-of-life care\u000a      pathways should not be addressed by treating all patients as though they\u000a      were curable.\u000a    Jones was appointed to a full-time position at SMUC in March 2002 and\u000a      remained there until June 2010 in a role which included research,\u000a      lecturing and academic leadership. He was programme director of the MA in\u000a      Bioethics from September 2002 until June 2010. In 2007 he was appointed\u000a      professor on the basis of research and in 2008 he co-founded a centre for\u000a      research, teaching, and dialogue: The Centre for Bioethics and\u000a        Emerging Technologies (CBET). His research during this period (2002\u000a      to 2010) was shaped not only by personal interests and the needs of\u000a      curriculum development but also through engagement in public policy\u000a      debates and the deeper questions these raised.\u000a    In July 2010 Jones was appointed director of the Anscombe Bioethics\u000a      Centre in Oxford which is not formally affiliated to any HEI. His research\u000a      in this period built on work done between 2002 and 2010. In July 2013, he\u000a      returned to SMUC as a part-time (0.2 FTE) research fellow.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44544","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"3057568","Name":"Slovakia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3057568","Name":"Slovakia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1694008","Name":"Philippines"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3932488","Name":"Peru"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Although still ongoing, Redeeming Power has already had\u000d\u000a      significant, international impact, especially in relation to the Catholic\u000d\u000a      hierarchy, and those with oversight over the Church's response to\u000d\u000a      instances of abuse (and allegations thereof).\u000d\u000a    The launch conference featured around 60 delegates, coming from Austria,\u000d\u000a      Belgium, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, Peru, the Philippines, Poland,\u000d\u000a      Slovakia, the UK, the USA, and Vatican City. In addition to\u000d\u000a      university-based scholars from a large number of backgrounds (theology,\u000d\u000a      religious studies, canon law, secular law, education, bioethics,\u000d\u000a      paediatrics, psychology, sociology, and social work), the conference\u000d\u000a      attracted significant numbers of safeguarding professionals. Among these\u000d\u000a      were psychologists working with abuse survivors, the Safeguarding Officer\u000d\u000a      for the Archdiocese of Birmingham; and three current members (and one\u000d\u000a      former one) of the National Catholic Safeguarding Commission\u000d\u000a      (NCSC), including its current Chairperson. The NCSC is an independent body\u000d\u000a      established by the Catholic Church in England and Wales in response to the\u000d\u000a      Cumberledge Commission's final report (2007), with oversight over the\u000d\u000a      Church's safeguarding policies and procedures (see http:\/\/www.catholicsafeguarding.org.uk\/).\u000a      Among the keynote speakers were Monsignor (now Bishop) Charles Scicluna,\u000d\u000a      who was at that time the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith's\u000d\u000a      'Promotor of Justice' (i.e., its head prosecutor of abuse allegations),\u000d\u000a      and Bishop John Arnold, who is one of two representatives of the Catholic\u000d\u000a      Bishops' Conference of England and Wales on the steering committee of the\u000d\u000a      NCSC.\u000d\u000a    The one-day Bratislava conference, Prekon&#225;vanie zneu&#382;&#237;vania moci v\u000d\u000a        Cirkvi a v spolo&#269;nosti, brought together leading Slovak academics\u000d\u000a      with politicians, and journalists, to explore the theme 'overcoming abuse\u000d\u000a      in Church and society' with specific reference to the Central European,\u000d\u000a      post-communist situation. Finally, the Manila conference on 'Power and\u000d\u000a      Theology' included a half-day public event for over 100 theologians,\u000d\u000a      students, and Catholic educators (including papers from Bullivant and Pia\u000d\u000a      Matthews from St Mary's).\u000d\u000a    As mentioned above, a key 'impact aim' among the delegates at the launch\u000d\u000a      conference was the wider dissemination of academic research into the\u000d\u000a      nature and context of sexual abuse, in order to inform Church responses.\u000d\u000a      Part of its impact strategy, therefore, involved building &#8212; and thus\u000d\u000a      fostering dialogue &#8212; with key national and international figures. Even at\u000d\u000a      so early a stage (at the time of writing, only one of the main research\u000d\u000a      outputs has appeared in print), there is evidence that this strategy has\u000d\u000a      borne (and this, will continue to bear) notable fruits at both\u000d\u000a      international and national levels.\u000d\u000a    At an international level, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the\u000d\u000a      Faith's Mgr Charles Scicluna spoke to Vatican Radio from the launch\u000d\u000a      conference (as part of a half-hour feature programme on Redeeming\u000d\u000a        Power, also including an interview with Bullivant). Having mentioned\u000d\u000a      that the Vatican's own February 2012 'Toward Healing and Renewal'\u000d\u000a      conference was the Church hierarchy's 'opportunity to reflect on this most\u000d\u000a      tragic wound in the Church and in society', he emphasized the landmark\u000d\u000a      nature of Redeeming Power as:\u000d\u000a    ...an important moment to move from the hierarchy to the theologians.\u000d\u000a        I think that slowly, slowly, we're getting towards a response which is\u000d\u000a        truly ecclesial &#8212; we're in this together, in suffering the wound and\u000d\u000a        trying to respond to it &#8212; I think that's a very important aspect that I\u000d\u000a        bring away from the conference, to share concerns.

In September 2011 he was appointed as a committee\u000d\u000a      member of the European Society for Catholic Theology (ESCT), as its\u000d\u000a      delegate to the International Network of Societies for Catholic Theology\u000d\u000a      (INSeCT).\u000d\u000a    In recent decades, questions of power, and its capacity for abuse, have\u000d\u000a      emerged as urgent themes for theoretical and practical reflection within\u000d\u000a      the global Catholic context. This has, of course, been prompted both by\u000d\u000a      widespread revelations of sexual abuse, and by allegations of subsequent\u000d\u000a      cover-ups, mishandlings, and safeguarding failures. The monumental tasks\u000d\u000a      of, on the one hand, documenting and understanding these abuses, and on\u000d\u000a      the other, of seeking ways of 'healing' or 'overcoming' them &#8212; to the\u000d\u000a      extent that this is possible &#8212; and of preventing their happening again,\u000d\u000a      have begun in earnest. In light of this, the Redeeming Power\u000d\u000a      project took as its primary aim the task of engaging scholars from a wide\u000d\u000a      range of disciplinary backgrounds, and bringing these into contact not\u000d\u000a      only with each other, but also with safeguarding and social work\u000d\u000a      professionals, and those in key positions of oversight within the Catholic\u000d\u000a      hierarchy on this matter.\u000d\u000a    To accomplish this, an initial network of interested parties from a\u000d\u000a      number of European HEIs was created, with theologians and social\u000d\u000a      scientists from St Mary's University College (UK), Heythrop College (UK),\u000d\u000a      Durham University (UK), University College Dublin (Ireland), KU Leuven\u000d\u000a      (Belgium), Opole University (Poland), and Trnava University (Slovakia).\u000d\u000a      Following an initial planning meeting at St Mary's, hosted by InSpiRe, in\u000d\u000a      March 2012, two outward-facing events were organized: a launch conference\u000d\u000a      at St Mary's on 4-5 September 2012; and a one-day conference in Bratislava\u000d\u000a      in October 2012. A third conference, co-hosted by Redeeming Power\u000d\u000a      and DaKaTeo (the Catholic Theological Society of Philippines), was held in\u000d\u000a      Manila on 19-20 July 2013. Participants at the Redeeming Power meetings\u000d\u000a      have included both world-leading scholars of the abuse crisis, and those\u000d\u000a      at the 'sharp end' of the Catholic Church's institutional response.\u000d\u000a    Several of the main papers from the launch conference will be appearing\u000d\u000a      in a special issue of the European theology journal ET-Studies in\u000d\u000a      late 2013, co-edited by Bullivant. The conference proceedings from the\u000d\u000a      Bratislava event have already been published (in Slovak) in book form. A\u000d\u000a      book proposal for a major edited volume drawing largely on papers from the\u000d\u000a      Manila conference, entitled Theology and Power: An Intercontinental\u000d\u000a        Conversation (co-edited by Stephen Bullivant, Agnes Brazal, Daniel\u000d\u000a      Pilario CM, and Eric Genilo SJ), is currently under consideration by a\u000d\u000a      major international academic press.\u000d\u000a    Major findings from the research project include:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The urgent need for the Catholic Church, at a hierarchical and\u000d\u000a        institutional level, and theologians in general, to engage with and\u000d\u000a        learn from the emerging findings from the social sciences on the topic\u000d\u000a        of sexual abuse.\u000d\u000a      A new focus on structural and\/or systemic factors in\u000d\u000a        causing\/facilitating abuse, as opposed to blaming abuse on 'bad apples'\u000d\u000a        in otherwise well-functioning organizations.\u000d\u000a      Significant parallels between abuse crises within the Catholic Church\u000d\u000a        (and other religious bodies) and other, secular institutions (e.g., the\u000d\u000a        Savile affair at the BBC; the Sandusky case at the University of\u000d\u000a        Pennsylvania), both in terms of sexual abuse itself, and subsequent\u000d\u000a        mishandlings of allegations and cover-ups. This suggests that focusing\u000d\u000a        exclusively on 'Catholic-specific' causes or catalysts of abuse\u000d\u000a        (celibacy, 'clericalism') is misguided.\u000d\u000a      The extent to which cultures of secrecy and silence facilitate abuse\u000d\u000a        and its cover-ups; the need for increased transparency.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "}]

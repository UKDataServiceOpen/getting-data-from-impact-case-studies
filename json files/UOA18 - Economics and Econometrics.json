The first part of this research consisted of detailed statistical analysis of the\u000d\u000aeffects of tax structure on investment, productivity growth and overall economic growth in OECD\u000d\u000acountries over a period of more than 30 years. The second part of the research combined these\u000d\u000astatistical growth results with an analysis of how tax policy would affect short-term recovery and\u000d\u000ainequality, based on theoretical reasoning and analysis of published empirical research. The\u000d\u000aresearch was particularly influential because it was the most detailed research on this topic that\u000d\u000ahad been undertaken.\u000d\u000aThe main research findings were that a shift of taxation away from income taxes (particularly\u000d\u000acorporate income tax) towards consumption taxes and property taxes could increase growth, as\u000d\u000acould reductions in the top rate of personal income tax and the taxation of low-skilled workers. On\u000d\u000athe other hand, tax changes to promote short-term economic recovery at the lowest budgetary cost\u000d\u000awere likely to be cuts in the taxation of those on low incomes. Therefore, a reduction in the taxation\u000d\u000a(both personal income tax and social security contributions) of low-skilled workers would contribute\u000d\u000ato both the short-term goal of aiding recovery and the long-term goal of securing growth.\u000d\u000aThe research was started while Professor Heady was at the OECD and involved a number of\u000d\u000aOECD staff. Professor Heady was one of the two leaders of the project and he was responsible for\u000d\u000athe tax policy analysis. The other project leader was responsible for the statistical work. Following\u000d\u000aProfessor Heady's appointment to the University in 2009 he developed the research contained in\u000d\u000aan OECD report to which he had contributed (reference 1) into academically publishable research\u000d\u000aoutputs (reference 2 to reference 3).\u000d\u000aIn his new role he recognised the academic and impact potential of the research, and worked on\u000d\u000acombining the longer-term statistical results that had been obtained at the OECD with the new\u000d\u000ashort-run concerns of economic recovery. In view of the innovative nature of the research,\u000d\u000acombining long-run supply-side analysis with short-run demand side considerations, he worked\u000d\u000atowards publication in a high quality journal. His work was initially published as a University of Kent\u000d\u000adiscussion paper (reference 2) before being submitted to the Economic Journal. A revised version\u000d\u000awas accepted and published in 2011 (reference 3).\u000d\u000aIn order to engage more widely with the policy community and to inform debate on the issues, a\u000d\u000amedia briefing was prepared and issued by the Royal Economic Society (source 3), and Heady\u000d\u000aalso wrote an article for VoxEU, a website set up by the Centre for Economic Policy Research\u000d\u000aspecialising in economic policy issues and widely read by economists with a policy interest,\u000d\u000aparticularly in the European Union (reference 4).\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"544","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aProblems in the effectiveness of the CAP income payments system have been exacerbated with\u000d\u000athe two EU enlargements since 2000. The 12 New Member States are characterised by a large\u000d\u000apopulation of small and semi-subsistence farmers. Reference 2 indicates that the highest estimate\u000d\u000aof the joint population of small and semi-subsistence farmers was 11 million in the enlarged EU (27\u000d\u000aStates). This finding was used and cited by the European Commission, for example in the report by\u000d\u000athe Director in the Directorate of Agriculture and Rural Development in 2010 (source 6).\u000d\u000aThe research described in this case study started in the period of the second enlargement in 2007.\u000d\u000aBy that time the decisions about the CAP for the EU financial period 2007-2013 had already been\u000d\u000amade. The research findings have had an impact on the policy agenda and policy setting for the\u000d\u000aCAP post-2013 (sources 7 and 8).\u000d\u000aReferences 2 and 3 raised the issue of the lack of a rigorous definition of small and semi-subsistence farming. Reference 2 was commissioned by the European Network for Rural\u000d\u000aDevelopment (ENRD) and by the European Commission, Directorate General Agriculture and\u000d\u000aRural Development. On two occasions Davidova was invited to brief officials from the Directorate.\u000d\u000aThe seminar `Semi-subsistence farming in the EU: Current situation and future prospects' in\u000d\u000aOctober 2010, at which the paper was presented, was attended by the European Commissioner for\u000d\u000aAgriculture, Directors and Head of Units in the Directorate Agriculture and Rural Development, and\u000d\u000arural stakeholders from EU Member States. The results suggested a range of indicators and\u000d\u000athresholds that could be applied in the definition of semi-subsistence farming, for example a share\u000d\u000aof output sold as a proxy for market participation; economic size; or physical measures, for\u000d\u000aexample farm land smaller than 5 hectares, or a standard labour requirement as used in the UK.\u000d\u000aThese indicators were picked up and developed in the EU Agricultural Economic Brief of July 2011\u000d\u000a(source 4) `What is a small farm?' This brief referred explicitly to reference 4.\u000d\u000aReference 5 was commissioned by the European Parliament, Directorate General for Internal\u000d\u000aPolicies, Policy Department B: Structural and Cohesion Policies, Agriculture and Rural\u000d\u000aDevelopment. Professor Davidova was invited to present the main conclusions and\u000d\u000arecommendations to MEPs - members of COMAGRI. The final results of the research for\u000d\u000aSCARLED project (reference 7) were reported to the European Commission representatives at a\u000d\u000ameeting in Brussels in 2010.\u000d\u000aIn the legislative Proposal by the European Commission for a Regulation of the European\u000d\u000aParliament and of the Council establishing Rules for Direct Payments to Farmers under Support\u000d\u000aSchemes within the Framework of the Common Agricultural Policy (source 2, October 2011),\u000d\u000aArticle 49(1b), the highest threshold for small farms has been set at 3 hectares. Reference 1\u000d\u000arecommended a flat cash multiannual payment to small and semi-subsistence farms funded\u000d\u000aby the Rural Development fund. It also suggested that although it is tempting to ask for business\u000d\u000aplans and set mid-term performance targets the costs of such control might rapidly exceed the\u000d\u000abenefits. In the Proposal for Regulation on establishing rules for direct payments to farmers under\u000d\u000asupport schemes within the framework of CAP, the text of Article 49(2) specifies that the\u000d\u000asupport to small farmers will be a flat payment between EURO 500 and 1,000 without a\u000d\u000arequest for a business plan. These policy proposals identified by the research were acted\u000d\u000aupon by the Commission and were taken up by the Council and Parliament (reference 6)\u000d\u000aand adopted in June 2013 (source 7).\u000d\u000aReferences 2 and 3 also argued that the importance of small farmers is in maintaining the\u000d\u000atraditional landscape and vitality of rural communities. References 1 and 2 underlined the social\u000d\u000aand welfare role of semi-subsistence farming by estimating the value of non-marketed output and\u000d\u000aits contribution to total household incomes. These ideas have had impact on the economic\u000d\u000ajustifications for support to small farmers. For example, in his speech in October 2010, the\u000d\u000aEuropean Commissioner for Agriculture cited the research and emphasised that \"the\u000d\u000aperformance of small farms can be measured not only in terms of economic\u000d\u000acompetitiveness but also by their role in the sustainable management of natural resources\u000d\u000aand land use\" (sources 5 and 3). In addition, The Special Euro Barometer on CAP (2011) asked\u000d\u000ain Section 1.3 for justifications of simplification of support to small farmers, including options as to\u000d\u000atheir role in social activity and in their contribution to the beauty of the countryside (sources 1 and\u000d\u000a3).\u000d\u000aThe direct beneficiary of the research has been agricultural policy makers in the European\u000d\u000aCommission who (i) were able to identify the group of small and semi-subsistence farmers;\u000d\u000a(ii) had academic research supporting the positive roles of these farmers beyond the output\u000d\u000aof food and fibre; and (iii) were provided with ideas for improved support design to small\u000d\u000afarmers that could involve lower transaction costs. The indirect, but important, beneficiaries\u000d\u000aare the 11 million small farmers who, within the CAP for the period 2013-2020, will enjoy a\u000d\u000asimplified flat-rate payment scheme for support, which was agreed by the European Parliament\u000d\u000ain June 2013 (source 7).\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aThis case study describes how research undertaken by Sophia Davidova and Alistair Bailey\u000d\u000acontributed to raising the issue of the welfare of small farmers in Europe onto the EU policy\u000d\u000aagenda.

Yet taxpayers' money has not contributed\u000d\u000aeffectively to the CAP's main objectives, which are to ensure a fair standard of living for the\u000d\u000aagricultural community and to contribute to the stability of farm incomes. Under the label of `income\u000d\u000asupport', CAP transfers have mainly benefitted large farms, a regressive policy, increasing the farm\u000d\u000aincome gap between large and small farmers. Moreover, the landscape of European agriculture\u000d\u000ahas changed as a consequence of the two enlargements since 2000, which have resulted in a\u000d\u000amassive expansion in the number of small and semi-subsistence farmers.\u000d\u000aResearch by Davidova et al described the capacity of subsistence farming to alleviate rural poverty\u000d\u000aand improve welfare in the poorer EU New Member States (references 1, 5). The CAP Rural\u000d\u000aDevelopment Regulation has a measure to facilitate the market integration of semi-subsistence\u000d\u000afarming, and the research provided insights into the factors that can stimulate this process,\u000d\u000aparticularly technology, and the attitude and perceptions of farming households were revealed as\u000d\u000aimportant factors influencing the commercialisation process (reference 1). One of the practical\u000d\u000adifficulties faced by policy makers is in defining the policy target group, as `small' and `semi-subsistence' farms can be defined in a variety of ways by applying different indicators. For\u000d\u000ainstance, if semi-subsistence is defined to be farms which consume more than 50% of their output,\u000d\u000athen it is a very substantial group of 5.8 million farmers (48% of all farms in the EU). The research\u000d\u000ainvestigated different indicators (market participation, economic size and various measures of\u000d\u000aphysical size of the farm), emphasising their strengths and weaknesses, and the sensitivity of\u000d\u000aestimates of the total population of small farms in Europe to the selected criterion (references 1, 2,\u000d\u000aand 3).\u000d\u000aAnother insight that relates to the impact is the provision of ecosystem services by small and semi-subsistence farmers. Research conducted for the Structural Change in Agriculture and Rural\u000d\u000aLivelihoods (SCARLED) project (reference 6), disseminated via conference papers and reports to\u000d\u000athe European Network for Rural Development and the European Parliament, found a negative and\u000d\u000asignificant relationship between environmental efficiency and market integration, supporting the\u000d\u000aclaim that semi-subsistence farming is environmentally friendlier than specialised commercial\u000d\u000aoperations. The research also indicated that awareness of the positive externalities (social benefits\u000d\u000aexceed private benefits) supplied by small farmers in general is very limited among policymakers\u000d\u000aand the wider population, and so more information and engagement is necessary (references 3, 5).\u000d\u000aThe underpinning research described above was undertaken by Sophia Davidova (lead researcher\u000d\u000aand Director of the School's Centre for European Agri-Environmental Studies, CEAS) and Alastair\u000d\u000aBailey, both at Kent. The project started in 2007 with an EU FP6 research grant, funded by the\u000d\u000aEuropean Commission, titled SCARLED. This was a continuation of the long-term interests of\u000d\u000aProfessor Davidova into the differences in farm structures in the EU and the factors affecting their\u000d\u000aefficiency. SCARLED (reference 7) had project partners from Universities and Research Institutes\u000d\u000ain seven other EU Member States.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"545","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aAs described below, the impact of the research has been to a) inform policy debate on the\u000d\u000aeconomic role of independent schools and discussion of social mobility within the state education\u000d\u000asector; b) to shape government policy towards funding for the teaching of shortage subjects; and c)\u000d\u000ato improve public awareness and understanding of the issues.\u000d\u000aThe research has informed debate amongst practitioners and the education and economic\u000d\u000apolicy community.

In order to address\u000d\u000adeclining social mobility, the government should also devote more resources to enable the\u000d\u000aacademically best-performing schools and\/or the most able pupils in the state sector to compete\u000d\u000awith their independent sector counterparts for places at leading universities and popular subjects,\u000d\u000aperhaps through early identification, provision of extracurricular activities and career guidance.\u000d\u000aThe Government responded to this debate in learned societies, parliament and the media,\u000d\u000ainformed by this research, and has placed the teaching of STEM subjects as a national\u000d\u000apriority.

It was the first major quantitative research of\u000d\u000athe economic role of independent schools in England to use large micro data sets. The project\u000d\u000ainvolved secondary analyses of several large survey data sets in order to examine the economic\u000d\u000aeffects of independent schools over time (reference 4).\u000d\u000aIndependent schools employ an increasingly disproportionate share of teachers in Britain, relative\u000d\u000ato the number of their pupils. Their teachers are more likely than state school teachers to possess\u000d\u000apost-graduate qualifications, and to be specialists in shortage subjects. Recruitment from the state\u000d\u000asector is an important and growing source of new teaching staff for independent schools, and\u000d\u000arepresents a small though increasing deduction from the supply of new teachers available to state\u000d\u000aschools. Independent school teachers enjoy greater job satisfaction, work with fewer pupils, enjoy\u000d\u000alonger holidays and, in the case of women, shorter weekly hours. Among women, pay is lower in\u000d\u000athe independent sector. For men, there is no significant inter-sectoral difference in pay. However,\u000d\u000afor both men and women there is evidence of a substantial pay premium for independent school\u000d\u000ateachers trained in shortage subjects (references 1, 4).\u000d\u000aThe researchers firstly examined trends in the economic return to attendance at an independent\u000d\u000aschool over recent decades both for males and females. They estimated both the labour market\u000d\u000areturn, and the impact on the academic achievement of pupils. They also examined whether the\u000d\u000alabour market return had become more associated with academic achievement than in earlier\u000d\u000adecades (references 2, 3). Secondly they examined the role of independent schools in the labour\u000d\u000amarket for teachers. They investigated differences in labour market outcomes (wages, hours,\u000d\u000aholidays, job satisfaction) for independent and state school teachers, how these differences may\u000d\u000ahave changed over time, and how the differences may be associated with transitions between the\u000d\u000astate and independent sectors (reference 1). Thirdly they provided evidence showing that\u000d\u000aindependent schools deliver key skills and academic success, especially in STEM subjects\u000d\u000a(science, technology, engineering and mathematics), that are most in demand in the modern\u000d\u000aeconomy: the independent\/state school wage differential of teachers has risen significantly over\u000d\u000atime, and a significant factor has been faster rising educational attainment for independently-\u000d\u000aeducated individuals (references 2, 3).\u000d\u000aThe project started in 2006 and was undertaken by Yu Zhu (Kent), Francis Green (Kent until 2010),\u000d\u000aStephen Machin (UCL) with research assistance from Richard Murphy (funded by the project, and\u000d\u000abased at UCL).

The OFT uses various advanced quantitative methods, e.g.,\u000d\u000a      econometric techniques,\u000d\u000a      simulations, event studies, and difference-in-differences to measure the\u000d\u000a      impacts of its many\u000d\u000a      interventions. These impacts influence HMT's allocation of resources to\u000d\u000a      the OFT and the allocation\u000d\u000a      of resources across OFT activities.\u000d\u000a    Davies' academic research has direct implications for the OFT's\u000d\u000a      evaluations. In particular, he has\u000d\u000a      shown that: (i) policy interventions often have much larger (and\u000d\u000a      unintended) long-term\u000d\u000a      consequences; (ii) the choice of methodology is inextricably linked with\u000d\u000a      what is the appropriate\u000d\u000a      counterfactual; (iii) all methodologies have weaknesses which should be\u000d\u000a      more explicitly\u000d\u000a      acknowledged than they currently are. He makes various recommendations\u000d\u000a      (pages 37-43) for\u000d\u000a      improvement in OFT practices. In some cases, these concern the OFT's\u000d\u000a      detailed assumptions and\u000d\u000a      calibrations, for example on cartel duration and overcharge, and the costs\u000d\u000a      of monopoly abuse; in\u000d\u000a      others, they relate to the applicability of simulation methods and\u000d\u000a      sensitivity analysis. He also\u000d\u000a      argues for more flexibility in the broad methodology, for example,\u000d\u000a      attaching statistical confidence\u000d\u000a      intervals and assessing the likely impact of deterrence &#8212; a subject of\u000d\u000a      current research interest.\u000d\u000a    The OFT's published response (OFT, 2010) states that some of Davies'\u000d\u000a      recommended changes\u000d\u000a      would be introduced immediately and the feasibility of others would be\u000d\u000a      explored in coming months.\u000d\u000a      Changes have indeed been made, as acknowledged in its current Positive\u000d\u000a      Impact document: \"We\u000d\u000a      implemented some changes to our methods last year (such as for example\u000d\u000a      revising our default\u000d\u000a      price assumption when estimating impact of our competition enforcement\u000d\u000a      cases). We intend to\u000d\u000a      continue working on some of the other suggestions made by Professor Davies\u000d\u000a      in his review &#8212; such\u000d\u000a      as for example, testing our methodology to estimate impact of our consumer\u000d\u000a      work over 2011-12.\"\u000d\u000a      (OFT, 2011, p11).\u000d\u000a    Some of Davies' other recommendations have instigated further ongoing\u000d\u000a      research in the OFT and\u000d\u000a      will be acknowledged in future years' positive impacts.\u000d\u000a    These changes help improve existing estimates of the returns from\u000d\u000a      competition policy in general\u000d\u000a      and the relative contributions of different areas (e.g. mergers versus\u000d\u000a      cartels).\u000d\u000a    Davies' academic research has also been influential in helping the OFT\u000d\u000a      shape future policy. Its\u000d\u000a      chief economist has outlined its impact on the methods that the\u000d\u000a      organisation uses in evaluation\u000d\u000a      saying: \"He has played a particularly crucial role in respect of the OFT's\u000d\u000a      evaluation programme,\u000d\u000a      which he has audited for us on a regular basis, pushing us to be more\u000d\u000a      innovative and ambitious.\u000d\u000a      Steve Davies was commissioned by the OFT to do an independent evaluation\u000d\u000a      of the impact on\u000d\u000a      productivity of removing RPM (resale price maintenance) in the books\u000d\u000a      industry.

In\u000d\u000a      each of these areas, policy and the Law are heavily influenced by the\u000d\u000a      research findings of\u000d\u000a      Industrial Economists, particularly those guided by the quantitative\u000d\u000a      techniques of econometricians,\u000d\u000a      for example, simulation of structural models, event studies using stock\u000d\u000a      market data, and difference-in-differences,\u000d\u000a      using ex-post before-and-after analysis relative to a control (the\u000d\u000a      unaffected market).\u000d\u000a    In turn, this evaluation of the OFT has led to subsequent requests for\u000d\u000a      advice and research on this\u000d\u000a      subject from the OECD and the CAs of various other countries around the\u000d\u000a      world (see below).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"1420","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research by L&amp;D has influenced policy on merger remedies made by\u000d\u000a      competition authorities\u000d\u000a      across Europe; specifically:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      European Commission (DG Competition)\u000d\u000a      UK Competition Commission and Office of Fair Trading.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The focus here is on documented evidence of influence on merger remedy\u000d\u000a      guidelines - in\u000d\u000a      particular on the specification of licensing agreements used as a remedy\u000d\u000a      in mergers involving\u000d\u000a      Intellectual Property Rights. This follows from research finding a) in\u000d\u000a      section 2. It is highlighted\u000d\u000a      because L&amp;D's influence is clearly observable: the European Commission\u000d\u000a      (EC) incorporated their\u000d\u000a      recommendation into its 2008 guidelines.\u000d\u000a    The final revised `Notice on Merger Remedies' was published in October\u000d\u000a      2008 ([I] in section 5).\u000d\u000a      L&amp;D were the only respondents to comment on the inadequacy of\u000d\u000a      `reasonable and non-\u000d\u000a      discriminatory (RAND)' licensing in the draft guidelines [II]. In direct\u000d\u000a      response to L&amp;D's criticism,\u000d\u000a      backed by their detailed research of pharmaceuticals market, the draft\u000d\u000a      section 65 in the final Notice\u000d\u000a      was replaced by a requirement for precise formulas:\u000d\u000a    \"It has to be further ensured that the terms and conditions under which\u000d\u000a      the licences are\u000d\u000a      granted do not impede the effective implementation of such a licence\u000d\u000a      remedy. If no clearly\u000d\u000a      determined terms and conditions for the granting of licences exist in the\u000d\u000a      market at stake,\u000d\u000a      the terms and conditions, including the pricing, should be clearly\u000d\u000a      apparent from the\u000d\u000a      commitments (e.g. by way of pricing formulas). An alternative solution may\u000d\u000a      be to rely on\u000d\u000a      royalty-free licences.\" Wording to this effect was also added to section\u000d\u000a      38.\u000d\u000a    In order to understand how this is a major impact, we trace how L&amp;D's\u000d\u000a      research came to the\u000d\u000a      attention of those responsible for determining EC policy. The EC had\u000d\u000a      consulted on the revised draft\u000d\u000a      Notice on Merger Remedies [III]. Section 65 of the draft included the\u000d\u000a      following extract relating to\u000d\u000a      licensing terms:\u000d\u000a    \"As regards the terms and conditions, it may be appropriate to rely on\u000d\u000a      commonly accepted\u000d\u000a      licensing terms in the industry at stake, i.e., if appropriate, on RAND as\u000d\u000a      used in some\u000d\u000a      standardisation processes\".\u000d\u000a    L&amp;D's research had found that similar terms such as `adequate\u000d\u000a      compensation' and `normal and\u000d\u000a      non-discriminatory commercial conditions' \"... are open to abuse leading\u000d\u000a      to ineffective remedies.\u000d\u000a      Much clearer guidance is necessary to determine commercial terms and\u000d\u000a      licence duration such that\u000d\u000a      competition will be fully restored\" [4].\u000d\u000a    L&amp;D submitted evidence on this to the consultation ([IV]), with\u000d\u000a      extracts from [4] including:\u000d\u000a      \"Insufficient attention was also paid in several cases to licensing terms,\u000d\u000a      concerning royalties,\u000d\u000a      arbitration, and duration.

The fact that this was a\u000d\u000a      direct result of L&amp;D's research is\u000d\u000a      corroborated by Dr Svend Albaek (adviser of the Chief Competition\u000d\u000a      Economist's Team in the\u000d\u000a      European Commission) in the extract reproduced in [a]. There is further\u000d\u000a      evidence that Commission\u000d\u000a      practice has actually changed to the benefit of consumers as a\u000d\u000a      result. The required licensing\u000d\u000a      remedies must now be \"irrevocable, exclusive and royalty free\" (e.g.\u000d\u000a      merger cases Teva\/Barr\u000d\u000a      M.5295; Abbott\/Solvay M.5661).\u000d\u000a    While impact on UK competition guidelines is less straightforward to\u000d\u000a      document, it is no less\u000d\u000a      significant. Lyons was a part-time member of the UK Competition Commission\u000d\u000a      (2002-11) and,\u000d\u000a      because of his research on merger remedies, was invited to be a founding\u000d\u000a      member of its\u000d\u000a      Remedies Standing Group (2002-06) and to join its Economics Advisory\u000d\u000a      Committee (2008-11).\u000d\u000a      During this period he was able to influence Commission thinking, and its\u000d\u000a      revised guidelines\u000d\u000a      (October 2008, [V]). As a result, Lyons has input his research knowledge\u000d\u000a      into discussions and\u000d\u000a      commented on drafts prior to consultation. This is acknowledged by Peter\u000d\u000a      Freeman CBE, QC,\u000d\u000a      Chairman of the Competition Commission 2006-11 in the extract reproduced\u000d\u000a      in [b].\u000d\u000a    Because of his research on merger remedies, Lyons was also invited to\u000d\u000a      give seminars on this topic\u000d\u000a      to competition authorities across Europe. He disseminated his knowledge on\u000d\u000a      remedy design, and\u000d\u000a      likely influenced subsequent actions:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      March 2006 - Central European Competition Initiative in Budapest\u000d\u000a      January 2008 - UK Competition Commission\u000d\u000a      May 2009 - Norwegian Competition Authority, Bergen\u000d\u000a      Sept 2010 - Norwegian Competition Law Association, Sandefjord\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Finally, in addition to the impact of L&amp;D research on merger remedy\u000d\u000a      guidelines, one of the novel\u000d\u000a      simulation methodologies developed in [4] has been adopted by the OFT for\u000d\u000a      screening relevant\u000d\u000a      mergers and justifying actual decisions ([c]).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Competition authorities (CAs) often regulate mergers through the\u000d\u000a      imposition of remedies.

The\u000d\u000a      research developed a\u000d\u000a      novel methodology for appraising merger remedies, including the\u000d\u000a      development of simplified\u000d\u000a      simulations. A key part of the research consisted of detailed quantitative\u000d\u000a      case studies of a number\u000d\u000a      of mergers, including ex post reviews of `what happened next'. L&amp;D's\u000d\u000a      focus was on paper &amp; paper\u000d\u000a      products and pharmaceuticals mergers. This was in order to understand the\u000d\u000a      breadth of issues from\u000d\u000a      relatively homogeneous products to high research-and-development\u000d\u000a      innovation markets. Access to\u000d\u000a      confidential data normally inaccessible to academics was facilitated by an\u000d\u000a      in-house descriptive\u000d\u000a      study of problems of remedy implementation conducted simultaneously by the\u000d\u000a      EC's Directorate\u000d\u000a      General for Competition. The research drew on earlier empirical studies on\u000d\u000a      contracts and\u000d\u000a      transaction costs ([1], [2]) and weaknesses in EU merger control [3].\u000d\u000a    Key results of L&amp;D's pioneering research [4] led to practical\u000d\u000a      recommendations including:\u000d\u000a    a) Licensing contracts can be an ineffective remedy because they result\u000d\u000a      in a long-term\u000d\u000a      relationship with a competitor who can raise the licensee's costs. L&amp;D\u000d\u000a        concluded that\u000d\u000a        licences should specify clear and well defined terms (including duration\u000d\u000a        and payments)\u000d\u000a        that do not result in anticompetitive pricing.\u000d\u000a    b) There could be disproportionately high transaction costs in applying\u000d\u000a      remedies,\u000d\u000a      particularly in relation to small businesses (e.g. a single pharmaceutical\u000d\u000a      in a small\u000d\u000a      national market, where there may be very few potential buyers). L&amp;D\u000d\u000a        recommended\u000d\u000a        that remedy packages should be carefully designed to address issues of\u000d\u000a        buyer fit and\u000d\u000a        transaction costs. Behavioural remedies (e.g. price commitments) would\u000d\u000a        sometimes be\u000d\u000a        the best option for isolated markets or small countries, and where large\u000d\u000a        buyers have an\u000d\u000a        incentive to monitor.\u000d\u000a    c) Divestiture trustees are instructed by firms, with the Commission's\u000d\u000a      approval. L&amp;D found\u000d\u000a      a principal-agent problem that, in practice, impeded the restoration of\u000d\u000a      competition. L&amp;D\u000d\u000a        concluded that the Competition Authority should instruct Trustees\u000d\u000a        directly.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"2411","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aChief Economist and Deputy Secretary of the LPC, Tim Butcher, stated, \"The National Minimum\u000d\u000aWage was recently voted the most successful policy in the last thirty years and Professor Stewart's\u000d\u000apioneering work was instrumental in gaining widespread acceptance of the NMW in the UK\"\u000d\u000a(Butcher (2013a), p2).\u000d\u000aThis impact is evident in the Low Pay Commission's annual reports which analyse the effects of\u000d\u000athe NMW and recommend changes (\"upratings\") in its level. The LPC's recommendations are\u000d\u000abased on an evaluation of current knowledge about the effects of such upratings on employment,\u000d\u000ahours worked, and a variety of other labour market outcomes. These reports are very influential:\u000d\u000athe Government has always accepted the LPC's recommendations on annual changes to the\u000d\u000aminimum wage.\u000d\u000a\"Professor Stewart's work has been cited in thirteen of the fourteen reports so far produced by the\u000d\u000aLPC,\" including all of the reports since 2009 (Butcher (2013a), p1). \"Much of [his] early work...\u000d\u000afocussed on investigating the impact of the minimum wage on employment [(Stewart (2002),\u000d\u000aStewart (2003), Stewart (2004a), Stewart (2004b)]...1 This research concluded that... the\u000d\u000aintroduction of the minimum wage, and its subsequent initial increases, had not adversely affected\u000d\u000aemployment. These findings were valuable insights that enabled Commissioners to be less\u000d\u000acautious in their approach to raising the minimum wage.\" (Butcher (2013a), p1-2)\u000d\u000a\"The next phase of his research... concerned the impact of the minimum wage on hours [Stewart\u000d\u000aand Swaffield (2004)].2 In contrast to the earlier literature, they found some... negative effects on\u000d\u000ahours over the long run... However, the reduction in hours was less than the increase in the\u000d\u000aminimum wage, thereby increasing weekly pay. These findings convinced Commissioners that the\u000d\u000alow paid had not suffered a reduction in weekly earnings.\" (Butcher (2013a), p2) Recognising that\u000d\u000asome of the LPC decisions predate the current impact period, Butcher concluded, \"I should note\u000d\u000athat [Stewart's] findings on employment and hours were particularly important in determining\u000d\u000aCommissioners' recommendations in the period between 2001 and 2008 (and the impacts of those\u000d\u000adecisions continue to this day) but they have continued to play a role in the decisions made since\u000d\u000athen.\" (Butcher (2013b), p1).\u000d\u000a\"A further area of research, and most recent, concerned the impact of the minimum wage on the\u000d\u000adistribution of earnings. In a thorough and comprehensive study... for the 2010 LPC report,\u000d\u000aProfessor Stewart [measured] the effect of the minimum wage on earnings higher up the earnings\u000d\u000adistribution (spillover effects)... [and] concluded that spillovers were small or limited. This further\u000d\u000ahelped Commissioners to view the effects of the minimum wage so far as relatively benign, and\u000d\u000ainfluenced their recommendations appropriately.\" (Butcher (2013a), p2).3\u000d\u000aThe reach and significance of Professor Stewart's \"pioneering work ... in gaining widespread\u000d\u000aacceptance of the NMW\" (Butcher (2013a), p2) is considerable. As described above, the direct\u000d\u000abeneficiaries were policymakers at the LPC tasked with evaluating and setting recommended\u000d\u000aminimum wages, but indirect beneficiaries include minimum wage employees, firms who employ\u000d\u000alow wage employees, and even the public at large, via increased tax revenues and reduced benefit\u000d\u000apayments.\u000d\u000aIn its most recent report, the LPC estimates 1.4 million workers (5.8% of the work force) were paid\u000d\u000abelow the then-forthcoming minimum wage of &#163;6.08 per hour (LPC (2012), p36). If features of the\u000d\u000adistribution of wages in the absence of a NMW were similar to that in 1998, the last year when\u000d\u000aevidence on below-minimum wages is available, then we estimate the NMW increased wages\u000d\u000aamong low-wage workers by an average of &#163;1.53 per hour (&#163;2,678 per year), or &#163;3.7 billion in\u000d\u000a2011.4 These income increases are tangible, material benefits that improve welfare for low-wage\u000d\u000aemployees.\u000d\u000aThe NMW has also advanced other social goals, including reducing income inequality, decreasing\u000d\u000athe gender wage gap, increasing tax revenues, and lowering aggregate benefit payments.\u000d\u000aDickens, Riley, and Wilkenson (2012) estimate that each ten percentage point increase in the\u000d\u000aproportion of workers affected by the NMW is associated with a 4% lower growth rate in income\u000d\u000ainequality. LPC (2012, p42) demonstrated that the NMW also reduced the gender pay gap from\u000d\u000a15.8% to 8.3% at the median of the pay distribution and from 13.1% to 4.7% in the lowest decile.\u000d\u000aFinally, LPC (2012, p152) estimated the October 2012 uprating increased government tax revenue\u000d\u000ain the 2012\/13 budget cycle by &#163;112 million and lowered tax credits and benefit payments by &#163;78\u000d\u000amillion.\u000d\u000aFinally, firms that employ such workers also benefit from the NMW as they are protected against\u000d\u000aunfair competition from rivals who might otherwise cut wages and other working conditions,\u000d\u000aimposing costs on their employees and society as a whole. Contrary to its position at the time the\u000d\u000aNMW was introduced, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), the UK's largest business\u000d\u000aorganisation, now concludes \"The CBI supports the NMW ... and the role of the independent LPC\u000d\u000ain setting it... The NMW was implemented successfully and we accept that it has delivered benefit\u000d\u000ato the low paid and did not adversely impact on overall levels of employment growth...

Simple labour market theory predicts that introducing a minimum wage\u000d\u000aleads employers to cut employment. In contrast, models that take into account employers' market\u000d\u000apower, the use of wages to elicit high employee effort, and\/or job search suggest that a minimum\u000d\u000awage may not reduce and could even increase employment. There is similar uncertainty in the\u000d\u000atheory about the effects of a minimum wage on hours worked and spillover effects on wages for\u000d\u000aworkers above the minimum.\u000d\u000aThe UK introduced a national minimum wage in 1999, increasing wages for an estimated 1.3\u000d\u000amillion employees - 5.5% of the labour force. The LPC was created to evaluate the consequences\u000d\u000aof the new minimum, as well as subsequent increases (\"upratings\") in its level.\u000d\u000aStewart (2002, OBES) compared employment growth in regions where the NMW caused wages to\u000d\u000aincrease significantly to regions where wages were less affected, and found no difference in\u000d\u000aemployment growth across regions. In contrast to the textbook model, there didn't seem to be\u000d\u000anegative employment effects of the minimum wage.\u000d\u000aSubsequent research confirmed these (negligible) employment effects with more granular data.\u000d\u000aStewart (2004, JEEA) used three separate longitudinal datasets to analyse the difference in\u000d\u000asubsequent employment between those affected and those not affected by the minimum before\u000d\u000aand after the introduction of the NMW. If the NMW had a negative employment effect, this\u000d\u000adifference should have increased significantly. Across all three datasets, he found no effect.\u000d\u000aStewart (2003, LPC Report) and Stewart (2004, EJ) extended this analysis to subsequent\u000d\u000aupratings in the minimum wage in 2000 and 2001, finding no significant adverse effect on\u000d\u000aemployment for any demographic groups.\u000d\u000aIn a 2010 BIS survey of minimum wage research, each of the investigations described above was\u000d\u000asingled out for its methodological innovation and each has served as a foundation for other\u000d\u000aeconomists to analyse similar questions (BIS (2010, p49-50)). In discussing Stewart (2002), Chief\u000d\u000aEconomist and Deputy Secretary of the LPC, Tim Butcher, concluded, \"[Stewart's] methodology\u000d\u000alaid the foundations for future work using large datasets to look at individual employment\u000d\u000aprobabilities and spatial analysis taking advantage of geographical variations.\" (Butcher (2013a,\u000d\u000ap1)\u000d\u000aIn joint work with Joanna Swaffield at the University of York (Stewart and Swaffield (2004, LPC\u000d\u000aReport)), Stewart looked at the impact of the NMW on the working hours of low-wage employees,\u000d\u000afinding that it reduced their basic hours by between 1 and 2 hours per week. Subsequent research\u000d\u000aby other authors on upratings has determined this to be a one-off effect of the introduction of the\u000d\u000anew minimum. Further work for the LPC (Stewart (2009, LPC Report)) investigated whether\u000d\u000aincreases in the NMW had effects on wages beyond the increases required to bring the lowest\u000d\u000awage employees up to the new minimum. For the most plausible scenario, the evidence of\u000d\u000aspillover effects is weakest, lessening any concerns that there are adverse effects of the NMW.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"2412","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a            Professor Oswald's research has had impacts on both public policy\u000a              and on public understanding, both in the UK and abroad.\u000a            Oswald's public policy impact was reflected in the Office of\u000a              National Statistics' (ONS) 2010 launch of the Measuring National\u000a              Well-being Programme. Oswald was active in this initiative,\u000a              presenting to ONS staff and serving on the ONS National Well-being\u000a              Advisory Forum. Lord Gus O'Donnell, UK Cabinet Secretary from\u000a              2005-2011, reflected, \"Oswald's research into happiness helped\u000a              show that serious and important policy conclusions flowed from\u000a              understanding the level and determinants of people's subjective\u000a              well-being. It helped me directly in arguing the case for getting\u000a              the ONS to start measuring well-being. Now that we have leaders\u000a              from David Cameron to Ben Bernanke arguing that well-being is the\u000a              ultimate goal of policy, it is clear that the pioneers like Andrew\u000a              have been very effective in getting across the implications of\u000a              their research\" (O'Donnell (2013)).\u000a            Ewen McKinnon, from the Analysis and Insights team at the Cabinet\u000a              Office, stated \"I work on national well-being policy across\u000a              government...

Stephen Aldridge, Director\u000a              for Analysis and Innovation in the Department of Communities and\u000a              Local Government (DCLG), added \"Professor Oswald's work has been\u000a              crucial ... in explaining the key drivers of happiness and\u000a              well-being, both in general and for particular groups, such as the\u000a              elderly, in both the UK and other countries\" (Aldridge (2013)).\u000a            Internationally, an early and prominent effort to better measure\u000a              social welfare was the Stiglitz Commission on the Measurement of\u000a              Social and Economic Progress (Stiglitz, Sen, Fitoussi (2009), or\u000a              SSF), initiated by President Nicholas Sarkozy. Oswald was a member\u000a              of the Commission, which concluded that both objective and\u000a              subjective measures of well-being are important and should be\u000a              analysed. Oswald's journal articles are referenced as early,\u000a              fundamental research throughout the Stiglitz Commission report.\u000a            Dr Marco Mira d'Ercole, OECD economist and rapporteur of the SSF\u000a              quality of life chapters, concluded, \"The... SSF Commission proved\u000a              to be extremely influential in policy discussions, moving the\u000a              issue of measuring performance beyond GDP from academic circles to\u000a              the policy field.... There is today an established international\u000a              agenda on measuring performance beyond GDP that simply did not\u000a              exist in 2008. Andrew played an important role in articulating the\u000a              implications of [his and other subjective well-being] research for\u000a              policy and statistical work\" (Mira d'Ercole (2013)).\u000a            Dr Mira d'Ercole continued, \"Beyond his role in the SSF\u000a              Commission, Andrew is today one of the most prominent researchers\u000a              using [subjective well-being] measures to value non-market\u000a              outcomes.\" Oswald commented upon and is cited heavily in a number\u000a              of OECD publications on measuring well-being (OECD (2011), OECD\u000a              (2013)). \"It would not be an overstatement to say that Andrew's\u000a              work on valuing non-market outcomes is one of the most important\u000a              contributions to this area in the last decade or so...

With his innovative and sometimes\u000a              provocative research, Oswald turned economists' attention to\u000a              people's happiness, correlating it with personal characteristics\u000a              (e.g. age, absolute income, relative income), macroeconomic\u000a              variables (e.g. inflation and unemployment), and observable\u000a              measures of quality of life. In so doing, he established himself\u000a              as one of the world's leading researchers on the economics of\u000a              happiness and well-being, and highlighted the shortcomings of\u000a              Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a measure of economic and social\u000a              well-being.\u000a            Clark and Oswald (1996, JPubE) produced the first\u000a              microeconometric evidence that people's well-being, depends on\u000a              their relative rather than absolute income. Data from a\u000a              sample of 5,000 British employees showed that their satisfaction\u000a              was weakly correlated with their absolute pay but strongly\u000a              correlated with their relative pay.\u000a            Oswald (1997, EJ) established Oswald as a leading scholar\u000a              on the measurement of happiness and its correlation with more\u000a              conventional measures of economic well-being. In this\u000a              thought-provoking paper, he described the patterns in modern\u000a              happiness data and challenged the assumption that rising\u000a              productivity and GDP necessarily imply that society is better off.\u000a              He found that happiness appeared to be increasing much more slowly\u000a              over time than income in both the US and Europe, and that\u000a              happiness correlated positively with income and marriage, and with\u000a              being a woman, white, well-educated, self-employed, retired, or a\u000a              homemaker. It also established for the first time that an\u000a              individual's happiness over a lifetime is U-shaped and that\u000a              happiness shows a powerful negative correlation with unemployment.\u000a            Di Tella, MacCulloch, and Oswald (2001, AER; 2003, REStat)\u000a              established the sub-field of the macroeconomics of happiness. This\u000a              was the first research into the link between people's self-\u000a              reports of perceived happiness and macroeconomic variables such as\u000a              unemployment and inflation. These articles took data on\u000a              approximately 300,000 randomly sampled workers and showed that -\u000a              after controlling for individual characteristics, country fixed\u000a              effects, and year dummies - the misery index (equal to inflation\u000a              plus unemployment) underweights the well-being costs of\u000a              unemployment: when times are bad, people are typically unhappier\u000a              than one would expect. The work also demonstrated the link between\u000a              unemployment-benefit generosity and national happiness, an issue\u000a              that continues to resonate in the aftermath of the 2008 financial\u000a              crisis.\u000a            Blanchflower and Oswald (2004, JPubE) examined historical\u000a              annual data on a range of well-being indicators for Great Britain\u000a              and the USA and showed that the structure of life satisfaction\u000a              equations is almost identical across the countries. It also\u000a              suggested a method to place a dollar value on the happiness\u000a              consequences of life events like the death of a spouse.\u000a            A final article, by Oswald and Wu (2010, Science), is\u000a              notable for two reasons. First, using data on more than one\u000a              million Americans, it demonstrated that subjective measures of\u000a              well-being correlate well with objective measures of quality of\u000a              life based on the longstanding economic theory of compensating\u000a              differentials and spatial arbitrage. Second and unusually for\u000a              economics research, it appeared in Science and thus\u000a              crossed the boundary from economics research (narrowly conceived)\u000a              into the broader scientific community.\u000a            "},{"CaseStudyId":"2413","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Broadberry and Crafts' early research and 1990s policy influence has a\u000d\u000a      current, continuing impact,\u000d\u000a      which is enhanced by their contemporary impact on public attitudes\u000d\u000a      and government policies.\u000d\u000a    In the late 1990s, Broadberry and Crafts' research contributed to New\u000d\u000a      Labour's response to\u000d\u000a      Thatcherism, for example, in HM Treasury's `Productivity Agenda' from 1999\u000d\u000a      and 2000.

Dr Charles\u000d\u000a      Bean, Deputy Governor\u000d\u000a      for Monetary Policy at the Bank of England, commented, \"The historical\u000d\u000a      perspective afforded by\u000d\u000a      [Crafts'] research into Britain's comparative economic performance ... has\u000d\u000a      provided policymakers\u000d\u000a      with a unique perspective on the engines of growth and the [supply-side]\u000d\u000a      policies to support it...\u000d\u000a      While the importance of supply was contentious in the 1980s during the\u000d\u000a      Thatcher years, I think it is\u000d\u000a      fair to say that it is now accepted by all the main political parties and\u000d\u000a      Crafts' work has played into\u000d\u000a      providing the hard evidence to support that belief\" (Bean (2013)).\u000d\u000a    Ken Warwick, former Director General at the Department for Business,\u000d\u000a      Innovation, and Skills (BIS),\u000d\u000a      commented \"[Crafts] is the economist of choice for anyone working on\u000d\u000a      economic policy in the field\u000d\u000a      of productivity, economic growth, and a wide range of supply-side\u000d\u000a      policies...

Particular areas where he has been influential in\u000d\u000a      policy thinking include\u000d\u000a      competition policy &#8212; where for example his work had direct impact on\u000d\u000a      policy development for the\u000d\u000a      1998 Competition Act ...and approaches to the labour market and industrial\u000d\u000a      relations.

Crafts is\u000d\u000a      notable for targeting\u000d\u000a      academics, policymakers, and the broader public through his writing.\u000d\u000a      Crafts is one of the most\u000d\u000a      highly-read authors on VoxEU, a leading economics blog which publishes\u000d\u000a      research in non-technical\u000d\u000a      language for a general-interest audience. His eight articles since 2008\u000d\u000a      attracted over\u000d\u000a      150,000 page views. Dr Bean concurs, \"I think it is worth recording\u000d\u000a      Crafts' efforts to engage with\u000d\u000a      policymakers and the wider public. For instance, he delivered last year's\u000d\u000a      well-received Royal\u000d\u000a      Economic Society Policy Lecture [and] is a regular contributor to the Vox\u000d\u000a      website ([where] his\u000d\u000a      recent contributions... have garnered over 30,000 hits each) and to the\u000d\u000a      quality press.\"\u000d\u000a    Crafts' research has also had a contemporary policy impact. The economic\u000d\u000a      and policy analysis\u000d\u000a      team at BIS (and its predecessor BERR) have relied on Crafts (2013) to\u000d\u000a      motivate the Coalition\u000d\u000a      Government's pro-growth policies limiting the adverse impacts of\u000d\u000a      regulation and continuing to\u000d\u000a      invest in transport infrastructure (BERR (2008), BIS (2010a), BIS\u000d\u000a      (2010b)). Indeed, three of the\u000d\u000a      `four pillars' of the current Government's Plan for Growth &#8212; lowering\u000d\u000a      regulatory and legal barriers to\u000d\u000a      starting and growing a business, encouraging investment, and creating a\u000d\u000a      more educated workforce\u000d\u000a      &#8212; are identical to those in Crafts (1996) and repeated throughout\u000d\u000a      Broadberry and Crafts' research.\u000d\u000a    Lord Gus O'Donnell, former UK Cabinet Secretary 2005-2011, concluded,\u000d\u000a      \"The Treasury has\u000d\u000a      struggled for years to understand the determinants of growth and\u000d\u000a      productivity. Crafts' work has\u000d\u000a      been fundamental to putting this policy area on a much stronger footing...\u000d\u000a      His emphasis on the\u000d\u000a      importance of the right structural reforms had a big impact on the\u000d\u000a      Treasury's thinking and directly\u000d\u000a      influenced the debates about what should go in various budgets.\u000d\u000a      Governments have taken on\u000d\u000a      board many of his points such as the need to improve the planning system\u000d\u000a      and to strengthen\u000d\u000a      competition\" (O'Donnell (2013)). Warwick added, \"With the global financial\u000d\u000a      and economic crisis in\u000d\u000a      2008-09, the Government's approach to economic and industrial policy\u000d\u000a      shifted somewhat &#8212; with a\u000d\u000a      greater emphasis on strategic intervention, countercyclical policy and\u000d\u000a      sectoral strategy... [Crafts']\u000d\u000a      work has proved a salutary reminder of the dangers of excessive\u000d\u000a      intervention and the risks\u000d\u000a      associated with trying to `pick winners' [in industrial policy]. [This]\u000d\u000a      helped analysts in Government\u000d\u000a      shape the new approach to industrial policy in ways that were consistent\u000d\u000a      with the literature and the\u000d\u000a      lessons from past experience\" (Warwick (2013).\u000d\u000a    Kingman and Smewing add, \"Crafts' more recent work continues to shape\u000d\u000a      thinking at the Treasury.\u000d\u000a      In particular his Royal Economic Society lecture of 2012 [Publication (6)\u000d\u000a      above] and associated\u000d\u000a      work has contributed to internal policy debate and policy development on\u000d\u000a      crucial supply-side\u000d\u000a      issues. One notable area is planning reform, where his research fed into\u000d\u000a      the policy development\u000d\u000a      leading up to the publication of the \"Plan for Growth\" alongside Budget\u000d\u000a      2011.

Based on this\u000d\u000a      research, they articulated \"supply-side\" policies designed to foster\u000d\u000a      economic growth.1\u000d\u000a    Bean and Crafts (1996) documented the decline in British productivity\u000d\u000a      relative to a 12-country peer\u000d\u000a      group between 1950 and 1973. Their research revealed Britain's relative\u000d\u000a      economic decline to be\u000d\u000a      due to low investment and low total-factor productivity (TFP) growth,\u000d\u000a      probably because of shortfalls\u000d\u000a      in workforce training and a lack of product and process innovation. They\u000d\u000a      further found that\u000d\u000a      fragmented bargaining and the frequent presence of multiple unions reduced\u000d\u000a      TFP growth in the\u000d\u000a      period. These findings were confirmed in Broadberry and Crafts (1996),\u000d\u000a      which analysed patterns in\u000d\u000a      labour productivity in the manufacturing sector and found that British\u000d\u000a      manufacturing suffered from a\u000d\u000a      lack of human capital formation and that British industrial relations\u000d\u000a      induced \"overmanning\" and a\u000d\u000a      failure to obtain the full productivity gains from new technology.\u000d\u000a    Broadberry and Crafts (2003), citing 19 papers by one or both of the\u000d\u000a      authors, summarise their\u000d\u000a      research between 1992 and 2003 to conclude that British productivity\u000d\u000a      growth was lower than it\u000d\u000a      could have been between 1950 and 1973 by about 1 per cent, causing Britain\u000d\u000a      to fall behind other\u000d\u000a      European countries (notably West Germany) in manufacturing and services.\u000d\u000a      It confirmed that this\u000d\u000a      poor performance was driven particularly by poor British labour relations\u000d\u000a      and a lack of competition\u000d\u000a      in British product markets.\u000d\u000a    This research was noted for its early advocacy of policies that are now\u000d\u000a      common in pro-growth\u000d\u000a      economic reforms. For example, Crafts (1996) recommended policies (1) to\u000d\u000a      stimulate investment,\u000d\u000a      (2) to enhance workforce skills acquisition, e.g. by investing in\u000d\u000a      education, (3) to promote\u000d\u000a      innovation, (4) to enhance appropriability through the reform of corporate\u000d\u000a      law and regulation, and\u000d\u000a      (5) to promote competition. All of these proposals were implemented by\u000d\u000a      Labour and Coalition\u000d\u000a      governments and continue to be a policy focus today. Crafts' recent\u000d\u000a      research has reinforced the\u000d\u000a      particularly important role played by competition in enhancing\u000d\u000a      productivity growth (Crafts (2012)).\u000d\u000a    As public and policy debate intensified over the slow recovery of the\u000d\u000a      British economy from the\u000d\u000a      2008 financial crisis, Professor Crafts synthesised the implications of\u000d\u000a      this literature for\u000d\u000a      contemporary policy-making in an influential Royal Economic Society (RES)\u000d\u000a      Policy lecture and\u000d\u000a      companion research paper (Crafts (2013)). Drawing on lessons from\u000d\u000a      macroeconomic and growth-oriented\u000d\u000a      policy responses in the 1930s and 1980s, Crafts advocated for policies\u000d\u000a      reversing the\u000d\u000a      decline in government infrastructure investment and promoting road\u000d\u000a      pricing, enhancing incentives\u000d\u000a      in education, shifting taxes from income to consumption and property,\u000d\u000a      relaxing planning\u000d\u000a      regulations, and discouraging competition-distorting industrial policy. He\u000d\u000a      concluded that despite\u000d\u000a      the constraints placed on fiscal policy by the need to reduce government\u000d\u000a      debt, and on monetary\u000d\u000a      policy by the Zero Lower Bound to nominal interest rates, targeted\u000d\u000a      supply-side policies could\u000d\u000a      enhance productivity and growth.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"2414","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Waterson's research and policy recommendations have been used by\u000d\u000a      competition and sector regulators to reduce search and switching costs and\u000d\u000a      promote competition, both of which benefit consumers. Dr Amelia Fletcher,\u000d\u000a      Chief Economist at the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) from 2001-2013 noted,\u000d\u000a      \"Since 2001, the OFT has had a remit to carry out market studies where\u000d\u000a      competition does not seem to be working well for consumers. As Chief\u000d\u000a      Economist at the OFT [in] that time, I was involved in developing our\u000d\u000a      framework and methodology for carrying out such studies. Waterson's work\u000d\u000a      on search and switching costs ... was very influential in this...\u000d\u000a      including recent studies into personal current accounts (2008-9) and\u000d\u000a      consumer contracts (2011)\" (Fletcher (2013)).\u000d\u000a    Under UK competition law, the OFT may refer a market to the Competition\u000d\u000a      Commission (CC) for investigation. Robin Finer, Director of Economic\u000d\u000a      Analysis at the CC, said \"Waterson's work on consumer behaviour,\u000d\u000a      particularly in relation to search and switching, has had an important\u000d\u000a      impact in several of the CC's market investigations... Some important\u000d\u000a      examples of investigations where we have identified substantial barriers\u000d\u000a      to consumer search and\/or switching are: store cards, domestic bulk liquid\u000d\u000a      petroleum gas, home credit, personal current account banking services in\u000d\u000a      Northern Ireland, and payment protection insurance...1 In all of\u000d\u000a        these cases, it was important to identify the relevant barriers to\u000d\u000a        search and\/or switching, to understand their impact on competition, and\u000d\u000a        to identify suitable remedies to help customers overcome them. Professor\u000d\u000a        Waterson's work contributed heavily to providing a sound theoretical\u000d\u000a        basis for all of these steps in our analysis and in improving outcomes\u000d\u000a        for consumers\" (Finer (2013).\u000d\u000a    Finer concluded, \"The influence of Waterson's work on the CC's approach\u000d\u000a      to market investigations can be seen from our recently updated guidelines\u000d\u000a      for market investigations (April 2013), where we outline the potential\u000d\u000a      importance of customer behaviour, particularly in terms of search and\u000d\u000a      switching, in making competition work effectively, ... both in terms of\u000d\u000a      our competitive assessment and our choice of remedies\" (Finer (2013)).\u000d\u000a    The Government's centrepiece economic policy, `Plan for Growth', also\u000d\u000a      cites Giulietti, Otero, and Waterson (2010) in support of its statements\u000d\u000a      about the importance of competition and that \"markets rely heavily on\u000d\u000a      active and informed consumers to drive competition\" (BIS (2011, p12)).\u000d\u000a    Waterson's work has been prominently cited in government documents in\u000d\u000a      Finland, Australia, the European Commission, and the World Bank. Former\u000d\u000a      Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Deputy Chair, Louise\u000d\u000a      Sylvan, concluded \"Waterson's published work on the ways in which...\u000d\u000a      consumers drive competition... were seminal to our initial thinking and\u000d\u000a      the direction of our subsequent work both in the recommendations on\u000d\u000a      superannuation regulation in Australia in 2010 and more globally through\u000d\u000a      the... Economics of Consumer Policy work that I chaired... at the OECD [in\u000d\u000a      2010]\" (Sylvan (2013)).\u000d\u000a    Professor Crawford's research directly impacted Ofcom's decision to ban\u000d\u000a      rollover contracts. Ofcom concluded, \"Our research, in particular the\u000d\u000a      econometric analysis that we commissioned on the switching behaviour of BT\u000d\u000a      customers [i.e. the Crawford research], indicates a clear causal link\u000d\u000a      between ARCs and reduced levels of consumer switching. We believe ... that\u000d\u000a      any example of such a contract is likely to be harmful to consumers and to\u000d\u000a      effective competition\" (Ofcom (2011, p1)). Based on these conclusions,\u000d\u000a      Ofcom prohibited automatically renewable contracts in the fixed voice and\u000d\u000a      fixed broadband small business and residential sectors from 31 December\u000d\u000a      2012 (ibid).\u000d\u000a    Dr Andrea Coscelli, Director of Economics at Ofcom, said of this process,\u000d\u000a      \"Professor Crawford and his colleagues were able to use sophisticated\u000d\u000a      econometric analysis to separate out and identify the effects of rollover\u000d\u000a      terms and showed that they did in fact materially inhibit [consumer]\u000d\u000a      switching [behaviour]... We had wrestled with these issues prior to the\u000d\u000a      involvement of Professor Crawford and without his input we would have\u000d\u000a      found it difficult to make a robust case (both internally and externally)\u000d\u000a      that [rollover] terms [in consumer contracts] were having an adverse\u000d\u000a      effect... The impact of the work was enhanced by the clear presentation of\u000d\u000a      the final results to key decision makers within Ofcom and this had a\u000d\u000a      significant effect on our final decision\" (Coscelli (2013b)).\u000d\u000a    Policymakers responsible for enhancing competition are direct\u000d\u000a      beneficiaries of this research, but the reach and significance extend to\u000d\u000a      consumers for whom a reduction in such costs provides tangible benefits.\u000d\u000a      For example, reporting on the consequences of remedies introduced after\u000d\u000a      the payment protection insurance investigation, the CC concluded, \"the\u000d\u000a      total consumer detriment to be addressed would be significantly more than\u000d\u000a      &#163;200m per year. The remedies package as a result incorporated significant\u000d\u000a      information provision requirements to enhance search and switching.\u000d\u000a      Implementation necessarily involved costs but the net benefit of the\u000d\u000a      measures taken was evaluated as being substantially positive\" (CC (2009)).\u000d\u000a    The estimated direct benefit to consumers of eliminating the switching\u000d\u000a      costs induced by BT's rollover contracts was 33.5% of the price of\u000d\u000a      telephone service, equal to at least &#163;120 million\/year (Crawford et. al.\u000d\u000a      (2012)). Ofcom has banned or threatened to ban rollover contracts in\u000d\u000a      residential and small business broadband services and mobile services\u000d\u000a      (Ofcom (2011, p5)), which would extend the value of consumer benefits by\u000d\u000a      an additional &#163;220 million\/year, for a total of &#163;340 million\/year.2\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Professor Michael Waterson demonstrated how two consumer activities &#8212;\u000d\u000a      search and switching &#8212; are necessary if competition is to benefit\u000d\u000a      consumers. He showed how search and switching costs inhibit the\u000d\u000a      competitive process; highlighted how firms increase these costs in retail,\u000d\u000a      banking, insurance and energy markets, and recommended government measures\u000d\u000a      to empower consumers.

Waterson challenged the received\u000d\u000a      wisdom that more firms automatically increase competition and make\u000d\u000a      consumers better off, using existing studies to highlight how search and\u000d\u000a      switching costs inhibit the competitive process, and demonstrating this\u000d\u000a      effect in several industries. He identified how firms increase search\u000d\u000a      costs &#8212; by obscuring information about prices and the whole cost of a\u000d\u000a      contract &#8212; and impose prohibitive switching costs, and showed how these\u000d\u000a      costs make it difficult for consumers to make efficient choices,\u000d\u000a      regardless of the number of firms. Waterson argued that regulators should\u000d\u000a      explore novel strategies to empower consumers and discipline firm\u000d\u000a      behaviour to improve the functioning of markets.\u000d\u000a    His first paper, Waterson (2003), showed how search and switching costs\u000d\u000a      can keep prices high even with a large number of firms, and highlighted\u000d\u000a      firms' strategies to enhance these costs, from persuasive advertising to\u000d\u000a      failing to list prices to the introduction of loyalty programs or\u000d\u000a      bundling. He further demonstrated how differences in search or switching\u000d\u000a      costs &#8212; in industries from insurance to banking to energy &#8212; could explain\u000d\u000a      differences in firm profitability across these industries.\u000d\u000a    Waterson subsequently demonstrated these effects in the newly deregulated\u000d\u000a      UK gas and electricity markets. In Giulietti, Waddams, and Waterson\u000d\u000a      (2005), he collected survey data to analyse consumer awareness of new\u000d\u000a      entrants into the natural gas market and their willingness to switch\u000d\u000a      suppliers. He found that consumer beliefs about the functioning of the\u000d\u000a      market are important and that under realistic scenarios about search and\u000d\u000a      switching behaviour, consumers would be no better off despite the\u000d\u000a      increased competition. Giulietti, Otero, and Waterson (2010) analysed\u000d\u000a      deregulated electricity prices and found significant variation in prices\u000d\u000a      across incumbents and entrants over time consistent with large search and\u000d\u000a      switching costs. They concluded that price and product information, and\u000d\u000a      consumers' willingness to exploit it are necessary for these markets to\u000d\u000a      function adequately, and recommended regulatory policies ranging from\u000d\u000a      making prices more transparent to changing the terms for continuing supply\u000d\u000a      from the same provider.\u000d\u000a    Professor Crawford demonstrated that switching costs are also an issue in\u000d\u000a      telecommunications markets. The UK telecommunications regulator, Ofcom,\u000d\u000a      became concerned when BT, the largest telecommunications provider in\u000d\u000a      Britain, introduced and marketed heavily automatically renewable, or\u000d\u000a      \"rollover\", contracts for residential and small business telephone and\u000d\u000a      broadband internet service. In exchange for a discount on their service,\u000d\u000a      these contracts imposed significant early termination charges on a\u000d\u000a      recurring basis unless households acted in a short window at the end of\u000d\u000a      each annual contract. Ofcom commissioned Professor Crawford to evaluate\u000d\u000a      the impact of rollover contracts on household switching behaviour,\u000d\u000a      controlling for the discount provided by the contracts and other\u000d\u000a      potentially confounding factors (Crawford, Tosini, and Waehrer (2010a,\u000d\u000a      2010b)). This work was subsequently submitted for academic publication\u000d\u000a      (Crawford, Tosini, and Waehrer (2011)).\u000d\u000a    Crawford and his co-authors evaluated switching behaviour among a random\u000d\u000a      sample of BT customers. They found, controlling for other factors that\u000d\u000a      influence switching behaviour, that rollover households switch after their\u000d\u000a      first contract period 34.8% less than comparable customers on standard\u000d\u000a      plans, inducing switching costs on the order of 33.0% of the monthly price\u000d\u000a      of the average BT fixed-voice telephone service. This raised significant\u000d\u000a      concerns about the competitive effects of such contracts in\u000d\u000a      telecommunications markets.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"2415","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Professor Scharf's research shaped public and policymakers' views about\u000d\u000a      Gift Aid reform and the favourable tax treatment of charitable\u000d\u000a      contributions.1\u000d\u000a    Jeremy Sherwood, Branch Head, Charity Tax at HM Treasury, stated \"[the\u000d\u000a      Scharf and Smith] research provides very valuable evidence on a topic\u000d\u000a      where robust UK data is surprisingly scarce... The research has been\u000d\u000a      enormously helpful in providing analytical information to help explore the\u000d\u000a      various proposals and their likely impacts on donor behaviour\" (2009). In\u000d\u000a      response to the Report, HMRC and HM Treasury officials invited sector\u000d\u000a      representatives to participate in an open forum (HM Treasury (2010)), and\u000d\u000a      the final report of this forum drew on the 2009 report to outline\u000d\u000a      proposals for Gift Aid reform (Fanning (2010)). More recently, Scharf's\u000d\u000a      research underpins the entire section of \"Coalition Government proposals\u000d\u000a      to encourage philanthropy\" in their plans regarding Gift Aid reform (House\u000d\u000a      of Commons (2012a)).\u000d\u000a    Scharf's research also triggered a spirited public discussion about the\u000d\u000a      role of charitable donations in public life and their tax treatment. This\u000d\u000a      came to a head in late Spring 2012 when the Government proposed to cap tax\u000d\u000a      relief for deductions, including charitable deductions.\u000d\u000a    The uproar from charities and their donors was immediate. 19 charities\u000d\u000a      cited Scharf and Smith (2009) in making public statements or policy\u000d\u000a      proposals since 2008 about Gift Aid or the cap on charitable deductions.\u000d\u000a      Scharf provided non-academic presentations and blog posts, several of\u000d\u000a      which were prominently reported in the media. The Guardian editorial of 17\u000d\u000a      April 2012 concluded Scharf and Smith (2009) offered the \"best evidence\"\u000d\u000a      on tax incentives (Guardian (2012)) and both authors discussed their\u000d\u000a      research on the Today programme (BBC Radio 4). In response to the uproar,\u000d\u000a      the Government did a quick U-turn: while the cap on deductions was indeed\u000d\u000a      introduced in April 2013, charitable deductions are excluded from this\u000d\u000a      limit (House of Commons (2012b)).\u000d\u000a    Karl Wilding, Head of Policy, Research, and Foresight at the National\u000d\u000a      Council for Voluntary Organisations, reflected, \"The recent disagreement\u000d\u000a      between HMT and the charity sector in relation to unrestricted tax reliefs\u000d\u000a      and Gift Aid highlighted the ongoing difficulties faced by the sector in\u000d\u000a      the battle for evidence-informed policy... The sector needs... more work\u000d\u000a      such as the economic analysis by Smith and Scharf on the price of\u000d\u000a      giving... Smith and Scharf had an impact on the debate by providing a\u000d\u000a      balanced, independent commentary. I am confident that Smith and Scharf\u000d\u000a      made a contribution to the debate and, as such, ... had a real impact in\u000d\u000a      the charity sector\" (Wilding (2012)).\u000d\u000a    Lockwood's methods for estimating the impact of a financial services VAT\u000d\u000a      also had an immediate effect on government policy, this time in the EU.\u000d\u000a      Lockwood's methods for analysing the costs and benefits of a VAT were\u000d\u000a      adapted by the European Commission (EC) to calculate whether the financial\u000d\u000a      sector receives favourable tax treatment. Finding that it did, the EC\u000d\u000a      subsequently used this result to justify a novel Financial Transactions\u000d\u000a      Tax (FTT). Mr. Gaetan Nicodeme, Head of Sector in the Directorate-General\u000d\u000a      for Taxation and Customs Union in the EC, noted \"The approach taken in\u000d\u000a      [Annex 5 to the 2011 FTT proposal] to calculate the share of irrecoverable\u000d\u000a      VAT is similar to the one taken by De la Feria and Lockwood (2010) in\u000d\u000a      Appendix A of their study. The only difference is that they used OECD IO\u000d\u000a      tables instead of Eurostat's tables\" (Nicodeme (2013)). It concluded that\u000d\u000a      the financial sector has a tax advantage of at least &#8364;14 billion, or 0.11%\u000d\u000a      of Euro area GDP.\u000d\u000a    Lockwood's Fiscal Studies article also formed the basis of a\u000d\u000a      consultation with PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) on the appropriate taxation\u000d\u000a      of the financial sector. Frans Oomen, partner for Indirect Taxes at PwC,\u000d\u000a      concluded, \"During the project, Lockwood added significant knowledge,\u000d\u000a      insight, conceptual thinking, and quality in ... developing a conceptual\u000d\u000a      framework as well as using statistical information to build an economic\u000d\u000a      model and a methodology [to assess] whether the VAT exemptions for banking\u000d\u000a      services in the EU lead to a lower level of VAT revenues as compared to a\u000d\u000a      full VAT taxation system of banks. In [PwC's] view, the findings of the\u000d\u000a      report have contributed to a wider and better understanding of the\u000d\u000a      financial and economic implications of the EU VAT system and to the\u000d\u000a      discussions around the EU's tax policy introducing a Financial\u000d\u000a      Transactions Tax as an additional tax for the financial sector\" (Oomen\u000d\u000a      (2013)). Another project sponsored by a separate division within the EC\u000d\u000a      also relied on de la Feria and Lockwood's methodology to quantify the\u000d\u000a      effects of the taxation of financial services (IFS (2011)).\u000d\u000a    Scharf's and Lockwood's research have had significant and meaningful\u000d\u000a      effect in debates about the tax treatment of charities and financial\u000d\u000a      services. Scharf's research played a significant role in the debate that\u000d\u000a      ultimately prevented charitable donations from being included in a\u000d\u000a      deductions cap. It also has influenced public and policymaker\u000d\u000a      understanding about the likely impact of changes in Gift Aid rules in an\u000d\u000a      environment where more than 50% of UK residents make charitable\u000d\u000a      contributions worth over &#163;4 billion on an annual basis.\u000d\u000a    While the primary beneficiaries of Lockwood's research have been EC\u000d\u000a      policymakers, the public at large will benefit from the increased tax\u000d\u000a      revenues the FTT will bring. From 2014, the FTT will tax exchanges of\u000d\u000a      shares and bonds at a rate of 0.1% and derivative contracts at a rate of\u000d\u000a      0.01% and is estimated to raise &#8364;57 billion annually, approximately 0.4%\u000d\u000a      of EU GDP (EC (2012)).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Professors Kimberley Scharf and Benjamin Lockwood have influenced public\u000d\u000a      and policy debate leading to tax policy changes in the UK and EU.

Professor Scharf's early\u000d\u000a      research provided a critical assessment of the tax treatment of charitable\u000d\u000a      donations in Canada (CPRN, 1997), showing how tax incentives for giving\u000d\u000a      can be used by a low-income majority to shift the burden of public good\u000d\u000a      provision towards higher-income minorities (2000, JPubEcon), and how their\u000d\u000a      presence can promote economic segregation along income lines (2007,\u000d\u000a      JPubEcon).\u000d\u000a    UK income tax relief for donations was introduced in 2000 with the Gift\u000d\u000a      Aid scheme. It has since become the largest source of tax relief for\u000d\u000a      charitable activities. Gift Aid grants tax relief both in the form of a\u000d\u000a      `match' that is paid directly to charities and, for high-rate taxpayers,\u000d\u000a      and as a tax rebate for a portion of the tax due on the value of the\u000d\u000a      donation.\u000d\u000a    Initially it was assumed that the match and the rebate would provide\u000d\u000a      equivalent incentives for giving decisions, but in 2007 HMRC commissioned\u000d\u000a      Professor Scharf and Professor Sarah Smith (Bristol University) to measure\u000d\u000a      how giving might vary with changes in Gift Aid rules and report on\u000d\u000a      alternatives for Gift Aid reform. This research found that the \"price\u000d\u000a      elasticity of giving\" for the UK was in line with corresponding US\u000d\u000a      estimates where the rebate component of Gift Aid was concerned, but was\u000d\u000a      significantly higher for the match component. This implied that a shift in\u000d\u000a      the delivery of tax relief from one method to the other may have sizeable\u000d\u000a      effects on the volume of private donations. It also implied that\u000d\u000a      reallocating one pound from funding public provision to funding tax relief\u000d\u000a      could raise the combined volume of public and private provision if that\u000d\u000a      relief was delivered in the form of a match rather than a rebate.\u000d\u000a    The financial services sector has also enjoyed special tax treatment, via\u000d\u000a      an exemption from Value Added Tax (VAT). The exemption was granted largely\u000d\u000a      for practical reasons: since roughly two- thirds of all financial services\u000d\u000a      earn profit based on a margin (e.g. a bid-ask spread) rather than a posted\u000d\u000a      price, it is more difficult to implement the invoice-credit system of VAT\u000d\u000a      collection. The industry benefits from not having to charge VAT to its\u000d\u000a      ultimate customers, but suffers from not being able to claim tax relief\u000d\u000a      for the VAT it pays on inputs, so-called `Stuck VAT'. Following the 2008\u000d\u000a      financial crisis, policy-makers began to question the merits of VAT\u000d\u000a      exemption of financial services.\u000d\u000a    In an influential 2010 paper in Fiscal Studies, de la Feria and\u000d\u000a      Lockwood (2010) use OECD input-output data to estimate Stuck VAT for the\u000d\u000a      financial services sector in six EU countries, finding it accounted for\u000d\u000a      between 0.4 and 1.5% of sector tax revenue. In 2011,\u000d\u000a      PricewaterhouseCoopers asked Lockwood to extend his analysis of a\u000d\u000a      financial service sector VAT to 26 EU countries, to a time frame of 2000\u000d\u000a      to 2007, and to estimate the tax revenue gains and thus the net effects of\u000d\u000a      a financial sector VAT (Lockwood (2011)). Given assumptions about cost\u000d\u000a      pass-through and the tax- cascading that would cause any equilibrium\u000d\u000a      effects, Lockwood predicted that a financial services VAT would lower\u000d\u000a      ultimate tax revenues as the losses in Stuck VAT exceeded the gains from\u000d\u000a      taxing retail financial services.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3690","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The collapse of Northern Rock in 2007 gave rise to an urgent need to\u000a      inject liquidity into the financial system. Given this, the Bank of\u000a      England was willing to accept a wider-than-usual range of collateral\u000a      against loans, but it wanted a correspondingly higher interest rate\u000a      against any weaker collateral that it accepted. The Bank's existing\u000a      mechanisms for injecting liquidity into the markets raised a number of\u000a      significant operational issues (See Fisher et al (2011) for further\u000a      details -[section 5, C5]). To resolve these issues, the Bank of\u000a      England consulted Professor Klemperer, a leading researcher in auction\u000a      theory who had played a major role in the design of the auction for the\u000a      British 3G telecom licenses in 2000 [C5, p.4 and C6, p.9].\u000a    Professor Klemperer's `product mix' auction, described in section 2,\u000a      directly addresses the Bank of England's problem. In the context of\u000a      long-term repo operations, the `bidders' in the product-mix auction are\u000a      the Bank's counterparties, the `differentiated products' or `product\u000a      varieties' correspond to loans of central bank reserves that the Bank\u000a      makes against the narrow or the wider collateral set. The prices at which\u000a      counterparties bid are expressed as a spread (in basis points) to Bank\u000a      Rate (subject to a minimum spread of zero). The `overall supply\u000a      constraint' is the pre-announced quantity of central bank reserves that\u000a      the Bank is willing to supply through the auction.\u000a    The product-mix auction meets the Bank's objectives of:\u000a    \u000a      Allowing a broader range of collateral;\u000a      Charging different interest rates for the loans depending on the\u000a        quality of the collateral in order to reduce moral hazard;\u000a      Allowing market conditions, as revealed by the bids, to determine both\u000a        the interest rate premium for inferior collateral and the proportion of\u000a        inferior collateral accepted; and\u000a      Permitting borrowers to specify how the collateral they supply will\u000a        depend on the auction outcome.\u000a    \u000a    In 2010, the new auction was adopted as the Bank's standard mechanism for\u000a      long-term repo operations [C1, C2, C3]. The considerable\u000a      advantages of Klemperer's new auction over earlier mechanisms are set out\u000a      in a recent Bank of England paper [C5]. Expressing the bids as\u000a      spreads to Bank Rate (with a minimum spread of zero) eliminates the\u000a      interest rate risk arising from unexpected movements in the spread of\u000a      market rates to Bank Rate. Moreover, the spread that the Bank charges to\u000a      lend against weaker collateral is determined within the auction - as the\u000a      market becomes more stressed, counterparties are willing to pay more to\u000a      borrow against weaker collateral - and so the Bank no longer has to make a\u000a      judgment about the appropriate spread to charge counterparties. As market\u000a      stress increases, and the spread between the rates on wider\u000a      collateral-backed and narrow collateral-backed loans widens, the auction\u000a      design automatically allows the range of collateral accepted to increase.\u000a      As a result, the Bank of England is better able to manage the liquidity of\u000a      the financial system, particularly during periods of stress. A review of\u000a      the performance of the new auction design after one year of operation\u000a      concluded that \"based on the operations to date, the Bank is satisfied\u000a      that the operational framework meets the objectives of the ILTRs\" [C5,\u000a        p.14].\u000a    The auction design is highly innovative in the field of central banking,\u000a      and was a first of its kind in any field. Commenting in a magazine article\u000a      in 2010, Paul Fisher, Executive Director, Markets and Member of the\u000a      Monetary Policy Committee noted \"`the Bank's Indexed Long-Term Repo\u000a      [auctions] represent a world first in central banking...This is\u000a      potentially a major step forward in practical policies to support\u000a      financial stability\" [C10, p.14]. In a speech in March 2011, Paul\u000a      Fisher observed \"the academic profession can make a significant\u000a      contribution to the field of central bank operations. In this paper I have\u000a      highlighted one example in particular where our thinking has benefitted\u000a      considerably from such insight\" [C6, p.15]. More recently, The\u000a      Bank's Governor, Sir Mervyn King, observed \"The Bank of England's use of\u000a      Klemperer auctions in our liquidity insurance operations is a marvellous\u000a      application of theoretical economics to a practical problem of vital\u000a      importance to financial markets.\" [C4].\u000a    The product-mix auction design has potential to be used in a wide range\u000a      of contexts: for instance Klemperer and several other auction theorists\u000a      suggested that the US government use this form of auction to buy up \"toxic\u000a      assets\" from troubled banks in 2008. In the event the US government\u000a      changed direction and decided not to buy troubled assets after all.\u000a      Looking outside financial markets, other potential applications include\u000a      auctions for electricity transmission networks [C7, pp.14-15]; for\u000a      planning permission on brown-field v. green-field sites [C9].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The banking crisis that followed the collapse of Northern Rock in 2007\u000a      resulted in an urgent need to inject liquidity into the financial system.\u000a      In order to resolve these issues, the Bank of England asked Professor\u000a      Klemperer, an expert in auction theory, to help re-dseign its long-term\u000a      market operations to allow the Bank of England to auction loans backed by\u000a      financial collateral of varying quality. Since 2010, this has been adopted\u000a      as the Bank of England's standard mechanism for its long-term repurchase\u000a      operations.

This research played a major role in the\u000a      design of the auction for British 3G Telecom licenses in 2000 [R1].\u000a    Building on this earlier work, Professor Klemperer's recent research\u000a      addresses the fundamental problem of how to sell goods that both sellers\u000a      and buyers view as imperfect substitutes when, as in the financial\u000a      context, multi-round auctions are impractical [R6]. His proposed\u000a      solution permits different but related goods to be traded and individually\u000a      priced in a single auction. Each bidder can make one or more bids, and each\u000a      bid contains a set of mutually exclusive offers. Each offer\u000a      specifies a price for a quantity of a specific \"variety\". The auctioneer\u000a      looks at all the bids and then selects a price for each \"variety\". The\u000a      idea is that the menu of mutually exclusive bids allows each bidder to\u000a      approximate a demand function, so bidders can, in effect, decide how much\u000a      of each variety to buy after seeing the prices chosen. Meanwhile\u000a      the auctioneer can look at demand before choosing the prices.\u000a      Importantly, offers for each variety provide a competitive discipline on\u000a      the offers for the other varieties, because they are all being auctioned\u000a      simultaneously.\u000a    The `product-mix' auction is best understood as a \"proxy\" version of a\u000a      `simultaneous multiple round auction' (SMRA). Bidders input their\u000a      preferences, and the auction chooses the outcome that an SMRA would select\u000a      assuming straightforward bidding. Because the auction is \"sealed bid\", it\u000a      runs instantaneously (important in the financial-market context), and\u000a      therefore is less vulnerable to collusion. Another novel feature is that\u000a      while standard SMRA implementations specify the number of each type of\u000a      each good to be sold in advance, in the new `product-mix' auction the\u000a      auctioneer also bids its preferences about how the proportions of\u000a      different varieties that it will sell will depend upob the auction prices\u000a      ( the overall supply constraint). The product-mix auction yields better\u000a      \"matching\" between suppliers and demanders, reduced market power, greater\u000a      volume and liquidity, and therefore also improved efficiency, revenue, and\u000a      quality of information than feasible alternatives.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3691","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3057568","Name":"Slovakia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3057568","Name":"Slovakia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    In June 2008, Professor Wren Lewis presented research on optimal fiscal\u000d\u000a      policy and fiscal rules at a research workshop organised by the Centre for\u000d\u000a      Economic Policy Research, which was attended by members of George\u000d\u000a      Osborne's private office [section 5: C1]. In September 2008, a\u000d\u000a      Conservative Party economic policy document \"Reconstruction - Plan for a\u000d\u000a      Strong Economy\" proposed the establishment of the Office for Budget\u000d\u000a      Responsibility (OBR), citing Kirsanova, Leith and Wren-Lewis (2007) [R2]\u000d\u000a      and drawing directly from their proposals for a fiscal council to combat\u000d\u000a      `deficit bias' [C2]. Subsequently, Wren-Lewis and his co-authors\u000d\u000a      presented their research to the Cabinet Office and the Treasury and had\u000d\u000a      informal discussions with members of George Osborne's private office. When\u000d\u000a      the Conservative party came to power in May 2010, the OBR was established\u000d\u000a      on an interim basis as a non-statutory body, and in March 2011, the OBR\u000d\u000a      became a statutory body.\u000d\u000a    In July 2010, Wren-Lewis was called as an expert witness to give oral\u000d\u000a      evidence before the Treasury Select Committee for the formation of the OBR\u000d\u000a      on a statutory basis. Wren-Lewis' earlier research and proposal for a\u000d\u000a      fiscal council was noted in the minutes [C3, Formal Minutes, q84].\u000d\u000a      Drawing on his research on the role and structure of fiscal councils [R1]),\u000a      Professor Wren Lewis argued in his evidence to the Select Committee that\u000d\u000a      the board of the proposed OBR should include independent non-executive\u000d\u000a      members as well as executive members [C3, Formal Minutes, q88]. On\u000d\u000a      21 June 2011, two non-executive members were appointed to the OBR. These\u000d\u000a      were not included in the interim OBR, but were recommended by the Treasury\u000d\u000a      Committee for the statutory OBR.\u000d\u000a    In March 2011, the Budget Responsibility and National Audit Act 2011\u000d\u000a      established the OBR as a statutory body. Wren-Lewis was appointed to the\u000d\u000a      seven-member panel of the OBR comprised of outside experts \"to help\u000d\u000a      develop and scrutinise its work programme and methods\", a move indicative\u000d\u000a      of the influence of Wren-Lewis' research on the subject of fiscal councils\u000d\u000a      [C4]. Wren- Lewis' recent work on the comparative functions of\u000d\u000a      fiscal councils has also influenced the operation of the OBR itself. In\u000d\u000a      the Ken Dixon Lecture at the University of York on 13 June 2011, the\u000d\u000a      current director of the OBR, Robert Chote drew heavily on the analysis by\u000d\u000a      Calmfors and Wren-Lewis [R1] in setting out the justification for\u000d\u000a      fiscal councils and in comparing of the UK's OBR with fiscal councils in\u000d\u000a      other countries [C5, p.3]. Since its establishment, the OBR has had\u000d\u000a      a major impact on UK fiscal policy. For example, in November 2011, the OBR\u000d\u000a      revised down its forecast for potential output, which led the Chancellor\u000d\u000a      in his Autumn Statement to announce plans for additional future austerity\u000d\u000a      to ensure he met his fiscal targets [C6].\u000d\u000a    The impact of Wren-Lewis' work in this area has extended beyond the UK. A\u000d\u000a      conference on Independent Fiscal Institutions (Budapest, June 2010)\u000d\u000a      reviewed the experiences of fiscal councils worldwide, and Wren-Lewis'\u000d\u000a      presentation to the conference drew important distinctions between types\u000d\u000a      of fiscal council and the extent to which different designs tackle\u000d\u000a      different problems of fiscal policymaking [C7]. In April 2011, the\u000d\u000a      research on the role of fiscal councils was presented at the 3rd\u000d\u000a      Annual Meeting of OECD Parliamentary Budget Officials on 29 April 2011\u000d\u000a      [C8]. In addition, Wren-Lewis has held informal discussions\u000d\u000a      with interested political representatives in other countries, such as\u000d\u000a      Ireland and Slovakia. He has since joined the Advisory Panel of the Slovak\u000d\u000a      Council for Budget Responsibility [C9].\u000d\u000a    Wren-Lewis maintains a webpage on fiscal councils\u000d\u000a    (http:\/\/www.economics.ox.ac.uk\/members\/simon.wren-lewis\/fc\/Fiscal_Councils.htm).\u000a      The webpage is designed to be an easily accessible account of what fiscal\u000d\u000a      councils are trying to achieve, and, as such, it has proved a useful\u000d\u000a      source of information and analysis on fiscal councils for policymakers.\u000d\u000a      The webpage has specifically been referred to by UK policymakers while\u000d\u000a      drawing up legislation to put the OBR on a statutory basis (for example, [C3]\u000d\u000a      footnotes 11 and 12). A summary of Calmfors and Wren-Lewis (2001) [R1]\u000d\u000a      on the role of fiscal councils was made available on VoxEU (http:\/\/www.voxeu.g\/index.php?q=node\/6369)a\u000a      website supported by the EU to provide research- based policy advice and\u000d\u000a      commentary for economists in governments, international organisations,\u000d\u000a      academia and the private sector as well as journalists specializing in\u000d\u000a      economics, finance and business [C10].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    In 2010, the new Conservative government established the Office for\u000d\u000a      Budgetary Responsibility (OBR) to provide independent and authoritative\u000d\u000a      analysis of the UK's public finances. The economic case for an independent\u000d\u000a      body to monitor fiscal policy was based on research by Professor Simon\u000d\u000a      Wren-Lewis and his co-authors into fiscal policy rules and optimal debt\u000d\u000a      policy.

This\u000d\u000a      earlier research analyses the causes of deficit bias and demonstrates why\u000d\u000a      fiscal rules on their own may not be sufficient to combat deficit bias [R2].\u000d\u000a      Subsequent work extends and deepens this analysis to consider\u000d\u000a      countercyclical fiscal policy and optimal debt dynamics, both inside and\u000d\u000a      outside a monetary union [R3, R4, R5]. This research shows why the\u000d\u000a      application of fiscal rules on their own, are unlikely to be successful in\u000d\u000a      controlling government debt. Simple rules are seriously sub-optimal, while\u000d\u000a      better but more complex rules are much easier to fudge.\u000d\u000a    Building on this, Wren-Lewis' research then goes on to establish the case\u000d\u000a      for an independent fiscal monitoring body as a useful complement to fiscal\u000d\u000a      rules, by publically warning when those rules are being circumvented, and\u000d\u000a      also by sanctioning occasions when it makes sense to break those rules. An\u000d\u000a      independent fiscal council to monitor public finances was first proposed\u000d\u000a      specifically, in 2007, by Kirsanova, Leith and Wren-Lewis [R2]. In\u000d\u000a      subsequent work, Wren-Lewis focused on the structure and role of fiscal\u000d\u000a      councils. Some commentators have drawn parallels between the role of\u000d\u000a      fiscal councils and that of independent central banks. Wren-Lewis\u000d\u000a      demonstrates that simple analogies between inflation bias and deficit bias\u000d\u000a      can be misleading and offers two arguments for the form of delegation to\u000d\u000a      differ between monetary and fiscal policy [R6]. The first is that\u000d\u000a      informational problems play a much greater role in explaining deficit bias\u000d\u000a      than is the case for inflation bias, in which case an independent advisory\u000d\u000a      body may be sufficient to correct the problem. The second is that there\u000d\u000a      was much less consensus about the objectives of long term debt policy\u000d\u000a      compared to monetary policy.

The key researchers involved in this research\u000d\u000a      at Oxford University are: Sir David Hendry, Professor of Economics and\u000d\u000a      Fellow of Nuffield College since 1982; Jurgen Doornik, Research Fellow at\u000d\u000a      Nuffield College since 1989; and Jennifer Castle, Fellow at Magdalen\u000d\u000a      College since 2006, Postdoctoral Research Fellow, Department of Economics\u000d\u000a      2003-06.\u000d\u000a    Research undertaken by this group has established the importance of\u000d\u000a      structural shifts in economic relationships as the main cause of forecast\u000d\u000a      failures. In the face of structural breaks, so-called\u000d\u000a      equilibrium-correction models (ECM - the de facto standard in\u000d\u000a      empirical econometrics) face serious forecasting problems. The reason is\u000d\u000a      that such models are designed to return to equilibrium, but, after a\u000d\u000a      structural shift, this is now the wrong equilibrium. While forecasting\u000d\u000a      performance of ECM models can be improved through `mechanistic'\u000d\u000a      corrections, Oxford researchers have shown that such techniques are\u000d\u000a      outperformed by approaches that model the break process explicitly [R6,\u000a        R3].\u000d\u000a    Economies both evolve and experience sudden changes, which interact with\u000d\u000a      the plethora of highly interrelated macroeconomic variables arising from\u000d\u000a      agents' actions, such that many features of econometric models cannot be\u000d\u000a      derived by prior reasoning. Model selection can reduce this complexity,\u000d\u000a      intrinsically involving empirical discovery and theory evaluation [R5].\u000d\u000a      The model selection and evaluation techniques developed by this research\u000d\u000a      group have been carefully validated, allowing investigators to handle very\u000d\u000a      general models with many variables, long lag lengths, and non-linear\u000d\u000a      functions, while at the same time taking into account outliers, data\u000d\u000a      contamination, and parameter shifts [R1, R2]. These general\u000d\u000a      representations retain the best available theory while being simplified to\u000d\u000a      well-specified representations that are rigorously evaluated against the\u000d\u000a      data to ascertain their validity [R4].\u000d\u000a    Research on the theory of model selection has been accompanied throughout\u000d\u000a      by the development of publicly available econometric software. PcGive,\u000d\u000a      a user-friendly interactive econometric modelling package for estimation,\u000d\u000a      testing and forecasting, designed by members of the Oxford team, was first\u000d\u000a      released in the mid-eighties and is now in its fourteenth version.

It has influenced the policy debate\u000a      within a range of countries (through advice offered to ministers and\u000a      engagement in debates within civil society and NGOs) and hence shaped\u000a      policy.\u000a    1) International financial institutions and the development policy\u000a          community:\u000a    A key point of influence has been the International Monetary Fund (IMF),\u000a      in particular the Fiscal Affairs Department and also the Low-Income\u000a      Countries Strategy Unit and the IMF Research Department. The IMF undertook\u000a      a thorough review of its policy advice on revenue management leading to a\u000a      2012 policy paper for the IMF Executive Board setting out a new\u000a      macro-fiscal framework and policy advice for resource-rich developing\u000a      countries [C1]. This draws heavily on Oxford research (citing 9\u000a      research papers including [R1], [R5] and [R6], and\u000a      consulting Van der Ploeg and Venables in preparation of the paper).\u000a      Accompanying the Executive Board paper, the IMF published a background\u000a      paper [C2] and Staff Discussion Note [C3] drawing on the\u000a      research and designed to ensure policy reaches IMF staff and country\u000a      offices. The Deputy Director of the Fiscal Affairs department at the IMF\u000a      has confirmed that the IMF Board paper has had a major impact on the\u000a      Fund's policy advice to resource-rich countries, particularly in the\u000a      context of the scaling of public spending [C4]. Van der Ploeg\u000a      subsequently taught a course at the IMF Institute attended by 50+\u000a      professional economists from within the IMF (The Economics of Natural\u000a      Resources, IMF Institute, 2010).\u000a    OxCARRE research [R1, R7] has also been used by the World Trade\u000a      Organisation in their flagship 2010 World Trade Report [C5], which\u000a      focused on trade in natural resources. The World Bank (WB) has used the\u000a      research in their policy dialogue with the government of Iraq (a model\u000a      based on their research [R2] and provided by Venables and Van der\u000a      Ploeg forms chapter 2 of the Iraq Country Economic Memorandum [C6]);\u000a      and in their Governance of Extractive Industries Initiative (GOXI), and\u000a      their Extractive Industries Sourcebook designed to provide senior\u000a      government officials and policymakers with a guide to good practice [C7].\u000a    2) Policy in Country: \u000a    Impact on the policy within countries has been achieved through two main\u000a      mechanisms. The first is interaction with policy makers through high-level\u000a      conferences and meetings. Examples include government conferences in\u000a      Ghana, Uganda, South Sudan, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, D. R. Congo; IMF\u000a      conferences including a joint IMF &#8212; WB conference in March 2012; the\u000a      annual conference of the Extractive Industries Initiative (2011); and the\u000a      Global Development Network (`Natural Resources and development' 2009).\u000a      These events, attracting ministerial and in some cases presidential\u000a      audiences, have contributed to a greater awareness of the policy\u000a      alternatives and the dissemination of good practice (for example see [C8]).\u000a      Extractive industries legislation (or draft legislation) in newly resource\u000a      rich countries in Africa now generally contains explicit clauses on the\u000a      use of resource revenues, including investment in the domestic economy and\u000a      limited use of off-shore funds (in line with the policy recommendations\u000a      from [R1, R5]). For example: Ghana's Petroleum Revenue Management\u000a      Act (2011) and associated Stabilization and Heritage funds [C9].\u000a    The second mechanism by which the research has informed and influenced\u000a      policy is the Natural Resource Charter (NRC),\u000a      established in 2009 by an independent team of experts to provide a guide\u000a      to the management of natural resources. The NRC is \"a set of economic\u000a      principles for governments and societies on how to best manage the\u000a      opportunities created by natural resources for development.\" It is\u000a      organized around twelve core precepts that offer guidance on key\u000a      decisions; beginning with whether to extract natural resources, and ending\u000a      with decisions that determine how resource revenue can produce maximum\u000a      good for a country's citizens. Collier and Venables were members of the\u000a      team that launched the initiative and continue as members of the Technical\u000a      Advisory Group, with Oxford providing the intellectual base for the NRC.\u000a      Oxford research on revenue management (including [R1], [R4], [R5])\u000a      directly informs precepts 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the charter [C10]. The\u000a      NRC has been adopted or otherwise endorsed by a broad range of\u000a      organizations\/governments\/NGOs: the World Bank, the IMF, Norway,\u000a      Australia, Zimbabwe, African Development Bank, and the African Progress\u000a      Panel. The UK government gave its support to the the NRC in the 2009\u000a      Department For International Development white paper Eliminating World\u000a      Poverty: Building Our Common Future [C11]. In 2012, Nigeria was the\u000a      first country to benchmark its performance against the 12 precepts of good\u000a      practice set out in the Charter [C12].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Countries with substantial non-renewable natural resource wealth face\u000a      special opportunities and challenges.

The centre was established in 2008 with funding from\u000a      BP. Venables joined Oxford in 2007 as BP Professor of Economics and van\u000a      der Ploeg joined in 2008 as Professor of Economics. Work has also involved\u000a      Professor Paul Collier (Professor of Economics and Public Policy) of\u000a      Oxford's Centre for the Study of African Economies (CSAE).\u000a    The research has covered a broad agenda (OxCARRE has produced over 120\u000a      research papers) including the relationship between resource wealth and\u000a      conflict, the impact of volatility [R3], trade issues [R2],\u000a      and the experience of particular countries [R1, R7]. A focus has\u000a      been the management of the foreign exchange windfall generated by resource\u000a      revenues. At the aggregate level, these revenues can be used for three\u000a      things: current expenditure; domestic investment; and the acquisition of\u000a      foreign assets (e.g. a Sovereign Wealth Fund). The balance depends on\u000a      factors including: the ethical weighting of income accruing to different\u000a      generations; constraints on public funds and the supply of capital; the\u000a      need to avoid an inflationary resource boom, exchange rate overvaluation,\u000a      and `Dutch disease'; the country's capacity (institutional and economic)\u000a      to absorb extra spending; the need to insulate the economy from\u000a      volatility; and the need for choices to be robust to environments with\u000a      difficult political economy. Analysis of how best to manage the trade-offs\u000a      between these factors is the subject of much of the research of van der\u000a      Ploeg and Venables [R5, R6], together with [R1, R3, R4].\u000a    OxCARRE's research on the use of natural resource revenues challenges the\u000a      conventional wisdom of following the permanent income hypothesis (PIH).\u000a      The researchers construct a dynamic model of a developing economy which is\u000a      capital constrained (households and government unable to borrow at the\u000a      world interest rate) and on a growth path towards development. They show\u000a      that in this setting the optimal policy is not to follow the PIH\u000a      prescription of using revenues to build long- run foreign assets, but\u000a      rather to balance higher investment in the domestic economy (particularly\u000a      infrastructure) with a relatively large increment to current consumption,\u000a      to address the poverty of the current generation [R5]. The\u000a      research addresses issues relating to short- and medium-run economic\u000a      management, analysing the impact of resource revenue on economic\u000a      structure, its implications for the exchange rate, and policy to manage\u000a      this [R6]. Other work focuses on the problems associated with\u000a      volatility [R3, R4].\u000a    Together, this body of research outlines a strategy for resource revenue\u000a      management which prioritises investment in physical (and human) assets in\u000a      the domestic economy, supplementing these with foreign savings vehicles\u000a      designed to mitigate the effects of volatility and in which revenues can\u000a      be `parked' until absorptive capacity problems are solved. They also\u000a      outline the importance of concurrent domestic reform (preparing the\u000a      economy to overcome absorption constraints and handle a resource boom),\u000a      and the micro-economic detail of interaction between the public and\u000a      private sectors. The importance of the work lies in the fact that the core\u000a      analysis suggests a use of revenues quite different from the PIH\u000a      prescriptions that underpinned the policy advice of the IMF (Fiscal\u000a      Affairs Department) and influential donors (the Norwegian Oil for\u000a      Development programme).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4577","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"239880","Name":"Central African Republic"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2453866","Name":"Mali"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research undertaken by Collier and other members of the CSAE team has\u000d\u000a      played a major role in bringing the economic and political problems of\u000d\u000a      `fragile' developing economies to the forefront of the public policy\u000d\u000a      debate around aid and development policies.

The policy objectives and commitments to making development\u000d\u000a      more effective in fragile states are set out in a 2005 DFID policy paper [C1],\u000d\u000a      drawing on CSAE research throughout (including [R5]). The\u000d\u000a      Coalition Government's Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR)\u000d\u000a      committed to spend at least 30 per cent of aid in fragile and\u000d\u000a      conflict-affected states [C2]. CSAE's work on the cost of conflict\u000d\u000a      [R2, R3, R7] has also been influential in creating greater\u000d\u000a      attention to fragile states and The Bottom Billion and associated\u000d\u000a      CSAE research are identified as key references in the current (2011)\u000d\u000a      Guidance Note produced by the Governance and Social Development Resource\u000d\u000a      Centre, under contract from DFID [C3].\u000d\u000a    The research has also been highly influential in encouraging the\u000d\u000a      international donor community to address with greater energy the problems\u000d\u000a      of fragile and failing states. In 2011, the World Bank devoted its\u000d\u000a      flagship economic report to the issues of conflict, security and\u000d\u000a      development [C4]. No fewer than nine papers and books authored or\u000d\u000a      co-authored by CSAE members are referenced in the bibliography (including\u000d\u000a      [R1, R2]). Professor Collier served on the Advisory Council, and\u000d\u000a      Anke Hoeffler led research for a key background paper on Post-Conflict\u000d\u000a      Recovery [C5]. The high cost of conflict and state failure was\u000d\u000a      given a high profile, referencing CSAE work [R4]. As a follow-up\u000d\u000a      to the World Development Report (WDR) 2011, World Bank management\u000d\u000a      presented a strategy paper operationalizing the 2011 WDR, that was\u000d\u000a      discussed by the Development Committee in Spring 2011 (the Development\u000d\u000a      Committee is a forum of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund\u000d\u000a      that facilitates intergovernmental consensus-building on development\u000d\u000a      issues) [C6]. At the 2013 World Bank\/IMF Spring Meetings, conflict\u000d\u000a      was a prominent topic because of the recent collapse of Mali and the\u000d\u000a      Central African Republic, and Collier's work was heavily cited [C7].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Similarly, bilateral donors, meeting in the OECD-hosted International\u000d\u000a      Network on Conflict and Fragility (INCAF), produced Policy Guidance in\u000d\u000a      2011 on Supporting Statebuilding in Situations of Conflict and Fragility [C8]\u000d\u000a      that drew on CSAE research findings and concepts, referencing The\u000d\u000a        Bottom Billion and the research directly [R3].

In 2009, the IMF created a Low Income Unit within the\u000d\u000a      Strategy and Review Department and appointed Collier as Senior Advisor [C9];\u000d\u000a      Collier is a member of DFID Policy Advisory Group; Advisor to the Vice\u000d\u000a      President of the Africa Region of the World Bank (2003-); and a member of\u000d\u000a      the European Commission's Scientific Advisory Board for EU Development\u000d\u000a      Policy (2012-).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research at Oxford, led by Paul Collier, on the causes and consequences\u000d\u000a      of conflict and state failure for low income economies has informed\u000d\u000a      policymakers, and contributed to a substantial increase in the proportion\u000d\u000a      of aid programmes devoted to addressing these problems.

One important strand of their work has\u000d\u000a      highlighted two issues: first, the links between conflict, state failure,\u000d\u000a      and economic conditions; and second the policies that can mitigate the\u000d\u000a      risks of conflict and state failure. The research has pioneered the\u000d\u000a      quantitative modelling of the risks of conflict, [Section 3: R2].\u000d\u000a      It has identified the economic factors that make a country more prone to\u000d\u000a      conflict, highlighting the role of poverty and sudden collapses in\u000d\u000a      economic growth, and a dependence upon primary commodity exports [R1,\u000a        R2]. The findings suggest that the economic factors that determine\u000d\u000a      the feasibility and opportunity costs of rebellion and conflict play a\u000d\u000a      potentially more important role in determining the risks of conflict than\u000d\u000a      measures of grievance, such as ethnic diversity or inequality [R3].\u000d\u000a      CSAE research has quantified the costs associated with civil war and state\u000d\u000a      failure - taking into account not only the direct effects on the country\u000d\u000a      concerned but also the spillover effects on their neighbours - and has\u000d\u000a      shown them to be extremely large [R4].\u000d\u000a    Collier and his colleagues at the CSAE have addressed the question of how\u000d\u000a      to mitigate the problems associated with conflict and state failure. The\u000d\u000a      research highlights interventions with the potential to reduce the risks\u000d\u000a      of conflict and state failure by enhancing economic performance. It\u000d\u000a      demonstrates the crucial role that can be played by international aid in\u000d\u000a      post-conflict recovery, emphasising the importance of phasing in the aid\u000d\u000a      over a period of several years as the post-conflict country's absorptive\u000d\u000a      capacity recovers [R5]. In the absence of post-conflict aid,\u000d\u000a      inflation tends to increase sharply, hampering more general monetary\u000d\u000a      recovery. Aid is shown to transform the path of monetary variables in the\u000d\u000a      post-conflict period, achieving a monetary \"reconstruction\" analogous to\u000d\u000a      its more evident role in infrastructure [R6].\u000d\u000a    Low income countries that depend on primary commodity exports are\u000d\u000a      particularly vulnerable to conflict and state failure, and strong\u000d\u000a      governance is shown to be important in enabling resource-rich developing\u000d\u000a      countries to harness opportunities for economic growth [R7]. CSAE\u000d\u000a      research (with Rohner) shows that by itself, democracy in low-income\u000d\u000a      countries may increase, rather than reduce, the risks of conflict, and\u000d\u000a      that elections in post-conflict situations may also be risk-increasing [R8].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"10378","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Oxford research on the housing market and its interaction with other\u000d\u000a      areas of the economy has guided UK housing policy over a number of years,\u000d\u000a      influencing UK housing provision and government policy to support mortgage\u000d\u000a      holders in arrears. The research highlights the important role of housing\u000d\u000a      and credit markets in the macroeconomy and has influenced policy on macro-\u000d\u000a      economic rebalancing following the global economic crisis.\u000d\u000a    Since its initial development, the Regional Affordability Model (RAM) [R6]\u000d\u000a      has played a central policy role in guiding the advice of the National\u000d\u000a      Housing and Planning Advisory Unit (NHPAU) to regional and local planning\u000d\u000a      authorities. From 2007 until its abolition in 2010, the NHPAU was tasked\u000d\u000a      with advising government, planners and regional bodies on housing\u000d\u000a      affordability and the consequences of different levels of housing\u000d\u000a      provision, with the aim of improving the link between demand for homes and\u000d\u000a      planning permissions for new housing. The NHPAU used the RAM to estimate\u000d\u000a      the effect of housing supply on housing affordability, and to provide\u000d\u000a      advice to Ministers on the housing supply ranges to be tested by the\u000d\u000a      Regional Planning Authorities [for example C1, C2]. These\u000d\u000a      estimates of housing supply ranges were influential because the Regional\u000d\u000a      Assemblies had to take the NHPAU evidence into account in determining\u000d\u000a      housing provision and provide evidence should they wish to set a supply\u000d\u000a      level outside of the NHPAU range. The NPHAU also used the model for policy\u000d\u000a      analysis and simulation of scenarios.

The report's\u000d\u000a      evidence was used in support of the Mortgage Rescue and Homeowners Support\u000d\u000a      scheme, and it influenced the decision of the Housing Minister to maintain\u000d\u000a      the policy following the 2010 General Election [C5]. In 2012, the\u000d\u000a      DCLG commissioned Aron and Muellbauer to update their forecasts to\u000d\u000a      incorporate data through to Q3, 2011 [C6]. The information on the\u000d\u000a      new forecasts, indicating an improved outlook for arrears and repossession\u000d\u000a      through to 2015, was included in the briefing note for MPs on mortgage\u000d\u000a      arrears and repossessions provided by House of Commons Library [C7].\u000d\u000a      The models developed for forecasting possessions and arrears have been\u000d\u000a      given to DCLG for their own use in forecasting, and the work has been\u000d\u000a      shared with the Ministry of Justice, the Financial Services Authority\u000d\u000a      (FSA), the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML), the IMF Stress Testing Unit,\u000d\u000a      and the Financial Stability Unit of the Bank of England.\u000d\u000a    The research by Aron, Muellbauer and Murphy on the interrelationships\u000d\u000a      between household behaviour, credit markets and the macroeconomy [R1,\u000d\u000a        R2, R5] has highlighted the role played by housing and credit\u000d\u000a      markets in the recent global financial crisis, and the potential lessons\u000d\u000a      for central bank modelling. In 2009, Muellbauer addressed the annual\u000d\u000a      conference of the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel on the\u000d\u000a      theme of lessons of the global financial crisis for policy modelling at\u000d\u000a      central banks, drawing on his research with Aron and others [C8].\u000d\u000a      He has delivered keynote addresses at numerous international meetings for\u000d\u000a      senior policymakers including: a Banque de France conference on the\u000d\u000a      macroeconomics of housing markets (December 2009); a National Central\u000d\u000a      Banks (NCB) Experts Meeting organised by the European Central Bank (ECB)\u000d\u000a      on how central banks could make better use of information on credit and\u000d\u000a      housing market developments and flow of funds data more generally\u000d\u000a      (November 2011); and the BIS-Reserve Bank of Australia annual conference\u000d\u000a      attended by senior central bankers from the Asia-Pacific region on\u000d\u000a      `property markets and financial stability (August 2012). Subsequently,\u000d\u000a      Muellbauer was appointed to the Wim Duisenberg Visiting Fellowship at the\u000d\u000a      ECB for 2012-13, where he worked with central bank economists on analysis\u000d\u000a      of the responses of household consumption, portfolio behaviour and house\u000d\u000a      prices to credit conditions, asset prices and housing supply, inter alia,\u000d\u000a      in Germany, France and Spain. This research now feeds into the work of the\u000d\u000a      ECB on flow-of-funds data. The Senior Adviser to the Directorate of\u000d\u000a      Monetary Policy at the ECB describes the research as of \"considerable\u000d\u000a      policy relevance for the euro area in the context of the need for\u000d\u000a      macroeconomic rebalancing and asset price adjustments (namely in the\u000d\u000a      housing market) in the wake of the debt crisis\" and states that the\u000d\u000a      research findings have contributed significantly to the analysis and\u000d\u000a      briefings provided to senior policy-makers and the ECB executive Board [C11].\u000d\u000a    Further global impact has occurred thanks to Muellbauer's engagement with\u000d\u000a      the Dallas Federal Reserve. Muellbauer's collaborative research and\u000d\u000a      publication with the Senior Economist and Vice-President at the Dallas\u000d\u000a      Federal Reserve has had a significant impact on US monetary policy towards\u000d\u000a      mortgage and housing markets [C9]. The co-authored research [R2,\u000a        R5] contributed prominently to a special briefing by the Senior\u000d\u000a      Economist and VP to the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee [FOMC] in\u000d\u000a      January 2012 and was influential in briefing the FOMC before the September\u000d\u000a      2012 decision to embark on a third phase of quantitative easing [C10].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Oxford research on consumption, credit and housing has played a central\u000d\u000a      role in guiding the policy advice provided to UK government departments,\u000d\u000a      planners and regional bodies on housing affordability and housing\u000d\u000a      provision and on policies to support homeowners.

The\u000d\u000a      research highlighted the volatility of UK house prices and their tendency\u000d\u000a      to overshoot, and identified the importance of `sticky' expectations and\u000d\u000a      credit conditions [R7]. In subsequent work, Cameron and Muellbauer\u000d\u000a      analysed the way in which the housing and labour markets interact in\u000d\u000a      determining inter-regional commuting and migration decisions [R3],\u000d\u000a      and analysed the role of house prices in determining earnings and\u000d\u000a      employment across UK regions [R4]. In 2004, Cameron, Muellbauer\u000d\u000a      and Murphy were senior members of a the team of researchers commissioned\u000d\u000a      by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to develop a fully-integrated\u000d\u000a      econometric model of house prices, earnings, migration, employment and\u000d\u000a      unemployment across UK regions, henceforward referred to as the Regional\u000d\u000a      Affordability Model. [R6]. Research by Cameron, Muellbauer and\u000d\u000a      Murphy lies at the core of the Regional Affordability Model. Cameron and\u000d\u000a      Muellbauer's methodology for modelling inter-regional migration [R3]\u000d\u000a      provides a key element of the demographic module [R6, p.14]. The\u000d\u000a      labour market module is based on Cameron and Muellbauer's work on the\u000d\u000a      interrelationship between house prices, earning and employment [R6,\u000d\u000a        p.18]. The specification of the housing module draws heavily on the\u000d\u000a      analysis of Muellbauer and Murphy [R7], developed to capture the\u000d\u000a      spatial dimension, in which house prices are determined in a spatial\u000d\u000a      system of inverted demand equations (see [R6, p.15-18]).\u000d\u000a    In recent research, Muellbauer, with Aron and Murphy, has focused on the\u000d\u000a      interrelationship between the credit and housing markets; estimating and\u000d\u000a      forecasting mortgage arrears and repossessions [R1, R2]. A key\u000d\u000a      innovation in this work is estimating the joint effects of policy\u000d\u000a      interventions and of lending quality on repossessions and arrears,\u000d\u000a      highlighting their sensitivity to interest rates and demonstrating that\u000d\u000a      forbearance and government support policies can play a major role in\u000d\u000a      reducing the rate of repossessions [R1]. This research highlights\u000d\u000a      the crucial role of credit and housing markets and other institutional\u000d\u000a      differences in determining cross-country differences in consumption [R2];\u000d\u000a      and from this, wider lessons regarding the role of credit and housing\u000d\u000a      markets in the global financial crisis can be drawn.

In doing this, it draws on the findings of the research\u000a      described above [R1-R4].\u000a    To support health policy makers and local NHS commissioners in deciding\u000a      where and when to\u000a      promote and enable competition, the OHE Commission for Competition devised\u000a      a toolkit (set out in\u000a      full in Appendix II of its report) [C2]. The toolkit lists, in\u000a      everyday language for non-economists, the\u000a      economic characteristics affecting the feasibility and effectiveness of\u000a      competition. The economic\u000a      characteristics were derived from the economics literature, making\u000a      extensive use of the research\u000a      findings, particularly those concerning the ease of defining and\u000a      monitoring output and quality [R1,\u000a        R4]; and the scope for supplier discretion [R4]. To provide\u000a      guidance to NHS commissioners, it\u000a      illustrates the relevance of these characteristics by mapping them to\u000a      specific medical procedures.\u000a      Specifically, it contains a matrix with rows corresponding to the economic\u000a      characteristics, columns\u000a      corresponding to the specific medical procedures, and colour-coded cells\u000a      indicating the importance\u000a      of the economic characteristics for the specific medical procedures. The\u000a      mapping to the medical\u000a      procedures was carried out by interactive discussion between those with\u000a      economic and those with\u000a      medical expertise.\u000a    The report received extensive coverage in the national, professional and\u000a      commercial media\u000a      following its launch in January 2012, involving citation by journalists\u000a      and broadcasters in the\u000a      general and specialist media (e.g. [C4, C5]).

A fundamental issue with provision of health services is ensuring\u000a      that an appropriate quality of\u000a      service is delivered, not so low as to deprive patients of a reasonable\u000a      standard of treatment, but also\u000a      not so high as to incur exorbitant expenditure.\u000a    Early (pre-1999) research by Malcomson and his co-author Professor Martin\u000a      Chalkley considered how\u000a      to set prices for services to achieve an appropriate level of quality when\u000a      patients do not pay directly for\u000a      treatment, and providers can attract patients from elsewhere by improving\u000a      the quality of service. In the\u000a      later work, they examine situations where the number of patient referrals\u000a      cannot, or does not, respond\u000a      to quality differences between providers. They show that in such cases\u000a      prices may usefully be\u000a      supplemented by some cost sharing with those providers for whom cost\u000a      information can be reliably\u000a      obtained, and who care to some extent about the quality of patient care\u000a      (or physician behaviour\u000a      ensures they act as if they care) [R1]. Subsequent research\u000a      provided an empirical assessment of the\u000a      extent of cost savings that might be attainable in this way [R2].\u000a    In more recent research, Malcomson has focused on the impact of\u000a      alternative payment arrangements\u000a      on the behaviour of providers. GPs play a pivotal role as gatekeepers to\u000a      NHS services and the research\u000a      examines how their behaviour is affected by alternative contractual\u000a      arrangements for payment [R3].\u000a      Health service providers have discretion over the form of treatment\u000a      provided and their decision about\u000a      treatment may be influenced by the payments offered across the range of\u000a      alternative treatments - an\u000a      unnecessarily expensive treatment for a minor condition may appeal to the\u000a      patient and also to the\u000a      provider if the payment for it is sufficiently generous. Research by\u000a      Malcomson analyses how the\u000a      payments for different treatments should be set under those circumstances;\u000a      both in theory and with an\u000a      application to specific medical procedures [R4].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"15517","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    As described above (section 2), the OMI provides a fruitful co-creative\u000d\u000a      collaborative environment for researchers and their counterparts in the\u000d\u000a      commercial world via co-location within the Man Research Laboratory (MRL)\u000d\u000a      and a series of collaborative seminars, workshops and conferences. It was\u000d\u000a      through the research seminars that AHL researchers became aware of\u000d\u000a      Professor Shephard's research on volatility, and, in particular, of the\u000d\u000a      predictive model that he had developed with Dr. Kevin Sheppard [R6].\u000d\u000a      The predictive research methodology of Shephard and Sheppard provided the\u000d\u000a      basis for a decision rule developed by AHL researchers to generate what\u000d\u000a      they termed the `spike detection strategy'. This tool was then used by AHL\u000d\u000a      to attempt to statistically hedge significant `tail events'. Shephard and\u000d\u000a      Sheppard were consulted over the subsequent development of the spike\u000d\u000a      detection strategy, providing feedback on the approach adopted and\u000d\u000a      pointing to some fruitful directions for subsequent work [Section 5:\u000d\u000a        C1].\u000d\u000a    Shephard and Sheppard's research was particularly pertinent because, for\u000d\u000a      some time before AHL became aware of the work [R6], Man Group had\u000d\u000a      identified the need to build an investment fund that protected a hedge\u000d\u000a      fund portfolio against so-called `tail events' [C1] . These `tail\u000d\u000a      events' (very bad monthly equity portfolio returns) are difficult to\u000d\u000a      predict and can lead to challenging periods both for institutional\u000d\u000a      investors (e.g. pension companies) or fund managers. Various asset classes\u000d\u000a      have traditionally been used to provide some insurance against severe\u000d\u000a      equity losses. The most famous are bonds, although, in recent years, bond\u000d\u000a      and equity returns have been positively correlated.\u000d\u000a    AHL researchers recognised that volatility contracts are a class of\u000d\u000a      investable assets which do perform well during periods of financial stress\u000d\u000a      [C1]. (A simple version of such a contract has a payoff related to\u000d\u000a      the square root of the sum of squares of daily returns of the underlying\u000d\u000a      measured over a pre-specified period). Realised volatility has nearly\u000d\u000a      always been very high during periods where equity indexes have fallen\u000d\u000a      significantly. There are various economic theories as to why this may be\u000d\u000a      the case. Overall, however, it means that buying volatility contracts\u000d\u000a      provides a form of statistical insurance on equity positions. If equities\u000d\u000a      rally, the contract will tend to pay off little; if equities fall\u000d\u000a      dramatically, it will tend to pay off very substantially. This suggests\u000d\u000a      that an equity portfolio could have some of its `left hand tail' risk\u000d\u000a      reduced by holding a small amount of volatility contracts. The difficulty\u000d\u000a      with this conclusion, and the resulting action, is that the expected\u000d\u000a      long-run payoff of variance contracts is substantially negative. The size\u000d\u000a      of expected loss is called the volatility risk premium, and it rewards\u000d\u000a      sellers of volatility contracts for being exposed to the risk of\u000d\u000a      substantial losses at the same time as equities are losing.\u000d\u000a    The critical value of the predictive model developed by Shephard and\u000d\u000a      Sheppard [R6] is that it provided the methodological basis for a\u000d\u000a      strategy to predict periods of stress in the financial markets, and so\u000d\u000a      reduce the costs of holding volatility contracts [C1]. Man Group's\u000d\u000a      `spike detection' strategy, derived from Shephard and Sheppard's\u000d\u000a      predictive model [R6] \"looks at noise in the markets and tries to\u000d\u000a      translate that noise into when a crisis is likely to take place\" [C2].\u000d\u000a      When a challenging period is detected, exposure to volatility is increased\u000d\u000a      to provide greater protection. The spike detection strategy is a key\u000d\u000a      component of the Man group's TailProtect Fund. In a 2012 interview, Sandy\u000d\u000a      Rattray (CEO of AHL) described the strategy as the \"more creative and\u000d\u000a      innovative part\" of the Man Group's TailProtect Fund (Dickinson, 2012) [C2].\u000d\u000a      The TailProtect fund opened to external investors in January 2011, and in\u000d\u000a      2012 won the annual European award for most innovative hedge fund [C3].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research by Oxford econometricians provided the basis for innovative new\u000d\u000a      methods for predicting periods of potential financial stress and providing\u000d\u000a      protection for investors against extreme events. During periods of\u000d\u000a      financial stress, equity funds tend to sharply lose value while volatility\u000d\u000a      tends to increase. Adding some long volatility exposure to a standard\u000d\u000a      equity portfolio can significantly improve the tail behaviour of a\u000d\u000a      portfolio.

The OMI provides an innovative model of collaboration\u000d\u000a      between academic researchers and their counterparts in the commercial\u000d\u000a      world with the OMI co-located with the Man Research Laboratory (MRL) which\u000d\u000a      houses long-term commercial researchers from AHL. AHL is a dedicated group\u000d\u000a      within the Man Group who specialise on using purely quantitative\u000d\u000a      investment strategies. The two centres are independent &#8212; OMI's focus is on\u000d\u000a      academic research for the public domain whilst AHL's research is\u000d\u000a      commercial and profit driven &#8212; but researchers come together for seminars,\u000d\u000a      workshops and conferences, allowing OMI researchers to benefit from\u000d\u000a      practitioner expertise and Man's commercially-focused staff to benefit\u000d\u000a      from discussions with leading academics in the field. This research was\u000d\u000a      born in, and benefits from, this co-creative environment and is a product\u000d\u000a      of direct engagement beyond academia with the financial sector.\u000d\u000a    From the late 1990s onwards, Professor Shephard has carried out\u000d\u000a      significant work with Prof Barndoff-Nielsen, developing new statistical\u000d\u000a      methods which allow researchers to extract econometrically useful long and\u000d\u000a      medium term information from high frequency financial data. These methods\u000d\u000a      have been very widely applied in academic research, allowing various\u000d\u000a      researchers to develop a new generation of predictive models to be built\u000d\u000a      for financial volatility, a major component of financial risk.\u000d\u000a    Shephard's early work [Section 3: R1] showed how to frame\u000d\u000a      realised volatility as a simple non-parametric estimator of the increment\u000d\u000a      to quadratic variation and derived a central limit theory for this\u000d\u000a      estimator. This theory was used to provide a principled and simple way of\u000d\u000a      carrying out volatility forecasting using a non-parametric continuous time\u000d\u000a      stochastic volatility model. This research has been extended to the\u000d\u000a      multivariate case in Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard [R3] and has\u000d\u000a      been further developed to explore how to mitigate the impact of market\u000d\u000a      microstructure effects [R2].\u000d\u000a    Other extensions to the research include the development of the first\u000d\u000a      non-parametric quantifiers of the importance of jumps in financial markets\u000d\u000a      [E.G. R4Since these first papers there has been extensive\u000d\u000a      econometric research in this area, allowing researchers to have a better\u000d\u000a      gauge of extreme price moves in equity markets. Unusual moves are critical\u000d\u000a      in terms of the pricing of risk, but also for their potential spillover\u000d\u000a      into the macroeconomy.\u000d\u000a    In more recent Oxford research, Sheppard and Shephard produced a simple\u000d\u000a      volatility forecasting model called the high-frequency-based volatility\u000d\u000a      (HEAVY) model [R5]. Building on the results of Shephard's earlier\u000d\u000a      2002 paper [R2], this used high frequency data to make low\u000d\u000a      frequency volatility forecasts. In subsequent research, the techniques\u000d\u000a      were extended to the multivariate case [R6]The key advantage to\u000d\u000a      this kind of model, compared to traditional GARCH or RiskMetrics models,\u000d\u000a      is that it is able to react quickly to abrupt changes in the level of\u000d\u000a      volatility, which is a feature of nearly all periods of financial\u000d\u000a      distress. The reason for this is that it is built using realised\u000d\u000a      volatility measures of daily volatility, rather than using absolute daily\u000d\u000a      returns. These realised volatility measures are simply much more\u000d\u000a      informative, which means it is not necessary to temporally average them\u000d\u000a      over many months to produce coherent medium term forecasts. Such models\u000d\u000a      can be used to adjust portfolio allocations and potentially to value\u000d\u000a      volatility contracts.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"15580","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Brown has served as an independent expert on a number of public bodies.\u000a    1) The National Minimum Wage. Brown was appointed an independent member\u000a      of the Low Pay Commission (LPC) when established in 1997 to set up the\u000a      National Minimum Wage. He served until 2007 and the influence of his\u000a      research on the LPC continues to the present. The first Chair of the LPC,\u000a      and temporarily the Chair for 2008-2009, testifies (T1) that Brown `played\u000a      an active part in the substantial task of defining the NMW and of\u000a      conducting and commissioning the research whereby the Commission assessed\u000a      its likely and actual impact on employment, pay and productivity.' He\u000a      refers specifically to Refs 1, 2, and 5. He writes that, on his return to\u000a      the LPC in 2008, `it was evident that the integrity of the initial design\u000a      of the NMW and its supporting institutions was intact. Our confidence in\u000a      our advice to government continued to draw on the rich and constantly\u000a      renewed British empirical research to which Professor Brown's work had\u000a      made and continued to make an important contribution. ... Professor\u000a      Brown's published research since 1993 has made a significant contribution\u000a      to the continuing success of the British National Minimum Wage since\u000a      2008.'\u000a    The present Secretary of the LPC testifies that Brown's analysis (Ref 6))\u000a      `has been a central part of the induction reading which we give to all Low\u000a      Pay Commissioners, and to all new members of the Commission's Secretariat,\u000a      and we will continue to use it in this way in the future' (T2). In 2011,\u000a      the National Minimum Wage was judged to be `the most successful policy of\u000a      the past 30 years' in a poll of members of the Political Studies\u000a      Association conducted with the Institute for Government (W1).\u000a    2) Arbitration and mediation. Brown has been a member of the Panel of\u000a      Arbitrators of the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas)\u000a      since 1985.and the independent chair of the Fire Brigades National Joint\u000a      Council body for mediating disputes that cannot be settled at brigade\u000a      level since 1998. The Head of Strategy of Acas, testifies (T3) to Brown's\u000a      research `having a significant impact on policy thinking and practice'.\u000a      She says, inter alia that it `has provided invaluable commentary on the\u000a      dynamics of the employment relations. This is critical to understanding\u000a      the world in which Acas operates.' She writes of the value of his research\u000a      on `partnership working' (Ref 3) With regard to dispute resolution, she reports that `his material is\u000a      important in underpinning the training provided to new arbitrators' (e.g.\u000a      Ref 4). She refers to Brown's leadership with Ref 5, which Acas, as a\u000a      sponsor of WERS, `particularly welcomed'. 3) Trade union development. In\u000a      2005, the government established the Union Modernisation Fund (UMF) to\u000a      enable trade unions to improve their administration. A Supervisory Board\u000a      was set up to administer this at arms length from government. Brown served\u000a      on this until the UMF was wound up in 2010. The UMF was judged to have a\u000a      substantial effect in changing trade unions. The Programme Manager of the\u000a      UMF, testifies (T4) that `Over the course of three funding rounds\u000a      [Brown's] extensive academic research in this field played a significant\u000a      part in the deliberations of the Board. In particular, Prof Brown's\u000a      research on the changing role of trade unions in Britain and the\u000a      increasing individualisation of employment enabled him to provide very\u000a      useful insights into how trade unions might be supported through the UMF\u000a      to adapt to their new circumstances'.\u000a    4) Labour contracts reform and conflict resolution in China. Brown has\u000a      been invited to China six times since their Labour Contracts Act of 2008,\u000a      partly to discuss the implications with government officials. He returned\u000a      twice in 2010, at a time of rising industrial unrest, to address the All\u000a      China Federation of Trade Unions and government researchers on dispute\u000a      resolution procedures and on minimum wages. He co-organised two\u000a      conferences, attended by officials, at Renmin University in 2011 and 2013\u000a      on labour reform in China. The head of the relevant Ministry's research\u000a      institute testifies (T5) to discussions based on Ref 1, writing `this has\u000a      been helpful in helping us to advise the Chinese government on policy in\u000a      the period following the introduction of our Labour Contracts Act'. In\u000a      2012 Brown was appointed an Honorary Professor of Renmin University and\u000a      also a consultant to the principal government research project on\u000a      collective bargaining reform.

He investigated workplace wage bargaining using ethnographic,\u000a      econometric and survey methods. The British engineering industry, the main\u000a      focus of this work, was then characterised by dysfunctional incentive\u000a      schemes, frequent strikes, and intense bargaining over all aspects of work\u000a      organisation. His research analysed these phenomena. He led the first\u000a      large sample survey of British workplace industrial relations in 1977\/78,\u000a      from which came the official (now) ESRC\/Acas\/BIS-funded Workplace\u000a      Employment Relations Survey (WERS), which has been conducted six times\u000a      between 1980 and 2011, and in several rounds of which he has been in the\u000a      design team. Brown joined the Faculty of Economics at the University of\u000a      Cambridge in 1985, when he became the Montague Burton Professor of\u000a      Industrial Relations.\u000a    In the 1990s his work, funded by the (then) Department of Trade and\u000a      Industry, turned to the individualisation of employment and the\u000a      characteristics of the decline of collective bargaining. He led a team\u000a      that compared the conduct and contractual basis of employment in\u000a      organisations that had withdrawn support from trade unions, with\u000a      industrially matched organisations that had not (Ref 1). He then led a\u000a      larger, ESRC funded, project that used a combination of WERS 1998 survey\u000a      analysis and more detailed case studies to investigate private sector\u000a      employer response to tougher competition and the consequent changing role\u000a      of trade unions at the workplace (Ref 2). He led an ESRC-funded sequel\u000a      using targeted case studies to evaluate the process and outcomes of\u000a      co-operative trade union strategies referred to at the time as `workplace\u000a      partnership' (e.g. Ref 3). The teams he led for these 1990s projects were\u000a      all of Cambridge researchers.\u000a    Brown's research returned to large-scale survey analysis with an\u000a      ESRC-funded project, definitively analysing all the WERS Surveys from 1980\u000a      to 2004. He played a central role in organising and writing up the\u000a      statistical analysis of these data, by over twenty researchers from\u000a      different institutions, of the transformation of British industrial\u000a      relations that had occurred over that time (Ref 5). His own co-authored\u000a      chapters demonstrated, for the first time, the extent to which the\u000a      collapse of collective bargaining in Britain, sector by sector, had been\u000a      the consequence of the intensification of product market competition.\u000a    It is generally recognised that the UK has internationally uniquely rich\u000a      data on the changing nature of labour relations over the past several\u000a      decades (c.f. e.g.\u000a      http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/j.1467-8543.2010.00843.x\/abstract).\u000a      Brown's research has made a major contribution to this, not only in his\u000a      involvement in establishing the statistically representative WERS survey,\u000a      but in refreshing it and adding to it by systematic case studies. His\u000a      research from the 1990s onwards was particularly important in describing,\u000a      analysing, and quantifying a period of unprecedentedly rapid change in\u000a      employment relations.\u000a    Throughout this period, Brown has been an active industrial arbitrator\u000a      and mediator with Acas and has published research on these processes (e.g.\u000a      Ref 4).

This project, led by Hashem Pesaran\u000d\u000a      and Sean Holly, allowed the ECB access to the GVAR and an updated version\u000d\u000a      of the model was provided to the ECB. This became the basis for a number\u000d\u000a      of studies carried out by the ECB up until the present, e.g.: \"Modelling\u000d\u000a      global trade flows: Results from a GVAR model\" (2009) [5.1] and \"External\u000d\u000a      shocks and International inflation Linkage: A global VAR analysis\" (2009)\u000d\u000a      [5.2].\u000d\u000a    Since 2010 the main vehicle for the dissemination of the GVAR approach is\u000d\u000a      via the GVAR Toolbox. This is a collection of MatLab (a high level\u000d\u000a      computer language) procedures with an Excel-based interface, designed for\u000d\u000a      GVAR modelling. This provides a general yet practical global modelling\u000d\u000a      framework for the quantitative analysis of shocks to the world. This makes\u000d\u000a      it a suitable tool for policy analysis, analysing credit risk and\u000d\u000a      forecasting. This software package was made available and launched in\u000d\u000a      December 2010, and sponsored by the ECB [5.3].\u000d\u000a    Observable impacts take the form of analysis that was carried out at\u000d\u000a      these organisations based on the GVAR framework. Evidence of continuing\u000d\u000a      impact is provided by a workshop in 2011. The Workshop was held on\u000d\u000a      November 3 2011 at the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance where Dr. Di\u000d\u000a      Mauro and Dr. Bianchi from the ECB gave presentations on the Utilization\u000a        of the GVAR Model in Global Macro-economic Research. Dr. Bianchi, in\u000d\u000a      the modelling session, explained and demonstrated policy simulations and\u000d\u000a      scenario analysis by means of the GVAR model [5.4]. The Senior Advisor of\u000d\u000a      the Research Department of the ECB has advised us in an email that \"...the\u000d\u000a      GVAR has been for years one of the most important tools used.

The outcome of this research was first\u000d\u000a      published in an article in the Economic Journal [3.1], and in a book by\u000d\u000a      Oxford University Press [3.2] (both co-authored with Garratt, Lee, and\u000d\u000a      Shin: also employees of the University of Cambridge). The approach\u000d\u000a      developed for the UK was then extended to construct a model of the global\u000d\u000a      economy &#8212; the so-called GVAR. This was first published in an article in\u000d\u000a      the Journal of Business Economics and Statistics [3.3] (co-authored with\u000d\u000a      Schuermann (Federal Reserve Bank of New York) and Weiner (Alliance Capital\u000d\u000a      Management)).\u000d\u000a    A GVAR model is a global model combining individual country vector\u000d\u000a      error-correcting models, in which domestic variables are related to\u000d\u000a      country-specific foreign variables in a consistent manner. The latter are\u000d\u000a      constructed from the domestic variables so as to match the pattern of\u000d\u000a      international trade or financial connections or any other desired pattern.\u000d\u000a      The model relies exclusively on observables, which typically include\u000d\u000a      macroeconomic aggregates and financial variables. Some key advantages of\u000d\u000a      the GVAR modelling approach are that it allows for interdependence at a\u000d\u000a      variety of levels (national and international) in a transparent way that\u000d\u000a      can be empirically evaluated; it allows for long-run relationships\u000d\u000a      consistent with economic theory and short-run relationships that are\u000d\u000a      consistent with the data; it also provides a coherent, theory-consistent\u000d\u000a      solution to the curse of dimensionality in global modelling. The global\u000d\u000a      model can also incorporate forward looking behaviour, so it can also\u000d\u000a      accommodate modern dynamic stochastic, general equilibrium models. The\u000d\u000a      development of the GVAR involved also Schuermann (Federal Reserve Bank of\u000d\u000a      New York), as well as Dees (ECB), Di Mauro (ECB), Pesaran, Smith\u000d\u000a      (Cambridge) and Holly (Cambridge).\u000d\u000a    Amongst other things GVAR has been used for the international analysis of\u000d\u000a      credit risk [3.4] an analysis of the international linkages of the Euro\u000d\u000a      area [3.5] and the role of long run relationships in the global economy\u000d\u000a      [3.6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"15624","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Two categories of evidence demonstrate that EPRG research has exercised\u000d\u000a      an impact beyond academia: demand by non-academic users (and in particular\u000d\u000a      their willingness to incur costs to secure access to research); and direct\u000d\u000a      testimony, as documented in a 2012 ESRC-commissioned impact evaluation\u000d\u000a      report by CAG Consultants (source 8).\u000d\u000a    Demand by non-Academic Users\u000d\u000a    The main conduit for the EPRG's research is the Energy Policy Forum which\u000d\u000a      is funded by annual subscriptions from a number of corporations.

The EPRG `were seen\u000d\u000a      as a primary source of advice and knowledge on energy economics and\u000d\u000a      markets, especially by the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC)\u000d\u000a      and Ofgem' (source 8).\u000d\u000a    On Electricity Market Reform;\u000d\u000a    EPRG has played an influential role as a sounding board for the\u000d\u000a      Electricity Market Reform process and face-to-face briefings with DECC\u000d\u000a      (2010-2013) in Cambridge and London led to a number of policy impacts' (p.\u000d\u000a      4, source 8). DECC described EPRG as `the premier group in electricity\u000d\u000a      markets' (and David Newbery as a key player)' (p. 16, source 8).

An EU policy-maker stated, `we have followed what\u000d\u000a      [EPRG] are doing, downloaded papers, and been inspired by documents' (p.\u000d\u000a      19, source 8). Industrial users credited EPRG with `moving the debate from\u000d\u000a      a rhetorical one to a more quantitative approach, where facts and figures\u000d\u000a      are being brought to bear. They moved the policy debate forward on issues\u000d\u000a      such as carbon capture and storage, distribution networks, energy market\u000d\u000a      reform, ... cost of renewable policy, security of supply, ... and how\u000d\u000a      commercial projects ... should be taken forward and regulated.

Earlier research\u000d\u000a      (Brunekreeft, Neuhoff and Newbery, 2005, of Cambridge University) argued\u000d\u000a      cogently for Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP) to guide generation\u000d\u000a      investment to the efficient location and ensure efficient dispatch,\u000d\u000a      supplemented by additional access charges.\u000d\u000a    B. Electricity and carbon market reform: Newbery had published\u000d\u000a      extensively on the design and operation of the electricity wholesale\u000d\u000a      market of England and Wales since its launch in 1990. He and others\u000d\u000a      extensively criticised the 1998 proposal to reform the electricity market\u000d\u000a      (Newbery, 2005), providing the intellectual foundation for the\u000d\u000a      Government's Electricity Market Reform White Paper of 2011. Roques,\u000d\u000a      Newbery et al. (2006) argued that fossil generation enjoyed a natural\u000d\u000a      hedge because the price of electricity was set by the cost of fossil fuels\u000d\u000a      and the carbon price, disadvantaging low-carbon generation such as nuclear\u000d\u000a      power. Newbery criticized the way in which the EU Emissions Trading System\u000d\u000a      (ETS) determined the price of carbon by setting a quota. The intellectual\u000d\u000a      case for setting a carbon price or tax instead was developed in Grubb and\u000d\u000a      Newbery (2008). Newbery (2008) further argued that fixing a quota\u000d\u000a      amplified market power in the gas market. A series of presentations and\u000d\u000a      submissions, summarized in Newbery (2011), argued that the ETS meant that\u000d\u000a      any additional renewable energy would not reduce CO2 as that was set by\u000d\u000a      the cap, undermining support for the Renewables Directive, whereas a\u000d\u000a      carbon tax would ensure that any additional renewable energy would create\u000d\u000a      additional carbon reductions; and pointed out that the ETS carbon price\u000d\u000a      was too volatile, too low, and not credible.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17233","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aBackground\u000d\u000aRSA is one of the world's leading multinational insurance groups, focusing on general insurance.

The Solvency II Directive,adopted by the EU\u000d\u000ain the European Council in 2009, significantly change how the capital requirement of general\u000d\u000ainsurers is set and assessed. To ensure compliance with the new regulations, RSA set up a\u000d\u000aresearch programme into reserving which has fed through to impact on RSA policies and practise.\u000d\u000aTo facilitate the research and its impact, Jens Nielsen, then research director at RSA, set up a\u000d\u000a\"knowledge loop\" in 2004, which continues today, whereby practical problems confronting RSA are\u000d\u000afed through as research questions for academic research, the research is then tested on RSA data\u000d\u000athrough an internship programme. The outcome of this process is then evaluated by RSA with a\u000d\u000aview to implementation or to stimulate further research. Dr Bent Nielsen was contacted initially by\u000d\u000aJens Nielsen, in 2004, to lead the research into problems of calendar effects in the chain ladder\u000d\u000amodel. Bent Nielsen then became associated with RSA as an academic consultant from 2004 to\u000d\u000a2012. As part of this \"knowledge loop\" with RSA, Bent Nielsen also organised a number of\u000d\u000aworkshops in Oxford between 2006 and 2008 as a part of RSAs corporate development\u000d\u000aprogramme. These discussed the emerging research with participation from academics and about\u000d\u000a20 actuaries from RSA helping to continue this co-productive research dialogue.\u000d\u000aInternship programme\u000d\u000aAn annual internship programme has been running since 2004 for 2-3 Oxford undergraduate\u000d\u000amathematics students. It involves a period spent absorbing recently researched methods and\u000d\u000aassociated computer programs, followed by a period of testing the methods on RSA data. In the\u000d\u000ainitial period the students are supervised by academics. Subsequently they are supervised by RSA\u000d\u000aactuaries. The students then write their findings up in a confidential internal research report and\u000d\u000amake an oral presentation to RSA management. The topic of the internship has changed from year\u000d\u000ato year. In 2009 the main topic was calendar effects with Dr Bent Nielsen leading the initial\u000d\u000aacademic supervision and guidance.\u000d\u000aImpact 1: Research on calendar effects\u000d\u000aTo date the research by Dr Bent Nielsen and others has impacted on the operations of RSA in two\u000d\u000amain ways.

In 2009, the possible effects of\u000d\u000athe financial crisis on their reserves was a key issue for RSA and the research on forecasting in the\u000d\u000apresence of structural breaks [R3] was the focus of the 2009 internship.

General insurers are faced with delays from insured\u000d\u000aevents happening to the final settlement of the claim. Typical reasons are (i) delays between event\u000d\u000aand reporting to the insurer; and (ii) delays from reporting to settlement of the claim. The delays\u000d\u000acan run into years for employers' liability or auto third party liability or even decades in the case of\u000d\u000amesothelioma caused by employment related exposure to asbestos. General insurers are required\u000d\u000ato hold large capital reserves to cover outstanding liabilities.\u000d\u000aMany of the problems encountered in reserve forecasting are closely related to those found in\u000d\u000atime-series econometrics. Dr Bent Nielsen, a leading researcher in the field of time-series\u000d\u000aeconometrics, led the research to develop new statistical methods for reserve forecasting, which\u000d\u000acan be broken down into the following areas\u000d\u000a1) Research on calendar effects\u000d\u000aThe traditional approach to forecasting the capital reserve, needed to cover outstanding liabilities,\u000d\u000ais the Chain Ladder method. It is a two-way Poisson regression allowing for policy year and delay\u000d\u000ayear effects. In practice, it is often necessary to include a third component for the calendar year.\u000d\u000aThe calendar effect introduces problems with respect to identification and extrapolation of the\u000d\u000amodel. The identification problem is the same as that found in the so-called \"age-period-cohort\"\u000d\u000amodels used in economics, epidemiology, biostatistics, sociology. In those literatures, the problem\u000d\u000ahas been extensively discussed but only partially solved, whereas the extrapolation problem has\u000d\u000agone unnoticed.\u000d\u000aThe identification problem is that the three effects cannot be fully separated from each other. In a\u000d\u000aPoisson regression, this shows up as perfect collinearity among the regressors. It was found that\u000d\u000athe problem is related to those encountered in time-series econometrics. Dr Bent Nielsen and his\u000d\u000aco-researchers solved the identification problem by establishing a representation theorem that\u000d\u000acharacterises exactly what can and what cannot be estimated by the models [R1]. The\u000d\u000aextrapolation problem arises from the need to extrapolate the estimated calendar effect in order to\u000d\u000aforecast the reserves. If the identification problem is handled incorrectly then the forecast has\u000d\u000aundesired, but avoidable, arbitrary components. The research identifies a necessary and sufficient\u000d\u000acondition for avoiding such arbitrary components [R2].\u000d\u000a2) Research on forecasting in the presence of structural breaks\u000d\u000aInsurers are occasionally faced with structural breaks in the underlying economy which can have a\u000d\u000abig impact on the reserves. The problem of forecasting in the presence of structural breaks has\u000d\u000abeen studied in time series econometrics, and research led by Dr Nielsen demonstrates how these\u000d\u000aresults may be translated across to the reserving problem [R3].\u000d\u000a3) [text removed for publication]\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"17497","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"51537","Name":"Somalia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Shortland has shaped the policy dialogue on Somali piracy through direct\u000d\u000a      presentations to policy-makers, practitioners and through wide media\u000d\u000a      coverage. Many of her ideas and research results shaped the World Bank's\u000d\u000a      2013 policy report on Somali piracy.\u000d\u000a    Shortland regularly presents her research on piracy to commanding\u000d\u000a      officers of the Royal Navy, EU Atalanta and NATO. She is frequently\u000d\u000a      invited to speak at conferences, workshops, VIP naval events and has been\u000d\u000a      engaged in dialogue with naval command since 2010. Over this period the\u000d\u000a      naval leadership has increasingly referred to the Royal Navy's role as a\u000d\u000a      supporting force to the wider comprehensive approach towards a \"desirable\u000d\u000a      and sustainable end state\" in the Horn of Africa. In public speeches naval\u000d\u000a      commanders no longer speak of seeking to \"eradicate\" Somali piracy but to\u000d\u000a      \"contain\" it until land-based policies gain traction.\u000d\u000a    Shortland obtained funding from the Royal Navy Hudson Trust to organise\u000d\u000a      two academic conferences on Maritime Security in April 2012 and January\u000d\u000a      2013. Both conferences also had the personal endorsement as well as\u000d\u000a      financial and administrative support from the Director of Naval Staff. The\u000d\u000a      second Hudson Trust conference was entitled \"Maritime Security as a\u000d\u000a      Development Goal\" underlining the shift in policy focus from sea-based law\u000d\u000a      enforcement towards comprehensive policy-solutions for organised maritime\u000d\u000a      crime. Preparations for the 2014 conference indicate the value naval\u000d\u000a      commanders place on the continued policy dialogue between practitioners\u000d\u000a      and academics on maritime security.\u000d\u000a    Shortland presented her work on the community-level implications of\u000d\u000a      piracy at a cross-Whitehall meeting hosted by Cabinet Office in March\u000d\u000a      2011, to SAS commanders in April 2011, at Chatham House in January 2012,\u000d\u000a      to World Bank and UNODC staff in Nairobi in March 2012 and to MEPs and EU\u000d\u000a      Atalanta staff at the ALDE conference in June 2012. She also presented her\u000d\u000a      work on ransoms the Institute of Strategic Studies in September 2012 and\u000d\u000a      at a Foreign Policy Centre event at the House of Commons in March 2013.\u000d\u000a      Shortland's research also received wide media coverage, for example in the\u000d\u000a      Financial Times, the Independent, New Scientist and Handelsblatt.\u000d\u000a      Shortland appeared on BBC Radio 4, CNN, Channel 4 News, the BBC World\u000d\u000a      Service, ARD (Tagesschau) and CBS News. Her research was featured on the\u000d\u000a      front-page of the CNN and BBC News International websites.\u000d\u000a    In March 2012 Shortland joined an international team of specialists\u000d\u000a      writing the World Bank's flagship report on Somali piracy, led by the\u000d\u000a      Africa Region's Chief Economist's Office. Shortland's research on the role\u000d\u000a      of coastal communities in providing security for pirates (published\u000d\u000a      jointly with Federico Varese as a European Security Economics (EUSECON)\u000d\u000a      working paper in September 2012) shaped the policy conclusions of this\u000d\u000a      report. The World Bank report repeats the conclusions of Shortland and\u000d\u000a      Varese's work in calling for a \"paradigm shift\" in the approach to piracy:\u000d\u000a      rather than targeting the perpetrators of the crime, the international\u000d\u000a      community must engage with its enablers.\u000d\u000a    The report champions a policy solution based on a combination of law\u000d\u000a      enforcement and developmental initiatives in the coastal regions.\u000d\u000a      Sustainable counter-piracy is therefore closely linked to the success of\u000d\u000a      state-building in Somalia, requiring international financial and political\u000d\u000a      support. Before the launch of the report Shortland was involved in\u000d\u000a      building such institutional support from the European External Action\u000d\u000a      Service (EEAS) at a joint meeting of the World Bank and EEAS in Brussels\u000d\u000a      in March 2013. The World Bank launched the piracy report in Mogadishu in\u000d\u000a      April 2013 as the first public event of its re-engagement process with\u000d\u000a      Somalia, which was concurrently announced at the G8 summit.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Shortland's research on Somali piracy has influenced the general policy\u000d\u000a      debate on Somali piracy through extensive media coverage and presentations\u000d\u000a      to key policy-makers and stakeholders.

Pirates initially gained from the\u000d\u000a      concentration of shipping traffic in the recommended transit corridors.\u000d\u000a      Only when the transit corridor was well protected did pirates change\u000d\u000a      tactics: they moved into the open seas which were impossible to protect\u000d\u000a      militarily. A second issue with naval operations was the lack of\u000d\u000a      deterrence arising from the \"catch and release\" approach to pirates caught\u000d\u000a      with insufficient evidence to convict.\u000d\u000a    Piracy Business Model\u000d\u000a    Shortland's research shows that a secure anchorage with reliable supply\u000d\u000a      lines is a key component of the Somali piracy business model. In effect,\u000d\u000a      those who control access to secure anchorages are able to extract\u000d\u000a      significant financial resources from the pirates. This in turn suggests\u000d\u000a      that some coastal communities and several politically powerful individuals\u000d\u000a      in Somalia's clan structure might have a financial incentive to resist\u000d\u000a      efforts to end piracy. Shortland's research indicates that a land- based\u000d\u000a      policy solution must be \"incentive compatible\": law-enforcement efforts\u000d\u000a      have to go hand in hand with policies to provide alternative livelihoods\u000d\u000a      in the relevant communities and contain potential \"spoilers\" in the\u000d\u000a      process.\u000d\u000a    Using satellite images in economic research\u000d\u000a    Given the dearth of verifiable economic data from Somalia, Shortland\u000d\u000a      analysed both high resolution and night-time satellite images of the\u000d\u000a      country to show how pirate ransoms affect local economic prosperity. This\u000d\u000a      corroborates the results from the business model analysis: piracy in\u000d\u000a      Somalia is a crime with community level implications where the proceeds\u000d\u000a      are not transferred out of the region. Somali piracy therefore calls for a\u000d\u000a      land-based policy approach with a development component. Related, the\u000d\u000a      nightlights analysis has many interesting applications in the study of\u000d\u000a      countries at the early stages of economic development and especially in\u000d\u000a      failed or highly corrupt states where terrestrial data collection is\u000d\u000a      non-existent or unreliable. For example, changes in light output can\u000d\u000a      provide independent evidence on the effectiveness of specific development\u000d\u000a      initiatives.\u000d\u000a    Dr Anja Shortland has started work on this research project in the autumn\u000d\u000a      term of 2009, while she was a Lecturer in Economics at Brunel University.\u000d\u000a      While conducting the related research she was promoted to Senior Lecturer\u000d\u000a      and, then, Reader in Economics.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18358","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"},{"GeoNamesId":"2264397","Name":"Portugal"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The initial impact of the programme of research was general, and added to\u000d\u000a      the discussion of the\u000d\u000a      adequacy of saving and regulation of pensions. Our empirical work for the\u000d\u000a      Commission and for the\u000d\u000a      Department of Work and Pensions showed clearly that at an aggregate level\u000d\u000a      savings were driven\u000d\u000a      by asset prices (both financial and real assets), and not by rational\u000d\u000a      calculation of needs for\u000d\u000a      retirement income.

The core of this analysis was the inclusion of the Barrell and\u000d\u000a      Davis (2007) and its use to\u000d\u000a      analyse changes in policy.

The group's\u000d\u000a      research showed that\u000d\u000a      in most countries these problems could be solved by raising working ages\u000d\u000a      by three years, with only\u000d\u000a      Greece and Spain, and perhaps Portugal, facing serious problems because of\u000d\u000a      their generous\u000d\u000a      replacement rates and low retirement ages\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    It is widely agreed that savings for funded pensions are inadequate,\u000d\u000a      while pay-as-you-go schemes\u000d\u000a      are unsustainable. Our research addressed determinants and adequacy of\u000d\u000a      saving, and policies to\u000d\u000a      alleviate the problem.

Barrell, whilst at NIESR until 2011, and\u000d\u000a      Davis, whilst full time at\u000d\u000a      Brunel until 2009 and part time thereafter, worked on the determinants of\u000d\u000a      consumption and on\u000d\u000a      financial market and pension regulation (such as Davis 2002), including\u000d\u000a      regulation of annuities\u000d\u000a      markets. Davis's work appeared as a series of six Brunel working papers\u000d\u000a      (2004-9). Along with\u000d\u000a      others, he identified a savings shortfall in the UK (Davis 2004), itself\u000d\u000a      aggravated by various errors\u000d\u000a      in pension structure and regulation.\u000d\u000a    The EC funded further work in 2004-5 undertaken by Barrell and Davis on\u000d\u000a      the determinants of\u000d\u000a      consumption in Europe using a panel error correction approach, results of\u000d\u000a      which included\u000d\u000a      important wealth effects and also the detection of scope for demographic\u000d\u000a      impacts on saving,\u000d\u000a      whereby ageing reduces saving (Davis 2006 showed this demographic impact\u000d\u000a      across a wider\u000d\u000a      range of countries). This led to the publication of Barrell and Davis\u000d\u000a      (2007). The level and changes\u000d\u000a      in housing and financial wealth were shown to be important determinants of\u000d\u000a      (lack of) savings for\u000d\u000a      retirement in seven OECD countries. Increases in either equity market or\u000d\u000a      house price values would\u000d\u000a      depress saving, including in the form of pensions provision (most previous\u000d\u000a      studies had omitted real\u000d\u000a      wealth in consumption functions). This is a problem not only because of\u000d\u000a      its impact on pensions but\u000d\u000a      because increased pension saving could have particularly positive effects\u000d\u000a      on growth (Davis and Hu\u000d\u000a      2008) and as noted ageing itself reduces saving. Increases in house prices\u000d\u000a      in particular are a\u000d\u000a      problem when they induce lower saving because they represent an increase\u000d\u000a      in individual wealth for\u000d\u000a      home owners, but not in national wealth, and therefore in the ability to\u000d\u000a      finance pensions.\u000d\u000a    The team started to investigate the impacts of extending working lives,\u000d\u000a      first on productivity. The\u000d\u000a      work suggested that increased participation of older people did not\u000d\u000a      significantly reduce productivity,\u000d\u000a      although older people may not be as productive as those in middle age.\u000d\u000a      These results on ageing\u000d\u000a      and retirement presented Davis presented them in Vienna (Davis 2005) and\u000d\u000a      at the Bundesbank in\u000d\u000a      2006. These results, along with those in Barrell and Davis were used as\u000d\u000a      the core of work for a\u000d\u000a      report to the Department of Work and Pensions in 2011 of the impacts of\u000d\u000a      extending working lives\u000d\u000a      on the economy. A preliminary version of this work, based on directly\u000d\u000a      allocated funds, was\u000d\u000a      circulated in 2009. Analyses were undertaken of the impacts of one, two,\u000d\u000a      and three years extra\u000d\u000a      working lives on consumption and output in the UK. Although the savings\u000d\u000a      rate would be reduced,\u000d\u000a      savings adequacy for retirement would be increased.

The country has chosen a\u000d\u000a      radical approach to power industry regulation that includes controlling\u000d\u000a      the price and the output of each firm. In contrast, most other countries\u000d\u000a      have liberalised their electricity markets. Why has China chosen a\u000d\u000a      different approach and does it work well? In this context, the results of\u000d\u000a      our study are highly relevant. Below we present our contribution and\u000d\u000a      impact:\u000d\u000a    (1) China's macroeconomic performance has drawn the world's attention,\u000d\u000a      but studies of the energy sector which fuels economic growth had only\u000d\u000a      limited success in understanding the system. Our study of China's\u000d\u000a      electricity sector has bridged this gap and provided valuable insights\u000d\u000a      into the industry and, especially, price and output setting.\u000d\u000a    (2) The study explored the industry theoretically and empirically with a\u000d\u000a      focus on understanding how China prices its electric power to support its\u000d\u000a      significant growth over the last two decades. The soft price constraint\u000d\u000a      impedes the restructuring of the industry and efficiency improvements, so\u000d\u000a      that ultimately the regulatory framework fails to deliver the desired\u000d\u000a      outcome. The problem identified in this study shows the importance of\u000d\u000a      price reform for the Chinese economy. The electricity regulator needs to\u000d\u000a      improve the cost efficiency of the industry by implementing alternative\u000d\u000a      pricing mechanisms that provide the firms with the right incentives to\u000d\u000a      lower costs and invest in sustainable technologies.\u000d\u000a    (3) This project has had an impact on the regulatory processes in China.\u000d\u000a      The officials in the Chinese State Electricity Regulatory Commission have\u000d\u000a      used a related article (the Chinese version) as one of the main references\u000d\u000a      to support their price reform initiatives. The proposed reforms of the\u000d\u000a      Commission aim to change the pricing system through co-ordination with\u000d\u000a      other government departments such State Development and Reform Commission.\u000d\u000a      The findings of our project provide strong scientific evidence that allows\u000d\u000a      the policy makers to understand the importance of the pricing system\u000d\u000a      reform and speed up the planning and implementation of an alternative\u000d\u000a      framework when a new Chinese government comes to the power.\u000d\u000a    (4) The issues related to cost efficiency improvement in China addressed\u000d\u000a      by our study have wider policy implications for governments and central\u000d\u000a      banks in advanced economies. To the extent to which the prospective\u000d\u000a      electricity sector reforms in China will increase the cost efficiency of\u000d\u000a      power supply and, ultimately, the country's competitiveness, this is\u000d\u000a      likely to have an effect on global capital flow configurations and other\u000d\u000a      economies.\u000d\u000a    (5) The soft price constraint shows that the inefficient firms are not\u000d\u000a      directly subsidised by the `soft budget', but by the `soft price'. This is\u000d\u000a      a new economic phenomenon that may be relevant to other transition\u000d\u000a      economies. In effect, our study contributes to the existing literature on\u000d\u000a      the economics of transition and opens new directions for research that\u000d\u000a      complement the studies of the `soft budget constraint' (e.g. Kornai, 1992)\u000d\u000a      by focusing on the novel soft price constraint.\u000d\u000a    (6) Why has China chosen a different electricity market regulatory\u000d\u000a      approach? The government believed that the controlled price system could\u000d\u000a      help regulate the industry more effectively while serving its strategic\u000d\u000a      interest in providing cheaper electricity to the economy and supporting\u000d\u000a      growth. Our study shows that the regulation in its current form fails to\u000d\u000a      lower the cost and, consequently, the prices. Rather, it induces the firms\u000d\u000a      to manipulate upwards their costs in order to sell at a higher controlled\u000d\u000a      price. Our empirical evidence has convinced the Chinese government and has\u000d\u000a      also strengthened its political will by highlighting the need for price\u000d\u000a      reform that improves the cost efficiency of power supply. This impact\u000d\u000a      claim is made on the basis of the comments given by the Deputy Director\u000d\u000a      for the Price and Finance Division of the State Electricity Regulatory\u000d\u000a      Commission, who oversees electricity prices in China.\u000d\u000a    China is the largest electricity producer in the world with 80% of the\u000d\u000a      power produced from its coal-fired power firms. Any policy that would\u000d\u000a      result in lower costs could have wider implications and may result in\u000d\u000a      global benefits if the cost saving helped the Chinese producers to invest\u000d\u000a      in environmental projects and reduce pollution. Well-designed price\u000d\u000a      reforms would have significant effects both on productive efficiency and\u000d\u000a      also on environmental improvement.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This study is part of a research project on China's electricity industry\u000d\u000a      conducted jointly with the Universit&#233; de la M&#233;diterran&#233;e in France, and\u000d\u000a      Swiss Electricity Ltd, and is funded by the EU. Despite three decades of\u000d\u000a      market-oriented reforms in China, the electricity price-formation process\u000d\u000a      is still state-controlled. The study shows how this process induces\u000d\u000a      electricity producers to manipulate costs to gain an advantage when\u000d\u000a      negotiating prices with the state.

The project team\u000d\u000a      consisted of 6 researchers from Brunel University, University de la\u000d\u000a      Mediterranee in France and Swiss Electricity Ltd, and the study the\u000d\u000a      pricing issues of the industry is part of tasks delegated to Brunel team\u000d\u000a      headed by Prof Guy Liu. Over a period of four years, our research team has\u000d\u000a      analysed data and surveys from more than 300 Chinese electricity firms,\u000d\u000a      and undertaken field studies of the relationship between Chinese power\u000d\u000a      firms and the industry regulator. We have identified that, although China\u000d\u000a      has pursued market-oriented economic reforms for three decades, its\u000d\u000a      electricity industry is still governed by a planned system whereby the\u000d\u000a      state regulates not only the output of each firm, but also both its\u000d\u000a      on-grid price (the price at which the firm sells its output) and the\u000d\u000a      end-user prices. Furthermore, we have explored, both theoretically and\u000d\u000a      empirically, how the state regulates firms' on-grid prices. We have found\u000d\u000a      that the prices are set through a bargaining process between the state and\u000d\u000a      the firms that aims to balance the need to stimulate overall economic\u000d\u000a      growth (by supplying low cost electricity) and the needs of the power\u000d\u000a      industry for sustainable development. As a result of this process, if a\u000d\u000a      firm has a higher cost it is allowed to sell at a higher regulated price,\u000d\u000a      and this creates an incentive for the manipulation of costs by the power\u000d\u000a      firms.\u000d\u000a    The study refers to this cost-based negotiated price as creating a `soft\u000d\u000a      price constraint' in the Chinese electricity sector. Currently, the\u000d\u000a      state-owned grid company purchases output produced by power firms at a\u000d\u000a      state-controlled on-grid price and resells output to end-users also at a\u000d\u000a      state-controlled price. Consistent with this study, the company complains\u000d\u000a      about the controlled high on-grid prices charged by high-cost electricity\u000d\u000a      producers. Our study also examines how far the soft price constraint\u000d\u000a      raises the cost of electricity supply in the economy. It explores the\u000d\u000a      issue further through an international review of electricity prices and\u000d\u000a      identifies that, although the labour costs faced by Chinese power firms\u000d\u000a      are only one-tenth of those of their OECD counterparts, the cost of power\u000d\u000a      supply in China is no less than the average OECD standard for both\u000d\u000a      industrial users and household users. In fact, in terms of the purchasing\u000d\u000a      power, Chinese households pay more than their OECD counterparts. Our study\u000d\u000a      suggests that the Chinese electricity producers would be able to reduce\u000d\u000a      their costs if provided with the correct pricing mechanism. Such\u000d\u000a      significant cost savings would also enable the firms to invest in\u000d\u000a      environment-friendly technologies without putting pressure on end-user\u000d\u000a      prices.\u000d\u000a    The results of this project have been reported to the State Electricity\u000d\u000a      Regulatory Commission of China. They were presented at research\u000d\u000a      conferences attended by government officials from the Commission (Beijing\u000d\u000a      Oct 2011 and Geneva Oct 2012). They have also been submitted as academic\u000d\u000a      articles in both Chinese and English versions (Liu 2012, and Beirne et al\u000d\u000a      2012) to the Department of Price and Finance of the Commission. The\u000d\u000a      relevance of our argument about the current on-grid pricing mechanism and\u000d\u000a      its adverse impact on the restructuring of the power industry and the\u000d\u000a      market efficiency has been recognised by the officials of the Commission.\u000d\u000a      They commented that \"the arguments made by the study have helped us\u000d\u000a      understand more about the problems of the current plan system, adding a\u000d\u000a      further impact on us as an electricity policy maker of the country to\u000d\u000a      prioritise our plan on reform of the current on-grid prices towards a more\u000d\u000a      market-oriented pricing system.

The more capital a banking system has, the less likely\u000d\u000a      it is to experience a\u000d\u000a      crisis, and the same is true with liquidity.

Karim's Brunel financed PhD (2008)\u000d\u000a      outlined three approaches\u000d\u000a      to Early Warning Systems (EWS) for banking crises, logit, signal\u000d\u000a      extraction and binomial recursive\u000d\u000a      tree. Davis and Karim (2008) showed logit was superior in all respects.\u000d\u000a      However, the variables in\u000d\u000a      extant EWS were unable to predict the subprime crisis, suggesting EWS need\u000d\u000a      to be estimated on\u000d\u000a      subgroups of countries rather than global samples, and with an extended\u000d\u000a      set of variables. Work by\u000d\u000a      Davis and Zhu (2011) had several years earlier suggested a link to\u000d\u000a      commercial property prices,\u000d\u000a      and lack of data in large samples of countries constrained researchers\u000d\u000a      from looking for the effects\u000d\u000a      of capital and liquidity.\u000d\u000a    By 2008, Barrell, Davis and Karim were established experts in various\u000d\u000a      aspects of predicting\u000d\u000a      financial crises and analysing their impacts. At the time this was a\u000d\u000a      specialist field as many in the\u000d\u000a      subject felt crises were unlikely to happen. Once the crisis of 2007-8\u000d\u000a      began to unfold the Financial\u000d\u000a      Services Authority needed research on the causes and consequences of\u000d\u000a      crises for the Turner\u000d\u000a      Report, and they approached this team. Around &#163;200,000 of research money\u000d\u000a      was obtained without\u000d\u000a      competition. The ESRC also supplemented the funding (without competition)\u000d\u000a      by &#163;30,000. The FSA\u000d\u000a      requested intensive work on optimal bank capital and liquidity for Basel\u000d\u000a      III. We used the funding to\u000d\u000a      publish papers in leading journals, and as a foundation for competitively\u000d\u000a      obtained ESRC funds.\u000d\u000a    The core of our work demonstrated for the first time that variables that\u000d\u000a      were under the control of\u000d\u000a      the regulator affected the incidence of crises, and hence there could be\u000d\u000a      regulatory policies that\u000d\u000a      reduced crises incidence. These policies were however not costless. In an\u000d\u000a      EWS for OECD\u000d\u000a      countries, we found that bank capital, bank liquidity and house prices,\u000d\u000a      not used in earlier work,\u000d\u000a      dominated all the other variables (Barrell et al 2010). In a report for\u000d\u000a      the FSA (Barrell et al 2009\u000d\u000a      Occasional Paper 38) we estimated a banking sector model for the UK, with\u000d\u000a      an impact of capital\u000d\u000a      and liquidity on spreads between lending and borrowing rates. Using a\u000d\u000a      production function\u000d\u000a      approach we showed that costs from widening spreads affect investment and\u000d\u000a      potential output. The\u000d\u000a      benefits of increased standards were shown to be reducing the risk of the\u000d\u000a      long run scarring of the\u000d\u000a      economy due to higher risk premia after a crisis, which arises in turn\u000d\u000a      from a lower probability of a\u000d\u000a      banking crisis. We found a positive net benefit for a 2-6 percentage point\u000d\u000a      increase in capital and\u000d\u000a      liquidity ratios. A number of other policy relevant papers followed, for\u000d\u000a      instance assessing off\u000d\u000a      balance sheet impact on crisis probabilities using non-interest income\u000d\u000a      (Barrell et al 2012)\u000d\u000a    Subsequent follow-up research on crisis prediction and bank behaviour,\u000d\u000a      including a further ESRC\u000d\u000a      grant for Karim for work on Emerging Market Countries have further\u000d\u000a      underpinned the major impact\u000d\u000a      of our work on the global bank regulatory reform. Barrell and Karim\u000d\u000a      investigated determinants of\u000d\u000a      crises in emerging markets, and used the ESRC funded work along with more\u000d\u000a      OECD work when\u000d\u000a      they presented work on macroprudential policy and credit at the Bank of\u000d\u000a      England (Barrell and\u000d\u000a      Karim 2013), the UN and elsewhere.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18492","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a      The Bank of England engages with academia in order to explain current\u000a        policy issues and\u000a        learn about tools and models that may be useful for addressing them.\u000a        This engagement\u000a        process often leads to research projects involving both Bank staff and\u000a        external academics,\u000a        the results of which are described in internal publications such as the\u000a        Quarterly Bulletin.\u000a        These publications, in turn, inform decisions by policymakers at the\u000a        Bank.\u000a      Kapetanios was employed by the Bank prior to joining QMUL, and\u000a        continues to spend one\u000a        day a week there on a permanent basis, so he is well placed to\u000a        participate in the interchange\u000a        of ideas between academics and policymakers. His research in\u000a        collaboration with staff at the\u000a        Bank has continued to influence both its operational practices and its\u000a        conduct of monetary\u000a        policy. The examples of collaborative research described below\u000a        demonstrate this impact: in\u000a        all three cases, Kapetanios was personally involved in the production of\u000a        briefing notes\u000a        presented to the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to inform and support\u000a        its decision-making.\u000a      1. Macroeconomic forecasting.\u000a      Since monetary policy is forward looking, a critical factor for its\u000a        effectiveness is the\u000a        availability of accurate macroeconomic forecasts. This is especially so,\u000a        as in recent years, in\u000a        the aftermath of a severe recession.\u000a      Kapetanios's research has led to the development of a suite of novel\u000a        statistical models that\u000a        are routinely used by the Bank to construct forecasts of key indicators\u000a        such as GDP growth\u000a        and inflation for the Monetary Policy Committee. These models exploit\u000a        data and methods not\u000a        previously included in the Bank of England Quarterly Model, the\u000a        institution's primary\u000a        framework for producing official economic projections. For example, the\u000a        suite contains linear\u000a        and non-linear univariate models whose performance Kapetanios has\u000a        compared with official\u000a        forecasts (see reference #4 in Section 3 above).\u000a      2. Uncertainty in data releases.\u000a      Most macroeconomic data are uncertain; that is, they are estimates\u000a        rather than perfect\u000a        measures of the economic variables of interest. Quantifying and\u000a        correcting for this\u000a        uncertainty is of great importance for the conduct of monetary policy.\u000a      In 2005 Kapetanios was asked by the Bank of England to serve as the\u000a        lead econometrician\u000a        on a team assigned to study biases and other deficiencies in early ONS\u000a        releases, and to\u000a        propose methods for addressing these issues. This research collaboration\u000a        has produced\u000a        innovative tools for understanding and using uncertain macroeconomic\u000a        data, including a\u000a        behavioural model of government statistical agencies and an analysis of\u000a        the trade-off\u000a        between accuracy and recentness of information (see references #2 and #5\u000a        in Section 3\u000a        above). Bank staff who brief the Monetary Policy Committee regularly use\u000a        this data-uncertainty\u000a        toolkit to improve their forecasts of macroeconomic trends.\u000a      3. Effects of quantitative easing.\u000a      After the financial crisis intensified in late 2008, the Bank of\u000a        England and other central banks\u000a        loosened monetary policy by both conventional and unconventional means.\u000a        In the UK, the\u000a        principal unconventional policy measure has been the so-called\u000a        \"quantitative easing\"\u000a        programme, which has made large-scale asset purchases financed by\u000a        central bank money.\u000a      Kapetanios has recently coordinated a Bank project aiming to quantify\u000a        the macroeconomic\u000a        effects of the QE programme. A variety of vector autoregression models\u000a        indicate that the first\u000a        round of asset purchases had peak effects of approximately +1.5% on real\u000a        GDP and +1.25%\u000a        on CPI inflation. These findings have provided the main source of\u000a        scientific support for the\u000a        effectiveness of the QE policy in the UK during the Great Recession.\u000a      ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    George Kapetanios's research on macroeconomic modelling and forecasting\u000a      has influenced\u000a      both the operational practices of the Bank of England and its conduct of\u000a      UK monetary policy.\u000a      His work has:\u000a    \u000a      led to the creation of novel forecasting tools that have been adopted\u000a        by the Bank to\u000a        inform the Monetary Policy Committee on macroeconomic trends,\u000a      enabled the Bank to extract information from ONS macroeconomic data\u000a        more\u000a        effectively by producing estimates that correct for deficiencies in\u000a        early ONS releases,\u000a      informed the Bank's decision to adopt quantitative easing by\u000a        estimating the effects of\u000a        this policy on GDP growth and inflation, and provided the main source of\u000a        scientific\u000a        support for the effectiveness of the QE policy in the UK during the\u000a        Great Recession.\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactType":"Economic","Institution":"\u000a    Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Queen Mary, University of London","InstitutionName":"Queen Mary, University of London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007775}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a      \u000aA state space approach to extracting the signal from uncertain data.\u000a        (With A.\u000a        Cunningham, J.

Standardisation of statistics.\u000d\u000a    The mission of the UCW programme includes the collection, archiving, and\u000d\u000a      distribution of accurate statistics on child labour from around the world.\u000d\u000a      These statistics are used heavily by policymakers, development\u000d\u000a      specialists, and the media to measure progress in this area and to make\u000d\u000a      cross-country comparisons. Standardisation of figures arising from\u000d\u000a      different sources is necessary if these measurements and comparisons are\u000d\u000a      to be meaningful.\u000d\u000a\u0009Manacorda has devoted considerable attention to this\u000d\u000a      problem in his work with UCW. He led a study of the comparability issue\u000d\u000a      (see source #2 in Section 5 below) that came to pessimistic conclusions,\u000d\u000a      finding the child labour statistics (and hence the resulting international\u000d\u000a      rankings) to be worryingly fragile due to variations in the survey\u000d\u000a      instruments used to collect them. He then proceeded to develop a method of\u000d\u000a      standardising these statistics that is scalable and easy to use, providing\u000d\u000a      a valuable service to research and public policy related to child labour\u000d\u000a      incidence.\u000d\u000a    2. Public sector practices.\u000d\u000a    Since 2001 the US Department of Labor (USDOL) has distributed\u000d\u000a      approximately $250 million through its Education Initiative (EI) to\u000d\u000a      projects aimed at reducing child labour. In 2009 Manacorda joined the EI's\u000d\u000a      Technical Advisory Group, charged with the task of developing methods to\u000d\u000a      analyse the effectiveness of particular interventions and improving the\u000d\u000a      transparency of the programme as a whole.\u000d\u000a    Manacorda's recommendations &#8212; drawing on methods used in his published\u000d\u000a      research &#8212; were made in technical reports (see source #3 in Section 5\u000d\u000a      below) that outlined the general principles of programme evaluation,\u000d\u000a      highlighted how randomised controlled trials (a powerful empirical\u000d\u000a      strategy commonly used in applied microeconomics) were essential for\u000d\u000a      establishing programme gains in a scientifically credible way, established\u000d\u000a      criteria for assessing existing projects and explained how an evaluation\u000d\u000a      component could be built into the design of new programmes.\u000d\u000a    A recent analysis of an EI project in Nepal, providing schooling\u000d\u000a      assistance to a group of child carpet weavers, which includes a randomised\u000d\u000a      controlled trial, was shown to confer substantial benefits on both the\u000d\u000a      children and the households in which they lived.\u000d\u000a    3. Child labour policy debates.\u000d\u000a    Manacorda is committed to improving understanding of the phenomenon of\u000d\u000a      child labour by governments, international organisations, and the general\u000d\u000a      public. He has taken every opportunity to explain how the tools of applied\u000d\u000a      microeconomics can address this subject and help to guide the formulation\u000d\u000a      of effective policy. For example, he has\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      been interviewed by the BBC and Al Jazeera on the occasion of June 12th,\u000d\u000a        designated the World Day Against Child Labour;\u000d\u000a      spoken at practitioner conferences (eg, the Oslo High Level Group on\u000d\u000a        Education for All) and at seminars at international organizations (e.g.\u000d\u000a        the World Bank) on topics such as the interaction between child labour\u000d\u000a        and globalisation, and school accessibility and child labour; and\u000d\u000a      participated in the UK consultation on \"Vulnerabilities\" for the UN\u000d\u000a        Development Programme's Human Development Report 2014.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Manacorda's research in this area has featured in the Lancet World Report\u000d\u000a      on Child Labour as well as in policy documents from organisations\u000d\u000a      including the ILO, UN Development Programme, UNESCO, Unicef, and World\u000d\u000a      Bank (see sources #4-6 in Section 5 below).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Marco Manacorda's research on the causes of child labour and its\u000d\u000a      interaction with schooling has influenced policy and led to a more nuanced\u000d\u000a      understanding of the issue by governments and international organisations.\u000d\u000a      Specifically, his work has:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      provided a method of standardising statistics from different sources,\u000d\u000a        yielding more reliable cross-country comparisons;\u000d\u000a      devised criteria for the evaluation of interventions carried out by\u000d\u000a        the US Department of Labor under its Education Initiative (EI); and\u000d\u000a      enhanced public understanding of the issue of child labour and the\u000d\u000a        efficacy of different policy responses.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Political","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Queen Mary, University of London","InstitutionName":"Queen Mary, University of London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007775}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a1.

However, neither the most effective way of\u000d\u000a      achieving these goals, nor even the exact causal relationship between\u000d\u000a      child labour and schooling is immediately clear.\u000d\u000a    Manacorda has contributed to the understanding of these issues and to the\u000d\u000a      policy debates surrounding child labour in a series of studies (conducted\u000d\u000a      jointly with colleagues at the World Bank, UCL, and Washington University\u000d\u000a      in St. Louis) funded by a Nuffield Foundation New Career Development\u000d\u000a      Fellowship (2002-05) and a research grant from the ESRC (2002-04).\u000d\u000a    Manacorda's research on child labour has offered new insights and at\u000d\u000a      times challenged facile assumptions. Key findings, established\u000d\u000a      empirically, include the following:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Contrary to a widespread perception, making schools more accessible in\u000d\u000a        poorer countries does not reduce child labour, though it does increase\u000d\u000a        school attendance. These effects were shown using data from rural\u000d\u000a        Tanzania, an area with an agriculture-based economy and a historically\u000d\u000a        high incidence of child labour (see reference #1 in Section 3 below).\u000d\u000a      Within the household, whether or not children work has no discernible\u000d\u000a        effect on the labour supply of either parent. If one child works,\u000d\u000a        however, any siblings are considerably less likely to work and more\u000d\u000a        likely to attend school. This indicates that the gains to the household\u000d\u000a        from child labour are largely redistributed among the children, and\u000d\u000a        hence extreme poverty is a better explanation of the phenomenon than\u000d\u000a        pure exploitation of children by parents. These effects were shown using\u000d\u000a        data from the US census of 1920 (see reference #2 in Section 3 below).\u000d\u000a      While a policy of requiring very poorly performing pupils to repeat\u000d\u000a        school years (and thus banning \"social promotion\") may create desirable\u000d\u000a        incentives to avoid failure, such a policy is also harmful in that it\u000d\u000a        exerts a causal effect on increased dropout rates and premature\u000d\u000a        participation in the labour market. This is true even when the decision\u000d\u000a        to drop out occurs years after the mandated repetition. These effects\u000d\u000a        were shown using data from junior high schools in Uruguay (see reference\u000d\u000a        #3 in Section 3 below).\u000d\u000a      Pre-school attendance exerts a similarly long-lasting positive\u000d\u000a        causal effect on duration of schooling and scholastic achievement. By\u000d\u000a        age fifteen, having attended pre-school is associated with a\u000d\u000a        27-percentage point increase in the probability of remaining in\u000d\u000a        education. This suggests that early intervention policies to subsidise\u000d\u000a        or otherwise encourage pre-school participation are an effective way to\u000d\u000a        improve the life chances of children who are at risk of low educational\u000d\u000a        attainment and early entry into the labour market. These effects were\u000d\u000a        shown using data from a period of rapid expansion in pre-school\u000d\u000a        attendance in Uruguay after 1995 (see reference #4 in Section 3 below).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18494","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3439705","Name":"Uruguay"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Manacorda has been working in Uruguay since the beginning of the last\u000d\u000a      decade. Following a change of government in the national elections of\u000d\u000a      2005, he was invited to join colleagues at the Universidad de la Rep&#250;blica\u000d\u000a      in helping (pro bono) the new government design and evaluate PANES.\u000d\u000a    Over the intervening years, Manacorda's research on social assistance\u000d\u000a      policy has had an impact in four main areas.\u000d\u000a    1. Resource targeting.\u000d\u000a    To address the challenge of alleviating poverty in a population not fully\u000d\u000a      covered by official records, as well as to allow a quasi-experimental\u000d\u000a      approach to evaluating the programme, Manacorda and his colleagues\u000d\u000a      proposed a carefully designed resource-targeting mechanism. This proposal\u000d\u000a      was presented formally by Manacorda to the Minister for Social Development\u000d\u000a      at a 2006 public conference sponsored by the Presidency of the Republic of\u000d\u000a      Uruguay (see source #6 in Section 5 below), and was later adopted by the\u000d\u000a      government for PANES and some other social welfare programmes.\u000d\u000a    The targeting mechanism functions by computing for each household a\u000d\u000a      poverty index based on verifiable information collected at the time of\u000d\u000a      application for social assistance. Only those households scoring above a\u000d\u000a      pre-defined threshold on the index are deemed eligible for transfer\u000d\u000a      payments. This mechanism has been judged a success in identifying\u000d\u000a      genuinely impoverished Uruguayans. An independent appraisal by the World\u000d\u000a      Bank described PANES as \"one of the most successful income transfer\u000d\u000a      programmes in terms of targeting effectiveness,\" with a higher percentage\u000d\u000a      of beneficiary households in the poorest quintile of the population \"than\u000d\u000a      what was achieved in other programs in Latin America and around the world\"\u000d\u000a      (see source #4 in Section 5 below; executive summary, point #14).\u000d\u000a    2. Programme evaluation.\u000d\u000a    As mentioned above, the resource-targeting mechanism used in PANES was\u000d\u000a      constructed in a way that allowed the programme to be evaluated\u000d\u000a      quasi-experimentally. Analysis of the data revealed clear evidence of\u000d\u000a      success both in poverty alleviation per se and in improvements to\u000d\u000a      the well-being of beneficiaries (whether impoverished or not). These\u000d\u000a      findings were communicated in technical reports (see source #3 in Section\u000d\u000a      5 below) and through discussions with officials in the Ministry of Social\u000d\u000a      Development, and they were an important factor in the Uruguayan\u000d\u000a      government's decision to scale up PANES and later to adopt the Plan de\u000d\u000a        Equidad (a comprehensive reform of the tax and benefit system\u000d\u000a      introduced in 2008).\u000d\u000a    3. Welfare policy debates.\u000d\u000a    Manacorda has actively disseminated the results of his research to a\u000d\u000a      variety of audiences. For example, in April 2011 he participated in a\u000d\u000a      policy dialogue on \"Labor Markets and Social Security\" at the IADB offices\u000d\u000a      in Washington, DC. This event &#8212; attended by 21 ministers and officials\u000d\u000a      from Latin American countries &#8212; offered the opportunity to inform\u000d\u000a      policymakers from across the region about the labour supply distortions\u000d\u000a      that can be an unintended consequence of social assistance policies.\u000d\u000a      Indeed, these effects proved to be significant in the Uruguayan case,\u000d\u000a      leading the government to reduce the strictness of means testing for some\u000d\u000a      entitlements and benefit programmes.\u000d\u000a    In addition to the IADB, Manacorda has presented his research findings at\u000d\u000a      the World Bank and at the OECD's Directorate for Employment, Labour and\u000d\u000a      Social Affairs. His analysis of the effects of PANES has been summarised\u000d\u000a      in a number of policy documents from the international institutions\u000d\u000a      already mentioned as well as from the UK Department for International\u000d\u000a      Development and the UN Development Programme (see sources #7-8 in Section\u000d\u000a      5 below). He has also given several interviews on social assistance\u000d\u000a      programmes to the local media (eg, Radio el Espectador and Televisi&#243;n\u000d\u000a      Nacional Uruguaya).\u000d\u000a    4.

This has materialized in a\u000d\u000a      formal protocol of data exchange, which has led to the sharing of best\u000d\u000a      practices for data collection, handling, storage, and release.

One such programme was Uruguay's Plan Atenci&#243;n Nacional\u000d\u000a        a la Emergencia Social (PANES), a temporary poverty alleviation\u000d\u000a      initiative that from 2005-07 covered 14% of the country's population.\u000d\u000a    Manacorda has been deeply involved in both the design and evaluation of\u000d\u000a      PANES. His initial contribution (together with colleagues at UC Berkeley\u000d\u000a      and the Universidad de la Rep&#250;blica in Montevideo) was to the programme's\u000d\u000a      resource targeting mechanism. He later used data from PANES to study the\u000d\u000a      intended and unintended consequences of cash transfer programmes,\u000d\u000a      contributing to a lively debate about the optimal design of social\u000d\u000a      assistance measures in developing countries.\u000d\u000a    Crucial for the success of the project was establishing good working\u000d\u000a      relationships with and between an array of governmental and\u000d\u000a      non-governmental organisations, including the Uruguayan Ministry of Social\u000d\u000a      Development, Ministry of Public Health, and social security administration\u000d\u000a      (ie, the Banco de Previsi&#243;n Social); as well as the Inter-American\u000d\u000a      Development Bank (IADB), which provided essential financial support. The\u000d\u000a      research involved both primary data collection and the use of large\u000d\u000a      amounts of detailed administrative data from various government sources.\u000d\u000a    Initial research focused on the mechanism used to select programme\u000d\u000a      beneficiaries based on an eligibility score. The nature of the scoring\u000d\u000a      rule allowed for an evaluation of the effects on recipients using a\u000d\u000a      regression discontinuity design. This and other empirical strategies were\u000d\u000a      able to demonstrate changes in several aspects of the behaviour and\u000d\u000a      well-being of cash-transfer recipients. For example, there was found to be\u000d\u000a      a significant increase in the proportion of beneficiary households that\u000d\u000a      favoured the incumbent government relative to its predecessor (see\u000d\u000a      reference #1 in Section 3 below).\u000d\u000a    A subsequent study, funded by the IADB under its project \"Improving Early\u000d\u000a      Childhood Development in Latin America,\" combined PANES data with official\u000d\u000a      birth records in order to show that the poverty alleviation initiative\u000d\u000a      increased weight and other measures of health at birth among children who\u000d\u000a      received cash transfers in utero via their mothers (see reference #2 in\u000d\u000a      Section 3 below).\u000d\u000a    A third strand of research, again funded by the IADB under its project\u000d\u000a      \"Social Assistance and Labor Supply in Latin America and the Caribbean\",\u000d\u000a      linked social security and PANES data (see reference #3 in Section 3\u000d\u000a      below).

While details of most of the advice to central banks\u000a      are confidential, his research has also stimulated much public debate and\u000a      Corsetti himself has written extensively in that policy debate, especially\u000a      in VoXEU.\u000a    International Dimensions of Monetary Policy [1 &#8212; section3]\u000a    Corsetti's research [1 &#8212; section 3] underlies much of Corsetti's\u000a      activities in support of the International Economic Analysis Division at\u000a      the Bank of England. The Chief Economist at the Bank writes (C1-section5),\u000a      \"[Corsetti's] research highlights that when financial markets are\u000a      imperfect, then optimal monetary policy in an open economy may require a\u000a      consideration of factors that go beyond the traditional closed economy\u000a      output and inflation gaps, to include the terms of trade and demand\u000a      imbalances. More broadly, his work on New Open Economy Macroeconomics has\u000a      helped move our thinking about how shocks propagate internationally beyond\u000a      the traditional trade linkages, to consider the roles of the exchange\u000a      rate, financial variables and the substitutability of home and foreign\u000a      goods.

The Chief Economist at the Bank, writes\u000a      (C1-section5), \"his work on the build up of imbalances within currency\u000a      unions has helped us better understand the run-up to the crisis in the\u000a      euro area and we've taken up his idea of using inflation differentials as\u000a      a summary statistic of total imbalances in our presentations to\u000a      policymakers.\"\u000a    In addition to the Bank of England, this work [1 &#8212; section 3] has been\u000a      presented to numerous central banks across the world including at the Bank\u000a      of Canada-European Central Bank Workshop on Exchange Rates, the\u000a      International Research Forum on Monetary Policy, the Swiss National Bank\u000a      conference on Monetary Policy Advances, the Reserve Bank of Australia,\u000a      Banco Central de Chile, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Reserve Bank of\u000a      New Zealand, Bank of Hungary.\u000a    Fiscal Multipliers [2,3,4,5 &#8212; section3]\u000a    The main lessons from the research on the fiscal multipliers at times of\u000a      fiscal and financial stress have been incorporated in numerous policy\u000a      models and exercises at the ECB and European national central banks. The\u000a      Head of Fiscal Policies Division at the ECB writes (C9 &#8212; section5): \". In\u000a      our internal simulations we made extensive use of the concepts and ideas\u000a      developed in the paper [2 - section 3], which proved to capture essential\u000a      elements of interest to a central bank. It is notable that the paper was\u000a      circulated well before the announcement of the OMT programme, which\u000a      essentially focuses on the impact of risk premia on government bonds on\u000a      the funding costs of the economy.\"\u000a    The main goal of these exercises is to clarify the appropriate role of\u000a      fiscal consolidation as part of a strategy of output stabilization, with a\u000a      critique of the idea of `expansionary contractions'. The Director of DG\u000a      Research at the ECB writes (C3-section5), \"[Corsetti's] work on fiscal\u000a      multipliers has been an important contribution to the debate about the\u000a      appropriate pace of fiscal consolidation in Europe. In particular, his\u000a      work on the importance of the sovereign risk channel has been highly\u000a      influential.\" In concluding, he writes: \"Overall, Giancarlo's research has\u000a      had a significant and important impact on the way the ECB has understood\u000a      and dealt with the crisis over the past three years\".\u000a    The Head of Fiscal Policies Division at the ECB writes (C9 &#8212; section5):\u000a      \"Giancarlo's work on fiscal multipliers (Economic Policy October 2012\u000a      [reference 3 &#8212; section 3]) and on the impact of fiscal shocks on the\u000a      exchange rate (such as in Review of Economic and Statistics November 2012\u000a      [reference 5 - section 3]) have been extensively used as reference in the\u000a      division when assessing the impact of fiscal policies in the short and\u000a      long-term and when elaborating scenarios.\"\u000a    Giancarlo's research on fiscal multipliers and the role of sovereign risk\u000a      has underpinned his participation in and moderation of the Voxeu Debate \"Has\u000a          austerity gone too far?

C4-section5,\u000a      June 2013, 18288 reads).\u000a    His research on monetary policy trade-offs has had substantial impact on\u000a      the recent policy debate around the OMTs (especially through various\u000a      commentaries by Paul Krugman, C5-section 5). The research has provided a\u000a      basis for a balanced discussion of possible economic and political issues\u000a      in the implementation of the OMT strategy.\u000a    In addition to the direct impact of his research on the specific\u000a      interactions between fiscal and monetary policy, the research in section 3\u000a      has also formed the core of the curriculum of central bank training. Since\u000a      2010, Corsetti has repeatedly presented his research at the Central\u000a      Bankers Programme of the Study Center in Gerzensee, Bern. The Director of\u000a      the Programme writes (C2- section5): Giancarlo's \"research results on\u000a      international monetary economics and international finance influence how\u000a      the central bank community thinks about exchange rates, monetary policy\u000a      coordination or capital flows.

His research is highly topical, focusing on the\u000a      crisis and monetary and fiscal policy in the crisis. He has simultaneously\u000a      been doing underpinning research and ensuring that research has impact on\u000a      current central bank policy.\u000a    More specifically, his research has focused on three interrelated areas.\u000a    The first aims at identifying new theoretical and empirical foundations\u000a      for the trade-offs between internal and external objectives in the conduct\u000a      of monetary policy. While these trade-offs are at the heart of traditional\u000a      models such as Mundell-Fleming, they have been recently de-emphasised by\u000a      new-Keynesian literature, with claims that optimal monetary rules are\u000a      `isomorphic' in closed and open economies, and that international policy\u000a      coordination is at best irrelevant. After showing that the objective for\u000a      policy makers includes not only output gaps and inflation, but also\u000a      exchange rate misalignment and external imbalances, his recent research\u000a      [1] explore policy trade-offs between controlling domestic inflation and\u000a      inefficient capital flows\/external borrowing associated with real\u000a      appreciation. The analysis focuses on conditions under which monetary\u000a      instruments can effectively redress external imbalances, and the scope for\u000a      integrating monetary with macro-prudential policy.\u000a    The second area of research consists of a reassessment of fiscal\u000a      multipliers under conditions of financial and fiscal stress, at both the\u000a      theoretical and empirical level. The theory (presented at the Jacques\u000a      Polak Research Conference at the IMF in November 2010), and published in\u000a      2013 by the Economic Journal [2]) pursues a generalisation of standard\u000a      monetary models to include a new channel of transmission, the \"sovereign\u000a      risk channel\". According to this channel, risk premia on government debt\u000a      increase the real cost of debt for private borrowers. Thus, when monetary\u000a      policy is at the zero lower bound, this channel undermines macroeconomic\u000a      stability. The model provides foundations for the design of fiscal\u000a      stabilisation which rest on a combination of stimulus and budget\u000a      consolidation strategies (analysed in [5]), and to a balanced assessment\u000a      of pros and cons of fiscal austerity. A multi-country generalisation for a\u000a      currency union stresses the prevention of belief- driven downturns as a\u000a      new argument in favour of coordinated, asymmetric fiscal policies\u000a      (procyclical cuts in the crisis countries offset by conventional,\u000a      anti-cyclical fiscal policy in low-risk premia countries). Applied to\u000a      countries pursuing a peg, the model corrects fallacies in the conventional\u000a      textbook wisdom, suggesting that fiscal policy is not effective under a\u000a      fixed exchange rate system.\u000a    The empirical agenda alongside this model estimates the size of\u000a      multipliers, conditional on macroeconomic and policy environments\u000a      (exchange rate regimes, financial stress) and suggests that fiscal policy\u000a      is particularly consequential at times of financial and banking crises.\u000a    In the light of the threat that sovereign risk poses to macro stability,\u000a      a third area of research consists in specifying a rigorous analysis of the\u000a      conditions under which a central bank can provide a credible monetary\u000a      backstop to government debt, that is, when can it credibly act as a lender\u000a      of last resort to the fiscal authorities. The popular view confounds the\u000a      ability of a central bank to provide a monetary backstop, with the use of\u000a      hyperinflation to debase public debt. By contrast, Corsetti shows that a\u000a      monetary backstop (a) does not rest on the threat to debase government\u000a      paper via inflation and (b) can be credible and effective even when the\u000a      size of intervention falls short of covering government financing needs in\u000a      full. This line of work [6] was originally developed joint with Luca\u000a      Dedola at the ECB as background research on the design of the Outright\u000a      Monetary Transactions launched by the ECB in 2012. It builds on the theory\u000a      of self-fulfilling sovereign default crisis undertaken in the 1980s,\u000a      especially by Calvo (1988), and integrates it with monetary theory.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18738","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"2629691","Name":"Iceland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2960313","Name":"Luxembourg"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    There are four key areas of impact in Sibert's work:\u000a    Monetary Committee Design\u000a    The primary impact of Sibert's research is to change the way that policy\u000a      makers and the public think about monetary policy committees. She has\u000a      communicated her work to central bankers through invited presentations and\u000a      contributions to central bank publications. Her work on monetary policy to\u000a      EU policy makers is disseminated through briefing papers and briefings to\u000a      the European Parliament and by taking part in a commissioned collaborative\u000a      effort that produced a major study.\u000a    This study concludes that to be more effective and predictable the\u000a      European Central Bank (ECB) should make a clear move towards more\u000a      transparency. The current final target (a low growth rate of the\u000a      Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices) should be accompanied by a review of\u000a      non-consumption goods and asset prices. The ECB should adopt a symmetrical\u000a      target to avoid an inflationary drift; and more detailed projections, as\u000a      well as the public release of the model used to calculate them, should be\u000a      adopted to communicate the ECB's expected inflationary bias, and thus the\u000a      expected path of interest rates in the medium term.

When Goldman\u000a      Sachs published a report criticising the ECB, her research was prominently\u000a      cited (5.5). ECB Executive Board Member Yves Mersch (then the\u000a      Governor of the Central Bank of Luxembourg) demanded that she retract her\u000a      remarks on ECB accountability (5.6) and the Deputy Governor of the\u000a      Central Bank of Turkey publicly objected to her commentary on the Turkish\u000a      monetary policy committee (5.7). In a lecture, the deputy governor\u000a      of the Central Bank of Norway discussed the size of the Norwegian monetary\u000a      policy committee in light of her research and in private correspondence he\u000a      said that he frequently referred to theory of the optimal size of monetary\u000a      committees (5.1).\u000a    In Iceland, following the collapse of the banking system, Sibert's\u000a      research on the design of monetary policy committees had a direct impact\u000a      on policy. Sibert was appointed to the newly-formed Icelandic five-member\u000a      monetary policy committee in 2008 (5.2). The committee was the\u000a      result of legislation that redesigned the monetary policy framework after\u000a      the collapse. The new legislation gave responsibility about the\u000a      formulation of many of the details of the committee's decision-making\u000a      process to the members of the new committee. Sibert's research was\u000a      significant in their formulation of the committee's conventions.\u000a    Gender Composition\u000a    Sibert's writing on the gender composition of committees that make\u000a      financial decisions has fuelled the European Parliament's opposition to an\u000a      all-male Executive Board. It has been discussed in blogs and the popular\u000a      press. It is cited in a European Assembly of the Council of Europe report\u000a      on women in the financial crisis (5.8).\u000a    Sibert was interviewed on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour on 20th September\u000a      2012 (5.9). The interviewer discusses with Sibert the reason for\u000a      the lack of credible female candidates for the role of Governor at the\u000a      Bank of England and explores why banking may be such a male dominated\u000a      culture. Sibert is also able to contribute ideas about how a more diverse\u000a      gender balance in banking may have impacted the financial crises.\u000a    Impact on public discourse and the media\u000a    Sibert communicates her work to other policy makers and to the public\u000a      through newspaper articles, occasional television and newspaper interviews\u000a      and papers on the vox.eu website, a policy portal set up by the Centre for\u000a      Economic Policy Research. This shows in excess of 332,000 views as of\u000a      October 2013, for Sibert's contributions. (5.10)\u000a    Writing on the web site of the Breugel think-tank (www.breugel.org)\u000a      on 31st August 2012, about effective banking supervision under European\u000a      Commission proposals for a supervisory board, Guntram Wolff observes that\u000a      Sibert, having studied the effects of committee size on performance, has\u000a      concluded that a committee of five or fewer is ideal. He continues: \"Sibert's\u000a        research on the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) argued that the\u000a        detection of systemic risk requires a certain diversity of the skills of\u000a        Committee members, notwithstanding the small committee size. She\u000a        concluded that the set-up of the ESRB, consisting mostly of national\u000a        central bank representatives, is not conducive to effective systemic\u000a        risk assessment.\"\u000a    European Parliament member Sylvie Goulard listed her as a possible\u000a      candidate for the Executive Board, as did a prominent German newspaper:\u000a      http:\/\/sylvie-goulard.eu\/bce\/ECB-potential%20female-candidates.pdf\u000a      .\u000a    http:\/\/www.faz.net\/aktuell\/wirtschaft\/menschen-wirtschaft\/besetzung-des-ezb-direktoriums-vier-frauen-fuer-die-ezb-11941105.html.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research published between 2003 and 2010 on central bank design has\u000a      established Sibert as an internationally-recognised authority whose ideas\u000a      have changed the way that policy makers, academics and the public think\u000a      about monetary policy committees and have influenced efforts to increase\u000a      the accountability of these committees and the call to increase female\u000a      participation, particularly at the Bank of England and the European\u000a      Central Bank.

Sibert (2003) is an\u000a      early theoretical attempt to ask how and why this might matter (3.4).\u000a      Rational expectations and nominal wage contracting lead benevolent central\u000a      bankers to inflate too much in an attempt to cause unexpected inflation\u000a      that will lead to higher output. However, if the public knows that the\u000a      policy maker is benevolent then the inflation is expected and there is no\u000a      attendant output gain. Sibert considers a scenario where central bankers\u000a      are either benevolent or are inflation hawks. A policy maker's type is his\u000a      private information and can only be signalled by his behaviour. Monetary\u000a      policy is made by a committee where members serve overlapping terms.\u000a      Sibert considers how features of the economic environment, customs and\u000a      institutional rules that govern the way that the committee members\u000a      interact, and influence the ease with which their actions can be observed,\u000a      affect incentives to build a reputation, and hence expected inflation and\u000a      social welfare.\u000a    Mihov and Sibert (2006) (3.2) considers the problem of designing a\u000a      central bank that is credible in that it will deliver low inflation while\u000a      retaining the flexibility to respond to shocks. There have been proposals\u000a      to make central bankers' salaries depend on how well they meet an\u000a      inflation target and proposals to appoint only inflation hawks. The United\u000a      Kingdom has dealt with the problem by allowing the government to override\u000a      its independent monetary policy committee in extreme circumstances. Mihov\u000a      and Sibert demonstrate that a committee of the type considered in Sibert\u000a      (2003) produces a better outcome than a zero-inflation rule or a single\u000a      benevolent policy maker and requires no government monitoring or\u000a      intervention.\u000a    Since 2003 there has been a small, but growing, economics literature on\u000a      monetary policy making by groups, but it approaches the issue within the\u000a      confines of academic economics. Sibert (2006) (3.1) broadens the\u000a      focus of this research on the intended audience. Drawing from work in\u000a      other social sciences she considers the optimal size of a monetary policy\u000a      committee and whether monetary policy making by committee is more extreme\u000a      than monetary policy by individuals and the features of committees that\u000a      influence the answer to this question. Sibert (2010) (3.5)\u000a      considers how the gender composition of committees that make financial\u000a      decisions affects their outcomes.\u000a    Central banks differ greatly in their approach to transparency and\u000a      accountability. The Bank of England's monetary policy committee, for\u000a      example, publishes both minutes and its members' votes; the ECB, on the\u000a      other hand, is notoriously opaque, providing little information about its\u000a      decision making process. The academic literature has provided some support\u000a      for the ECB's approach. Papers by Cukierman and Meltzer (\"A Theory of\u000a      Ambiguity, Credibility and Inflation under Discretion and Asymmetric\u000a      Information,\" Econometrica, 54, 1986, pp. 1099-1128) and Faust and\u000a      Svensson (\"Transparency and Credibility: Monetary Policy with Unobservable\u000a      Goals,\" International Economic Review Vol. 42, 2002, pp. 369-397)\u000a      found that central bank transparency can be harmful. Sibert (2009) used a\u000a      model similar to Cukierman and Meltzer and Faust and Svensson to\u000a      demonstrate that increased central bank transparency must always be\u000a      beneficial (3.3).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18761","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2542007","Name":"Morocco"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Geman has served as a scientific advisor to major banks, energy and\u000d\u000a      mining companies and\u000d\u000a      commodity trading houses.

As a result of the\u000d\u000a        importance of her\u000d\u000a        scientific contributions, and their recognition by practitioners, Geman\u000d\u000a        joined the Board of the\u000d\u000a        UBS-Bloomberg Commodity Index as the only academic member in 2008 (5.3).\u000d\u000a        She remains in\u000d\u000a        this position and by occupying this role she is able to make a direct\u000d\u000a        input into the construction\u000d\u000a        of the index. The rebalancing of the composition of the index in terms\u000d\u000a        of the commodity prices\u000d\u000a        makes use of her results on the shape of the forward curve, since the\u000d\u000a        rolling futures position\u000d\u000a        has a key impact on the performance of the index.

Since 2010, Geman has been a Scientific Advisor to\u000d\u000a        the European\u000d\u000a        Commission, and she has defined early indicators of price and volatility\u000d\u000a        spikes. The usual\u000d\u000a        explanation given for these spikes in volatility is the somewhat\u000d\u000a        populist one that it is due to\u000d\u000a        speculation in futures contracts. However, Geman has demonstrated,\u000d\u000a        through a series of\u000d\u000a        empirical examples, that scarcity of the physical commodity is the key\u000d\u000a        factor driving the spikes.\u000d\u000a        She has shown that useful indicators need to use data that reveal\u000d\u000a        scarcity and can measure it\u000d\u000a        continuously. She has shown that data on inventories is crucial for this\u000d\u000a        (3.3, 3.5, 5.5, 5.6).\u000d\u000a        These results are used in the European Commission's indicators.\u000d\u000a      In a world of food scarcity, limited arable land and soil erosion,\u000d\u000a        fertilizers represent a crucial\u000d\u000a        asset class.

In reference (3.1) (which was circulated as\u000d\u000a        a working paper in 2011),\u000d\u000a        she explains, first why fertilizers can represent a desirable investment\u000d\u000a        for financial institutions\u000d\u000a        and crucial working capital for the industry; second how the use of\u000d\u000a        phosphate derivatives, such\u000d\u000a        as forward contracts and swaps, can be integrated with the `old'\u000d\u000a        activity of the physical export\u000d\u000a        of phosphate rock, allowing the company itself, as opposed to the banks\u000d\u000a        who advise it, to\u000d\u000a        optimize its revenues over a larger feasible set, by combining physical\u000d\u000a        and financial trading in a\u000d\u000a        consistent manner.

However, an entity\u000d\u000a      labelled as `commercial'\u000d\u000a      may also engage in speculative activities which should not generate the\u000d\u000a      same tax shield.

This formula has been\u000d\u000a      incorporated into the software of\u000d\u000a      all banks for decades. Its ease of use allows ordinary corporations to\u000d\u000a      benefit from it in their daily\u000d\u000a      hedging activities. But the heat equation cannot be used to determine\u000d\u000a      prices of complex options\u000d\u000a      that are widespread in commodities markets. In the case of Asian options\u000d\u000a      on the average value of\u000d\u000a      the underlying asset, which appeared in 1990, and which are crucially\u000d\u000a      useful in the world of\u000d\u000a      currencies and commodities, an equation analogous to Black-Scholes can be\u000d\u000a      derived but its\u000d\u000a      solution is far from obvious.

Moreover, crude oil\u000d\u000a      and commodity indexes in general are defined as averages, to reflect the\u000d\u000a      time to delivery and\u000d\u000a      avoid price manipulation within a single day. So called plain-vanilla\u000d\u000a      options are essentially non-existent.\u000d\u000a      Geman shows that by using exact formulas for the price, only the\u000d\u000a      volatility parameter\u000d\u000a      needs to be estimated (3.4).This leads, in turn, to exact formulas\u000d\u000a      for the Greeks (viz., &#945;, 03b2, and the\u000d\u000a      other parameters that are used in the Black-Scholes and other formulae for\u000d\u000a      pricing options) and\u000d\u000a      allows traders to price and hedge in a consistent manner, which is crucial\u000d\u000a      (3.2).\u000d\u000a    In (3.4) Geman and Roncoroni show that electricity spot prices\u000d\u000a      display not only mean reversion, in\u000d\u000a      common with other commodities, but also spikes. They introduce a class of\u000d\u000a      discontinuous\u000d\u000a      processes exhibiting a \"jump-reversion\" component to properly\u000d\u000a      represent these movements. Their\u000d\u000a      model captures both the trajectorial and the statistical properties of\u000d\u000a      electricity pool prices.\u000d\u000a    In (3.3) Geman and Ohana show that, when one explores the\u000d\u000a      relationship between inventory and\u000d\u000a      price volatility, the slope of the forward curve of oil and natural gas\u000d\u000a      prices can be used as a proxy\u000d\u000a      for inventory. They find that there is a globally significant negative\u000d\u000a      correlation between price\u000d\u000a      volatility and inventory for crude oil, which prevails only during those\u000d\u000a      periods of scarcity when the\u000d\u000a      inventory is below the historical average and increases importantly during\u000d\u000a      the winter periods for\u000d\u000a      natural gas. Their results are illustrated by the analysis of a 15\u000d\u000a      year-database of US oil and natural\u000d\u000a      gas prices and inventory.\u000d\u000a    Geman and Eleuterio show in (3.1) that investing in\u000d\u000a      fertilizer-mining companies is a valid strategy,\u000d\u000a      from the perspective of both market returns and hedging. The shares of an\u000d\u000a      exhaustive sample of\u000d\u000a      listed fertilizer producing companies between January 2004 and December\u000d\u000a      2012 generated good\u000d\u000a      returns over the whole period and extremely high ones between January 2004\u000d\u000a      and December\u000d\u000a      2007. In addition, these returns are much more sensitive to major\u000d\u000a      agricultural indexes than to the\u000d\u000a      World Bank Fertilizer Index, underpinning the hedging argument.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18929","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"1643084","Name":"Indonesia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"1733045","Name":"Malaysia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The long-run small macro modelling approach developed by Garratt and\u000a      co-workers has been\u000a      adopted by a number of central banks and government authorities around the\u000a      world, including the\u000a      European Central Bank, and the central banks of Switzerland, Norway, New\u000a      Zealand, Indonesia\u000a      and Malaysia.

Over the course of\u000a      2009 and 2010, Garratt\u000a      and his co-authors visited central banks (de Nederlandsche Bank, the Bank\u000a      of England, the\u000a      European Central Bank, Norges Bank and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand)\u000a      and Eurostat to\u000a      disseminate their findings.

The Bank\u000a      of England's Inflation Report,\u000a      May 2013, pages 46-47, gives an account of this.

Partner organizations, who have\u000a      committed modest funding\u000a      for the first year, include the Norges Bank, Bank of England and the\u000a      European Central Bank.\u000a      Partner investigators are researchers, including senior and junior\u000a      academic econometricians,\u000a      applied statisticians and practitioners. The major aim of this network is\u000a      to provide a forum for\u000a      exchanging ideas for operationalizing methodologies and to stimulate and\u000a      coordinate research into\u000a      new methods for probabilistic forecasting, forecast evaluation and\u000a      communication.

The first\u000a      meeting of this network was held on 17th January 2013 at\u000a      Birkbeck. The topic was `Now-casting in\u000a        Central Banks' and it was attended by and had presentations from the\u000a      Norges Bank, Sveriges\u000a      Riksbank, Central Bank of Ireland, Bank of England, European Central Bank\u000a      and the Central\u000a      Banks of Austria and Spain (5.2, 5.9).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Garratt's research on methods for quantifying the uncertainty surrounding\u000a      macroeconomic\u000a      forecasts, uncertainty which arises from not knowing the true model of the\u000a      economy and from\u000a      having to use inaccurate data, has been applied by Central Banks and\u000a      national statistical agencies\u000a      in their forecasting exercises and their analysis of policy interventions.\u000a      Notably, Norges Bank (the\u000a      central bank of Norway) has developed a system called the System for\u000a      Averaging Models, which\u000a      they use when they make macroeconomic forecasts and when they predict the\u000a      effects of possible\u000a      monetary policy actions, which incorporates Garratt's results.\u000a    Garratt's research provides new methods to allow for uncertainty about\u000a      the 'true' model by using\u000a      combinations of different possible models, when making forecasts.

In this work a pragmatic\u000a      implementation of Bayesian\u000a      Model Averaging was adopted to allow for model uncertainties. Amongst the\u000a      many possible\u000a      macroeconomic events of interest, they considered the probability of a\u000a      recession and of inflation\u000a      falling in the range 1.5%-3.5%, the target range considered at the time by\u000a      the Monetary Policy\u000a      Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England.\u000a    Following his initial work on model forecast uncertainty, Garratt's\u000a      subsequent research then\u000a      analysed the inaccuracy of initial measurements of important UK macro\u000a      variables such as output\u000a      growth, inflation, retail sales, unemployment, and its effects on the\u000a      degree of uncertainty\u000a      surrounding `now-casts' of the current state, and forecasts of the future\u000a      state, of the economy (3.2).\u000a      Knowing the size and direction of any bias, and the timing of any change\u000a      in bias, forecasters can\u000a      incorporate this information into their forecasts and therefore reduce or\u000a      at least have a greater\u000a      understanding of the uncertainty surrounding them. The results of this\u000a      research show that first\u000a      measurements, and indeed subsequent measurements, should be treated with\u000a      caution. People\u000a      expect data to be revised, but the research shows that the biases change\u000a      over time and the\u000a      revised data does not always change smoothly and monotonically towards its\u000a      final `true' value. The\u000a      patterns of the revision process that Garratt's research documents enable\u000a      an assessment of the\u000a      usefulness of various releases of data. For example, there are large\u000a      biases in the national\u000a      accounts data but very little in money supply numbers. These results argue\u000a      for greater resources\u000a      to be put into data collection. Reference (3.4) expands on\u000a      Garratt's contribution to the Pickford\u000a      report on ONS preparation of national income statistics.\u000a    Garratt's research then develops and applies methods of model combination\u000a      which show how to\u000a      quantify uncertainty using density forecasts, robust to a constantly\u000a      changing macroeconomic\u000a      environment (3.4) This extends previous work which has focused on\u000a      point forecasts. The expert\u000a      combination method that Garratt develops assumes that each \"expert\" uses a\u000a      distinct model to\u000a      produce a density forecast which is then aggregated by a \"decision maker\".\u000a      Since models differ in\u000a      their sensitivity to structural instabilities, he shows that the\u000a      aggregated density is robust to\u000a      structural breaks.\u000a    Garratt shows that his procedures provide a useful means of computing\u000a      density forecasts for a\u000a      range of economic and financial variables, including GDP, the output gap\u000a      (the difference between\u000a      actual and potential output) and inflation. These forecasts, in general,\u000a      are robust to individual\u000a      model (expert) misspecification. In other words, his results indicate that\u000a      combining density\u000a      forecasts delivers gains, and mitigates the dangers of using mis-specified\u000a      individual models. He\u000a      shows that the combination approach can be used to improve the forecasts\u000a      from policymaking\u000a      (Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium) models, which, despite their\u000a      competitive point-forecast\u000a      performance, can fail density-forecast evaluation-tests, unless combined.\u000a      He shows that it is\u000a      important to evaluate probabilistic forecasts using economic as well as\u000a      statistical loss functions.\u000a      The uncertainty associated with the output gap, a concept commonly\u000a      discussed by policymakers,\u000a      can be quantified and is extremely wide (3.4, 3.5). It is imprudent\u000a      to present, as is common, only a\u000a      central estimate of the output gap, since the density (the distribution of\u000a      forecast errors around it) is\u000a      often complex. Probabilistic estimates should be presented instead.\u000a    The broad context of Garratt's research, and motivation for it, is that\u000a      macroeconomic forecasts are\u000a      imperfect. If a forecaster provides information about inflation next\u000a      month, it contains considerable\u000a      inaccuracy. The inaccuracy stems (in part) from imprecise real-time\u000a      measurements, latent\u000a      variables, model uncertainty, parameter uncertainty, and the inherently\u000a      unpredictable nature of the\u000a      macro-economy. Since forecasting is a key input into the work of\u000a      statistical agencies, finance\u000a      departments and independent fiscal watchdogs, it is important to\u000a      understand more about the\u000a      sources of uncertainty. Nevertheless, most policymaking institutions and\u000a      statistical agencies\u000a      provide little information on the imprecision of their forecasts. Further,\u000a      the probabilities of\u000a      outcomes which are economically substantive, although not the most likely,\u000a      receive little attention.\u000a      Put differently, conventional macroeconomic forecasting neglects the\u000a      assessment of risk, and the\u000a      probability of extreme events.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18938","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1819730","Name":"Hong Kong"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    1.

In this capacity, he was a contributing author\u000a      to the European Commission's\u000a      2010 White Paper on \"Quantifying Antitrust Damages\". This paper\u000a      provides pragmatic, non-binding\u000a      assistance in the difficult task of quantifying damages in antitrust\u000a      cases, both for the benefit of\u000a      national courts and the parties of antitrust damages litigation. This\u000a      White Paper is aimed at\u000a      assisting the European Commission in developing guidance in this respect.\u000a    4. Economics Reference Groups, Co-operation and Competition Panel,\u000a        Monitor and NHS\u000a        (since October 2009)\u000a    In the UK, the NHS Act (2006) opened up healthcare to market forces,\u000a      introducing choice and\u000a      competition. Patients' geographic and quality preferences are important\u000a      determinants of choice\u000a      outcomes, and Beckert's work (3.6) examines both. Beckert was\u000a      appointed a member of the\u000a      Economics Reference Group of the Co-operation and Competition Panel (now\u000a      Directorate), an\u000a      advisory panel to the Department of Health and Monitor (5.2). Its\u000a      remit is to protect and promote\u000a      the interests of people who use health care services by promoting\u000a      provision of health care services\u000a      in the UK which is economic, efficient and effective, and maintains or\u000a      improves the quality of the\u000a      services. Beckert's (2011) paper on hospital choice, co-authored with the\u000a      director of economic\u000a      analysis of the Panel, which was first published as a Co-operation and\u000a      Competition Panel working\u000a      paper, is now published in a distinguished academic journal and widely\u000a      referenced by academic\u000a      and health economics and policy experts; it directly reflects on the\u000a      methodology the Panel uses in\u000a      order to assess demand-side aspects of hospital mergers in England. This\u000a      work has been\u000a      recognized through Beckert's honorary appointment to the Steering Group on\u000a      Competition in\u000a      Healthcare Markets of the Nuffield Trust (5.1) a charity and think\u000a      tank whose aim is to produce\u000a      independent analysis and debate of UK healthcare policy. The empirical\u000a      approach to simulate the\u000a      effect of mergers between hospitals laid out in that paper is currently\u000a      being used by the\u000a      Competition Commission in the competitive assessment of a merger between\u000a      two large foundation\u000a      trusts in England.

Such goods and\u000a      services are typically\u000a      differentiated, reflecting taste heterogeneity in consumer demand. The\u000a      degree to which choice is\u000a      exercised is determined by the ability and the willingness of consumers to\u000a      switch between\u000a      suppliers and product varieties. This is ultimately an empirical matter\u000a      which can be analysed within\u000a      the framework of micro-econometric demand analysis.\u000a    Modern demand analysis acknowledges preference heterogeneity as an\u000a      important demand\u000a      feature. It is critical to our understanding of differentiated product\u000a      industries that are ubiquitous in\u000a      the fabric of today's market economies. It has been incorporated in the\u000a      micro-econometric analysis\u000a      of discrete choice situations since the pioneering work of McFadden (1974)\u000a      who was awarded the\u000a      Nobel Prize in Economics (2000); Daniel McFadden (UC Berkeley) is a\u000a      co-author of Beckert and\u000a      his former PhD supervisor.\u000a    (b) Discrete choice analysis\u000a    In discrete choice contexts, decision makers select out of a menu of\u000a      distinct, unranked choice\u000a      alternatives. But not until an early econometric exploration of\u000a      discrete-continuous choices in Dubin\u000a      and McFadden (1984) and a more comprehensive and prominently disseminated\u000a      analysis in\u000a      Beckert (2005) (3.5) has preference heterogeneity been properly\u000a      modelled in empirically more\u000a      prevalent continuous choice situations. In continuous choice contexts,\u000a      decision makers select the\u000a      amount to consume of an economic good or service. Further theoretical\u000a      econometric work by\u000a      Beckert (2007) (3.4) and Beckert and Blundell (2008) (3.3)\u000a      published and cited in top international\u000a      academic journals, laid the groundwork for identification of structural\u000a      preference heterogeneity from\u000a      estimation of reduced form demand systems in the continuous choice\u000a      context. This work has\u000a      proven to be essential for the further development of the econometric\u000a      analysis of continuous\u000a      choices; Matzkin (2007) and Blundell, Kristensen and Matzkin (2011).\u000a    (c) Antitrust Market Analysis\u000a    Differentiated products are central to many antitrust investigations of\u000a      mergers and markets.\u000a      Depending on the stage of the supply chain at which the respective\u000a      investigation focuses, it is\u000a      concerned with either consumer demand or business-to-business\u000a      transactions. The analyses\u000a      thereby have to confront the respective idiosyncrasies of the demand\u000a      situation, and Beckert's\u000a      research has contributed to the econometric modelling of both. In consumer\u000a      level demand analysis\u000a      using micro level data, product attributes can typically be treated as\u000a      exogenously determined, and\u000a      demand heterogeneity arises from unobserved features of consumer\u000a      preferences. In business-to-business\u000a      transaction data analysis, parties to a contract typically bargain over\u000a      contract details,\u000a      contracts are often bespoke, attributes are negotiated over, and\u000a      heterogeneity arises from\u000a      unobserved outside options of the bargaining parties.\u000a    The analysis of consumer demand for differentiated products is critical\u000a      to assess the degree of\u000a      competition between merging or incumbent firms. Product differentiation\u000a      can thereby extend along\u000a      various product attributes. Early empirical and econometric modelling work\u000a      by Beckert (2005)\u000a      examines consumer demand responses to different qualities of service in\u000a      Internet access. It\u000a      provides estimates of consumers' propensities to switch between different\u000a      qualities of service when\u000a      prices are nonlinear and service valuation and performance are ex ante\u000a      uncertain. These features\u000a      of product differentiation are intrinsic to many consumer choice\u000a      situations, in particular in the\u000a      context of network industries. Subsequent work by Beckert (2010) (3.1)\u000a      and Beckert and\u000a      Mazzarotto (2010) (3.2) focuses on locally differentiated consumer\u000a      retail markets.\u000a    (d) Healthcare\u000a    Geographic and quality aspects of choice are at the heart of more recent\u000a      empirical work by\u000a      Beckert, Christensen and Collyer (2011) (3.6) on hospital choice\u000a      and competition for NHS funded\u000a      acute services in England. The efficient and cost effective provision of\u000a      healthcare has received\u000a      attention by academics and policy makers, in the UK since the introduction\u000a      of hospital choice and\u000a      competition through the National Health Service Act (2006).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"20314","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aResearch conducted by Professor Anton Muscatelli and others has directly shaped a key piece\u000d\u000aof UK legislation (and from 2015 will influence the way in which Scotland's budget is financed)\u000d\u000aand resulted in the largest transfer of financial powers from Westminster since the creation of the\u000d\u000aUK.\u000d\u000aFinancial accountability under devolution\u000d\u000aThe 1997 devolution arrangements allowed the Scottish parliament very limited accountability for\u000d\u000athe fiscal resources which it spends.

Some of\u000d\u000athe problems with the 1997 devolution settlement included a lack of financial accountability and the\u000d\u000aneed to address the imbalance in the Scottish Parliament's spending and revenue raising\u000d\u000aresponsibilities. It was important that future legislation addressed how to balance the need for\u000d\u000agreater accountability with the need to maintain equity in access to public services across the UK\u000d\u000aand potential issues of tax competition, as well as issues such as the need to borrow at the\u000d\u000adevolved country level. The studies undertaken at the University of Glasgow ranged from\u000d\u000aexamining the way different fiscal arrangements varied across the Organisation for Economic\u000d\u000aCooperation &amp; Development in Europe (OECD) and the lessons which could be drawn for\u000d\u000amodifying the UK devolution settlement of 1997 (particularly Scotland's fiscal arrangements) to\u000d\u000acreate more accountability [i-iii], to empirical studies which looked at the way different jurisdictions\u000d\u000ainteracted in their fiscal stance over time [iv-vi].\u000d\u000aIn 2001, the paper by Muscatelli [iii] emphasised the need for Scotland to move beyond the current\u000d\u000asystem of block grant funding through the Barnett formula, as it did not provide accountability and\u000d\u000aresponsibility for raising its own taxes to finance public spending. The paper identified income\u000d\u000ataxes as the most promising for devolution given the issues around tax competition, such as the\u000d\u000aproblems of different jurisdictions setting corporation and VAT\/sales taxes\/duties in such a way\u000d\u000awhich distorts consumer behaviour and leads to transfer pricing. It also identified the administrative\u000d\u000aproblems in devolving other taxes such as those on oil and gas given decommissioning\u000d\u000aallowances, on tax thresholds and bands given the simplicity of the UK PAYE system, and on VAT\u000d\u000agiven EU regulations. The papers written in 2002 [i] and 2003 [ii] by Muscatelli with Graeme Roy\u000d\u000a(then University of Glasgow PhD student, now an economist within Scottish Government) and Julia\u000d\u000aDarby (University of Glasgow [1995-2003 Senior Lecturer, Economics], now at the University of\u000d\u000aStrathclyde), took this further by providing evidence on how centralised taxation in the UK was\u000d\u000aproviding very little accountability to devolved administrations, compared to other OECD\u000d\u000aeconomies. These themes of financial accountability, tax competition in areas such as corporation\u000d\u000atax and VAT were at the heart of the subsequent work of the expert group. The main conclusions\u000d\u000ain the papers [i-iii] were all echoed in the conclusions of the Commission on Scottish Devolution,\u000d\u000aboth in the additional taxation powers granted within the Scotland Act (2012), and the decision not\u000d\u000ato devolve corporation tax and other taxes which would generate excessive tax competition within\u000d\u000athe UK.\u000d\u000aResearch papers [iv-vi] provided additional input to the devolution power changes recommended\u000d\u000aby the Calman Commission and set out in the Scotland Act (2012). These papers stress the\u000d\u000aimportance of the macroeconomic linkages when significant expenditure, taxation and borrowing\u000d\u000apowers are devolved to sub-national level, and provide an understanding of the way in which\u000d\u000adevolved governments act to offset or complement national fiscal policies. These also lie behind\u000d\u000asome of the key recommendations of the Commission and included in the Scotland Act (2012),\u000d\u000alimiting the level of fiscal autonomy and borrowing devolved to Scotland.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"21198","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Influencing UK Fiscal Policy\u000d\u000a      Amid the ongoing financial crisis in 2008, the Conservative Party\u000d\u000a      announced its plan for `economic recovery and long-term prosperity' in its\u000d\u000a      policy paper Reconstruction: Plan for a strong economy, launched\u000d\u000a      at the annual party conference on 28 September 2008.\u000d\u000a    The proposal put forward by Professors Leith, Kirsanova and Wren-Lewis &#8212;\u000d\u000a      for a fiscal monitoring commission for the UK &#8212; was cited by the\u000d\u000a      Conservative Party in this 2008 policy paper.

DSGE models have\u000d\u000a      grown in importance at many of the world's central banks as tools to\u000d\u000a      inform economic outlooks and formulate policy strategies.\u000d\u000a    A benchmark result in the literature is that it is optimal for a\u000d\u000a      benevolent policy-maker to allow the level of government debt to fluctuate\u000d\u000a      permanently in response to shocks; essentially, based on tax smoothing\u000d\u000a      arguments, the short-run costs of unwinding the fiscal repercussions of a\u000d\u000a      shock are balanced by the discounted value of the long-term benefits of\u000d\u000a      doing so. In other words, following the recent financial crisis\u000d\u000a      policy-makers should act to stop government debt levels continually\u000d\u000a      rising, but should not seek to return government debt to the levels\u000d\u000a      enjoyed before the crisis. Of course, in actuality, policy-makers may not\u000d\u000a      choose to act in the same manner as the benchmark result assumes. The\u000d\u000a      research outlined here explored the implications of introducing extensions\u000d\u000a      to the benchmark results to reflect the diverse options and behaviours\u000d\u000a      adopted by policy-makers who are often also subject to competing party\u000d\u000a      political pressures.\u000d\u000a    Moreover, Professor Leith and his co-authors sought to draw out the\u000d\u000a      policy implications of this work. Previously, by analogy with the rules\u000d\u000a      versus discretion debate in monetary policy, it was often assumed that\u000d\u000a      adopting policy rules provides a feasible means of tying the hands of\u000d\u000a      policy-makers in order to reduce policy mistakes, increase transparency\u000d\u000a      and limit political influence on policy. Accordingly, policy-makers in the\u000d\u000a      UK adopted the Golden Rule for fiscal policy whereby the government's\u000d\u000a      budget (excluding public sector investment) should be balanced over the\u000d\u000a      economic cycle, while in Europe the Stability and Growth Pact was designed\u000d\u000a      to do something similar within the Eurozone. However, an analysis of\u000d\u000a      optimal fiscal policy reveals that while such rules may overcome some\u000d\u000a      problems, unlike monetary policy rules, they fall significantly short of\u000d\u000a      mimicking fully optimal policy and have often been dropped by\u000d\u000a      policy-makers as soon as difficulties emerge.\u000d\u000a    Accordingly, in their paper `Optimal Debt Policy, and an Institutional\u000d\u000a      Proposal to help in its Implementation' published in European Economy\u000d\u000a      in 2007, Leith, Kirsanova, and Wren-Lewis proposed the creation of a\u000d\u000a      fiscal council in the UK which would closely monitor the fiscal activities\u000d\u000a      of the government so as to prevent unsustainable policies being followed,\u000d\u000a      while at the same time allowing a flexible response to shocks in the\u000d\u000a      short-run. The importance of achieving both flexibility and credibility in\u000d\u000a      fiscal policy in this way was further highlighted by the ongoing sovereign\u000d\u000a      debt crisis and recession in the Eurozone.\u000d\u000a    Leith's and his colleagues' research demonstrated that there are\u000d\u000a      substantial economic benefits from the creation of such a body in that it\u000d\u000a      would support the credibility of fiscal policy, in a manner which previous\u000d\u000a      fiscal rules failed to do, without compromising the government's ability\u000d\u000a      to deal with economic shocks.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21200","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"289688","Name":"Qatar"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Training the World's Economic Policy-Makers at IMF InstituteM\u000d\u000a    On the basis of his body of work on the area of Exchange Rate Regimes,\u000d\u000a      MacDonald was invited to prepare and deliver an Economics of Exchange\u000d\u000a      Rates Course as part of the IMF Institute's Capacity Development internal\u000d\u000a      training programme over the period 2005-2010.\u000d\u000a    The IMF Institute for Capacity Development was established in 1964 to\u000d\u000a      provide training in economic management to officials of the IMF's member\u000d\u000a      countries. The internal programme provides training over a wide range of\u000d\u000a      topics relevant to IMF economists. The objective of the programme is to\u000d\u000a      ensure that Fund economists at all levels stay at the forefront of the\u000d\u000a      profession and remain current on the major issues of the day. By drawing\u000d\u000a      on his research expertise to design this training at the IMF Institute,\u000d\u000a      MacDonald contributed to these capacity development objectives on an\u000d\u000a      ongoing basis.\u000d\u000a    MacDonald designed and oversaw the five-day training course on Economics\u000d\u000a      of Exchange Rates, delivered on five separate occasions to approximately\u000d\u000a      250 mid- to senior-level officials involved in work on monetary and\u000d\u000a      exchange rate policy. The participants were both Washington-based and also\u000d\u000a      drawn from IMF member country central banks. MacDonald delivered the\u000d\u000a      training course in the Institute's training centre in Washington DC. The\u000d\u000a      course was based on MacDonald's research, which he developed in the 2007\u000d\u000a      edition of his book Exchange Rate Economics: Theories and Evidence;\u000d\u000a      this publication acted as the core course text in 2007, 2008, 2009, and\u000d\u000a      2010 [1].\u000d\u000a    The success of the training provided by MacDonald is evidenced by the\u000d\u000a      fact that he was invited to return to provide the training on five\u000d\u000a      successive occasions whilst at the University of Glasgow. Course feedback\u000d\u000a      demonstrates how useful the attending delegates thought the training would\u000d\u000a      be for their working practices in Central Banks and Government departments\u000d\u000a      in different countries throughout the world. MacDonald's course regularly\u000d\u000a      scored between 4 and 5 out of 5 in evaluations by course participants [2].\u000d\u000a    MacDonald's research-driven teaching and training has therefore extended\u000d\u000a      well beyond the University of Glasgow to international economists and\u000d\u000a      policy makers.\u000d\u000a    Role of Monetary Advisor with IMF\u000d\u000a    MacDonald regularly engaged with the IMF throughout the course of his\u000d\u000a      academic scholarship and career; he was appointed to the role of Monetary\u000d\u000a      Advisor by the IMF in 2010 and sent on a mission to the Central Bank of\u000d\u000a      Costa Rica that same year.\u000d\u000a    During his one-week mission to the central bank in San Jose, MacDonald's\u000d\u000a      main role was to advise the central bank on the various methods it was\u000d\u000a      using to calculate its equilibrium exchange rate. Over the course of the\u000d\u000a      trip MacDonald was provided with a range of information on the monetary\u000d\u000a      and exchange rate regimes in existence in Costa Rica and the methods used\u000d\u000a      to calculate a range of different measures of the equilibrium exchange\u000d\u000a      rate. On his return to the UK, MacDonald wrote a 30-page report\u000d\u000a      documenting his recommendations for improving the Costa Rican methods of\u000d\u000a      exchange rate assessment. MacDonald's report drew from his research-driven\u000d\u000a      expertise on exchange rate regimes and similar work he had undertaken for\u000d\u000a      other central banks. Key recommendations of the report relating to\u000d\u000a      equilibrium exchange rate issues were finalised and accepted by the\u000d\u000a      Central Bank in Costa Rica [3].\u000d\u000a    As well as underpinning his advice and recommendations to the IMF,\u000d\u000a      MacDonald's research has regularly been cited in IMF Working Papers by\u000d\u000a      both the Research Department and the Policy Review and Development\u000d\u000a      Department. IMF Working Papers are designed to stimulate practitioner\u000d\u000a      debate and discussion of key areas of research within the IMF [4; 5].\u000d\u000a    Advice to Foreign Government Agencies on Exchange Rate Regimes\u000d\u000a    MacDonald has successfully engaged policy-makers with his research\u000d\u000a      through a series of presentations at central banks and foreign governments\u000d\u000a      around the world [6]. The BEER model - which MacDonald established and has\u000d\u000a      continuously developed &#8212; has been consistently used by economic\u000d\u000a      institutions such as the European Central Bank (ECB). MacDonald's research\u000d\u000a      has also been widely cited by central bankers within the ECB who work on\u000d\u000a      equilibrium exchange rate modelling. For that purpose, the Principal\u000d\u000a      Economist at the European Central Bank explains that, `BEER models\u000d\u000a        have been implemented to assess the misalignment of the euro against the\u000d\u000a        US dollar, the Japanese yen, the pound sterling and in effective terms.\u000d\u000a        BEER models (among others) have also been used to assess the conversion\u000d\u000a        rates of currencies in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II)'\u000d\u000a      [7].\u000d\u000a    In addition, MacDonald's research-driven expertise has been sought by\u000d\u000a      international governments and economic policy-makers. In 2008, for\u000d\u000a      example, the General Secretariat for Development Planning (GDSP) (now the\u000d\u000a      Ministry of Development Planning and Statistics) in Qatar commissioned\u000d\u000a      MacDonald to prepare a report on the Monetary and Exchange Rate Regime\u000d\u000a        Options for Qatar. The GDSP is a governmental agency mandated to\u000d\u000a      devise a national development vision for Qatar; this includes Social,\u000d\u000a      Economic, Human and Environmental Development. When the report was\u000d\u000a      commissioned the Gulf countries &#8212; Qatar included &#8212; were linking their\u000d\u000a      currencies to the US dollar. However, at that time the US dollar was\u000d\u000a      depreciating sharply against non-Gulf currencies, and this, combined with\u000d\u000a      a high price for oil, had serious implications for the operation of\u000d\u000a      macroeconomic policy. Professor MacDonald canvassed a number of approaches\u000d\u000a      to monetary and exchange rate management and his analysis provided\u000d\u000a      essential context for the preparation of Qatar's National\u000a        Development Strategy 2011-2016.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Professor Ronald MacDonald has developed leading research and economic\u000d\u000a      models for applied exchange rate analysis.

MacDonald developed the Behavioural Equilibrium Exchange Rate\u000d\u000a      (BEER) approach to currency assessment jointly with Peter Clark at the\u000d\u000a      IMF. In essence, the BEER approach takes a widely accepted economic model\u000d\u000a      of the real exchange rate and attempts to approximate that model to get an\u000d\u000a      estimated value of a country's equilibrium exchange rate. BEER has been\u000d\u000a      widely used by central banks and the wider financial community to assess\u000d\u000a      the degree of misalignment of major currencies and MacDonald has continued\u000d\u000a      to write instructively on the approach (1).\u000d\u000a    Since moving to the University of Glasgow in 2005, MacDonald has refined\u000d\u000a      and developed this BEER approach in a number of significant new\u000d\u000a      directions. For example, in the monograph `Exchange Rate Regimes and\u000d\u000a      Monetary Union for the Gulf States', published in 2010 with Abdulrazak Al\u000d\u000a      Faris (Professor of Economics, UAE University), MacDonald addressed\u000d\u000a      equilibrium exchange rate issues in the context of countries planning to\u000d\u000a      join a currency union, with a particular emphasis on resource-dependent\u000d\u000a      countries in the Gulf area. MacDonald's contribution to the publication\u000d\u000a      focused on exchange rate regime issues for either the UAE dirham\u000d\u000a      or for the proposed Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) currency within that\u000d\u000a      context (2). The GCC is a political and economic union of Arab states\u000d\u000a      bordering the Persian Gulf, namely Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi\u000d\u000a      Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. MacDonald's research insights into\u000d\u000a      these issues covered the different exchange rate regime options as they\u000d\u000a      would best suit the different states in the GCC, which would need to be\u000d\u000a      considered if the states were to form a currency union.\u000d\u000a    In developing his research on the BEER model, MacDonald has strongly\u000d\u000a      argued that for exchange rate regimes to be effective, they must be\u000d\u000a      credible and offer countries an effective adjustment mechanism. MacDonald\u000d\u000a      co-authored Credibility in Regimes of the International Monetary\u000d\u000a        System with Michael Bordo in 2012; this work developed equilibrium\u000d\u000a      exchange rate issues in relation to credibility issues for countries\u000d\u000a      deciding to participate in a fixed exchange rate regime. As well as\u000d\u000a      editing this collection with Bordo, MacDonald co-authored all 10 chapters\u000d\u000a      in the publication, drawing on his research expertise on economic exchange\u000d\u000a      rate regimes as well as an historical economic perspective on\u000d\u000a      international monetary reform (3).\u000d\u000a    MacDonald has undertaken research and writing with Mathias Hoffmann of\u000d\u000a      the University of Zurich to demonstrate empirically how real interest\u000d\u000a      differentials, another crucial determinant of the BEER, can impact on real\u000d\u000a      exchange rates (4). MacDonald's unique contribution to this research stems\u000d\u000a      from his instrumental role in establishing and advancing the BEER\u000d\u000a      approach.\u000d\u000a    Additionally, MacDonald has worked with Luca Ricci of the IMF to provide\u000d\u000a      a theoretical framework for how productivity difference across countries\u000d\u000a      (a key element in the BEER approach) impacts on the equilibrium exchange\u000d\u000a      of a country and how productivity effects can have apparent perverse\u000d\u000a      effects compared to the traditional view. This work originally formed the\u000d\u000a      basis of an IMF Working Paper, which the researchers later published in\u000d\u000a      the Journal of Macroeconomics (5); it provides a further example\u000d\u000a      of the way that MacDonald has contributed his exchange rate expertise to\u000d\u000a      theoretically and empirically develop the BEER model during his time at\u000d\u000a      the University of Glasgow.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"22923","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact on public policy has reached the highest levels of the UK and\u000a      Scottish Governments, helping shape the political debate, and has also\u000a      raised minimum pricing up the policy agenda overseas, e.g. in Australia\u000a      and Canada, and helped to inform potential interventions in the EU (S4).\u000a      The UoS research has been highly visible in the wider public arena,\u000a      helping to inform public understanding of the issues around price\u000a      interventions and subsequent benefits.\u000a    a) Impact under the Labour Government in England and Wales:\u000a        2008\/9-2010\u000a    After the Sheffield team reported to the DoH in 2008, the Labour\u000a      Government's Chief Medical Advisor Sir Liam Donaldson drew up plans in\u000a      early 2009 to implement a minimum price on alcohol in England, where no\u000a      drinks could be sold for less than 50p per unit of alcohol (as supported\u000a      by the research of the UoS team). If introduced nationwide, he argued\u000a      (using statistics directly from UoS research, see R1-R4) that alcohol\u000a      consumption would be cut by 7%, deaths per annum would fall by just under\u000a      3,400 and there would be an estimated 97,900 fewer hospital admissions\u000a      (S1). The UoS research published in The Lancet estimated that a\u000a      minimum price set at this level would save up to 50,000 individuals from\u000a      illness in a decade, where the largest harm reduction would be for those\u000a      individuals aged 45 and over with chronic ill health. However, the then\u000a      Prime Minister Gordon Brown refused to endorse the scheme on the grounds\u000a      that it would also penalise `moderate drinkers'.\u000a    b) Continuation of influence under Coalition Government: 2010 onwards\u000a    Under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition Government the\u000a      Chancellor in his June 2010 budget outlined the intention to review\u000a      alcohol taxation and pricing to tackle problem drinking without unfairly\u000a      penalising responsible drinkers, pubs and important local industries.\u000a      Whilst the Home Office reports fed into the review of pricing, the\u000a      Treasury led the review of taxation holding informal consultations during\u000a      the summer of 2010 between industry players, considering in particular the\u000a      rates and structure of duty on different products, the differential\u000a      between rates on high and low strength products, and the interaction\u000a      between tax and price. In the March 2011 budget the government announced a\u000a      2% above inflation rise on duties for beer, wine and spirits, over and\u000a      above flat rate increases previously imposed.\u000a    In England and Wales a ten week consultation period was launched by the\u000a      Home Office (28th November 2012 - 6th February 2013)\u000a      on a plan to set a minimum price of 45p per unit of alcohol as part of a\u000a      drive to tackle problem drinking. It also considered banning multi-buy\u000a      promotions e.g. two-for-one offers. The consultation sought views on five\u000a      key areas: (i) banning multi-buy promotions; (ii) review of mandatory\u000a      licensing conditions; (iii) health as a new alcohol licensing objective;\u000a      (iv) cutting red tape for businesses in order to reduce the burden of\u000a      regulation; and (v) minimum unit pricing (MUP). Meetings and events were\u000a      held with key stakeholders. The intended audience of the consultation\u000a      were: (i) licensed premises; (ii) licensing authorities; (iii) other\u000a      responsible authorities; (iv) health bodies; (v) the police; (vi) the\u000a      public; (vii) professional bodies; and (viii) trade bodies (S9). However,\u000a      on 17th July 2013, following analysis of the consultation's\u000a      responses, the Home Office minister Jeremy Browne announced that the\u000a      government would not be proceeding with minimum unit pricing, despite the\u000a      previous commitment shown, but this would \"remain under consideration.\"\u000a      The Home Secretary Theresa May stated in a post consultation Home Office\u000a      document (S10 page 3) \"We are not rejecting MUP &#8212; merely delaying it until\u000a      we have conclusive evidence that it will be effective\". Instead a ban on\u000a      the sale of alcohol below the level of alcohol duty plus VAT would be\u000a      implemented, coming into effect no later than spring 2014.\u000a    c) Reach beyond England and Wales\u000a    The research undertaken by the UoS team has also influenced the public\u000a      policy recommendations of the devolved Scottish Government, e.g., relating\u000a      to the introduction of an Alcohol Bill as part of their `Improving Health'\u000a      programme (see http:\/\/www.scotland.gov.uk\/Topics\/Health\/Services\/Alcohol\/minimum-pricing),\u000a      where it is stated that `The Chief Medical Officer believes that &#8212; like\u000a      the smoking ban &#8212; minimum price would save lives within a year. Recent\u000a      research by the University of Sheffield supports this &#8212; their model\u000a      suggests a 40p minimum price would save about 70 lives in year one, rising\u000a      to 365 lives per year by year ten.' In May 2012 the Scottish Health\u000a      Secretary Nicola Sturgeon announced a minimum price of 50p per unit. The\u000a      `Alcohol Minimum Pricing Scotland Bill' (S6) was the final stage of the\u000a      parliamentary process and it was anticipated that the policy would be\u000a      implemented in April 2013. However, the Scottish Whisky Association (SWA)\u000a      took legal action against the proposal which it believed contravened\u000a      European Law. The SWA lodged a complaint to the European Commission and\u000a      filed a petition for judicial review with the Scottish Court of Session.\u000a      This was ultimately rejected in May 2013 although the SWA has since lodged\u000a      an appeal which has delayed the implementation of a minimum unit price in\u000a      Scotland.\u000a    In Northern Ireland the Health Minister Edwin Poots was joined by the\u000a      Irish Republic's Health Minister Dr James Reilly and Minister of State for\u000a      Health R&#243;isin Shortall where a cross-border strategy on a minimum price\u000a      for alcohol was decided in 2011. Plans for minimum pricing between 45p and\u000a      50p per unit of alcohol were favoured following a consultation plan\u000a      announced by the Social Development and Health Ministers in March 2011\u000a      (S7). After a cabinet meeting in October 2013 it was announced that a new\u000a      Public Health Bill would be introduced with measures to curb the\u000a      advertising of alcohol and set a minimum unit price for drinks based on\u000a      their alcohol content.\u000a    In 2012 The Australian National Preventive Health Agency (ANPHA) was\u000a      tasked by the Commonwealth Government to examine the public interest case\u000a      for a minimum price for alcohol, to discourage harmful alcohol consumption\u000a      and promote safer consumption. A consultation document `Exploring the\u000a      public interest case for a minimum (floor) price for alcohol' was released\u000a      for public consultation in June and a draft report (S8) produced in\u000a      November 2012 which directly cites the UoS research. The ANPHA presented a\u000a      final report to Government in early 2013 and subsequent policy action is\u000a      currently under consideration.\u000a    d) Informing the public debate\u000a    Members of the public are one of the groups the ten week consultation was\u000a      aimed at. However, more generally, the exposure of the general public to\u000a      the policy debate has been on-going since the UoS report was initially\u000a      published. There has been extensive media coverage, e.g. The Financial\u000a      Times, The Guardian, and The Daily Telegraph. Examples of public exposure\u000a      to the issues around alcohol minimum pricing and its affects are evident\u000a      from prime time television coverage, e.g. Question Time (26\/05\/2011) http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/programmes\/p00h7569;\u000a      and Panorama (28\/09\/2012) http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/programmes\/b01mrmfd.\u000a      Awareness of the Sheffield research has reached the retail sector, trade\u000a      associations and advertising trade journals. For example, the Wine and\u000a      Spirit Trade Association website, http:\/\/www.wsta.co.uk,\u000a      where there is extensive discussion of the pricing debate, most recently\u000a      in relation to MUP in Scotland and the on-going legal action by the SWA.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    In 2007, as part of a major update of the national alcohol strategy, the\u000a      UK Government announced that it would commission an independent national\u000a      review of the evidence on the relationship between alcohol price,\u000a      promotion and harm. Subsequently, in 2008, researchers from the University\u000a      of Sheffield (UoS) were commissioned by the UK Department of Health (DoH)\u000a      for an `Independent Review of the Effects of Alcohol Pricing and\u000a      Promotion'.\u000a    The UoS research has played a crucial role in informing the debate and\u000a      deliberations on the available Government options for interventions on\u000a      alcohol consumption in England and Wales, by providing a robust evidence\u000a      base to underpin the debate. The UoS research findings have been used to\u000a      inform policy by senior decision-making bodies e.g. the House of Commons\u000a      Health Select Committee and the UK Chief Medical Officer to inform policy.\u000a      The findings have also stimulated the potential for policy intervention\u000a      beyond England and Wales, e.g. in Scotland and Australia.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Health","Institution":"\u000a    University of Sheffield\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Sheffield (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Sheffield","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Yorkshire And Humberside","UKPRN":10007157}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    Initial research grant from the DoH held by A.

It was these insights that underpinned the debate about policy\u000a      interventions, particularly minimum pricing, to address alcohol\u000a      consumption. The Sheffield research team comprised Karl Taylor (Department\u000a      of Economics), together with Alan Brennan, Petra Meier and Robin Purshouse\u000a      (all at the School of Health and Related Research in 2008).\u000a    The analysis estimated how price changes affect alcohol consumption and\u000a      how this in turn influences health outcomes. This was undertaken for the\u000a      population as a whole and also for a range of subgroups: (i) young people\u000a      under 18 who drink alcohol; (ii) 18-24 year old hazardous drinkers; and\u000a      (iii) harmful drinkers whose patterns of drinking damage their physical\u000a      and\/or mental health or cause substantial harm to others. The analysis\u000a      focused on four types of alcohol: beer; wine; spirits; and RTDs i.e. ready\u000a      to drinks (e.g. alcopops), identifying whether alcohol was purchased on\u000a      licensed premises (e.g. pubs), or off licensed premises (e.g. home\u000a      consumption of alcohol purchased from supermarkets).\u000a    Based on existing DoH guidelines in 2008 for alcohol consumption in\u000a      England, drinkers were classified into three categories based on their\u000a      mean alcohol intake per week: (i) `moderate drinkers', up to 21 units per\u000a      week (pw) for men and 14 units for women; (ii) `hazardous drinkers',\u000a      between 21 to 50 units pw for men and 14 to 35 units for women; and (iii)\u000a      `harmful drinkers', more than 50 units pw for men and more than 35 units\u000a      per week for women.\u000a    The analysis undertaken enabled a simulation of the effects of setting a\u000a      minimum price for alcohol. To simulate the effects of policy changes in\u000a      the pricing of alcohol, it was necessary to first establish the\u000a      sensitivity of alcohol consumption to price changes (elasticity). The\u000a      estimation of price elasticity was undertaken by Taylor in the Department\u000a      for Economics, UoS. The empirical analysis was based on data from the\u000a      Expenditure and Food Survey (EFS) providing purchasing transaction data\u000a      for individuals over the five years 2001\/02 to 2005\/06, including detailed\u000a      information on demographics, quantity purchased and prices paid.\u000a      Econometric analysis on the EFS data was then undertaken to quantify the\u000a      elasticity of demand for alcohol &#8212; the change to purchasing levels that\u000a      can happen when prices change. This was undertaken for 16 different\u000a      categories of alcohol: beers, wines, sprits and RTDs, split by\u000a      on\/off-trade purchase and further split into two price categories, using a\u000a      cut-off for low quality alcohol (defined by the DoH) of less than 30p per\u000a      unit of alcohol (off-trade) and less than 80p per unit of alcohol\u000a      (on-trade).\u000a    The results from econometric analyses (comprising 256 own and cross-price\u000a      elasticities) undertaken by Taylor were then used to: (i) estimate the\u000a      impact of policies on levels of alcohol consumption; and (ii) assess the\u000a      effect of consumption changes on mortality and disease prevalence for 47\u000a      health conditions. Minimum pricing interventions were found to be\u000a      effective for reducing consumption and subsequent health-care costs and\u000a      health-related quality of life losses (see 4a).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"22924","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"1605651","Name":"Thailand"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The development of the SF-6D contributes to health and welfare\u000d\u000a      and has commercial benefits.

Reach occurs because the SF-6D can\u000d\u000a      be derived from any SF-36 or SF-12 data set and these are the most widely\u000d\u000a      used generic outcome measures in clinical trials around the world.\u000d\u000a    Achieving impact\u000d\u000a    Dissemination of the SF-6D was initially via targeted presentations at\u000d\u000a      seminars with the funders (Glaxo Wellcome), other Pharma companies and\u000d\u000a      other key health decision makers such as the Department of Health and the\u000d\u000a      National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). In addition,\u000d\u000a      presentations were given at the main annual conference of key user\u000d\u000a      organisations including:\u000d\u000a    International Health Economics Association (IHEA); International\u000a        Society For Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR);\u000d\u000a      International Society for Quality of Life; American\u000d\u000a        Public Health Association (APHA). The work has also been\u000d\u000a      disseminated via chapters in two major books used by practitioners: the Elgar\u000d\u000a        Companion to Health Economics (Jones AM (ed) 2006) and the World\u000d\u000a      Health Organisation volume on Summary Measures of Population Health\u000d\u000a      (Murray et al 2001). This has resulted in the SF-6D being widely seen as\u000d\u000a      one of leading measures for calculating QALYs. Alongside the publications\u000d\u000a      of the research to develop the SF-6D, we have produced papers showing how\u000d\u000a      well it performs compared to other measures (in terms of psychometric\u000d\u000a      properties like validity); and how well it performs across different\u000d\u000a      health conditions.\u000d\u000a    To provide maximum access, the SF-6D is supplied in easy to use software\u000d\u000a      including Excel, SPSS and SAS. These programs can be run on SF-36 (version\u000d\u000a      1 or 2) and SF-12 datasets and generate the SF-6D index on the zero to one\u000d\u000a      scale for calculating QALYs. Guidance and instructions on how to use the\u000d\u000a      programs are provided at the SF-6D website (www.sheffield.ac.uk\/scharr\/sections\/heds\/mvh\/sf-6d).\u000a      Access to the SF-6D is through either a licence for commercial\u000d\u000a      applications from Fusion IP or Quality Metric (US) who supply the software\u000d\u000a      for a charge (see below). Non-commercial applications covering all public\u000d\u000a      sector and charitable organisations are free of charge and copies of the\u000d\u000a      software can be obtained through a named person in ScHARR; 521\u000d\u000a      non-commercial licences have been distributed since 2008.\u000d\u000a    Commercial benefits\u000d\u000a    The main commercial users of the SF-6D have been pharmaceutical\u000d\u000a      companies, and consultancy companies working on their behalf, who wish to\u000d\u000a      examine the cost-effectiveness of new drugs and make submissions to\u000d\u000a      regulatory authorities.\u000d\u000a    There are two sources for a commercial licence. One is obtained through\u000d\u000a      Fusion IP, a company specialising in marketing IP owned by Universities.\u000d\u000a      The selling of the SF-6D has also been sub- contracted to Quality\u000a        Metric (www.qualitymetric.com),\u000a      a US based company specialising in measuring health outcomes, who also\u000d\u000a      distribute other SF products including the SF-36 and SF-12. Since 2008\u000d\u000a      they have together sold 460 licences (based on royalties paid to the\u000d\u000a      University of Sheffield) to pharmaceutical companies (or consultancy\u000d\u000a      companies) including Novartis, Roche, Pfizer, Novo Nordisk, Astellas,\u000d\u000a      Merck, Sanofi and BMS. Other important commercial users have been health\u000d\u000a      care insurers and providers in the USA.\u000d\u000a    The companies benefit because an accepted generic health measure\u000d\u000a      administered in their clinical trial (the SF-36 or SF-12) can be directly\u000d\u000a      (and easily) translated into a preference-based measure that can be used\u000d\u000a      in economic evaluation. The SF-6D enables them to estimate the health\u000d\u000a      related quality of life benefits of their technology in terms of QALYs,\u000d\u000a      which is a requirement for a submission to regulatory bodies around the\u000d\u000a      world.\u000d\u000a    Health and welfare policy and practice: use by regulatory authorities\u000d\u000a        and in clinical trials\u000d\u000a    An important impact of the SF-6D is via its use by regulatory bodies\u000d\u000a      around the world for assessing the cost-effectiveness of health\u000d\u000a      technologies. The SF-6D is recommended for use by Health Technology\u000d\u000a      Assessment (HTA) agencies in Ireland and China (S1, S2); it is explicitly\u000d\u000a      named as an accepted measure in Australia (S3), Belgium, Canada, Norway\u000d\u000a      (S4), South Korea and Thailand; it also meets the specific guideline\u000d\u000a      requirements of HTA agencies in 21 other countries whose guidelines are\u000d\u000a      available via the ISPOR website and thus can be used for health care\u000d\u000a      decision making in those countries.\u000d\u000a    The SF-6D has been used in health care decision making in the UK by NICE,\u000d\u000a      the Scottish Medicines Consortium and the All Wales Medicines Strategy\u000d\u000a      Group. It has been used as the main health utility measure in important\u000d\u000a      NICE assessments for pharmacological treatments such as for Alzheimer's\u000d\u000a      (TA217) (S5), low platelet count (TA293) (S6), peripheral arterial disease\u000d\u000a      (TA223) (S7), and gout (TA291), and has been used alongside other measures\u000d\u000a      in many other appraisals. In addition, between them the two main SF-6D\u000d\u000a      studies (R1 &amp; R2) have been cited over 1200 times and the vast\u000d\u000a      majority of these citations report the use of the SF-6D in clinical trials\u000d\u000a      and economic evaluations of health care interventions around the world.\u000d\u000a      This provides clear evidence of its usefulness and popularity as a measure\u000d\u000a      for health care decision making. For example two uses of the SF-6D have\u000d\u000a      been in a large international clinical trial for nurse led management of\u000d\u000a      heart failure (S9), and to assess the cost effectiveness of diagnostic\u000d\u000a      procedures for HIV in resource limited settings (S10). There are numerous\u000d\u000a      other examples across physical, mental and public health, in both the\u000d\u000a      developed and developing world.\u000d\u000a    Impact on the general population\u000d\u000a    The SF-6D aids decision making via economic evaluation and therefore\u000d\u000a      informs the efficient and equitable allocation of health care resources.\u000d\u000a      Hence the general population of these countries are ultimately the main\u000d\u000a      beneficiaries since the health care authorities are able to extract better\u000d\u000a      value for money (i.e. more health outcomes per &#163;\/$\/&#8364;\/yuan etc.) from\u000d\u000a      scarce health care resources.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Given ever increasing demands on scarce health care resources, decisions\u000d\u000a      on whether to fund new health care interventions, particularly\u000d\u000a      pharmaceuticals, are increasingly being informed by evidence on\u000d\u000a      cost-effectiveness in terms of the cost per Quality Adjusted Life year\u000d\u000a      (QALY). The SF-6D health index method is used internationally for\u000d\u000a      calculating QALYs using patient reported health from clinical trials and\u000d\u000a      other sources. The development of the SF-6D contributes to health policy\u000d\u000a      and welfare via a more efficient allocation of scarce health care\u000d\u000a      resources and has significant commercial benefit. The health policy and\u000d\u000a      welfare benefits arise from the use of the SF-6D in the assessment of the\u000d\u000a      cost effectiveness by health services and regulatory agencies around the\u000d\u000a      world (including Australia, Canada, China, Scotland, Netherlands and\u000d\u000a      Norway) thus facilitating decisions on the most efficient use of limited\u000d\u000a      health care resources. The SF-6D is freely available to non-commercial\u000d\u000a      bodies, including researchers and policy makers. Commercial benefits come\u000d\u000a      from the licensing of the measure to pharmaceutical companies and others\u000d\u000a      to assess the cost effectiveness of their products, with 460 licences sold\u000d\u000a      globally since 2008, and a further 521 licences distributed on a\u000d\u000a      non-commercial basis to public sector and charitable status organisations.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Health","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Sheffield\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Sheffield (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Sheffield","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Yorkshire And Humberside","UKPRN":10007157}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    Main journal paper [Scopus citations]:\u000d\u000a    \u000aR1: Brazier J, Roberts J, Deverill M (2002) The Estimation\u000d\u000a      of a Preference-Based Measure of Health from the SF-36 Journal of\u000d\u000a        Health Economics 21(2) 271-292.

The research team\u000d\u000a      was Jennifer Roberts (Department of Economics, University of Sheffield),\u000d\u000a      John Brazier (School of Health &amp; Related Research [ScHARR] University\u000d\u000a      of Sheffield), and Mark Deverill (ScHARR). Jennifer Roberts' main input\u000d\u000a      was in developing the econometric modelling required to estimate the main\u000d\u000a      valuation algorithm, and subsequent extensions.\u000d\u000a    The main project was carried out at the University of Sheffield between\u000d\u000a      1999 and 2001. It involved deriving a health instrument (the SF-6D) from\u000d\u000a      the most commonly used general health measure in clinical studies\u000d\u000a      throughout the world (the SF-36); obtaining population preferences across\u000d\u000a      the dimensions of this new instrument; then estimating values for all\u000d\u000a      SF-6D health states for use in economic evaluation.\u000d\u000a    The SF-36 itself is not suitable for use in economic evaluation because\u000d\u000a      it simply measures the amount of limitation a patient is experiencing; it\u000d\u000a      does not enable trade-offs between different dimensions of health (e.g.\u000d\u000a      pain vs. physical functioning), or between quality and length of life.\u000d\u000a      Research involved psychometrically reducing the SF-36 to a 6 dimension\u000d\u000a      classification amenable to valuation. Population preferences for the 6\u000d\u000a      dimensions (physical functioning, role limitation, social functioning,\u000d\u000a      pain, mental health, vitality) were obtained for a sample of health\u000d\u000a      states, via face-to-face interviews with a large representative sample of\u000d\u000a      the UK population using standard gamble (SG), a choice-based method for\u000d\u000a      measuring preferences under uncertainty. Values for all SF-6D health\u000d\u000a      states were then estimated econometrically. The resulting algorithm\u000d\u000a      generates a continuous index for health anchored at 0 (equivalent to being\u000d\u000a      dead), and 1 (full-health); negative values denote health states assumed\u000d\u000a      worse than dead. The algorithm shows how much value people place on\u000d\u000a      different health limitations, and how they will trade-off between them;\u000d\u000a      for example how much vitality they will sacrifice for a reduction in pain.\u000d\u000a    The main research was published in 2002 (R1) and the SF-6D is now widely\u000d\u000a      used in the economic evaluation of health care around the world (see R4\u000d\u000a      and R5).\u000d\u000a    The SF-6D has a number of advantages over the previously used main health\u000d\u000a      valuation measure (the EQ-5D): (i) it is a much richer descriptive system,\u000d\u000a      defining 18,000 states as opposed to only 243 for the EQ-5D, thus it is\u000d\u000a      more sensitive to changes in health; (ii) it was valued using SG, which is\u000d\u000a      theoretically superior to the time-trade off method used for the EQ-5D;\u000d\u000a      (iii) the SF-6D can be derived from the SF-36, which is already included\u000d\u000a      as a health outcome measure in many clinical trials around the world, thus\u000d\u000a      imposing no additional patient or resource burden. Every SF-36 data set\u000d\u000a      (including those collected prior to the SF-6D) can therefore now be used\u000d\u000a      for economic evaluation.\u000d\u000a    Four main extensions to the research increase the impact: (i) An\u000d\u000a      algorithm was developed for the SF-12 (a reduced version of the SF-36),\u000d\u000a      increasing the reach to any trial where either SF-36 or SF-12 is\u000d\u000a      administered (R2); (ii) An improved algorithm using non-parametric\u000d\u000a      Bayesian methods was developed (R5), allowing decision makers to take\u000d\u000a      better account of differences across patients; (iii) Valuation algorithms\u000d\u000a      have been developed for the SF-6D in other countries including Australia,\u000d\u000a      Brazil, China (Hong Kong), Japan (R4), Portugal and Spain; as health\u000d\u000a      preferences differ between countries, reach is extended via these local\u000d\u000a      valuations; (iv) Algorithms have been developed for condition-specific\u000d\u000a      measures of health, extending the reach to health problems and trials\u000d\u000a      where generic measures are not appropriate (e.g. R6).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23960","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"3439705","Name":"Uruguay"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The collateral multiplier channel, first identified in the paper \"Credit\u000d\u000a      Cycles\", foreshadowed important aspects of the chain of events witnessed\u000d\u000a      recently. The amplification and propagation of business cycles through the\u000d\u000a      feedback mechanism in asset prices via the collateral resembles the sharp\u000d\u000a      deterioration in financial intermediaries' balance sheets during the\u000d\u000a      crisis. For that reason, this insight was an important input into\u000d\u000a      policymaking discussions within central banks during the crisis.\u000d\u000a    In order to maximise the impact of his work, Moore gave a series of\u000d\u000a      invited lectures in the Bank for International Settlements (2008), Banque\u000d\u000a      de France (2008), Bundesbank (2008), Sveriges Riksbank (2009), Banco\u000d\u000a      Central de Uruguay (2009) and the Bank of England (2011).

For example, in an\u000d\u000a      email to Prof Michael Elsby (UoE), an economist at the Federal Reserve\u000d\u000a      Bank of New York explicitly notes that he was invited to participate in\u000d\u000a      policy discussions in the Bank as a result of his familiarity with\u000d\u000a      Kiyotaki and Moore's work:\u000d\u000a    \"In the policy work that I've done last year, the reason why I was\u000d\u000a      involved was that I was working on Kiyotaki-Moore.

The\u000d\u000a      citation, entitled \"The Impact of \"Credit Cycles\" by Kiyotaki and\u000d\u000a      Moore\", notes in particular that:\u000d\u000a    \"This is a landmark paper for the literature... The insights of this\u000d\u000a      literature have been essential in understanding the current crisis and the\u000d\u000a      \"lost decade\" in Japan.\" [5.3]\u000d\u000a    This influence has also percolated into the public debate. An article in\u000d\u000a      The Economist criticising economists for the inability of their\u000d\u000a      models to engage with the crisis triggered a debate initiated by Nobel\u000d\u000a      Laureate Robert Lucas. In a piece by Markus Brunnermeier, Kiyotaki and\u000d\u000a      Moore are cited as economists who have provided useful models:\u000d\u000a    \"Research by Ben Bernanke and Mark Gertler, Nobu Kiyotaki and John Moore,\u000d\u000a      Rick Mishkin and other macroeconomists provided helpful policy guidance,\u000d\u000a      exactly because their models emphasise the importance of financial\u000d\u000a      frictions for the macroeconomy.\" [5.4]\u000d\u000a    Similarly, in a prominent article criticising the economics literature\u000d\u000a      for its irrelevance to the crisis, Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman highlights\u000d\u000a      the Kiyotaki-Moore agenda as an important exception:\u000d\u000a    \"There were some exceptions. One line of work, ... A related line of\u000d\u000a      work, largely established by my Princeton colleague Nobuhiro Kiyotaki and\u000d\u000a      John Moore ..., argued that prices of assets such as real estate can\u000d\u000a      suffer self-reinforcing plunges that in turn depress the economy as a\u000d\u000a      whole.\" [5.5]\u000d\u000a    This view was echoed by David Romer at a 2011 conference organised by the\u000d\u000a      International Monetary Fund on post-crisis macro policy:\u000d\u000a    \"I am not claiming that modern macroeconomics in general has not been\u000d\u000a      valuable. To give just one example, empirical and theoretical work on\u000d\u000a      credit-market imperfections (for example, Bernanke, 1983, Bernanke and\u000d\u000a      Gertler, 1989, and Kiyotaki and Moore, 1997) offers important insights\u000d\u000a      into financial crises and very likely informed the policy response.\" [5.6]\u000d\u000a    Beyond enriching our understanding of the financial crisis, Moore's\u000d\u000a      research also presaged policy responses that could counteract the severe\u000d\u000a      recessions exacerbated by financial frictions. Kiyotaki and Moore showed\u000d\u000a      that an injection of liquidity into the economy can help mitigate the\u000d\u000a      adverse effects of a financial crisis. From this insight emerged a highly\u000d\u000a      unconventional piece of policy advice: conduct open market operations that\u000d\u000a      exchange illiquid assets for liquid ones. This policy resembles important\u000d\u000a      aspects of the \"quantitative easing\" conducted by the Federal Reserve (and\u000d\u000a      the Bank of England) during the crisis. The impact of \"Liquidity, Business\u000d\u000a      Cycles, and Monetary Policy\" was acknowledged by Charles Evans, President\u000d\u000a      of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago (reinforcing the comment from the\u000d\u000a      Bank of England above). In a speech, delivered at the peak of the crisis,\u000d\u000a      he makes frequent reference to the paper, noting in particular that:\u000d\u000a    \"[O]ur Term Securities Lending Facility, which the Fed implemented in\u000d\u000a      mid-March, roughly corresponds to the Kiyotaki and Moore recommendations.\"\u000d\u000a      [5.7]\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    John Moore's Edinburgh-based research (1993-) on the role of trust and\u000d\u000a      liquidity in the amplification and propagation of business cycles has\u000d\u000a      informed both the understanding of, and the policy response to, the recent\u000d\u000a      financial crisis in central banking circles around the world.

It started during\u000d\u000a        Moore's first spell at The University of Edinburgh as a part-time\u000d\u000a        Professor in 1993-95. He returned in 2000 as the George Watson's and\u000d\u000a      Daniel Stewart's Professor of Political Economy, a full-time position\u000d\u000a        he continues to hold. This case study is based on two, closely related,\u000d\u000a        pieces of research both of which were predominantly produced in\u000d\u000a        Edinburgh.\u000d\u000a    Moore's first paper with Kiyotaki, \"Credit Cycles\", was originally\u000d\u000a      published as a University of Edinburgh Department of Economics Discussion\u000d\u000a      Paper in 1995. It subsequently appeared in the Journal of Political\u000d\u000a        Economy in 1997. This paper developed the idea that, in the presence\u000d\u000a      of financial frictions that limit the amounts that economic agents can\u000d\u000a      credibly borrow, collateral acts as a key lubricant to the financial\u000d\u000a      system. Kiyotaki and Moore show that there is a powerful interaction\u000d\u000a      between these credit constraints and aggregate economic activity over the\u000d\u000a      business cycle. In particular, since collateral sustains borrowing, and\u000d\u000a      thereby investment, changes in the price of collateralized assets can have\u000d\u000a      a profound effect on the ability of economic agents to borrow and invest.\u000d\u000a      In an economy in which debt sustains debt, a downward spiral can emerge\u000d\u000a      following a recessionary shock: in a downturn asset prices fall, which\u000d\u000a      reduces collateral values, suppresses investment and asset demand, thus\u000d\u000a      reducing asset prices still further. Moreover, the future knock-on effects\u000d\u000a      of falls in net worth and investment make matters even worse because they\u000d\u000a      too are reflected in reductions in today's asset prices. Through this new\u000d\u000a      channel, the collateral multiplier, small temporary shocks - such as those\u000d\u000a      that accompany business cycles &#8212; can be amplified and propagated through\u000d\u000a      the economy.\u000d\u000a    Kiyotaki and Moore resumed their research agenda on trust and liquidity\u000d\u000a      at the time of Moore's return to Edinburgh. The initial thoughts on their\u000d\u000a      follow-up project &#8212; part funded by Moore's Leverhulme Research\u000d\u000a      Professorship &#8212; \"Liquidity, Business Cycles, and Monetary Policy\" were\u000d\u000a      first put on paper in 2001 when they formed the basis of one of the\u000d\u000a      prestigious Clarendon Lectures given by Moore at Oxford\u000d\u000a      University. This paper presents a theory of the aggregate economy in which\u000d\u000a      fiat money has value because of its liquidity. When economic agents cannot\u000d\u000a      completely trust each other to repay their debts, money can allow them to\u000d\u000a      borrow and lend across time, financing investments that otherwise would\u000d\u000a      not happen. Thus, even though money is intrinsically valueless as an\u000d\u000a      asset, its liquidity has value in a world of limited trust. Kiyotaki and\u000d\u000a      Moore show that, in this environment, government policies that change the\u000d\u000a      mix of assets held in the economy can help to alleviate the amplitude of\u000d\u000a      business cycles. They show, in particular, that a policy that exchanges\u000d\u000a      illiquid private assets for liquid fiat money will stimulate the economy,\u000d\u000a      a policy considered unconventional at the time of the paper's writing.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23961","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"1605651","Name":"Thailand"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"1835841","Name":"South Korea"},{"GeoNamesId":"1562822","Name":"Vietnam"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Following the high visibility of his books on the ICT sector (including\u000d\u000a      prizes and extensive press reviews) Fransman was sought after by\u000d\u000a      governments and international organisations, receiving numerous\u000d\u000a      invitations to give lectures, briefings and face-to-face discussions with\u000d\u000a      policy makers around the world.\u000d\u000a    The wide dissemination of Fransman's ideas and expertise has given his\u000d\u000a      research an international reach, influencing policy makers, regulators and\u000d\u000a      companies in the ICT sector across the world.

With his\u000d\u000a      new ecosystem theory fully developed, in 2011 he returned to Vietnam as a\u000d\u000a      member of the International Advisory Board appointed by UNIDO to advise\u000d\u000a      the Ministry of S&amp;T on their ST&amp;I Strategy, 2011-2020. He gave the\u000d\u000a      main presentation to the Council for S&amp;T Policy, which reports to the\u000d\u000a      Prime Minister. Evidence of his recent impact is provided in the statement\u000d\u000a      by a leading member of the Vietnamese government:\u000d\u000a    \"... the work of Professor Martin Fransman has been studied in our\u000d\u000a      organisations and used widely in the domain of S&amp;T&amp;I [by] policy\u000d\u000a      makers in Vietnam. ...[he] has been instrumental in shaping [the] thinking\u000d\u000a      of Vietnamese policy makers for [the] new S&amp;T Strategy to 2010 while\u000d\u000a      working with [the] Ministry of S&amp;T of Vietnam...

The conference was\u000d\u000a      based around Fransman's concept of the ICT Ecosystem.\u000d\u000a    In April 2012 Fransman was invited to address the Japanese\u000d\u000a      Techno-Economic Society (JATES) on the topic, \"What should Japan do to\u000d\u000a      Survive and Thrive in the Evolving Global Economy?\" JATES' membership\u000d\u000a      includes the Chief Technology Officers of many of Japan's leading\u000d\u000a      companies.

JETS' establishment was sponsored by the\u000d\u000a        Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the UK DTI,\u000d\u000a        with financial support from NEC (&#165; 40 million), Fujitsu (&#165; 60 million)\u000d\u000a        and the Lothian Regional Council (&#163;120,000).\u000d\u000a    Following years of field research carried out in Japan, Korea, Taiwan,\u000d\u000a      France and in the US - using JETS as his base &#8212; Fransman developed\u000d\u000a      an integrated conceptual framework that facilitates the analysis of the\u000d\u000a      dynamics of the ICT sector (semiconductors, hardware and software,\u000d\u000a      telecommunications, consumer electronics, the Internet, new media) with\u000d\u000a      important implications for government policy makers, regulators, analysts\u000d\u000a      and companies. This framework is based on the notion of an evolving\u000d\u000a      innovation ecosystem of groups of competing and cooperating \"players\" who\u000d\u000a      innovate through their symbiotic interactions and co-evolve with their\u000d\u000a      environment. In the ICT Sector players are situated in four layers:\u000d\u000a    Layer 1 &#8212; equipment providers;\u000d\u000a    Layer 2 &#8212; network operators;\u000d\u000a    Layer 3 &#8212; platform, content and applications providers;\u000d\u000a    Layer 4 &#8212; final consumers.\u000d\u000a    Players interact with players in the other layers, producing six\u000d\u000a      symbiotic relationships. It is through these that innovation happens as\u000d\u000a      players learn their own and others' needs and potential and respond to\u000d\u000a      them. Innovation, in turn, drives the evolution of the ecosystem\u000d\u000a      generating the variety that, together with the system's selection\u000d\u000a      mechanisms, fuels the process of Schumpeterian creation-destruction.\u000d\u000a    As innovation is the main driver of performance, how it happens in the\u000d\u000a      ecosystem as a whole is of particular interest. Fransman's research showed\u000d\u000a      that in 2004-08 84% of the R&amp;D engine was located in Layer 1. However,\u000d\u000a      it is the network operators in Layer 2 who provide the bulk of investment\u000d\u000a      (67%) in the ecosystem. Understanding such characteristics of the ICT\u000d\u000a      Ecosystem helps policy-makers and regulators appreciate the likely\u000d\u000a      consequences of hypothetical measures.\u000d\u000a    Although firms are the engine of the ecosystem, universities, public\u000d\u000a      research institutes, financial and legal institutions are also important\u000d\u000a      determinants of its performance. The implications for policy making are\u000d\u000a      substantial. Most countries have science, technology and innovation\u000d\u000a      programmes, strategies and plans. How do these areas fit together and how\u000d\u000a      should policy makers evaluate policy options? The concept of an innovation\u000d\u000a      ecosystem provides a holistic method to analyse strengths\/weaknesses and\u000d\u000a      to design optimal policies.\u000d\u000a    As an illustration, extract the ICT companies (about 50) from the Financial\u000a        Times Top 500. Divide them into Layers 1 to 3 and into regions. Some\u000d\u000a      key puzzles emerge: why does the US almost completely dominate Layer 3?\u000d\u000a      Why are Europe and Asia hardly present in this layer? Why is Layer 1\u000d\u000a      dominated by US and Asian companies with Europe becoming weaker and\u000d\u000a      weaker? Why is Layer 3 growing far more rapidly than Layer 1 and why is it\u000d\u000a      more profitable? Fransman's framework highlights these puzzles and it also\u000d\u000a      gives an insight into where the answers lie.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23962","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"1562822","Name":"Vietnam"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Hughes's research was originally funded and developed in order to provide\u000d\u000a      a direct contribution to the formulation of policy at an international and\u000d\u000a      national level. It formed a large element of a study undertaken by the\u000d\u000a      World Bank which was funded by the Governments of the United Kingdom, the\u000d\u000a      Netherlands and Switzerland. This study was specifically commissioned\u000d\u000a        as the primary background document for the negotiations at the\u000d\u000a      Copenhagen Conference of Parties (COP15) for the UN Framework Convention\u000d\u000a      on Climate Change in 2009. [see 5.1 below] Agreement was not reached in\u000d\u000a      Copenhagen, so it was subsequently used in reaching an international\u000d\u000a      agreement on funding for adaptation to climate change in 2010 at the COP16\u000d\u000a      held in Cancun, Mexico. The final agreed funding (of approximately\u000d\u000a      US$80bn) was closely in line with the report's recommendations.

This research was\u000d\u000a      co-sponsored by the World Bank and the Development Research Centre of the\u000d\u000a      State Council of China, resulting in a policy statement on greener\u000d\u000a      growth, describing how China should respond to the challenges of climate\u000d\u000a      change.

In 2001 he left the World\u000d\u000a        Bank and since then he has been based in Scotland with the University of\u000d\u000a        Edinburgh as his sole academic base, along with a mix of public roles\u000d\u000a        and consultancy on policy issues. This combination of academic rigour\u000d\u000a        combined with applied policy research has led to powerful synergies,\u000d\u000a        making his advice highly sought after in policy circles.\u000d\u000a    This case study deals with Hughes's latest research on the economics of\u000d\u000a      adaptation to climate change. Underlying it is the general theme he has\u000d\u000a      championed in earlier work that successful policies to address climate\u000d\u000a      change must be based on carefully thought through empirical economics.\u000d\u000a    As of 2009 there were no reliable estimates of the cost of adapting the\u000d\u000a      infrastructure to climate change, notwithstanding the existence of the\u000d\u000a      2007 Bali Action Plan agreed by the UN. In order to progress with this\u000d\u000a      plan, a thorough cost measurement was required. To achieve this, the World\u000d\u000a      Bank commissioned a series of reports called the Economics of\u000d\u000a        Adaptation to Climate Change (EACC). As well as being effectively\u000d\u000a      the lead author on the main document, Hughes was personally responsible\u000d\u000a      for the detailed infrastructure parts (World Bank, 2010b) [see 5.1 below].\u000d\u000a      Parallel to these applications, Hughes (and co-authors) developed and\u000d\u000a      applied a framework for projecting and analysing the costs of adaptation\u000d\u000a      for the water, energy and infrastructure sectors for different alternative\u000d\u000a      projections of climate change over the 21st century, published in\u000d\u000a      scholarly articles. The method provides a tool for estimating broad costs\u000d\u000a      at the global and regional scale; such information is of key importance in\u000d\u000a      international negotiations. For example, in the case of water\u000d\u000a      infrastructure the analysis separates (a) the costs of maintaining service\u000d\u000a      standards for a baseline projection of demand, and (b) the costs of\u000d\u000a      changes in water use and infrastructure as a consequence of changes in\u000d\u000a      climate patterns. The engineering estimates focus on the direct capital\u000d\u000a      and operating costs of adaptation without relying upon economic incentives\u000d\u000a      to affect patterns of water use. Adopting an economic approach under which\u000d\u000a      water levies are used to cap total water abstractions, leads to a large\u000d\u000a      reduction in the burden of adaptation and generates savings of US$6-12\u000d\u000a      billion per year. Globally, these adaptation costs are low compared to\u000d\u000a      baseline costs (US$73 billion per year), which supports the notion of\u000d\u000a      mainstreaming climate change adaptation into broader policy aims.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28044","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2542007","Name":"Morocco"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    As noted, the main theme of the research that underlies this case study\u000a      has been on the extent to which central banks should use monetary policy,\u000a      along with countercyclical macroprudential tools, to promote financial\u000a      stability and mitigate systemic risk. Primary impacts can be noted at the\u000a      Central Banks of Brazil, Turkey and Morocco.\u000a    Pathways to Impact: In addition to formal academic papers, the\u000a      underlying research was disseminated through several policy-oriented\u000a      papers [B][E]. Several outputs were also presented in seminars and\u000a      conferences. These include presentations in central banks (e.g. The Bank\u000a      of France, The Central Bank of Brazil, and The Central Bank of Turkey) and\u000a      international organizations (European Central Bank, Bank for International\u000a      Settlements, Inter-American Development Bank, OECD, World Bank).\u000a      Presentations of the key policy insights were also made in specialized\u000a      policy forums, including a meeting of the G20 Central Banks in Brazil, and\u000a      meetings of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) and the Basel Committee on\u000a      Banking Supervision (BCBS). All these presentations took place between\u000a      June 2009 and December 2012. In addition, the position paper [B] and a\u000a      policy brief based on it were used as background material for a\u000a      presentation at the annual meeting of central banks from Latin America,\u000a      held in April 2013. Subsequently, the paper was distributed widely amongst\u000a      the central banks of the G20 countries.\u000a    In January 2012 Professor Ag&#233;nor held a special seminar in Brazil to\u000a      discuss integration of the key analytical insights of the underlying\u000a      research in the operational models used by the Central Bank of Brazil\u000a      (BCB), with the bank's Governor noting that the research agenda introduced\u000a      by Professor Ag&#233;nor:\u000a    \"...has been relevant at both an analytical and practical level to\u000a        enrich our discussions at the Banco Central do Brazil (BCB). In\u000a        particular, I would like to point out... its timeliness given the\u000a        challenges posed by the global financial crisis and its aftermath for\u000a        central banks and regulators... In Brazil...we had in the past and\u000a        continue now to aim at achieving both macroeconomic stability and\u000a        financial stability and need to refine our understanding of their\u000a        interaction with macroprudential policies.\" [1]\u000a    Following his visit, a Working Group of several researchers was\u000a      established at BCB to implement the work program that he outlined.\u000a      Insights from the research were also used as input in the design of a new\u000a      Macroprudential Regulation Department at BCB.\u000a    In further collaboration with BCB, in December 2012 Professor Ag&#233;nor\u000a      participated in a joint workshop organized by BCB and the Inter-American\u000a      Development Bank (IADB) on `Managing Capital Inflows in Latin America'.\u000a      His presentation was based on [B], a document which combines and refines\u000a      all previous research in this area undertaken by the research team.\u000a    Reach and Significance of the Impact\u000a    Brazil: As outlined, BCB has benefited directly from the research\u000a      output. One of the co-authors, Dr Pereira da Silva, has been in charge of\u000a      implementing a program of macroprudential regulation in Brazil, and\u000a      research outputs have helped to shape the new framework, by providing key\u000a      insights on how an IIT regime works - most importantly, the fact the\u000a      policy interest rate must respond directly (possibly in a state-contingent\u000a      fashion) to excessively rapid credit growth, and the fact that monetary\u000a      and macroprudential policies are calibrated jointly to achieve\u000a      macroeconomic and financial stability. Dr da Silva is also Brazil's\u000a      representative in the technical meetings of the G20 and in various\u000a      international forums (FSB and BCBS). Several policy papers, including a\u000a      comprehensive Position Paper, have been circulated in events organized by\u000a      these institutions and there is informal evidence that these papers have\u000a      helped several other middle-income countries to clarify their position on\u000a      specific systemic regulatory issues.\u000a    The research has also had a direct impact on policymaking at BCB, because\u000a      one of the core models that it uses for day-to-day operations (to provide\u000a      inputs for regular policy meetings) has begun to incorporate insights from\u000a      the research conducted under the agenda described above, with the BCB\u000a      governor recognising that research outputs are:\u000a    \"...useful for us at home and also to strengthen our dialogue in a\u000a        variety of international fora including the BRICS, the Group of Twenty\u000a        countries (G20). They also contributed to our discussions with senior\u000a        policymakers from advanced economies... [and are] also part of\u000a        the Banco Central do Brazil (BCB) effort to sponsor Technical Assistance\u000a        activities and Training Seminars involving many central banks in Latin\u000a        America.\" [1]\u000a    Turkey: There is clear evidence that the research has proved\u000a      useful for policy analysis and policy discussions at the Central Bank of\u000a      Turkey (CBT). The Head of Research and Monetary Policy Department at CBT\u000a      praised the research, affirming that CBT staff have \"benefited very\u000a        significantly, at an analytical level, from the research work...\u000a      [and] Professor Ag&#233;nor has played a leading role in developing this\u000a        agenda\". More specifically, it was noted that the research \"explicitly\u000a        focused on the type of financial systems that Turkey (as well as many\u000a        other middle-income countries) face... These systems tend to be\u000a        bank-dominated and credit market imperfections play a critical role in\u000a        their functioning. Developing models that adequately capture these\u000a        structural features are essential if these models have to be useful\u000a        guides for policy\" [2]\u000a    Morocco: Similarly, as the former Director, Economics and\u000a      International Relations at the Central Bank of Morocco (BAM) notes, the\u000a      research \"has proved extremely important for BAM because it is\u000a        explicitly focused on the type of financial systems that Morocco\u000a        operates... analytical work led by Professor Ag&#233;nor has helped to\u000a        improve significantly our understanding of the monetary transmission\u000a        mechanism in a bank-dominated financial system.\" Again, it is noted\u000a      that the development of models that adequately capture the structural\u000a      features of such economies is necessary for policy impact. Accordingly,\u000a      Ag&#233;nor's work on the transmission mechanism with imperfect credit markets\u000a      has served as a key input for the specification of a particular\u000a      forecasting model (specifically, a VARX model), which \"continues to be\u000a        used to this day by BAM staff to establish quarterly macroeconomic\u000a        forecasts and conduct policy analysis, with results published regularly\u000a        in BAM's Inflation Report and in background policy documents prepared\u000a        for regular meetings of BAM's Monetary Policy committee\" [3].\u000a    Additional Impact: The research has also benefited international\u000a      institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the\u000a      World Bank. A recent IMF executive board paper references the work of\u000a      Ag&#233;nor and colleagues on `Sudden Floods' [E], noting that: \"In open\u000a        economies, financial shocks can originate abroad and, more importantly,\u000a        lead to an appreciation of the domestic currency. While this limits\u000a        inflation, when banks have foreign liabilities, it leads to financial\u000a        amplification by strengthening banks' balance sheets, causing credit to\u000a        expand. As a result, macroprudential policy needs to react more and\u000a        monetary policy less, but the interplay between the two does not change\u000a        markedly\" [4].\u000a    Similarly, a policy paper by the Vice President of the World Bank also\u000a      dwells extensively on this research, noting that: \"One important\u000a        message emerging from this discussion is that monetary policy and\u000a        regulation are complementary instruments aiming at macroeconomic and\u000a        financial stability. A prudent approach should try to avoid `corner\u000a        solutions', that is, putting the entire weight of ensuring price and\u000a        financial stability on only one instrument... Ag&#233;nor, Alper, and Pereira\u000a        da Silva... develop a general equilibrium framework for analyzing this\u000a        issue\" [5].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Since the global financial crisis triggered by the collapse of the\u000a      subprime mortgage market in the United States, a key issue for central\u000a      banks has been the extent to which they should use monetary policy, along\u000a      with macroprudential tools, to promote financial stability.

Alper, was his PhD student at\u000a      Manchester when the research agenda was initiated.\u000a    The aim of the research was, and continues to be, to develop small\u000a      theoretical models and more detailed quantitative macroeconomic models\u000a      (for both closed and open economies), to allow central banks to determine\u000a      how and to what extent they should combine monetary policy and\u000a      macroprudential tools to promote macroeconomic and financial stability.\u000a      The culmination point of this agenda is the completion of a position\u000a      paper, \"Inflation Targeting and Financial Stability...\" [B], which will be\u000a      issued by a major multilateral institution, and in which a new regime for\u000a      monetary policy - Integrated Inflation Targeting (IIT) - is proposed for\u000a      middle-income countries. IIT is defined as a flexible inflation targeting\u000a      (IT) regime in which:\u000a    \u000a      The central bank holds an explicit financial stability mandate.\u000a      The policy interest rate responds directly (possibly in a\u000a        state-contingent fashion) to excessively rapid credit growth.\u000a      Monetary and macroprudential policies are calibrated jointly\u000a        to achieve macroeconomic and financial stability.\u000a    \u000a    More specifically, the research has helped to improve understanding in\u000a      three areas:\u000a    I. The monetary transmission mechanism in a bank-dominated financial\u000a      system [A][C].\u000a    II. How different bank capital regulatory regimes (including the new Basel\u000a        III regime) affect the transmission of policy and exogenous shocks\u000a      to inflation, economic activity and financial variables, and how, in turn,\u000a      fluctuations in these variables affect macroeconomic and financial\u000a      stability [A][D][E].\u000a    III. The extent to, and the conditions under, which monetary policy and\u000a      macroprudential regulation are complements or substitutes in achieving\u000a      macroeconomic and financial stability, and the extent to which these\u000a      objectives should be integrated in a new monetary policy regime, dubbed\u000a      `Integrated Inflation Targeting' (ITT) [A][B][E][F].\u000a    What is original and distinctive about the research is that it focuses\u000a        on the types of financial systems and credit market imperfections that\u000a        are pervasive in middle-income countries. It therefore aimed at the\u000a      outset to build cutting-edge models that are relevant for that group of\u000a      countries.\u000a    As there are very few groups of researchers engaged in this activity,\u000a      this line of research has received immediate international exposure, aided\u000a      to a significant extent by the fact that one of the co-authors is a senior\u000a      policymaker in the central bank of a major middle-income country, Brazil,\u000a      which is also a member of the BRIC group of large and fast-growing\u000a      emerging economies. The research outputs have been used to promote\u000a      discussions among senior policymakers from these countries, and to inform\u000a      their policy positions in international forums.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28045","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Pathways to impact: During the last decade, Professor Evstigneev\u000a      and colleagues have given numerous presentations at significant\u000a      international conferences in the field, and published popular papers on\u000a      the subject addressing broad audiences.

The results of the research were\u000a      used in the development of investment strategies in the AllMountain\u000a      Capital AG, and earlier, when building the Managed Futures trading team of\u000a      Horizon21. The AllMountain Capital AG is a specialist in Managed Futures\u000a      and systematic investment strategies, founded in 2010 as a spin-off from\u000a      Horizon21. AllMountain Capital is a highly successful hedge fund with USD\u000a      100 million currently under management.\u000a    In 2008, after the investment company started using the mathematical\u000a      results on Behavioural and Evolutionary Finance outlined within the\u000a      research of Professor Evstigneev and colleagues, it achieved an average\u000a      annual return of +12%, with an annualized volatility of 15%, coping well\u000a      with the global financial crisis and the post-crisis situation. A partner\u000a      at AllMountain Capital AG notes that \"For a systematic asset manager\u000a        like ours, it is of utmost importance to be able to rely on solid,\u000a        thorough academic work when it comes to formulating our investment\u000a        strategies\", and writes in support of this research:\u000a    \"The research of Profs.

Results from the outlined\u000a      research provided a theoretical framework for the development of the\u000a      `Portfolio Total Return Index' (PTRI), used by Deutsche Bank. The\u000a      portfolio total return index is a rule-based value index which is built up\u000a      of several different asset classes. The index management and controlling\u000a      requires a risk valuation of each subclass, with this valuation was\u000a      primarily undertaken in the manner described in the underpinning research.\u000a    Since 2008, DB has invested in the index with the DB X-trackers:\u000a      Portfolio Total Return Index (WKN DBX0BT). The DB X-trackers PTRI holds\u000a      more than EUR 84 million of assets under management, as of 10th\u000a      July 2012. Since its launch, the PTRI has created a total return of\u000a      approx. 50% with a volatility of about 9.2%. Within this time, the\u000a      benchmark consisting of 60% Stoxx 50 Index and 40% REX-P Index only\u000a      achieved a total return of approx. 17% with a volatility of about 12.4%.\u000a      The Head of DB X-trackers, Deutsche Bank, alongside the CEO of Institut\u000a        f&#252;r Verm&#246;gensaufbau (Munich) note that \"the scientific results\u000a        achieved by Igor V.

He has been the most important\u000a        economic source of these ideas for DTI\/BIS economists and other\u000a        officials.\" [1]\u000a    These appointments and the influence of his ideas led to Metcalfe's\u000a      membership of a panel of six economists, chaired by Keith Smith, that\u000a      produced the economics paper (EP15) that is the basis of the Government's\u000a      `Innovation and Research Strategy for Growth' (IRSG), announced on 8th\u000a      December 2011 [2].\u000a    IRSG: Professor Metcalfe was one of only six academics cited and\u000a      thanked by name for their input.\u000a    The chair and report co-author (on secondment to BIS) summarises\u000a      Metcalfe's contribution to EP15, recognising that \"Stan's thinking\u000a        played an important role... [with] the over-arching objective of\u000a        the Economics paper... to create a coherent framework within which to\u000a        formulate innovation policy in order to promote economic growth. This\u000a        framework relied heavily on the concept of `innovation systems', a\u000a        concept developed in Stan's seminal application of ideas from\u000a        evolutionary economics to the study of innovations [E][F]. Smith\u000a      went on to highlight that Metcalfe's work as a whole [see, Section 3]: \"played\u000a        a very important role in the identification of all four... priorities\u000a        for innovation policy as a driver for economic growth\" identified by\u000a      EP15 [3]: The need to:\u000a    \u000a      Strengthen the sharing and dissemination of knowledge within the\u000a        innovation system.\u000a      Maintain and develop a full scale knowledge infrastructure.\u000a      Incentivise businesses across the economy to undertake the tangible\u000a        and intangible investments that drive innovation.\u000a      Improve and transform the innovative capacity of the public sector in\u000a        order for it to realize its potential as a major driver of innovation.\u000a    \u000a    In sum, EP15 provided key support for IRSG, the objective of which is \"supporting\u000a        business R&amp;D in areas in which the UK excels, within the context of\u000a        developing the wider UK innovation eco-system including universities and\u000a        other organisations\" (http:\/\/bis.gov.uk\/innovatingforgrowth).\u000a      Moreover, IRSG is built around the key role of government in both\u000a      supporting innovation ecologies and the linkages between them:\u000a    The Government is improving incentives for companies to innovate\u000a        especially SMEs. In addition to our successful changes to the SME\u000a      [small and medium enterprises] R&amp;D Tax Credit we will invest an\u000a        additional &#163;75 million to support small business innovation including\u000a        additional funding for Smart, grants that support SME research and\u000a        development. We will implement a new innovation voucher programme\u000a        enabling small businesses to engage with universities and the wider\u000a        knowledge base. (BIS Website)\u000a    The importance of both innovation per se, alongside this specific\u000a      strategy to promote innovation, is evidenced by the budgets\u000a      involved. As of 2011, the annual Government budget for science and\u000a      research programmes is &#163;4.6 billion, with &#163;150 million each year\u000a      supporting university-business interaction. The impact of IRSG is further\u000a      evidenced in the BIS `Annual Innovation Report' (2012) that documents\u000a      progress made on a number of fronts in the implementation of IRSG during\u000a      2012 [2]. This progress involves the provision of support for innovation\u000a      ecologies, and the linkages between them, including additional funding of\u000a      &#163;200 million for the UK Research Partnership Investment Fund (UKRIF), to\u000a      add to &#163;100 million provided in the 2012 Budget to enable universities to\u000a      enter long-term strategic research partnerships with the private sector.\u000a    Beyond these immediate policy impacts, IRSG, and through it Metcalfe's\u000a      work, have played a key role in shaping public debate on economic growth.\u000a      As the IRSG chair clarifies, ministers have embraced this topic as they\u000a      seek to shape \"the ideas into new approaches to technology strategy,\u000a        industrial policy and long-term growth... Stan Metcalfe can legitimately\u000a        claim to be a central intellectual progenitor of these developments, and\u000a        it is therefore fair to say that his impact on contemporary policy\u000a        thinking and policy practice has been very substantial indeed\" [3].\u000a    Overseas Work: Metcalfe's research has had impact in Europe and\u000a      Australia. His ideas were presented in a European context at the 2009\u000a      UNESCO forum `Innovation for Development: Converting Knowledge to Value',\u000a      and subsequent report [4]. He worked closely with the EU K4G (Knowledge\u000a      for Growth) Expert Group that emerged out of the Lisbon Agenda\u000a      (2000-2010). The concluding conference in 2009 `S&amp;T Policy in Times of\u000a      Crisis: Prospects for the Knowledge-based Economy', noted that his work\u000a      with Professor Paul David on `Universities and R&amp;D organisations in\u000a      the ERA' and their contribution to Europe's `innovation performance' was \"fundamental\u000a        to the discussions at the conference\" [5]. This work was\u000a      subsequently published in the committee's final report [6]. As the EC\u000a      Research &amp; Innovation DG confirm:\u000a    Metcalfe's work on innovation systems continues to influence EC\u000a        thinking, as the successor of Commissioner Potocnik, M&#225;ire\u000a        Geoghegan-Quinn based her approach on his Schumpeterian\/ evolutionary\u000a        approach... Metcalfe's approach remains at the heart of the Europe 2020\u000a        target that proposes three per cent of the EU's GDP (public and private)\u000a        should be invested in R&amp;D\/innovation, and particularly in the\u000a        requirement to `strengthen... every link in the innovation chain, from\u000a        'blue sky' research to commercialisation'. Moreover, his research has\u000a        been useful in addressing the EC's medium term goals as his message on\u000a        the ecology of innovation was well understood in the EUROPA 2020\u000a        document of President Barroso and by Cm. Geoghegan-Quinn.\" [7][8]\u000a    Metcalfe's contribution to innovation policy in Australia arose through a\u000a      number of engagements. He became a member of the Creative Industries and\u000a      Innovation Centre of Excellence at Queensland University of Technology\u000a      upon its creation in 2005, and was a key contributor to series of\u000a      `Innovation Fora' in 2006. These associations, along with his acknowledged\u000a      expertise, led to his being one of four international experts consulted as\u000a      part of the 2008 `Review of the National Innovation System' set up by Kim\u000a      Carr, the Minister for Innovation Industry, Science and Technology. The\u000a      resulting report, `Venturous Australia', set out a national innovation\u000a      agenda [9], to which the Government responded in its White Paper (and 10\u000a      year innovation plan) \"Powering Ideas: An Innovation Agenda for the 21st\u000a      Century\", and implemented in its 2009 Federal budget. As confirmed by the\u000a      Government's innovation policy branch, Metcalfe's contribution:\u000a    \"...had a profound impact on the members of the Panel and led to a\u000a        better understanding of the role for Government in facilitating\u000a        innovation... In particular, three points made by Stan Metcalfe have\u000a        remained central to our innovation policy... The central importance of\u000a        competition policy to keep the system open &#8212; innovation policy as a\u000a        complement to competition policy...

The research was undertaken whilst\u000a      Metcalfe was Professor of Economics and Stanley Jevons Professor of\u000a      Political Economy (1990-2009) at UoM, and emerges from tasks undertaken\u000a      (1984-1992) as a member of both the science and innovation advisory\u000a      committees (ACARD, subsequently ACOST). These were the pre-cursors of the\u000a      current Council for Science and Technology, and the Monopolies and Mergers\u000a      Commission (1991-97).\u000a    At this time, innovation policy was largely framed within the\u000a      neo-classical economic framework of equilibrium and optimizing agents, and\u000a      centred upon the use of market incentive mechanisms to induce innovation\u000a      by profit maximising firms to overcome market failures. However, it was\u000a      becoming recognised that such policies were unlikely to succeed due to\u000a      market failures caused by the economic peculiarities of knowledge, and its\u000a      ongoing production. Through work undertaken within the aforementioned\u000a      committees, Metcalfe realised how ideas grounded within evolutionary\u000a      economics &#8212; as expounded in the seminal 1982 text by Nelson and Winter \"An\u000a      Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change\" &#8212; can be successfully applied to\u000a      the study of innovation policy. Both firms and governments are viewed from\u000a      a behavioural perspective, with a focus placed on learning processes and\u000a      adaptive behaviour. Metcalfe presented these ideas in a seminal paper [F]\u000a      and associated book chapter [E], with three key insights from this work\u000a      being:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aInnovation consists of two types of process: those that\u000a        determine the range of innovations (variety) introduced in the\u000a        economy; and those that alter the relative economic importance of the\u000a        competing alternatives (selection).\u000a      \u000aThese processes are sustained and supported by innovation systems;\u000a        the infrastructure and institutions that facilitate innovation within\u000a        and across firms.\u000a      \u000aAn evolutionary perspective leads to the necessity of two types of\u000a          policy instrument, for government's wishing to promote innovation:\u000a\u0009\u0009  \u000a      - Policies aimed at reducing the cost of (or increasing pay-off\u000a          from) research, such as tax incentives, R&amp;D subsidies and\u000a        patent protection.\u000a      - Policies aimed at improving the innovation infrastructure in\u000a        order to enhance linkages between the internal efforts of firms, and\u000a        public R&amp;D carried out within the national science base.\u000a    Through subsequent engagements with senior economics staff at the DTI,\u000a      and via interactions with colleagues in the ESRC Centre for Research on\u000a      Innovation and Competition (CRIC, 1997-), Metcalfe further developed these\u000a      ideas in a series of book chapters and articles [A][B][C][D] that led to a\u000a      fundamental decomposition of innovation systems into `innovation\u000a        ecologies'. These ecologies comprise the set of individuals (usually\u000a      within organisations) who are repositories and generators of new\u000a      knowledge, alongside the `system making' connections between the\u000a      components that ensure the flow of information whether in general or\u000a      directed at a specific purpose. These `innovation ecologies', including\u000a      firms, universities and knowledge brokers, are the building blocks from\u000a      which innovation systems are built with appropriate system making\u000a      connections including markets for technology licenses, professional\u000a      networks, collaborative partnerships, et cetera [A]. Two key\u000a        roles for government are highlighted:\u000a    \u000a      Governments must ensure the existence of innovation ecologies.\u000a      Governments must facilitate the formation and strengthening of the\u000a          connections that create innovation systems from these ecologies;\u000a        this includes intervening to address system failures due to\u000a        weak\/non-existent linkages [C] and actively promoting the diffusion of\u000a        knowledge [D].\u000a    \u000a    In line with this work, Metcalfe also sought to employ arguments from\u000a      evolutionary economics to demonstrate the importance of innovation as a\u000a      driver of economic growth [B]. This finding, combined with his earlier\u000a      work, strengthened the argument that Government policies aimed at\u000a      promoting innovation systems provide an important vehicle for promoting\u000a      economic growth.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28084","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Pathways: Following the submission of the 2002 report `Phasing out\u000d\u000a      the EU milk Quota', DEFRA\u000d\u000a      organized a meeting in Brussels attended by around ninety key players from\u000d\u000a      across the EU, to put\u000d\u000a      the UK case for eliminating milk quotas to member countries. At this\u000d\u000a      meeting, Colman led the team\u000d\u000a      of four economists presenting the results from the 2002 report relating to\u000d\u000a      the UK dairy industry.

This study used the models reported in [C] to\u000d\u000a      analyse the best process\u000d\u000a      and scenarios for the elimination of the milk quota. The analysis fully\u000d\u000a      supported the 2008 move to\u000d\u000a      \"progressively increase national milk quotas before 2015 in order to\u000d\u000a        reduce quota rents, permit\u000d\u000a        adjustment and achieve a `soft landing.'\" [1].\u000d\u000a    Reach and Significance: In 2008, the EU Agricultural Commissioner\u000d\u000a      announced the decision that\u000d\u000a      milk quotas in the EU were to be eliminated in 2015.

For instance, in 2009, the European\u000d\u000a      Parliament (Policy\u000d\u000a      Department B) published a report on the reform of market regulation\u000d\u000a      mechanisms in which it is\u000d\u000a      stated that in reference to the 2008 decision to eliminate milk quotas: \"following\u000d\u000a        the same approach\u000d\u000a        as the analyses drawn up by some economists (Colman, 2002), this\u000d\u000a        decision was made in\u000d\u000a        consideration of the fact that milk quotas were undermining the sector's\u000d\u000a        competitiveness\" [2]. The\u000d\u000a      influence of Colman's analysis is also evident in a 2008 study by the\u000d\u000a      European Parliament (Policy\u000d\u000a      Department B) analysing possible future scenarios for milk quota as it\u000d\u000a      references Colman's work\u000d\u000a      [B][D][E] twelve times in its assessment of both the regional and EU wide\u000d\u000a      impacts of alternative\u000d\u000a      quota elimination strategies [3]. Subsequent to these reports, the EU\u000d\u000a      decided in the 2008 Common\u000d\u000a      Agricultural Policy (CAP) `Health Check' to increase national quotas by 1%\u000d\u000a      per annum, a `soft\u000d\u000a      landing' that would slowly erode their value and prepare the way for the\u000d\u000a      quota to expire completely\u000d\u000a      in 2015.\u000d\u000a    This evidence of Colman's influence in European Parliament documents is\u000d\u000a      underscored by\u000d\u000a      testimony from Richard Ashworth (MEP), member of the Committee for\u000d\u000a      Agriculture and Rural\u000d\u000a      Development in the European Parliament, who confirmed that: \"Professor\u000d\u000a        Colman's comments\u000d\u000a        greatly added to the discussions and were of immense value in the\u000d\u000a        debate...Professor Colman's\u000d\u000a        research remains valid with reference to the next round of discussions\u000d\u000a        around the CAP, with the\u000d\u000a        current consensus being that the quota will be removed in 2015, but\u000d\u000a        other controls may be\u000d\u000a        introduced\" [4]. Similarly, Colman's work also impacted on the\u000d\u000a      response of DairyUK (an\u000d\u000a      organization representing the interests of the entire dairy supply chain)\u000d\u000a      to the stakeholder\u000d\u000a      questionnaire conducted as part of the 2008 CAP health check. The Policy\u000d\u000a      Director of DairyUK,\u000d\u000a      summarised DairyUK's position on the milk quota as follows:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \"[The] Milk quota should be eliminated as they were acting as an\u000d\u000a          effective constraint on the\u000d\u000a          total EU milk production, (response to Question 19 CAP Health Check\u000d\u000a          Stakeholder's\u000d\u000a          Questionnaire).\u000a\u000d\u000a      It would be irresponsible simply to do nothing until 2015 and let\u000d\u000a          the quota regime expire as\u000d\u000a          all available studies indicated that his would impose a rapid and\u000d\u000a          disruptive price adjustment\u000d\u000a          on the industry.

In\u000d\u000a      2008, Alliance\u000d\u000a        Environnement submitted a wide-ranging report to the European\u000d\u000a      Commission, commissioned by\u000d\u000a      DGARD, on the wider environmental impacts of milk quotas. Again Colman was\u000d\u000a      at the centre of\u000d\u000a      this work, alongside six other leading agricultural economists from across\u000d\u000a      the EU [6]. Four years\u000d\u000a      later, in 2012, the EC (Joint Research Centre) brought a number of strands\u000d\u000a      together in more\u000d\u000a      general assessment of the impact of the CAP on agricultural landscape.\u000d\u000a      Within the final report,\u000d\u000a      Colman's research was cited, with insights from both [B] and [6] used to\u000d\u000a      analyse the impacts of\u000d\u000a      changes in the dairy industry on landscapes in the EU [7].\u000d\u000a    Timeline &amp; Legacy: Following the 2008 CAP decision, the EU has\u000d\u000a      continued to commission\u000d\u000a      studies re-evaluating the impacts of quota removal on the dairy industry.\u000d\u000a      Colman's work is still\u000d\u000a      clearly influential in these recent debates.\u000d\u000a    Firstly, in 2010 the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural\u000d\u000a      Development \"adopted a proposal\u000d\u000a        on `contractual relations in the milk sector'... to help the sector\u000d\u000a        prepare for a `soft landing' when\u000d\u000a        quotas come to an end in 2015.\" This proposal was outlined in the EU\u000d\u000a      report `Evolution of the\u000d\u000a      Market Situation...' which report sought to synthesise three reports\u000d\u000a      submitted to the Directorate-General\u000d\u000a      for Agriculture and Rural Development (DGARD). One of these reports\u000d\u000a      (Tonini &amp;\u000d\u000a      Dom&#237;nguez) contained a review of six suitable econometric approaches for\u000d\u000a      the quantification of the\u000d\u000a      economic effects of the European milk quota scheme. It suggested that all\u000d\u000a      of these approaches\u000d\u000a      have merit, and one of these six approaches was the method presented by\u000d\u000a      Colman et al in [C][8].\u000d\u000a    Secondly, in 2011, DGARD commissioned a further re-evaluation of the milk\u000d\u000a      quota system by LEI\u000d\u000a      (Netherlands). This report identifies nine key objectives of EU policy\u000d\u000a      towards milk, one of which is\u000d\u000a      the structural evolution of the milk sector, again placing the insights\u000d\u000a      from [C] at the heart of the\u000d\u000a      narrative, in order to argue for the negative impact of milk quotas on the\u000d\u000a      structural evolution of the\u000d\u000a      dairy sector. On 14th March 2012 EU Regulation 261\/2012\u000d\u000a      (amending EC reg. No. 1234\/2007), put\u000d\u000a      in place the pathway for a `soft landing', with the update to the\u000d\u000a      `Evolution of the Market Situation...'\u000d\u000a      report subsequently noting:\u000d\u000a    Both the evolution of milk production versus milk quotas, and the\u000d\u000a        downward trend in quota\u000d\u000a        prices show that \"soft landing\" is on track. In the vast majority of\u000d\u000a        Member States, quotas are\u000d\u000a        no longer relevant to limiting production and the quota price has\u000d\u000a        already reached zero or is\u000d\u000a        approaching it. Against this analysis, the Commission is of the view\u000d\u000a        that no change is\u000d\u000a        required in the existing framework, which has been providing certainty\u000d\u000a        to milk producers\u000d\u000a        since 2008 and is proving its efficiency in securing a smooth\u000d\u000a        phasing-out towards a quota\u000d\u000a        free environment. [9]\u000d\u000a    Finally, the issue of supply controls remains salient, with the director\u000d\u000a      general of Dairy UK recently\u000d\u000a      arguing &#8212; in response to European Parliament proposals to retain a `strong\u000d\u000a      element of supply\u000d\u000a      management' after the 2015 quota abolition &#8212; that \"the removal of milk\u000d\u000a        quotas presented the\u000d\u000a        European dairy industry with `enormous opportunities for growth that\u000d\u000a        will provide a strong\u000d\u000a        foundation for the future...

In 2008,\u000d\u000a      the EU Agriculture Commissioner announced the intention not to renew the\u000d\u000a      quota system beyond\u000d\u000a      2015. Nevertheless, there continues to be considerable debate within the\u000d\u000a      EU about whether or not\u000d\u000a      the quota system should be renewed, and if it is not to be renewed then\u000d\u000a      whether to eliminate the\u000d\u000a      quota with a soft or hard landing.\u000d\u000a    Research: In 1997, Colman (alongside Burton, Rigby and Franks)\u000d\u000a      undertook a study for the\u000d\u000a      Ministry\u000d\u000a        of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) that highlighted the very\u000d\u000a      high costs the quota\u000d\u000a      regime imposed upon UK dairy farmers [E]. This initial research leads to\u000d\u000a      the conclusion that it\u000d\u000a      would be in the UK's interest to abolish the scheme. This analysis both\u000d\u000a      informed and was extended\u000d\u000a      in two journal articles [C][D]. A key finding of this work concerned\u000d\u000a        the first estimates of the\u000d\u000a        very high costs more efficient producers &#8212; those wishing to expand\u000d\u000a        production or newly\u000d\u000a        enter production &#8212; had to pay to lease or buy additional quota. It\u000d\u000a      was estimated that the cost\u000d\u000a      in 1997\/8 was equivalent to 12.5% of total sales revenue, much of which\u000d\u000a      was being paid to `sofa\u000d\u000a      farmers' who had quit milk production. These retired producers had not had\u000d\u000a      to buy quotas initially,\u000d\u000a      it was a capital right conferred for free by policy makers, but one that\u000d\u000a      could be used to create an\u000d\u000a      annual rental or capital sum at the cost of continuing producers. Ultimately,\u000d\u000a        these findings\u000d\u000a        demonstrated that the extant quota system was placing severe\u000d\u000a        restrictions on the\u000d\u000a        development of the dairy industry in the UK, with research outputs\u000d\u000a        strongly arguing that\u000d\u000a        milk quotas should be abolished.\u000d\u000a    On the basis of the research in [E] and an earlier version of [D], the\u000d\u000a      Department of Environment,\u000d\u000a      Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) commissioned a report on the potential\u000d\u000a      costs and benefits of\u000d\u000a      phasing out the milk quota system in the EU [B]. Colman was both the\u000d\u000a      coordinator and the editor of\u000d\u000a      this study, and an author or co-author on four of the nine chapters. Using\u000d\u000a      the models developed in\u000d\u000a      [C], this report demonstrated the economic benefits of milk quota\u000d\u000a      elimination. Synthesising the\u000d\u000a      analysis in the report, Colman (and Harvey) concluded that the total\u000d\u000a      annual benefit to the EU of\u000d\u000a      eliminating the milk quota system is &#8364;2.27 billion per year [Ch.9 in B]. A\u000d\u000a      further important\u000d\u000a      conclusion was that farmers (alongside the rest of the dairy product\u000d\u000a      processing and marketing\u000d\u000a      chain) were unnecessarily restricted by the milk quota system, reducing\u000d\u000a      the rate at which they are\u000d\u000a      innovating, adapting and expanding into new markets to meet new demands\u000d\u000a      [B]. Both these\u000d\u000a      findings confirmed that the economic arguments for quota elimination\u000d\u000a      established in [C] and [D] for\u000d\u000a      the UK applied also to the EU. These findings were subsequently revisited\u000d\u000a      and confirmed in [A].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28288","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The last decade has seen a rapid expansion of research in behavioural\u000a      economics and related fields. This has been accompanied by considerable\u000a      interest in those findings from potential research users. While a small\u000a      subset of ideas emerging from the programme of behavioural economics has\u000a      featured prominently in public debate (e.g. the use of `nudges' as policy\u000a      tools) there has been considerable uncertainty about how the wider body of\u000a      research findings can be translated to field application, and how the\u000a      findings and methods of behavioural economics can reliably inform\u000a      policy.

In that talk, Starmer\u000a      drew out the importance of message framing for promoting behaviour change\u000a      and in particular CeDEx research results showing the differential\u000a      impact of framing incentives as penalties (versus positive inducements).\u000a      In March 2011, OFWAT (water services regulatory authority in the\u000a      UK) published a report on sustainable water use [A] which draws directly\u000a      on ideas discussed at the January meeting: As evidence, the Head of\u000a        Ofwat's Supply and Demand Balance, wrote to Starmer noting\u000a      how his input had fed into their report and:\u000a    \"helped to stimulate a productive debate about the role of behavioural\u000a      economics in encouraging consumers to use water wisely\".\u000a    &#8226; Advisory roles\u000a    Members of CeDEx also regularly provide advice to government\u000a      departments and regulators in the process of commissioning behavioural\u000a      research. For example, drawing on the findings of his research into\u000a      experimental methodology reported in [1], Starmer provided advice\u000a      to OFCOM (UK's regulator and competition authority for the\u000a      communications industries) in the run up to their tendering process\u000a      commissioning experimental research to investigate the behavioural\u000a      influence (on phone users) of transparency of call pricing [B].

Starmer (in collaboration with Professor Loomes\u000a      &#8212; U.

Following this workshop, experimental approaches have been\u000a      trialled extensively across various government departments including those\u000a      participating in the workshop. For example, HMRC has successfully\u000a      used experimental trials to assess the effect of `social' message framing\u000a      in promoting tax recovery (this was reported by members of the Cabinet\u000a        Office Behavioural Insight Team at a workshop (Oct. 2012) on use of\u000a      experimental methods in government: www.bristol.ac.uk\/cmpo\/events\/2012\/policy\/;\u000a      Starmer was a participant). For further evidence, see [E] below.\u000a    &#8226; Direct commissioned research\u000a    Members of the CeDEx team have provided academic leads on\u000a      projects for government departments. For example, Starmer provided\u000a      scientific lead to a DEFRA project concerned with how aspects of\u000a      risk and time preference (loss aversion and discounting) influence\u000a      decisions related to the purchase and use of energy saving products.\u000a      Starmer co-authored a report on this subject for DEFRA (see [D]\u000a      below]) and has spoken at workshops organised by DEFRA to\u000a      disseminate the research. One motivation for the DEFRA project was\u000a      to assess the role of non-standard aspects of preferences (`extreme'\u000a      discounting and loss aversion) and in particular whether these factors\u000a      explained low uptake of a new generation of high-end efficiency products\u000a      (e.g. A+ and A++ refrigerators). Based on preference models ([2] above)\u000a      the CeDEx team were able to demonstrate that these factors\u000a      probably had low impact in the (then current) market place.\u000a    The work highlighted other likely important causal mechanisms including\u000a      social peer effects highlighted by our research. These factors had not\u000a      been considered as primary issues by DEFRA in commissioning the\u000a      research, but these issues were brought to the fore by the work and\u000a      feature prominently in the published DEFRA report [D]. In addition\u000a      the report contained recommendations on a set of potential interventions\u000a      (informed by consideration of our research on the framing of incentives\u000a      and the impact of loss aversion (as discussed in Section 2 above)\u000a      including: changing product labelling (to promote energy efficient\u000a      choices); presentation of cost information (to highlight potential energy\u000a      savings). The work and recommendations are summarised in the DEFRA\u000a        report \"Behavioural Economics and Energy Using Products\" and it is\u000a      cited by various other organisations (see for example OFWAT [A]).\u000a      A more recent report by DEFRA [I] highlights the importance of\u000a      insights from behavioural economics for a wider range of policy issues,\u000a      and specifically refers to the earlier work by CeDEx (reported in\u000a      D).\u000a    &#8226; Contribution to public debate\u000a    CeDEx researchers have stimulated and contributed actively to\u000a      public debate via non-technical summaries of their work in high profile\u000a      general science outlets (e.g. Science and Nature,\u000a      see [F] below) and publications aimed at the business community (see [G]\u000a      below for illustrations).

Beyond contributions to the\u000a      basic science, a major theme in the CeDEx group's research has\u000a      been to (iv) develop understanding of the relevance of behavioural\u000a      economics for the formulation of public policy. In this case study we\u000a      illustrate how specific elements of our research in relation to themes\u000a      (i)-(iii) have fed into (iv) and thereby generated the various forms of\u000a      impact identified in Section 4 of this document.\u000a    &#8226; Research insights and findings\u000a    In relation to topic (i), members of the CeDEx group have been\u000a      leading figures in the development, testing and evaluation of experimental\u000a      methods in economics. Robin Cubitt and Chris Starmer along\u000a      with collaborators elsewhere, as part of a project funded by the\u000a      Leverhulme Trust, undertook a major methodological assessment of the scope\u000a      and reliability of experimental research in economics (Sept 2002 - August\u000a      2005, Leverhulme Trust, Award Number F\/00 204\/K). That assessment [1] is\u000a      the first systematic appraisal of experimental economics' research\u000a      methods. Our knowledge of how and where experiments can be successfully\u000a      used, developed through this research, has supported us in our roles of\u000a      advising government departments and regulators in the use of experimental\u000a      method.\u000a    In relation to topic (ii) we have made significant contributions to\u000a      understanding individual behaviour, particularly aspects of risk and time\u000a      preferences. For example, CeDEx researchers have developed and\u000a      tested new models of risky choice which provide a unifying account of a\u000a      range of well-documented `anomalies' relative to standard theory. In\u000a      particular, CeDEx researchers have been influential in modelling\u000a      and measuring the impact of loss aversion [2]. While much of the\u000a      supporting evidence in this field has flowed from experimental evidence, a\u000a      related strand of our research has examined how far aspects of\u000a      non-standard preferences, which have been mainly identified and measured\u000a      in laboratory research, translate outside the lab to field behaviour.\u000a    In that context, CeDEx research [3] has shown how a target field\u000a      behaviour (in this case, paying a bill by a target date) can be promoted\u000a      more effectively through the use of incentives framed as `penalties' (for\u000a      late payment) versus `discounts' (for early payments). This and other work\u000a      under topic (ii) has flowed directly into the impacts identified.\u000a    CeDEx researchers have made world-leading contributions to the\u000a      study of `social preferences', human cooperation and organisational\u000a      behaviour. For example, the group is known internationally for path\u000a      breaking work on voluntary cooperation in the presence of free rider\u000a      incentives and, in particular, the crucial role played by `punishment'\u000a      [4,5]; the group is also known for developing important insights into the\u000a      organisational impacts of incentives, leadership, social norms and social\u000a      comparisons [6,7].

This research was exploited and applied when Bridges,\u000a      Disney and Gathergood were commissioned by BIS to\u000a      undertake a research project into the measurement and determinants of\u000a      over-indebtedness. This project was commissioned to fulfil the\u000a      Department's statutory responsibility to measure over-indebtedness and,\u000a      subsequently, in research to calibrate the FSA money advice levy\u000a      on the consumer credit sector to fund money advice.\u000a    The resulting report [A] was published by BIS in September 2008\u000a      as the first over-indebtedness monitoring report in a series published by\u000a      the Department. The main types of impacts of this work are in the form of\u000a      subjecting public policy to scrutiny leading to policy improvements. This\u000a      report scrutinised the existing definitions of `over-indebted' and\u000a      analysed the causes of household over- indebtedness at the individual\u000a      level. It demonstrated that many of the existing working definitions of\u000a      over-indebtedness utilised by government agencies tended to overstate the\u000a      true proportion of individuals facing critical debt pressures.\u000a    As a consequence of this research, the definition of over-indebtedness\u000a      utilised by BIS to target policy initiatives was revised in line\u000a      with the report's recommendations (see [D]). This revised definition has\u000a      been used by the Money Advice Service (MAS) (the new governmental\u000a      body with responsibility for over-indebtedness policy from 2012) in its\u000a      work to calibrate a new money advice levy on financial services (detailed\u000a      in [D]). The calibration of the levy involves a calculation of the total\u000a      value of debt held by over-indebted consumers which in turn is used to\u000a      calculate the required level of funding for free-to-client money advice\u000a      agencies, paid for by a levy on providers of credit (weighted by their\u000a      share in total over-indebtedness). Hence the definition of\u000a      over-indebtedness provided by the research for BIS is a key\u000a      element the calculation of this levy.\u000a    Following this, Disney and Gathergood were commissioned\u000a      to undertake a second study into the potential for using individual-level\u000a      data held by the consumer counselling sector as an alternative and\u000a      potentially higher quality data source to better understand the causes of\u000a      over-indebtedness at the individual level. This project led to a second\u000a      published report by BIS [B] in July 2009. Impacts resulting from\u000a      this activity have centred upon formulating policy and professional\u000a      practice. This research contributed to the Department's decision to fund a\u000a      new client database at Citizen's Advice and also to report trends\u000a      in money advice client volumes and characteristics to the Bank of\u000a        England. More generally, findings from [1] were drawn upon by the Bank\u000a        of England in its understanding of the cause of consumer\u000a      indebtedness [E] and disseminated to parliament via the quarterly ESRC\u000a        Parliamentary Briefing series [F]. Confirmation and details of the\u000a      impact can be provided by contacting [K].\u000a    &#8226; Shaping Policy Through Expert Testimony\u000a    Gathergood was nominated by BIS to testify as an expert\u000a      witness before the House of Commons Business Select Committee in\u000a      November 2011. Gathergood testified as an expert academic\u000a      economist alongside an expert academic lawyer, representatives from the\u000a      consumer credit industry and representatives from the money advice sector.\u000a      He also provided written evidence to the Committee and at the request of\u000a      the Committee produced a short statistical supplement to aid its\u000a      understanding of recent developments in consumer credit and debt in the UK.\u000a    He communicated findings from this body of research, including those in\u000a      [5] and [6] as well as those from [A] and [B]. The principal impact of\u000a      this activity was the influencing and shaping of public policy. Gathergood's\u000a      testimony was drawn upon directly by the Committee in their subsequent Report\u000a        to Government [G], for example, at paragraphs 36, 37 on `payday\u000a      lending' and at 108, 109 on personal insolvency. The government's response\u000a      to the Committee's Report [H] set out a series of recommended\u000a      actions, including specific undertakings on these two issues emphasised by\u000a      Gathergood in his testimony.\u000a    &#8226; Advising and Influencing the Third Sector\u000a    In a series of research reports commissioned by the Money Advice\u000a        Trust (MAT) [C] Gathergood used individual level micro-data\u000a      from YouGov surveys together with data on money advice clients (as in that\u000a      used in [B]) to analyse trends in financial stress and money advice\u000a      seeking behaviour among over-indebted consumers. This research applied the\u000a      methods and measures developed in [1] and [5]. The reports were\u000a      disseminated across the money advice sector. Gathergood has spoken\u000a      and continues to speak regularly at the MAT's Partnership Board\u000a        meetings, which include attendees from across the free-to-client\u000a      money advice sector as well as representatives from high street banks,\u000a      utility companies and local authorities who share a common interest in\u000a      money advice and individual management of credit and debt. The Chief\u000a        Executive of MAT writes:\u000a    \"We have found this research absolutely invaluable, both as a charity\u000a        for our own planning of service delivery (and in sharing it with other\u000a        charities such as Citizens Advice, Stepchange and the relevant Scottish\u000a        and Northern Ireland agencies for similar purposes) and also in working\u000a        with the key Government departments and regulators who I know have also\u000a        found it extremely useful\". [J]\u000a    &#8226; Shaping Monetary Policy Formation\u000a    The underpinning research on housing wealth and consumption identified\u000a      the causal links by which house price movements impact upon household\u000a      indebtedness and consumption and discriminated between channels which are\u000a      not empirically relevant (housing wealth effects) and those which are\u000a      significant (collateral effects). The principal impact of this research\u000a      was its influence on the Bank of England's understanding of the\u000a      collateral role for housing-consumption effects in its Quarterly Model.\u000a    Gathergood served a 3-month secondment with the Bank of England\u000a      in 2008 to directly share and apply the findings of this work with Bank\u000a      economists and to inform monetary policy strategy. During his internship\u000a      he applied the research findings of his postdoctoral research ([3], [4])\u000a      and contributed to a body of work with economists at the Bank (principally\u000a      [L]) which showed that the component of the Quarterly Model which\u000a      parameterised housing collateral effects included a key coefficient which\u000a      was too strong. This was subsequently amended during his internship.\u000a      Gathergood authored a Monetary Policy Note on housing equity withdrawal\u000a      which contributed to the Bank's knowledge base.\u000a    &#8226; Other Impacts\u000a    This work was also featured in the Financial Times ([I]), which\u000a      included extensive coverage of the key findings from [3].

This is a topic of perpetual interest and relevance\u000a      among policymakers, attracting much attention in the news media, including\u000a      recent widespread public debate over housing policy and the high-cost\u000a      `payday loans' lending market. The research was undertaken in the period\u000a      2002 to 2012 in the context of rising household indebtedness, a housing\u000a      market boom and then bust, a persistent increase in the rate of personal\u000a      insolvency and a rapidly evolving government policy agenda. Research was\u000a      facilitated by core funding from Experian Scorex Plc to found the\u000a      Experian Centre for Economic Modelling in the School of Economics\u000a      [7] and was supplemented by additional funded research projects with the Economic\u000a        and Social Research Council (ESRC) and BIS [8], [9].\u000a    &#8226; Research Insight or Findings\u000a    One strand of the research was the first to use micro-data to measure and\u000a      analyse the determinants of household over-indebtedness on consumer credit\u000a      and its implications for household welfare ([1], [2], [6]). The research,\u000a      the first of its type in the UK, developed methods to show that\u000a      over-indebtedness is best measured by objective indicators of financial\u000a      distress (arrears, delinquency, default) rather than by subjective,\u000a      self-reported measures which tend to be unreliable.\u000a    The research tested various measures of over-indebtedness, defined by\u000a    characteristics such as credit portfolio size, ratios of debt-to-income,\u000a    magnitude and duration of delinquency on one or more credit items and\u000a    similar measures. It showed over-indebtedness is concentrated and persistent\u000a    among certain groups of low-income households, who participate in subprime\u000a    consumer credit markets and that poor financial literacy and lack of\u000a    self-control are strong drivers of over- indebtedness among these\u000a    households. Subsequent research [5] showed that the prevalence of credit\u000a    constraints has increased markedly during the recent recession by both\u000a    objective and subjective measures, but unevenly across different household\u000a    types.\u000a    A second strand of the research considers the impact of movements in\u000a      housing wealth on household indebtedness and consumption [3], [4]. This\u000a      research used micro-data to show explicitly, for the first time, that the\u000a      correlation between house prices and consumption spending is for the most\u000a      part explained by financial expectations which drive both housing and\u000a      consumer demand. This research also showed, however, that for a subset of\u000a      households housing collateral effects act as a causal and strong driver of\u000a      debt accumulation and consumption smoothing both in the United Kingdom\u000a      and the United States.\u000a    &#8226; Key Researchers\u000a    Dr Sarah Bridges (Research Fellow and then Lecturer, University\u000a      of Nottingham 2000 - Present).

Brigden and Mizen (2004),\u000a        Chrystal and Mizen (2005a,b),).\"\u000a    Prior to these studies the Bank of England was uncertain whether\u000a      excess money and credit balances held by non-bank financial corporations\u000a      should be treated like assets and liabilities held by banks (as they are\u000a      in the United States) which are netted out of the official figures, or\u000a      included in the analysis of monetary policy. The Bank now considers these\u000a      data from some of these institutions to be important for output and\u000a      inflation and factors them into its analysis. Prior to this research the MPC\u000a      could have understated growth in money and credit aggregates by ignoring\u000a      all non-bank financial institutions, some of which have an impact on real\u000a      activity and inflation. The Bank produces monthly reports on monetary\u000a      developments in these sectors (see [A] various issues), and discusses them\u000a      in the quarterly Inflation Report. It has cited research on money\u000a      and credit, including the research in this case study, as one of its major\u000a      contributions to understanding monetary transmission in the 50th\u000a      Anniversary edition of the Quarterly Bulletin, [C]. The main\u000a      beneficiary has been the Bank of England, and other central banks\u000a      that they influence.\u000a    The research has had an impact on official monetary aggregates published\u000a      by the Bank of England. The research provided the starting point\u000a      for a review of other financial institutions in the monetary statistics\u000a      taken up by Spencer Dale when he was Head of Division in\u000a        Monetary Assessment and Strategy. The Bank undertook to review its\u000a      monetary statistics [G] and after public consultation adjusted its measure\u000a      of broad money from M4 (deposits held by banks and building societies) to\u000a      M4X (M4 minus holdings of money by certain bank-like entities known as\u000a      intermediate other financial institutions). Since June 2009, the M4X\u000a      statistics have been produced monthly by the Bank. The decision to exclude\u000a      non-bank financial institutions that undertake similar activities to banks\u000a      e.g. bank holding companies, but to include financial institutions that\u000a      serve firms and households (e.g. leasing companies) recognises the\u000a      research that showed some financial institutions have an impact on output\u000a      and inflation. The beneficiaries are all users of monetary aggregates\u000a      produced by the Bank of England in the United Kingdom,\u000a      such as commercial and investment banks, insurance companies and pension\u000a      funds, private non-financial corporations and individuals.\u000a    This work on non-bank financial institutions involved Mizen in an\u000a      `Expert meeting on monetary analysis' in DG-Economics, European\u000a        Central Bank in 2006, which discussed the construction of monetary\u000a      aggregates excluding other financial institutions in Europe, [B].\u000a      It underpins the analysis of the recent weakness of broad money growth,\u000a      [D], and the assessment of quantitative easing in the UK, [E].\u000a    The research also contributes to our understanding of policy and\u000a      contributes to the public policy debate, particularly during times of\u000a      change when new instruments or objectives have been adopted for\u000a      extraordinary times e.g. quantitative easing policies. It is notable that,\u000a      while central banks had relegated information on monetary aggregates\u000a      during the mid-2000s and when inflation targeting appeared to be very\u000a      successful, they refocused on these aggregates with the introduction of\u000a      quantitative easing. At the Bank of England the understanding of\u000a      monetary aggregates and credit have primary importance with the\u000a      introduction of QE in March 2009, as [D], [E] and [F] document.\u000a      The Deputy Governor of the Bank of England wrote\u000a    `\"The financial crisis has reminded economists of the centrality of\u000a        money and banking to macroeconomic conditions. At the Bank of England,\u000a        we drew on Paul Mizen's money models as a guide to gauging the\u000a        prospective impact of the Monetary Policy Committee's quantitative\u000a        easing on spending and asset prices.\"\u000a    One measure of the success of quantitative easing is the impact on bank\u000a      lending to UK businesses, which is reported by the Bank of England\u000a      monthly. The discussion in [H] shows how the measure of money excluding\u000a      certain non-bank financial corporations has an impact on the debate over\u000a      quantitative easing, as does [F]. The Editor of The Sunday\u000a          Times, comments:\u000a    `The research has had a clear impact on the Bank of England, both in\u000a        its modelling and in construction of the monetary aggregates (the new\u000a        M4X measure). It has also informed the work of other central banks...and\u000a        the researchers have been used as experts by these central banks and\u000a        invited to undertake further work.'\u000a    The work on interest rate pass through has helped central banks to\u000a      understand how their policy decisions affect interest rates offered to\u000a      households and firms. This has become a very important issue in\u000a      understanding the monetary transmission mechanism. Mizen was\u000a      invited to the Bundesbank in 2005-6 to explore the effects of\u000a      interest rate pass through in Europe. This then led to an invitation to an\u000a      `Expert meeting on interest rate pass-through', at DG-Economics and\u000a        DG-Statistics, European Central Bank in 2007 to discuss transmission\u000a      of monetary policy http:\/\/www.ecb.int\/events\/conferences\/html\/mir.en.html.\u000a    The Banque de France invited further work on pass-through in the\u000a      major European economies and on individual French banks in particular in\u000a      2011. This work has been published as Banque de France Working Paper\u000a      N 361, and Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, 45, 1377-1417, October\u000a      2013. The findings were used by the Banque de France to establish\u000a      data and modelling protocols, forecasting assessment criteria, and\u000a      informed the European Central Bank through the Expert Group on\u000a        Financial Assumptions (EGFA) from April 2011-June 2013. The senior Banque\u000a        de France official responsible for this research writes:\u000a    `The research on interest pass through was very innovative and\u000a        extremely useful for the monetary policy decision making process: it\u000a        confirmed the importance of future expected interest rates in aggregate\u000a        euroarea data, and then verified this in data for individual French\u000a        commercial banks. It had a great impact on our understanding of this\u000a        aspect of the monetary transmission mechanism in the Banque de France'\u000a    Further work is being undertaken on individual bank pass through using\u000a      panel data in 2013.

In this case study the focus is on CFCM's research on the\u000a      monetary transmission mechanism (MTM). Paul Mizen (then Reader in\u000a      Monetary Economics, University of Nottingham) was recruited as a\u000a      consultant (40% contract) to undertake research at the Bank of England\u000a      between 1997 and 2000 to assist the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)\u000a      in understanding: a) the importance of money and credit for the MTM,\u000a      particularly output and inflation; b) the different impacts of household,\u000a      non- financial firms and non-bank financial firms' money and credit on\u000a      output and inflation; and c) the pass through of interest rate changes to\u000a      households and firms through the banking system.\u000a    Mizen had been approached to join the Monetary Assessment and\u000a      Strategy Division headed by Paul Tucker (subsequently a Deputy\u000a      Governor of the Bank) after having published the book Buffer Stock\u000a        Models and the Demand for Money in 1994 and a number of refereed\u000a      papers on demand for money by UK households and firms. The\u000a      research undertaken subsequently was published in the Bank of England\u000a      working papers numbers 100, 134, 151, 170, and 254, summarised in the Bank\u000a        of England Quarterly Bulletin and also published in peer reviewed\u000a      journals (listed [1] - [6] below).\u000a    &#8226; Research insights and findings\u000a    The studies on money and credit, [1], [3], [4] and [5] show that excess\u000a      money and credit held by households and private non-financial corporations\u000a      in the UK economy interact with each other and feed through to output and\u000a      inflation via the conventional monetary transmission mechanism. The\u000a      majority of excess money and credit is held by the non-bank financial\u000a      sector (insurers, pension funds, securities dealers, leasing companies\u000a      etc), and these balances have an indirect effect on monetary transmission\u000a      through their impact on households and firms. For example, money and\u000a      credit held by financial companies involved in factoring or leasing of\u000a      capital equipment directly influences output and inflation. Paper [2]\u000a      demonstrated that their balances have an impact on firms and household\u000a      spending.\u000a    The MPC is therefore right to be concerned about excess money and\u000a      credit held by these sectors and should be embedded in the Bank's\u000a      forecasting models. The Bank's own research in 2012 built on this sectoral\u000a      information following the work that was done by Mizen to improve\u000a      structural VAR forecasting models under Quantitative Easing (QE).\u000a      However, the non-bank financial sector is diverse, and some institutions\u000a      which are more like banks do not affect output or inflation &#8212; they should\u000a      be netted out. The monetary statistics collected by the Bank have\u000a      since 2009 netted out money held by both banks and the non-bank financial\u000a      sector that are similar to banks.\u000a    The study of interest rate pass through demonstrates that retail interest\u000a      rates set by banks (such as deposit, loan and mortgage rates) could\u000a      deviate from official rates set by the Bank of England in the\u000a      short run. This deviation is driven by expectations about the direction of\u000a      changes to official rates in the future. Paper [6] estimates the long run\u000a      relationships between different retail rates and the official rate using\u000a      individual bank data for the UK.\u000a    The absence of adjustment to retail rates in the short run, following an\u000a      adjustment to official rates, is not a cause for concern, since it may\u000a      reflect expectations by banks that adjustments are temporary, or likely to\u000a      be reversed. This research helped to explain why interest rates set by\u000a      banks do not follow official rates set by central banks at turning points.\u000a      It also answered a concern expressed by journalists and other commentators\u000a      that changes to interest rates were not being passed on to commercial\u000a      banks' mortgage customers, by explaining more accurately how and when\u000a      banks respond to monetary policy changes.\u000a    &#8226; Key researcher\u000a    Paul Mizen, Lecturer (1992-99), Reader (1999-2004) and Professor\u000a      of Monetary Economics (2004-present), University of Nottingham.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28291","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"},{"GeoNamesId":"149590","Name":"Tanzania"},{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"},{"GeoNamesId":"226074","Name":"Uganda"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    \u000a      Dissemination and engagement\u000a    \u000a    This research was directly disseminated through lectures or training\u000a      sessions up to and after 2008 organised by the World Bank\u000a      (Nairobi, 1998; Delhi, 1999 - Milner), UN Economic Commission\u000a        for Africa -UNECA (Addis Ababa, 2004 - Milner), for DFID\u000a      economists (University of Nottingham, 2005- Milner &amp; Morrissey),\u000a      the New Zealand Treasury (Wellington, 2009 - Milner) and\u000a      at a public lecture chaired by the Minister of Trade in Ghana\u000a      (Accra, 2010 - Morrissey). The findings of the EC-PREP study were\u000a      presented by Morrissey at workshops in Kenya, Tanzania\u000a      and Uganda in 2004, which included participants from government\u000a      ministries (trade, planning and transport), local World Bank and EC\u000a      offices. Morrissey also provided a policy brief disseminated\u000a      through EC-PREP to DFID and to EC offices in Brussels and\u000a      overseas. He was interviewed on local radio and TV about trade policy in Ghana\u000a      (2010).\u000a    The findings of the research and their implications for trade\u000a      facilitation and `aid for trade' programmes were indirectly disseminated\u000a      through a number of policy-oriented publications and through papers,\u000a      reports and workshops for the Commonwealth Secretariat, UNCTAD,\u000a      and WIDER, again both before and after 2008.

The research gave rise to an invited theme paper on\u000a      operationalizing aid for trade; presented at a conference (Delhi, 2008) on\u000a      `Partnerships for Development' (with participants from the policy and aid\u000a      communities in south Asia and Africa and sponsored by the Consumer\u000a        Unity &amp; Trust Society (CUTS), Commonwealth Secretariat,\u000a      World Bank and Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce,\u000a      subsequently published in 2009) [A].\u000a    \u000a      Impact\u000a    \u000a    The research demonstrates that trade policy reform in many African\u000a      economies may be necessary, but is unlikely to be sufficient, to support\u000a      export development because other obstacles prevent this, such as poor\u000a      transport infrastructure and poor customs procedures. In order to enhance\u000a      economic development in these countries, trade policy reforms should be\u000a      coupled with complementary infrastructure and related reforms to increase\u000a      the efficiency of transport and other services that affect trade costs.\u000a      These findings have had major impact on international policy formulation,\u000a      including in the 2008-12 period. For example, the research influenced DFID\u000a      in the design of the Trademark Southern Africa trade facilitation\u000a      programme [B]. An independent evaluator of DFID's trade work in Southern\u000a      Africa writes that it has:\u000a    ` clearly influenced and informed the emphasis DFID has placed on\u000a        addressing transport costs and trade facilitation in the type of trade\u000a        policies and interventions implemented through Trademark Southern Africa.'\u000a      [L]\u000a    The research influenced the work of the African Development Bank\u000a        (AfDB), which assists African governments and policy-makers in their\u000a      efforts to achieve sustainable economic development and social progress;\u000a      the African Development Fund providing finance in concessional terms, with\u000a      a recent focus on transport infrastructure. In 2009 AfDB\u000a      commissioned Morrissey, given the research cited in section 3, to\u000a      review the evidence and policy implications on `Trade and Transport Costs'\u000a      as a background paper [C] to its 2010 African Development Report\u000a      [D], having earlier commissioned a paper by him on constraints to African\u000a      exporting that was published in the ADB research working paper series.\u000a    The high level and international nature of the impact of the research on\u000a      the policy community is evidenced by the citing of papers [1], [3] and [4]\u000a      in the World Trade Report, 2013 [E] and Milner's\u000a      publication in the Commonwealth Ministers' Reference Book [F]; a\u000a      central source of information on key aspects of policy issues for\u000a      government ministers in Commonwealth countries, including many developing\u000a      countries in Africa. The Head of the International Trade Division of the Commonwealth\u000a        Secretariat writes:\u000a    `...the Secretariat has greatly benefited from the research\u000a        Commissioned to Professor Chris Milner and Professor Oliver Morrissey;\u000a        commissioned because of their research and expertise on trade and trade\u000a        policies in developing countries (including Commonwealth developing\u000a        countries). Their high-quality analytical work in a range of areas\u000a        comprising intra-Commonwealth trade and cooperation, Aid for Trade,\u000a        impact of the Rise of China and India on Sub-Saharan Africa, and\u000a        promoting trade within the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries have\u000a        hugely informed discussions involving Commonwealth nations in various\u000a        fora including high-level meetings and conferences organised by the\u000a        Commonwealth Secretariat, the World Trade Organisation and UN\u000a        agencies.' [K]\u000a    Direct impact on policy formulation in some African economies themselves\u000a      is evidenced by Milner's direct involvement in the support and\u000a      advice given for the preparation of Uganda's and Kenya's National\u000a        Trade Policies; giving advice on the content and assisting in the\u000a      drafting of these documents, both of which have substantive sections on\u000a      the complementary reforms (including on infrastructure, institutions and\u000a      non-trade policies) to improve the effectiveness of export promotion\u000a      measures [G], [H] -the operative national trade policies, post-2008 and\u000a        up to the present of these two countries. In the case of Uganda,\u000a      Milner had earlier advised on and prepared a zero draft of the\u000a      national trade policy, having engaged with a range of stake holders [I].\u000a      This zero draft specifically included a section on complementary measures\u000a      to reduce trade costs, and the final national policy retains many of these\u000a      elements. In the case of Kenya, Milner was invited to\u000a      comment on early drafts of the national trade policy document both through\u000a      a presentation to a National Trade Policy Workshop (November,\u000a      2008) in Nairobi and through the submission of commentaries [J] to the\u000a      country's National Trade Policy Task Force.\u000a    This body of research by Milner and Morrissey on the\u000a      relative importance of trade policy and other sources international trade\u000a      costs (in particular transport costs) in Africa has therefore\u000a      directly influenced national trade policy design in Kenya and Uganda,\u000a      and has informed the advice given by several national and international\u000a      agencies (specifically AfDB, Commonwealth Secretariat, and\u000a      DFID) to African and other developing about increasing the scope\u000a      for improved trade performance and increasing the effectiveness of trade\u000a      policy reform through enhanced trade facilitation and transport\u000a      infrastructure improvement.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research by the School's Centre for Research on Economic Development\u000a        and International Trade (CREDIT) on the relative importance\u000a      of trade policy and non-trade policy barriers (especially high transport\u000a      costs) in determining international trade costs and export performance in\u000a      Africa has directly influenced the design of the national trade policies\u000a      of Uganda and Kenya.

The assessment given to the World Bank\u000a      in an internal report was that non-trade policy sources of trade costs\u000a      associated with `natural' geographical features (e.g., landlocked,\u000a      distance to export markets) and avoidable features of the poor\u000a      infrastructure, uncompetitive transport sector, inefficient ports and\u000a      custom procedures (in Uganda and transit countries) were likely to\u000a      be important constraints on or sources of implicit taxation of exports.\u000a      Subsequent research within CREDIT, including that supported by ODA\u000a      funding [7], allowed Milner and Oliver Morrissey to explore the\u000a      nature and extent of transport costs in Uganda's international trade with\u000a      more precision and, distinctively, with sector\/industry breakdown.\u000a    \u000a      Research insights and findings\u000a    \u000a    The research outputs [1], [2] listed in section 3 provided an analytical\u000a      framework for capturing the implicit and explicit subsidisation and\u000a      taxation effects of trade policy and non-trade policy sources of trade\u000a      costs, and for measuring the relative incentive effects of both for\u000a      import-substitution and export-oriented production. In [1] the effective\u000a      protection concept is used to summarise the taxing and subsidising effects\u000a      of trade policies and non-trade policy sources of trade costs on\u000a      production for domestic and export markets, and to model and measure the\u000a      relative importance of the alternative sources of trade costs for trade\u000a      regime or anti-export bias. In [2] a general equilibrium (true protection)\u000a      framework is used to summarise the relative (implicit and explicit) taxing\u000a      effects of trade policy and non-trade policy sources of trade costs.\u000a    Outputs [3], [4] report on the application of these frameworks for\u000a      measuring the relative importance of trade policy and other sources of\u000a      trade costs for trade regime bias and export performance in Uganda\u000a      and Malawi respectively. Subsequently, Morrissey secured\u000a      further funding [8] to extend and update the estimates of transport costs,\u000a      distinguishing land, sea and air transport and extending the country\u000a      coverage to Kenya and Tanzania. The output of this\u000a      research is reported in [5]. The insights from this research were\u000a      incorporated into a broader study of EU- ACP Economic Partnership\u000a        Agreements (EPAs) funded under FP6 of the EU and by DG Trade\u000a      (European Commission). The need for trade facilitation\u000a      measures and reducing transport and other trade costs in African and other\u000a      developing countries in the face of wider trade policy developments\u000a      eroding the preferential tariff treatment of these countries' in their\u000a      export markets was also specifically addressed in output [6].\u000a    The research overall demonstrated the potential for and existence of\u000a      larger anti-export bias to be induced by non-trade policy sources of trade\u000a      costs than by trade policy, and potentially larger scope therefore for\u000a      export growth from the lowering of non-trade policy barriers than of trade\u000a      policy barriers. It also highlighted the importance of including\u000a      complementary measures to reduce trade costs and facilitate trade in the\u000a      design of national, bilateral and regional trade policies. Other research\u000a      has contributed to policy interest in this issue, but it generally\u000a      post-dates the initial research cited here. The research below is also\u000a      distinctive in investigating the relative importance of trade policy and\u000a      non-trade policy sources of trade costs at a disaggregated\u000a      (industry\/sector) level and for the Africa region.\u000a    \u000a      Key researchers\u000a    \u000a    Chris Milner, Professor of International Economics, University of\u000a      Nottingham since 1995.

The research conducted\u000d\u000a      within [D] and\u000d\u000a      published as academic outputs in [5] and [6] was used as evidence to\u000d\u000a      underpin the launch of a\u000d\u000a      new trade promotion scheme called `Gateways to Global Growth' (GGG)\u000d\u000a      which was introduced\u000d\u000a      at the end of 2009. This scheme is targeted at firms with between 2-10\u000d\u000a      years of previous export\u000d\u000a      experience, and was grounded on evidence that these firms reported more\u000d\u000a      barriers to exporting\u000d\u000a      (see [4]). This research provided evidence that these barriers in fact\u000d\u000a      occurred at the level of the\u000d\u000a      export transaction, and therefore could be present even for firms that had\u000d\u000a      previously exported to\u000d\u000a      the same market (and were trying to identify new customers) or were\u000d\u000a      expanding into new markets.\u000d\u000a    Evidence for a link between the research and motivation to recommend this\u000d\u000a      new service can be\u000d\u000a      found in (UKTI Departmental Report and Resource Accounts 2008-09: http:\/\/www.official-documents.gov.uk\/document\/hc0809\/hc04\/0482\/0482.pdf)\u000d\u000a      which states that:\u000d\u000a    \"In the previous year UKTI commissioned research into the barriers\u000d\u000a        faced by more\u000d\u000a        experienced exporters and as a result of the findings in 2008-09, it\u000d\u000a        launched a new\u000d\u000a        package of support called Gateway to Global Growth.\"\u000d\u000a    It can also be found from correspondence with the Head of the Economics\u000d\u000a      and Evaluation team at\u000d\u000a      UKTI when GGG won an award from the Trade Promotion\u000d\u000a        Organisation, a joint agency of the\u000d\u000a      United Nations and the World Trade Organisation.

This has meant\u000d\u000a      that research has\u000d\u000a      become more closely aligned with export promotion policy within the UK,\u000d\u000a      which is also directed at\u000d\u000a      firms, and has provided an important evidence base against which policy\u000d\u000a      advice can be drawn.

The\u000d\u000a      research published as [2] used micro data to understand how the financial\u000d\u000a      health of firms might\u000d\u000a      affect export decisions, or whether financial health was actually improved\u000d\u000a      by exporting. This was\u000d\u000a      amongst the first papers to consider this question and the first to use UK\u000d\u000a      data. It found no evidence\u000d\u000a      that firms enjoying better ex-ante financial health are more\u000d\u000a      likely to start exporting, and strong\u000d\u000a      evidence that participation in export markets improves financial health.\u000d\u000a      The research in [6]\u000d\u000a      considers the issue of barriers to exporting more broadly.\u000d\u000a    Using survey data provided by UKTI (that included information on\u000d\u000a      the perceptions of barriers to\u000d\u000a      exporting by both existing exporters and firms that failed to start\u000d\u000a      exporting) one conclusion reached\u000d\u000a      was that experienced exporters with between 2-10 years of prior export\u000d\u000a      experience had more\u000d\u000a      difficulties in exporting than new exporters. It also identified important\u000d\u000a      differences between firms\u000d\u000a      that successfully started to export and those that did not, differences\u000d\u000a      relating to firms' ability to deal\u000d\u000a      with language barriers and to identify customers.\u000d\u000a    A second strand of research was on the benefits to export market entry\u000d\u000a      for firm performance. The\u000d\u000a      research in [1] was the first to test for the effects of export market\u000d\u000a      entry for the UK, using a\u000d\u000a      methodology that was then replicated by others (and summarised in [3]).\u000d\u000a      This research found that\u000d\u000a      the best firms self-select into becoming exporters, in that they are more\u000d\u000a      productive before they\u000d\u000a      enter export markets and entry also makes them more productive.

We focus on Wadsworth's\u000a      academic publication Manacorda, Manning and Wadsworth (2012) (publication\u000a      1). The first version of this publication was produced as a discussion\u000a      paper in 2006 (publication 2) with the research evolving and carrying on\u000a      in the following years until the publication of the final article.\u000a    By the mid-2000s, 12% of the working age population had been born\u000a      overseas, up from the 7.5% share observed at the end of the last recession\u000a      in 1993. The rising level of immigration has stimulated renewed interest\u000a      among policy makers and academic researchers concerned with the effects of\u000a      immigration, with the impact of immigration on labour market outcomes\u000a      being a particularly controversial issue. The research (publications 1\u000a      &amp; 2) addressed a key puzzle in the analysis of the UK Labour market,\u000a      which was that despite the large increase in immigration into the UK in\u000a      recent decades, which generated an increase in the labour supply and so\u000a      potentially more competition for jobs, the data seemed to show only a\u000a      small effect of immigration on the wages of the native labour force.\u000a    The research proposed a new methodology: a skill-cell correlation\u000a      approach, which allowed for the possibility of imperfect substitution\u000a      between native born labour and foreign born labour, so that,\u000a      theoretically, migrants could increase as well as decrease the wage rate\u000a      of native born workers and have differential effects on native born\u000a      workers dependent on their skill levels.\u000a    This was a much more flexible approach than had been used hitherto and\u000a      was able to provide new insights into the empirical analysis of the\u000a      effects of immigration on the labour market. The research was able to\u000a      decompose the average wage effects of immigration into differing effects\u000a      across different skill levels, and showed how immigration can affect the\u000a      wage structure even when the average wage does not change a great deal.\u000a    The key findings of the research are that (a) on average overall\u000a      immigrants are not perfect substitutes for native-born labour meaning that\u000a      it is possible for increased immigration not to affect the wages and\u000a      employment of native born labour, essentially meaning that migrant and\u000a      native labour do not necessarily compete for the same jobs. However this\u000a      overall finding obscures the fact that (b) less skilled immigrants are\u000a      much closer substitutes for unskilled natives than skilled immigrants are\u000a      for skilled natives. This means that any adverse labour market effects of\u000a      rising immigration are likely to be found among the less skilled\u000a      native-born labour force.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"30196","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1149361","Name":"Afghanistan"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This research had a direct impact on the development of resources to\u000d\u000a        enhance professional practice and an influence on professional\u000d\u000a        standards guidelines or training for NATO forces.

He has\u000d\u000a      published his research in outlets such as Science, Nature, PLOS\u000d\u000a        Medicine, The New England Journal of Medicine and an award-winning\u000d\u000a      article in the Journal of Peace Research.\u000d\u000a    The DWI concept is an original idea of Professor Spagat and Dr Madelyn\u000d\u000a      Hicks, who at the time was at King's College. The initial research was\u000d\u000a      published in 2008 as a lead paper with two accompanying editorials in PLOS\u000a        Medicine, a peer-reviewed journal with an impact factor of 15.2\u000d\u000a      (publication 1).\u000d\u000a    The DWI builds upon evidence-based methods in economics for classifying\u000d\u000a      degrees of compliance. It is a method to document, analyse and potentially\u000d\u000a      prevent the harmful effects of armed conflicts on populations, such as\u000d\u000a      civilian deaths. International humanitarian laws define what a \"dirty\"\u000d\u000a      outcome is (e.g., the disproportionate killing of civilians relative to\u000d\u000a      military objectives). The DWI explicitly links such \"dirty\" outcomes to\u000d\u000a      expose rates of combat outcomes from different weapons or combatant\u000d\u000a      groups. The DWI is a ratio and is calculated as: (number of \"dirty\"\u000d\u000a      cases\/total number of cases) x 100. Hicks and Spagat give several examples\u000d\u000a      of DWIs calculated for actual armed conflicts, such as a DWI measuring the\u000d\u000a      proportion of civilian deaths in the Colombian civil conflict from\u000d\u000a      1988-2005. Hicks and Spagat also have comparable indices from other\u000d\u000a      conflicts including Northern Ireland, Chechnya and the Israeli-Palestinian\u000d\u000a      conflict, and discuss the Vietnam War and World War II in DWI terms. The\u000d\u000a      findings suggest that certain combatant groups are inclined towards\u000d\u000a      dirtier outcomes.\u000d\u000a    In early 2009 Lieutenant Colonel Cameron attended a DWI presentation at\u000d\u000a      the London School of Tropical Medicine and approached Dr. Hicks, proposing\u000d\u000a      joint work that could be applicable to minimizing civilian casualties in\u000d\u000a      future military and humanitarian operations. This connection led\u000d\u000a      immediately to the CBDAR paper (publication 2), which progressed\u000d\u000a      collaborative data collection with the UN and humanitarian organisations.\u000d\u000a      Cameron then applied the CBDAR ideas in Afghanistan between October 2009\u000d\u000a      and March 2010 to reduce civilian casualties. He describes this success\u000d\u000a      story in a 2010 podcast and in an officially approved public statement\u000d\u000a      (Section 5).\u000d\u000a    A related stream of underpinning research (references 3, 4 and 5) applied\u000d\u000a      DWI ideas to a database of 92,614 Iraqi civilian direct deaths from armed\u000d\u000a      violence occurring from March 20, 2003 through March 19, 2008. This work\u000d\u000a      illuminated the impact on civilians of a wide range of weapons as used by\u000d\u000a      different perpetrators there. For example, a Woman and Child DWI suggested\u000d\u000a      that the most indiscriminate effects on women and children were from\u000d\u000a      unknown perpetrators using mortar fire (DWI=79), non-suicide vehicle bombs\u000d\u000a      (DWI=54) and from Coalition air attacks (DWI=69). Coalition forces had\u000d\u000a      higher Woman and Child DWIs than Anti-coalition forces. This DWI analysis\u000d\u000a      for Iraq is similar to the analytical side of the CBDAR-based joint work\u000d\u000a      that was implemented by NATO, the British military and humanitarian\u000d\u000a      organizations in Afghanistan.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"33672","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    THE NATURE OF THE IMPACT IN PAKISTAN: The impact was a major income tax\u000a      reform that was passed by Pakistan's parliament in June 2012 and took\u000a      effect from the fiscal year starting in July 2012. The reform followed the\u000a      key policy implications of the 2013 paper by Kleven and Waseem. A first\u000a      draft of this paper had had been available since 2011, and its policy\u000a      implications had been described in an International Growth Centre (IGC)\u000a      Policy Brief (2012) circulated immediately prior to the debate about tax\u000a      reform in Pakistan.\u000a    There were two central elements of the tax reform. First, the notched tax\u000a      schedule (featuring discrete jumps in tax liability) was abolished in\u000a      favour of a kinked tax schedule (featuring discrete jumps in marginal tax\u000a      rates): the research had shown that the notched schedule was hugely\u000a      distortionary, while an alternative kinked schedule would be efficient.\u000a      Second, there was a significant reduction in the degree to which\u000a      self-employed individuals and wage earners would be taxed differently: the\u000a      research had shown that the differential tax treatment was responsible for\u000a      inefficient income shifting between the two groups.\u000a    Following the successful impact of the work on personal income taxation,\u000a      a more formal framework has been developed between LSE\/IGC researchers\u000a      (led by Henrik Kleven) and Pakistan's Federal Board of Revenue (FBR),\u000a      which is intended to provide research-based foundations for transforming\u000a      the country's tax system. This framework supports research projects of\u000a      direct interest to Pakistani policy-makers (who provide unprecedented\u000a      access to administrative data and institutional know-how), and includes\u000a      conference calls between LSE researchers and the FBR leadership (including\u000a      the Chairman) to discuss tax design and reforms that can increase revenue,\u000a      efficiency and growth in Pakistan.\u000a    The agreement between LSE researchers and the FBR that underlies this\u000a      framework is described by Best (2013) (Source A). Such close collaboration\u000a      between independent researchers and policy-makers is probably unique. It\u000a      has huge potential for Pakistan and possibly for other developing\u000a      countries.\u000a    LINKS BETWEEN RESEARCH AND IMPACT IN PAKISTAN: The link between research\u000a      and policy impact was unique and direct. First, this was the only existing\u000a      study of the distortionary effects of the Pakistan's tax system, so there\u000a      was no other source of research-based information to which policy-makers\u000a      could turn when considering reform.\u000a    Second, the FBR policy-makers who were given the task of proposing a new\u000a      income tax structure were well aware of the study. They had provided the\u000a      unique dataset on which the study is based, and one of the authors &#8212;\u000a      Mazhar Waseem, a senior official at FBR on leave to pursue his PhD at LSE\u000a      &#8212; had travelled to Pakistan on several occasions to discuss the research\u000a      findings with his colleagues, including the Tax Policy Secretary.\u000a      Furthermore, at a pivotal meeting of the Economic Advisory Council to the\u000a      Prime Minister of Pakistan, where it was decided that the FBR should look\u000a      into a reform of the income tax structure, Kleven and Waseem's paper was\u000a      explicitly discussed and formed part of the decision to pursue reform.\u000a      Testimony by Ijaz Nabi (2013), a member of the Economic Advisory Council,\u000a      describes these events in detail (B).\u000a    Third, the reform that was passed and implemented by the parliament\u000a      follows Kleven and Waseem's policy recommendations very closely. This\u000a      process is described in the IGC Policy Brief (2012), the IGC Annual Report\u000a      (2011-12) and the IGC Newsletter (2012), which provide greater detail on\u000a      the policy recommendations, how those recommendations affected tax reform\u000a      deliberations within the FBR, and the ultimate policy impact (C-E)).\u000a    THE NATURE OF THE IMPACT IN DENMARK: As in Pakistan, the Danish impacts\u000a      consist of changes to tax policy. The two studies led to two different\u000a      policy changes, both introduced as part of a major income tax reform in\u000a      Denmark passed in parliament in 2009 and implemented in 2010. The first\u000a      change was the abolition of a particular income tax (the so-called `middle\u000a      tax') that was based on family income rather than individual income. This\u000a      implied that the income tax system became fully individual-based, while\u000a      means-tested transfers remained fully family-based, creating a\u000a      redistributive system featuring negative jointness. This reform\u000a      corresponds exactly to the policy conclusion in the 2009 paper by Kleven\u000a      et al.\u000a    The second change was an improvement of tax enforcement by expanding\u000a      third-party information reporting. This included the introduction of\u000a      third-party reporting on capital gains by requiring financial institutions\u000a      to report the sales prices of financial assets to tax authorities. It also\u000a      included an expansion of third-party reporting on perquisites. These\u000a      changes were precisely in line with the recommendations in the 2011 paper\u000a      by Kleven et al., which was based on an experiment conducted with the\u000a      Danish tax authorities in 2007 and 2008. A first draft of this paper had\u000a      been available since late 2008, prior to political decisions about tax\u000a      reform.\u000a    LINKS BETWEEN RESEARCH AND IMPACT IN DENMARK: The links between research\u000a      and policy reform are again very direct. The design of the 2010 tax reform\u000a      was based on the recommendations of a government-appointed Tax Commission\u000a      (Skattekommissionen), which consisted of 10 local tax experts and included\u000a      one of the researchers (Claus Kreiner) on the Danish projects. Both policy\u000a      changes originate directly from the official reform proposals of the Tax\u000a      Commission (Skattekommissionen, 2009) (F).\u000a    In particular, the Skattekommissionen recommended the change in the tax\u000a      treatment of married couples that was ultimately passed in parliament,\u000a      citing the findings of Kleven et al. (2009) as the key economic\u000a      justification. This was the only academic paper cited in the context of\u000a      the policy change and one of the only academic studies cited in the entire\u000a      report.\u000a    The Skattekommissionen also recommended the expansions of third-party\u000a      reporting that were ultimately implemented. These recommendations followed\u000a      the policy conclusions of Kleven et al. (2011, first draft 2008) extremely\u000a      closely. Since this is the only existing study that provides direct\u000a      evidence on the desirability of third-party reporting for tax compliance,\u000a      it represented the only research-based source of knowledge that could\u000a      inform those policy changes.\u000a    WHY DOES THE IMPACT MATTER? All of the policy impacts of this research\u000a      encourage desirable economic behaviour (including increased hours worked,\u000a      increased labour force participation and improved tax compliance), all of\u000a      which are beneficial for both government revenue and economic efficiency.\u000a      The impact is perhaps most impressive in the case of Pakistan, a country\u000a      rife with inefficiencies and with severe difficulties in collecting tax\u000a      revenue for the provision of public goods &#8212; such as education, health and\u000a      infrastructure &#8212; that are vital to economic growth. The income tax reform\u000a      that has been implemented and future policy changes that may be\u000a      implemented as a result of the unique collaboration between LSE\u000a      researchers and Pakistani policy-makers have the potential to make a\u000a      significant positive impact on economic growth in the country.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research at LSE by Henrik Kleven and colleagues has significantly\u000a      improved the design of tax policy and tax enforcement in countries as\u000a      different as Pakistan and Denmark.

Tax liability was calculated as a proportional tax rate\u000a      multiplied by taxable income, with different tax rates for different\u000a      income brackets. This meant that as income crossed a bracket threshold, a\u000a      higher tax rate would apply to an individual's entire income, not just the\u000a      portion above the threshold, resulting in a large jump in tax liability.\u000a      It contrasts with systems featuring discrete jumps in the marginal tax\u000a      rate &#8212; so-called `kinks' &#8212; such as those in the UK and other developed\u000a      countries. The research on Pakistan provides a theoretical and empirical\u000a      analysis of notches (1).\u000a    Two findings were particularly central to the impact. First, the\u000a      responses of earnings to tax notches were extremely large &#8212; up to 10-15%\u000a      of earnings in the long run &#8212; and the implied efficiency loss from those\u000a      responses was therefore also large. Second, using notches to estimate the\u000a      underlying structural parameters that govern behavioural responses to\u000a      alternative tax structures, the study showed that tax schedules without\u000a      notches would be associated with relatively small adverse effects on\u000a      behaviour and efficiency. These two findings together demonstrated that\u000a      Pakistan's notched schedule worked badly and that a more standard kinked\u000a      schedule would work better.\u000a    DENMARK: The Danish impacts were based on two separate projects. The\u000a      first (2) analysed the optimal tax-transfer design for married couples.\u000a      Because of technical problems, previous research had made relatively\u000a      little progress on this question. This study resolved those difficulties\u000a      and showed that redistributive systems for families should feature\u000a      `negative jointness' &#8212; a situation in which the effective income tax rate\u000a      (including the impact of both taxes and transfers) on a married individual\u000a      is declining in the income of the spouse. In other words, someone with a\u000a      high-income spouse should face a lower tax rate than someone with a\u000a      low-income spouse. The paper also showed that negative jointness could be\u000a      approximated by combining means-tested transfers based on family income\u000a      with income taxes based on individual incomes &#8212; as in the UK system. Such\u000a      a system strikes the best balance between equity goals (redistribution\u000a      across families) and efficiency goals (family labour supply).\u000a    The second project (3) studied the relationship between tax compliance\u000a      and tax enforcement based on a randomised field experiment conducted in\u000a      collaboration with the Danish tax authorities. This study finds that the\u000a      key determinant of income tax evasion is whether the income is subject to\u000a      pure self-reporting or to third-party reporting by employers, banks,\u000a      investment funds, etc. Evasion is always very high under self-reporting\u000a      and always very low under third-party reporting. For example, the paper\u000a      showed that tax evasion was relatively high for capital gains from shares\u000a      because of the absence of third-party reporting on the sales prices of\u000a      shares by financial institutions.\u000a    KEY RESEARCHERS: The Pakistan project was undertaken by Henrik Kleven\u000a      (who has been in the LSE Economics Department since June 2007) and Mazhar\u000a      Waseem (an LSE PhD student, on leave from a senior position at Pakistan's\u000a      tax authority, the Federal Board of Revenue). The two Danish projects were\u000a      undertaken by Kleven with Claus Kreiner (University of Copenhagen),\u000a      Emmanuel Saez (University of California, Berkeley) and, in one of the\u000a      projects, staff researchers in the Danish tax administration.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"33675","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of CEP's Wellbeing Programme has been not only on UK public\u000a      policy (items A-E below), but also international (items F-H) and cultural\u000a      (item I).\u000a    A. Wellbeing as a goal of UK public policy (including\u000a      measurement): Since the beginning of CEP's Wellbeing Programme in 2003,\u000a      there have been regular interactions with the Treasury and Cabinet Office\u000a      on how wellbeing can become a central goal of public policy. Through the\u000a      efforts of Gus O'Donnell (Cabinet Secretary between 2005 and 2011 and a\u000a      member of the CEP Policy Committee) and both Labour and Coalition\u000a      governments, the UK has led the world on this issue.\u000a    In 2008, the ONS sought CEP's help on what questions could be asked in a\u000a      regular national survey of wellbeing and in 2011, adopted the proposals\u000a      (6). Layard and his colleague Paul Dolan sit on the relevant ONS\u000a      committees: the Measuring National Well-being Advisory Forum and the\u000a      Measuring National Well-being Technical Advisory Group.\u000a    B. The Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT)\u000a      programme: The greatest specific result of CEP's work has been the IAPT\u000a      programme announced by Alan Johnson in October 2007. In 2005, CEP\u000a      researchers gave a seminar on this issue in the Cabinet Office and secured\u000a      a pledge in Labour's election manifesto. In 2006, the CEP Mental Health\u000a      Policy Group was formed to work out how this pledge should be implemented.\u000a      The group's Depression Report (which has been downloaded 315,000 times\u000a      since 2006) proposed a specific six-year programme and this has been\u000a      implemented in the way proposed and is increasingly becoming part of the\u000a      mainstream NHS. The programme is now treating 400,000 people a year, with\u000a      45% recovery rates. It has been acclaimed by Nature as `world-beating'.\u000a      Layard is an official adviser to the programme and has been a central\u000a      figure in securing and implementing the programme. The original IAPT\u000a      programme applied only to adults. In 2008, Layard proposed a somewhat\u000a      similar programme for children (Child Mental Health: key to a healthier\u000a      society). In 2010, this proposal was broadly accepted and is being\u000a      implemented through extension of the programme to children and young\u000a      people.\u000a    C. The UK Resiliency Programme: In 2006, CEP joined the Young\u000a      Foundation and IdeA to develop a Wellbeing Programme with three local\u000a      authorities: Hertfordshire, Manchester and South Tyneside. The biggest\u000a      element in this was the UK version of the Penn Resiliency Programme. The\u000a      researchers organised trials in 22 schools and, with a large Department\u000a      for Education grant, evaluated the outcome. The programme is now being\u000a      taught routinely in 60 schools in 10 local authorities. The researchers\u000a      have a large grant from the Education Endowment Foundation to conduct a\u000a      trial programme for the whole Personal, Social and Health Education\u000a      curriculum for the 11-15 age group.\u000a    D. The Apprenticeship Act 2009: Since the early 1990s, CEP\u000a      researchers have been pressing the government to offer apprenticeships as\u000a      the main alternative to university as a route to skill. Since 2000, they\u000a      have advocated the guarantee of an apprenticeship to every young person\u000a      who wants one (with a few specific exemptions). In 2007, at Layard's\u000a      suggestion, the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee produced a\u000a      report on apprenticeship that endorsed this suggestion. The report was\u000a      drafted by the Committee's adviser, Hilary Steedman, and led to a\u000a      government green paper and then the Apprenticeship Act of 2009, which\u000a      introduced the guarantee from 2015. Since 2008, apprenticeships for\u000a      under-25s have increased by 50%.\u000a    E. The Good Childhood Report (2009): Layard drafted the report\u000a      from this enquiry, which was commissioned by the Children's Society.\u000a      Recommendations that have been implemented include the introduction of\u000a      Improved Access to Psychological Therapies for children and young people\u000a      (2010), pilots of parenting classes in Camden, Middlesbrough and High\u000a      Peak, Derbyshire (http:\/\/www.canparent.org.uk, 2012)\u000a      and expanded apprenticeships (2009).\u000a    F. OECD wellbeing measures: CEP has a longstanding interaction\u000a      with the OECD, which has now held three large conferences on `What is\u000a      Progress?', each of which has featured presentations by CEP researchers.\u000a      The OECD, which master-minded the international measures of GDP, has now\u000a      recommended international measures of wellbeing that are heavily\u000a      influenced by the CEP proposals adopted by the ONS. The OECD Guidelines on\u000a      Measuring Subjective Wellbeing (2013) begin with the questions that CEP\u000a      persuaded the ONS to use in the UK.\u000a    G. The UN and sustainable development goals: At the world level,\u000a      the UN General Assembly passed a resolution on 13 July 2011, encouraging\u000a      member states to pay more attention to the goal of happiness, and mandated\u000a      a conference at the UN on the issue in April 2012. Layard was invited to\u000a      co-edit the World Happiness Report, which was published at that conference\u000a      and is contributing to the choice of objectives that will replace the\u000a      Millennium Development Goals from 2015.\u000a    H. World Economic Forum: In 2011, the World Economic Forum asked\u000a      Layard to chair their Global Agenda Council on Health and Wellbeing. He\u000a      master-minded their report, Wellbeing and Global Success, and presented it\u000a      at Davos in January 2012. There is now growing business interest in\u000a      workers' wellbeing as one feature of a good business. For example, in\u000a      March 2012, Layard was asked to give a one-hour lunchtime talk to more\u000a      than 800 people at Goldman Sachs on the theme Can we be happier?\u000a    I Action for Happiness and media culture: Reaching a wider public\u000a      requires a movement. To promote a happier society, Layard collaborated\u000a      with Geoff Mulgan and Anthony Seldon to launch Action for Happiness in\u000a      March 2011. It now has 22,000 members in 124 countries pledged to try to\u000a      create more happiness in the world and less misery. More generally, CEP's\u000a      Wellbeing Programme has played a significant role in stimulating the\u000a      extraordinary recent explosion in media focus on wellbeing. Since 2003,\u000a      the research has received over 1,130 references in the press; CEP\u000a      researchers have made more than 120 radio and TV appearances and given\u000a      over 100 public talks.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Wellbeing Programme at the LSE's Centre for Economic Performance\u000a      (CEP) was founded in 2001, based on the belief that subjective wellbeing\u000a      should be the main criterion for making government policy. The research\u000a      programme has had a widespread impact on many UK government policies,\u000a      including policies for measuring national wellbeing; for Improving Access\u000a      to Psychological Therapies in the NHS; for improving life skills in\u000a      schools; and for apprenticeships.

The programme's main aims since then have been to\u000a      promote the use of happiness as a criterion for public policy, and to\u000a      provide research underpinnings for policies to improve happiness.\u000a    1. Happiness in general: Time-series data show that despite major rises\u000a      in income in many countries, wellbeing has not risen since records began &#8212;\u000a      and yet people want more income. CEP research explains this apparent\u000a      contradiction by showing that what people mainly care about is their\u000a      income relative to other people (3): this greatly reduces the power of\u000a      economic growth to raise average wellbeing. The work also provides\u000a      empirical evidence in support of greater income equality by showing that\u000a      an extra pound gives x times more extra wellbeing to a poor person than it\u000a      does to someone who is x times richer (4).To provide a balanced survey of\u000a      all the different causes of wellbeing, CEP researchers co-edited the World\u000a      Happiness Report for the first UN Conference on Happiness in 2012, and\u000a      wrote the review chapter on the causes of happiness (5).\u000a    2. Measurement of wellbeing: If wellbeing is to become the goal of public\u000a      policy, a first step is to have regular official measurements of\u000a      population wellbeing. A CEP team surveyed the evidence on possible\u000a      measures and wrote a proposal for the four questions that should be asked\u000a      (6). The UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) adopted these proposals\u000a      for the regular national survey that began in 2011.\u000a    3. Mental health: CEP research shows that mental health is a major\u000a      determinant of wellbeing -more important than income. To persuade the UK\u000a      government to expand psychological therapy services, CEP researchers\u000a      conducted a cost-benefit analysis of cognitive behavioural therapy, which\u000a      showed that wider provision would have zero net cost to the UK Treasury\u000a      (7). Following this, in 2007, the government launched the Improving Access\u000a      to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme and a CEP team evaluated first\u000a      the two demonstration sites (8) and then the first year of the national\u000a      rollout. The evaluations showed that the best results were achieved by\u000a      implementing the treatments that CEP had proposed.\u000a    4. Life skills in schools: Prevention is better than cure &#8212; so, to\u000a      improve mental health, it is highly desirable to increase the resilience\u000a      of young people. One notable intervention is the 18-hour Penn Resilience\u000a      Programme. In small trials, this had already been shown to have good\u000a      results, but a wider field trial was needed. CEP persuaded 22 English\u000a      schools to introduce the programme and Layard's CEP colleagues Amy Challen\u000a      and Stephen Machin led the evaluation (9). This showed that the programme\u000a      had long-lasting effects on school performance and good short-term results\u000a      on emotional health though these faded over time. CEP is now promoting the\u000a      trial of a much longer 140-hour programme based on a worldwide search for\u000a      effective programmes.\u000a    5. Apprenticeship: Unemployment is a major source of misery, especially\u000a      among young people. CEP researchers, notably Layard's colleague Hilary\u000a      Steedman, have long advocated apprenticeships along the lines of Germany's\u000a      system and the latest evaluation of international evidence has been part\u000a      of the campaign to bring this about (10).\u000a    KEY RESEARCHER: Professor Layard has been at LSE since 1964.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"33676","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    NATURE OF THE IMPACT: Centre for Economic Performance (CEP) research on\u000a      minimum wages has: (a) had a direct impact on the initial design of the\u000a      UK's National Minimum Wage (NMW), a design that has persisted to the\u000a      present; (b) had some initial impact on the introduction of the minimum\u000a      wage in Hong Kong; and (c) continues to influence debates around the world\u000a      about the introduction or modification of minimum wages.\u000a    a. The UK's National Minimum Wage:\u000a    LSE research on the effect of minimum wages on employment had a large\u000a      impact on the initial deliberations of the Low Pay Commission (LPC) as it\u000a      provided the only credible UK evidence at that time. A 2009 report for the\u000a      ESRC by Frontier Economics found that `the consensus view from LPC\u000a      commissioners and CEP's research peers is that CEP research was the most\u000a      influential in terms of setting the minimum wage level' (see Source A).\u000a      Further: `in the case of the National Minimum Wage (NMW) we have been able\u000a      to provide some indication of the value generated by CEP research. Of\u000a      course, it is impossible to attribute with any precision the value\u000a      generated, but if we start with a gross benefit of &#163;1.2 billion attributed\u000a      to the policy, then even if only 2% of that gross benefit is attributable\u000a      to CEP that equates to &#163;24 million in 2008 prices.' Since the initial\u000a      structure of the minimum wage has been maintained over time, CEP work\u000a      continues to have impact, not least on living standards, as well as on the\u000a      thinking of the LPC (Source B).\u000a    In April 2012, Manning published a report for the Resolution Foundation's\u000a      Commission on Living Standards (Source C) which drew on CEP research to\u000a      make suggestions about how the NMW could be modified to have stronger\u000a      effects in a recession (Source C). This report attracted considerable\u000a      newspaper coverage and led to several radio interviews (28 media mentions\u000a      recorded). Its call for a modification of the mandate of the LPC to\u000a      recommend higher minimum wages in some sectors (eg banking) was adopted by\u000a      the Commission on Living Standards in its final report (Source D). Manning\u000a      is currently serving on the Resolution Foundation's expert panel on the\u000a      `Future of the National Minimum Wage and the Low Pay Commission', chaired\u000a      by George Bain, the founding chair of the LPC.\u000a    The impact of the research can also be seen in articles about minimum\u000a      wages in the media (Source E). For example, the `Free Exchange' column in\u000a      The Economist on 24 November 2012 was devoted to minimum wages. Two\u000a      of the seven articles referred to were by Alan Manning and The\u000a        Economist column referred to `monopsony' as the main reason why\u000a      minimum wages might not reduce jobs. Increasing acceptance among\u000a      mainstream economic commentators of the view that labour markets might\u000a      have monopsonistic aspects is an important secondary impact of the\u000a      underpinning research.\u000a    b. Beyond the UK: CEP's expertise on NMWs is in demand from other\u000a          countries.\u000a    Direct: 1. Hong Kong introduced a minimum wage for the first time\u000a      in 2011. The process by which that decision was made involved looking at\u000a      research done in other countries, including the research cited here on the\u000a      UK. The legislation that was introduced cites references (1), (2), (4) and\u000a      (5) from section 3, as well as other research on the topic by LSE-based\u000a      researchers (Source F).\u000a    Indirect 2i. United States: in his 2013 State of the Union Address,\u000a    President Obama proposed raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to\u000a    $9.00 per hour. Manning's research on monopsony has been cited as one reason\u000a    the minimum wage may not destroy jobs &#8212; for example, in a document produced\u000a    by the DC-based Center for Economic and Policy Research. Manning has also\u000a    written about the Obama proposal for the Milken Institute Review (Source G).\u000a    2ii. Germany: there has been an active debate in Germany over several\u000a      years about the introduction of a minimum wage &#8212; as opposed to minimum pay\u000a      rates set in local collective agreements &#8212; culminating in an announcement\u000a      by Angela Merkel on 25 April 2012 of plans to introduce a national minimum\u000a      wage.The UK experience has been regarded as of particular relevance for\u000a      informing that debate. For example, The Economist of 5 November\u000a      2011 wrote that: `the CDU seems to be heeding newer British and American\u000a      ideas'. Manning's expertise has been called on by a variety of people in\u000a      Germany, as evidenced by his meetings with German civil servants, radio\u000a      interviews, quotations in the press and a commission to write an article\u000a      on the UK experience for Focus magazine, which has a weekly\u000a      circulation of 500,000, the third largest in Germany (Source H).\u000a    2iii. Wider international debates: there is interest in many European\u000a      countries about what can and cannot be achieved by minimum wages and\u000a      Manning contributes significantly to the public debate. For example, in\u000a      December 2011, Manning was invited to speak to a meeting of academics and\u000a      trade unionists at the European Trade Union Institute in Brussels about\u000a      the UK experience. Globally, organisations like the OECD and the\u000a      International Monetary Fund (IMF) have changed their recommendations to be\u000a      more supportive of the use of minimum wages. A joint report by the OECD,\u000a      the IMF, the World Bank and the International Labour Organization (ILO)\u000a      for the G20 labour ministers' meeting in June 2012 wrote that `a statutory\u000a      minimum wage set at an appropriate level may raise labour force\u000a      participation at the margin, without adversely affecting demand, thus\u000a      having a net positive impact especially for workers weakly attached to the\u000a      labour market', a markedly more positive view than expressed in the past\u000a      (Source I). In March 2012, Manning was invited by Singapore's Ministry of\u000a      Trade and Industry and Civil Service College to advise on how Singapore\u000a      might combat rising wage inequality, which, combined with a slowing\u000a      overall rate of growth, has led to stagnant or even falling living\u000a      standards for low-wage workers (Source J).\u000a    WHY THE IMPACT MATTERS: Well-organised National Minimum Wage\u000a      schemes reduce poverty and wage inequality. LSE research has contributed\u000a      to this goal in several countries. In 2010, the Institute of\u000a        Government voted the minimum wage the most successful UK policy of\u000a      the last 30 years &#8212; a view reiterated in the Financial Times in\u000a      July 2013.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research by Alan Manning and colleagues at LSE's Centre for Economic\u000a      Performance (CEP) has contributed to widespread acceptance of the view\u000a      that minimum wages set at an appropriate level are a valuable tool of\u000a      public policy. CEP researchers had a direct impact on the design of the\u000a      UK's National Minimum Wage (NMW) and thus on the living standards of\u000a      poorer workers and their families. They provided the intellectual context\u000a      for the policy, advised on its implementation and evaluated its effects.\u000a      CEP research has had some initial impact on the introduction of the\u000a      minimum wage in Hong Kong. It has also influenced debates around the world\u000a      about the introduction or modification of minimum wages.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Economic","Institution":"\u000a    London School of Economics and Political Science\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"London School of Economics and Political Science","InstitutionName":"London School of Economics & Political Science","PeerGroup":"C","Region":"London","UKPRN":10004063}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"1819729","Name":"Hong Kong"},{"GeoNamesId":"2800867","Name":"Bruxelles-Capitale"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

Monopsony in the labour market: The conventional wisdom that minimum\u000a      wages must reduce employment comes in large part from a view that the\u000a      labour market is well approximated by the model of perfect competition.\u000a      Accordingly, anything that increases wages must then necessarily reduce\u000a      employment through a fall in the demand for labour. Manning's work on\u000a      monopsony argues that employers have significant market power over their\u000a      workers, an important implication of which is that the supply of labour\u000a      and how it responds to increasing wages are as important as the demand for\u000a      labour (1). Empirical validation of this theoretical analysis has\u000a      addressed concerns that minimum wages may destroy jobs and lead to an\u000a      increase rather than a reduction in inequality.\u000a    2. The effects of the minimum wage on employment: The common argument\u000a      against a minimum wage (that it destroys jobs) led in 1993 to the\u000a      Conservative government's abolition of the UK's Wages Councils, which had\u000a      previously set minimum wages in a number of low-paying industries. CEP\u000a      research analysed the effect of the minimum wages set by the Wages\u000a      Councils and concluded that there was no evidence that they had cost jobs\u000a      (2). Subsequent to the introduction of the NMW in 1999, CEP investigated\u000a      the impact on employment in a very low-wage labour market &#8212; care workers\u000a      in care homes (3). This study found some negative effects on employment\u000a      but they were small considering that 30% of workers were directly affected\u000a      by the minimum wage (the national average is about 5%).\u000a    3. The effects of the minimum wage on wage inequality: CEP research\u000a      investigated the short-run effects of the introduction of the UK's NMW on\u000a      wage inequality. It concluded that the only effect was to raise the wages\u000a      of workers who were directly affected, so the NMW benefitted only about 5%\u000a      of workers (4) and (5). More recent research (6) has concluded that, over\u000a      a longer time period, the NMW has had some spillover effects, influencing\u000a      the earnings of those paid above the minimum. This study found that the\u000a      NMW has played an important role in reducing wage inequality at the lower\u000a      end of the labour market, an effect that is particularly marked for women\u000a      and young people, as well as in low-wage regions.\u000a    KEY RESEARCHERS: Alan Manning has been full-time at LSE since 1993. Key\u000a      CEP colleagues have been: Stephen Machin (50% at LSE through this period);\u000a      Richard Dickens (full-time until 2000, 40% until 2006, now a research\u000a      affiliate).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"34497","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    In April 1999, the minimum wage was introduced to the UK labour market.\u000a      The role of Machin's research in this decision is demonstrated by the fact\u000a      that no fewer than 22 of his papers are cited in the first Low Pay\u000a      Commission (LPC) report of June 1998 before the National Minimum Wage\u000a      (NMW) was instituted [1]. Since then, and throughout the impact census\u000a      period (2008-2013), the minimum wage has been set by the LPC, and\u000a      underpinned by the guiding logic demonstrated by the research: that\u000a      setting a minimum wage at an appropriate level does not harm the economy.\u000a      Research papers [a-e] above continue to be cited in the LPC's annual\u000a      reports almost every year [1]. Some indicative outcomes based on research\u000a      during the impact period are described below.\u000a    Impact on minimum wage policy\u000a    i) A direct impact from the research, and from Machin's position as a Low\u000a      Pay Commissioner, has been the raising of the NMW at the right level at\u000a      the right time; to &#163;5.73 per hour in October 2008, to &#163;5.80 in October\u000a      2009, to &#163;5.93 in October 2010, to &#163;6.08 in October 2011, to &#163;6.19 in\u000a      October 2012 and to &#163;6.31 in October 2013. These upratings were\u000a      recommended by the LPC, and accepted by government following the\u000a      principles laid down in the research that a minimum wage pitched at the\u000a      right level need not harm employment [a], even in the context of the\u000a      economic downturn when some argued that there should be a freeze of the\u000a      minimum wage.\u000a    ii) At the same time, the research suggested that in an economic\u000a      downturn, care had to be taken in raising the wages of younger low wage\u000a      workers who are more prone to unemployment during recessions [b].\u000a      Following this logic, during the years of the economic downturn (through\u000a      the upratings announced each October from 2010-2013), the LPC decided, for\u000a      the first time, to not raise the youth development rate (the minimum for\u000a      18-20 year olds) by as much as the adult rate.\u000a    Thus the research, through the setting of the minimum wage, continues to\u000a      have impact on over a million UK workers and on large numbers of\u000a      businesses every year. In particular, it has been an important factor in\u000a      ensuring the minimum wage was increased without harming employment levels.\u000a    Benefits to low wage workers\u000a    The principal beneficiaries are, of course, the large number of low wage\u000a      workers in the UK: about 4 per cent of workers, around a million people,\u000a      are in minimum wage jobs. Between 2008 and 2012, the LPC raised minimum\u000a      wages by 8 per cent (in line with the research), whilst the wages of the\u000a      `typical' worker in the Labour Force Survey (at the 50th percentile in the\u000a      wage distribution) grew by only 5 per cent (in nominal terms) [1]. Thus\u000a      the NMW acted to keep up the relative wages, and by association the living\u000a      standards, of low wage workers.\u000a    The NMW has been a highly popular and successful policy. A recent policy\u000a      overview from the Institute of Government reported that the \"minimum wage\u000a      tops the chart of the most successful policies of the last 30 years\" [2].\u000a    Impact on the operation of the LPC and on government policy 2008-2013\u000a    Every year, including during 2008-2013, the LPC recommends to government\u000a      the level at which the NMW should be set and produces an annual report\u000a      justifying this on the basis of evidence. These reports are presented to\u000a      Parliament by the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills\u000a      (BIS) [1]. Its recommendations are submitted to government in spring, and\u000a      typically come into effect in October the same year.\u000a    The LPC comprises a chair, three employer representatives, three employee\u000a      representatives and two independents. Since 2007, Professor Machin has\u000a      been one of the two independent members. Through this appointment, which\u000a      was made on the basis of Machin's research expertise, he has brought\u000a      evidence from research to bear on the debate within and decisions made by\u000a      the Commission. This, as the chair of the LPC confirms in a written\u000a      testimonial, has `had a strong and wide-ranging impact on government\u000a      policy on minimum wages'; he further notes that this research impact `in\u000a      interacting with policymakers and practitioners has been second to none\u000a      amongst the academic economics community.' [3].\u000a    The evidence base for the LPC's annual recommendations to government\u000a      comprises several dimensions, in all of which Machin and his research play\u000a      an important role.\u000a    (i) Professor Machin has had direct impact on the LPC's use of academic\u000a      evidence during the REF period by commissioning research projects\u000a      undertaken by other academics and research consultants [4]. Thus the\u000a      original research listed in section 2 has important knock-on effects to\u000a      facilitate the next generation of minimum wage research. One clear example\u000a      of this was a project commissioned by the LPC in 2012-13 that directly\u000a      built on [e] listed in section 3 by looking at the impact of minimum wages\u000a      on firm profitability from the upratings of the minimum wage in the REF\u000a      assessment period [5]. In line with [e], they found profit margins were\u000a      squeezed by the minimum wage over the longer time period 1999 to 2007.\u000a      This was used in the LPC report released on April 2013 as evidence to take\u000a      into account when setting the NMW (para. 2.139-140, p. 69-70).\u000a    (ii) Professor Machin has, along with other LPC members, taken evidence\u000a      from a large number of groups each year and met them in presentations of\u000a      oral evidence in a two day meeting in November of each year (these are\u000a      listed in the LPC annual reports, [1]).\u000a    (iii) The LPC also conducts visits where commissioners meet employers,\u000a      workers and other individuals potentially affected by the minimum wage.\u000a      Many of these are in areas and industries with a high proportion of\u000a      minimum wage workers. This consultation with relevant parties generates a\u000a      wider impact through engaging members of the general public in the minimum\u000a      wage setting process. An indicative example is of the LPC visit to\u000a      Sheffield in November 2012, during which Debt Support Unit staff at a\u000a      Citizen's Advice Bureau provided specific feedback on the problems faced\u000a      by their clients on zero hour contracts [6].\u000a    Thanks to this robust evidence base, despite occasional objections\u000a      against the proposed level by both employer and employee groups, to date,\u000a      the government has always accepted the LPC's recommendations &#8212; which are\u000a      informed by Machin's contribution based on his research &#8212; on the setting\u000a      of the adult national minimum wage rates.\u000a    Impacts on policy debate\u000a    The research evidence has shaped the debate on minimum wages in the\u000a      policy arena. For example, the Resolution Foundation set up a Commission\u000a      on Living Standards to study aspects of this &#8212; first coining the now\u000a      commonplace phrase `the squeezed middle'. Professor Machin was a member of\u000a      the Commission and the evidence from section 2 was used in their report\u000a      [7]. They also refer to the research work in their new venture on `The\u000a      Future of Minimum Wages' [7].\u000a    The role of the minimum wage in alleviating inequality has been\u000a      acknowledged by the National Equality Panel (NEP), set up by the Right\u000a      Hon. Harriet Harman MP through the Government Equalities Office, of which\u000a      Professor Machin was also a member. The NEP emphasised the role of minimum\u000a      wages in keeping wages up at the bottom end of the wage distribution,\u000a      particularly for women, and drew upon the evidence of section 2 in doing\u000a      so [8].\u000a    Introduction of minimum wage in Hong Kong and experience of other\u000a        countries\u000a    The evidence provided by research continues to be used in discussions of\u000a      minimum wage in other countries, showing the international reach of this\u000a      work. Professor Machin presented his research to policy audiences in Hong\u000a      Kong in July 2008) as part of a search for evidence to inform minimum wage\u000a      policy. In 2011, Hong Kong introduced a National Minimum Wage, affecting\u000a      10 per cent of its working population. This referred to the use of the\u000a      LPC's assessments of the impact of minimum wages on employment as a\u000a      justification for the level at which a minimum could be introduced without\u000a      damaging employment [9]. The 2010 report of the Provisional Minimum Wage\u000a      Commission, which set the parameters of implementation in Hong Kong,\u000a      referred extensively and positively to the UK precedent, and cited eight\u000a      separate research outputs by Machin and nearly every LPC report since 1999\u000a      [9].\u000a    The UK research evidence has also featured prominently in minimum wage\u000a      discussions elsewhere, for example, the Australian Fair Pay Commission's\u000a      Minimum Wage Research Forum in Melbourne in October 2008 at which Machin\u000a      presented his research [10], while discussions in Germany (where Professor\u000a      Machin presented his research to policy audiences in Berlin in April 2008)\u000a      referred to the UK evidence and looked to the LPC as a model if an\u000a      economy-wide minimum wage were to be introduced.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research on the economic effects of minimum wages undertaken by Professor\u000a      Stephen Machin and his co-authors changed the policy context before a\u000a      National Minimum Wage (NMW) was introduced in April 1999. That and\u000a      subsequent research, as well as Machin's appointment as Commissioner in\u000a      2007, have provided the guiding logic for the operations of the Low Pay\u000a      Commission, the government body that makes recommendations on setting the\u000a      NMW. As a result, research has directly influenced the annual setting of\u000a      the NMW through 2008-2013, affecting the wages of over a million low-paid\u000a      UK workers. Research has subsequently influenced policy debate in the UK,\u000a      and in other countries including Germany, Hong Kong and Australia.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Economic","Institution":"\u000a    University College London\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"University College London","InstitutionName":"University College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007784}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"1819729","Name":"Hong Kong"},{"GeoNamesId":"2158177","Name":"Melbourne"},{"GeoNamesId":"2950159","Name":"Berlin"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a[a] Dickens, R., S.

Prior to this, many academic economists\u000a      and policymakers tended to think, on the basis of little rigorous\u000a      evidence, that a minimum wage would cost jobs were it to be introduced;\u000a      indeed some macroeconomic forecasters predicted, from models and no\u000a      empirical analysis, that up to two million jobs could be lost from\u000a      introducing a national minimum wage. Research by Stephen Machin at UCL\u000a      (Professor of Economics, employed at UCL since 1988) provided empirical\u000a      analysis that this was not the case.\u000a    Research undertaken during the 1990s [a] directly contributed to altering\u000a      this viewpoint by presenting evidence that minimum wages need not harm\u000a      employment. This research, along with papers [b]-[e] (described below) are\u000a      now viewed as seminal articles in the large body of minimum wage research\u000a      that has subsequently been undertaken.\u000a    The findings in [a] were supported by additional in depth research\u000a      studies of the policy context and its interaction with evidence from a\u000a      range of countries and time periods. For example, a large-scale project\u000a      carrying out empirical work on minimum wage systems in Europe concluded\u000a      that it was hard to find evidence that minimum wages harm employment,\u000a      unless the minimum is set at too high a level [b]. This challenged the\u000a      orthodox view that minimum wages always reduce employment. The research\u000a      findings showed, instead, that a minimum wage pitched at the `right' level\u000a      both need not harm employment and had scope to give a significant wage\u000a      boost to raise the incomes of the poorest workers in the economy.\u000a    Research was also undertaken to study the economic impact of minimum wage\u000a      introduction. In the years 1998 to 2001, a detailed data collection on\u000a      workers in care homes before and after minimum wage introduction was\u000a      undertaken [c]. Care homes were chosen as they employ many low wage\u000a      workers and the sector was thus potentially very vulnerable to employment\u000a      losses from minimum wage introduction. The research uncovered little\u000a      evidence of serious disemployment effects from minimum wage introduction,\u000a      and there was no evidence that care homes employing more low wage workers\u000a      were any more likely to shut down [d]. In fact, the evidence points to a\u000a      squeeze of profits occurring in response to the minimum wage [e]. Like the\u000a      pre-introduction work, these pieces of research are repeatedly used in Low\u000a      Pay Commission (LPC) deliberations and cited in subsequent academic\u000a      research and commissioned research projects by other authors as key\u000a      articles in the field.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35287","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The underpinning research conducted by Professors Katsoulacos and Ulph\u000a      influenced changes that both OFT and AdC were making to their penalty\u000a      policies. For OFT it contributed to the formulation of revisions to their\u000a      published penalty guidelines, and specifically a proposed increase in\u000a      baseline penalty from 10% to 30% of revenue. For AdC it helped shape the\u000a      formulation of the penalty guidelines that they published for the first\u000a      time.\u000a    Since other major competition authorities-e.g. the European Commission's\u000a      Competition Authority, (DGComp) &#8212; currently use a low 10% penalty, the\u000a      arguments and research could convince other authorities to raise their\u000a      penalties. Any major change in policy by organisations such as OFT and AdC\u000a      will be subject to vigorous debate and a vast range of often conflicting\u000a      advice. Some of this will arise through internal organisational\u000a      discussions as the policy is being developed. But it can also arise after\u000a      the policy has been announced and so is subject to external scrutiny and\u000a      comment. Research can therefore impact on the final policy that is adopted\u000a      both by shaping the initial policy formulation that is announced (and\u000a      finally agreed) and also by convincing the organisation that there are\u000a      robust defences against the arguments that oppose the initial policy that\u000a      is proposed.\u000a    However since the underpinning research by Professors Katsoulacos and\u000a      Ulph was undertaken at the same time as the policy changes were being\u000a      considered\/proposed, and was published only after the policy was\u000a      announced\/implemented &#8212; the impact arose as a result of knowledge exchange\u000a      activities with both OFT and AdC that was undertaken by Professors\u000a      Katsoulacos and Ulph in the course of the research. Consequently the\u000a      supporting documents refer to these engagement activities rather than the\u000a      subsequent publications.\u000a    The underpinning research conducted by Professors Katsoulacos and Ulph\u000a      shaped OFT's decisions in two ways, and through both these channels\u000a      identified above.\u000a    The first research impact arose through the demonstration that Legal\u000a      Uncertainty could not be used as a general argument for keeping penalties\u000a      low. At a meeting in Dec 2010 with OFT's Head of Economics, Professors\u000a      Katsoulacos and Ulph presented some early findings from their research on\u000a      legal uncertainty and penalties. The Head of Economics was intrigued by\u000a      their result that, while legal uncertainty may sometimes be an\u000a      argument for zero penalties, there were other circumstances under which it\u000a      might lead to higher penalties [4]. This ran counter to the\u000a      prevailing view amongst many legal scholars that legal uncertainty would always\u000a      be an argument for low penalties &#8212; a view that had support amongst those\u000a      in OFT arguing against the proposal to raise penalties. The Head of\u000a      Economics at OFT thought this work should be presented at greater length\u000a      to a wider OFT audience that included other policy analysts involved in\u000a      the review of penalty policy. This presentation took place in January\u000a      2011.\u000a    In October 2011 OFT published a consultation document on its draft\u000a      revised penalty guidance. Consistent with the research findings of\u000a      Professors Katsoulacos and Ulph, OFT announced its intention to raise\u000a      penalties. However, in para 4.7 of the consultation document, it argues\u000a      that \"genuine uncertainty on the part of the undertaking as to whether\u000a        the agreement or conduct constituted an infringement\" could be a\u000a      mitigating factor in favour of a lower penalty. This describes precisely\u000a      the type of uncertainty under which the research by Professors Katsoulacos\u000a      and Ulph suggests that a zero penalty MAY be warranted &#8212; though their\u000a      research indicates that further conditions need to be met to warrant a\u000a      zero penalty. And indeed OFT does not propose to automatically reduce\u000a      penalties under this type of uncertainty &#8212; it just indicates that it might\u000a      do so. So the policy formulation is precisely that proposed in the\u000a      research by Professors Katsoulacos and Ulph. Evidence that the proposed\u000a      policy was shaped by the research findings on the issue of Legal\u000a      Uncertainty comes in a letter from OFT's Chief Economist who states that\u000a      the January 2011 presentation \"was helpful in clarifying our thinking\u000a        about the role of legal uncertainty and ultimately helped confirm our\u000a        decision to propose higher starting point penalties.\" [S1]\u000a    The second area of impact came by confirming OFT's decision to propose a\u000a      figure of 30% as the appropriate penalty. The impact came through the\u000a      evidence submitted by Professors Katsoulacos and Ulph in January 2012, in\u000a      response to OFT's consultation. In the consultation document OFT provided\u000a      no indication as to why 30% was the appropriate figure. In their evidence\u000a      Professors Katsoulacos and Ulph reported on calculations they had\u000a      undertaken of what implications flowed from their analysis of optimal\u000a      penalties &#8212; work that was subsequently published in an academic paper[3].\u000a      The analysis and calculations by Professors Katsoulacos and Ulph showed\u000a      that while optimal penalties could be higher than the 30% figure proposed\u000a      by OFT, their proposed figure lay within a reasonable range of values.\u000a    Evidence that our advice had an impact through confirming OFT's view that\u000a      30% was a defensible figure comes from the letter from OFT's Chief\u000a      Economist which states \"We found this helpful in terms of contributing\u000a        to a balanced range of views on our proposals because many of the\u000a        submissions were arguing against our proposals to raise the penalty\u000a        starting point, whereas in their submission Professors Katsoulacos and\u000a        Ulph put forward arguments and calculations that suggested that the\u000a        optimal baseline penalty might if anything be somewhat higher than the\u000a        30% proposed in our consultation document, in particular for\u000a        infringements that suffer from low detection rates.\" [S1]\u000a    In France, the AdC has never published guidance on how penalties would be\u000a      determined. Research by Professors Katsoulacos and Ulph had an impact on\u000a      the internal debates taking place within AdC by demonstrating the value of\u000a      reducing certain types of legal uncertainty through publishing guidelines\u000a      [4], and by setting out the factors that should be used to determine the\u000a      optimal penalties [3]. Although the guidelines are heavily constrained by\u000a      the French legal code, nevertheless evidence that our research had such an\u000a      impact on AdC's penalty guidelines comes in a letter from AdC's Chief\u000a      Economist which states \"Discussion on the topic of fine setting was\u000a        extremely interesting and timely as the Autorit&#233; was in the middle of a\u000a        process to write its own sentencing guidelines (this was ultimately done\u000a        in May 2011). Although our guidelines on the setting of fines for\u000a        anticompetitive behaviour were primarily driven by the legal\u000a        requirements of the French Code of Commerce and our past case law, all\u000a        the discussions that we have had with - among other &#8212; academic\u000a        economists (and therefore with Professors Katsoulacos and Ulph) have\u000a        greatly influenced our discussions internally and helped thus drafting\u000a        our guidelines.\" [S2]\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The underpinning research arose from an ESRC-funded project on\u000a      the \"Optimal Design of Decision and Enforcement Procedures for Competition\u000a      Policy\" by Professor David Ulph (St Andrews) and Professor Yannis\u000a      Katsoulacos (AUEB). This influenced the penalty policies of competition\u000a      authorities in two countries: the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) in the UK\u000a      and the Autorite de la Concurrence (AdC) in France. For OFT it contributed\u000a      to the formulation of revised penalty guidelines, specifically a proposed\u000a      increase in baseline penalty from 10% to 30%. For AdC it impacted on the\u000a      formulation of the first penalty guidelines they published.

Most advanced\u000a      countries and many developing countries have competition authorities that\u000a      enforce competition policy by identifying, stopping and penalising what\u000a      are regarded as anti-competitive practices. Yet there had been\u000a      comparatively little research into the welfare consequences of different\u000a      ways of enforcing competition policy: choice of legal standard (Per Se\u000a      vs Effects-Based); design of penalty regime; timing of\u000a      interventions; nature of appeals procedures etc. Moreover, what research\u000a      has been done in this area has typically been framed in the context of\u000a      specific practices - e.g. mergers.\u000a    In 2006 Prof Katsoulacos, Athens University of Economics and Business\u000a      (AUEB), and Prof D. Ulph, University of St Andrews (in post since 2006),\u000a      began a systematic programme of research to provide a general\u000a      framework (i.e. not tied to specific practice) in which these issues could\u000a      be addressed. Their 2009 paper [1] established for the first time\u000a      the precise conditions under which, generally, an Effects-Based\u000a      legal standard would be better than a Per Se legal standard in\u000a      terms of; (i) decision error costs, and (ii) deterrence effects. This led\u000a      to successful application for ESRC funding for a 3-year project (starting\u000a      Jan 2010) to extend their research in a number of directions. For example,\u000a      their 2011 paper [2] showed that multi-stage decision processes &#8212;\u000a      such as appeals &#8212; do not necessarily improve the outcomes of an Effects-Based\u000a      legal standard.\u000a    As part of their project Professors Katsoulacos and Ulph committed to a\u000a      process of knowledge exchange through regular meetings with both OFT and\u000a      AdC. This engagement indicated that penalties was an area of active\u000a      concern for both OFT and AdC.\u000a    Two major issues have arisen in the existing academic literature on the\u000a      optimal penalties for anti-competitive behaviour.\u000a    (a) Legal Uncertainty. Effects-Based\u000a      enforcement procedures are often criticised because they entail legal\u000a      uncertainty. This means that, when deciding whether or not to take a\u000a      specific action &#8212; e.g. merger &#8212; then, under an Effects-Based\u000a      enforcement procedure, firms may not know (a) what decision a competition\u000a      authority will make (should they be investigated) (b) the sort of evidence\u000a      the authority will use in reaching its decision; (c) indeed firms may not\u000a      even understand in what sense their action could be construed to be\u000a      against the public interest (what have I done wrong?). It has been argued\u000a      by some scholars that such legal uncertainty should lead to low\/zero\u000a      penalties. In their 2013 paper [4], Professors Katsoulacos and\u000a      Ulph: (i) show for the first time how to formalise the idea of legal\u000a      uncertainty and how to distinguish it from errors; (ii) develop its\u000a      implications for both the choice of the appropriate level of penalties and\u000a      the choice of legal standard. They establish the precise conditions under\u000a      which legal uncertainty may lead to a zero penalty, but also show that\u000a      penalties could be higher if there were legal uncertainty than if there\u000a      were no legal uncertainty.\u000a    (b) Level of Penalties It has also been argued that,\u000a      across a wide range of competition authorities, existing penalties are too\u000a      low to provide effective deterrence. Indeed some scholars have suggested\u000a      that penalties should be 50% of revenue, or higher. However the existing\u000a      literature on optimal penalties is based on the Economics of Crime and\u000a      focuses on criminal activities such as robbery. It therefore ignores a\u000a      crucial feature of economic crimes such as anti-competitive behaviour and\u000a      their detection\/punishment, which is the very long time periods over which\u000a      both can take place. This means that firms can either be detected and\u000a      penalised while the \"crime\" is being committed (caught red handed) or else\u000a      detected and penalised long after they have ceased to practice\u000a      the action. In their 2013 paper [3], Professors Katsoulacos &amp;\u000a      Ulph extend the existing literature theoretically and exploit a new data\u000a      set to calculate the impact of these factors on penalties. They show that\u000a      the optimal penalty should be around 75% of that produced by existing\u000a      approaches and that the optimal penalty should therefore be between 27%\u000a      and 35%.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35288","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"},{"GeoNamesId":"146669","Name":"Cyprus"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of this case study was to influence public discourse and to\u000a      provoke discussion with\u000a      policymakers, economists and the general public about the need for\u000a      aggressive monetary easing\u000a      and fiscal stimulus in the wake of the financial crisis and recession of\u000a      2007-9. This is a significant\u000a      contribution to a major contemporary issue. The impact took the form of\u000a      policy-oriented papers\u000a      presented at conferences attended by top monetary policymakers,\u000a      dissemination of the research in\u000a      a widely read economics blog, and contact with Federal Reserve Bank\u000a      presidents and members of\u000a      the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC).\u000a    There is a severe limit on the extent to which specific impact on Central\u000a      Bank policy can be\u000a      documented. Central banks rarely cite factors other than economic\u000a      conditions when announcing\u000a      policy changes. Evidence of impact is therefore largely indirect: speeches\u000a      by top policymakers,\u000a      seminars and conferences arranged or attended by them, and the actual\u000a      course of policy. First,\u000a      there has been considerable interest within central banks in the adaptive\u000a      learning approach to\u000a      expectations, used in the underpinning research, and its implications for\u000a      policy. For example, Prof.\u000a      Evans co-organized the 2008 \"Learning week\" workshop at the FRB (Federal\u000a      Reserve Bank) St.\u000a      Louis, gave a keynote talk at the July 2012 FRB St. Louis Conference on\u000a      \"Expectations in Dynamic\u000a      Macroeconomic Models\" and was a visiting scholar during 2008-9 at FRBs St\u000a      Louis and Cleveland.\u000a      The Bank of Japan commissioned a 2008 article by him on policy in deep\u000a      recessions for their\u000a      journal Monetary and Economic Studies. Two regional FRB Presidents\u000a      have done important\u000a      research using the adaptive learning approach, have supported FRB\u000a      workshops and conferences\u000a      on its implications for policy, and have been keynote speakers at these\u000a      conferences. [S5].\u000a    The underpinning research, and its implications for policy, has been\u000a      disseminated to the public,\u000a      economists and policymakers in a number of ways. For the economics\u000a      profession, the results have\u000a      been summarized in published survey papers. For the general public an\u000a      opinion piece was written\u000a      for a newspaper\u000a      and made available through the Economist's\u000a          View, a widely read economics blog\u000a      that aims for dissemination of recent papers, opinion and discussion in\u000a      economics. [S6]. The\u000a      Economist's View also discussed and disseminated key parts of the\u000a      research of this case study\u000a      [S7, S8, S9], including the first\u000a        draft of the Stagnation Regime paper. [Ref. 5].\u000a    For research economists and central bank policymakers, a major channel\u000a      for dissemination and\u000a      advocacy has been presentation of the research of this case study in\u000a      Conferences at which senior\u000a      policymakers were present, including at the Norges Bank (2009), IMF, Wash\u000a      DC (2009), Swiss\u000a      National Bank (2009), Erasmus University (2010), Universit&#233; de la\u000a      M&#233;diterran&#233;e, Marseille (2011)\u000a      and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (2012). [S5]. In addition to\u000a      central bank economists,\u000a      each conference was attended by one or more senior policymakers: Governor\u000a      and Deputy\u000a      Governor, Norges Bank; the IMF Chief Economist; Governor, Central Bank of\u000a      Cyprus; Deputy\u000a      Governor, Sveriges Riksbank; and the Presidents of the Federal Reserve\u000a      Banks of San Francisco,\u000a      St Louis and Minnesota. These people are influential or directly\u000a      participate in setting monetary\u000a      policy. In addition, Prof. Evans's long-term co-author Seppo Honkapohja is\u000a      a Member of the\u000a      Governing Board of the Bank of Finland, which participates in ECB policy.\u000a    There have been several specific interactions with US monetary\u000a      policymakers. The FOMC, which\u000a      sets monetary policy, has followed an aggressive expansionary monetary\u000a      policy throughout the\u000a      financial crisis and its aftermath, continuing to this day. This policy\u000a      has been more consistently\u000a      aggressive than in other countries. However, members of the FOMC have had\u000a      a range of views\u000a      about policy, and FOMC votes have not always been unanimous. The policy\u000a      debate was intense in\u000a      early 2009 and again in the summer and autumn 2010. The research of this\u000a      case study provided\u000a      support for the policies that were followed. As noted below, several\u000a      members of the FOMC were\u000a      aware of this research, which provided strong reasons for following\u000a      aggressive policies, and which\u000a      supported the positions of the Chairman and the majority and against the\u000a      position of dissenters.\u000a      More specifically, in late 2008, Prof. Evans sent [text removed for\u000a      publication] a copy of EGH2008,\u000a      and received a reply thanking him for the paper and commenting on its\u000a      relevance in the current\u000a      circumstances. [S3]. In March 2009, the authors of EGH2008 were told by a\u000a      Federal Reserve\u000a      Board economist that he would be presenting their \"very nice\" paper to\u000a      [text removed for\u000a      publication]. They were told afterward that the presentation had gone\u000a      smoothly and that it was\u000a      \"good advertising\" for their paper and research. [S4].\u000a    In the summer of 2010, the President of the FRB, St Louis, who was viewed\u000a      at the time as a\u000a      centrist, published a paper \"Seven\u000a        Faces of `The Peril'\" which discussed the possibility that the US\u000a      might become enmeshed in Japanese-style deflation. (The paper included\u000a      references to the\u000a      research of this case study). [S8]. In this paper and in the months\u000a      thereafter, this President\u000a      recommended that low interest rate policies be supplemented by\u000a      \"quantitative easing\" (QE2). In\u000a      September 2010, Prof. Evans wrote and first presented the \"stagnation\u000a      regime\" paper, extending\u000a      the earlier model and providing additional support for aggressive monetary\u000a      and fiscal policies. Thispolicy-oriented\u000a        paper was disseminated and discussed on the blog Economist's Views.\u000a      [S9].\u000a    In his [text removed for publication] 2010 speech, [text removed for\u000a      publication] suggested that\u000a      interest rates might need to be increased to avoid deflation. On\u000a      August 31, the President of FRB\u000a      St Louis, in commenting on a post on the Fedwatch\u000a        blog, mentioned that Prof. Evans is \"one of the\u000a        world's experts on the question of the dynamics\" lying behind the\u000a      Figure that he used in his Seven\u000a      Faces paper. [S8]. Noting this, Prof. Mark Thoma [S2] asked Prof. Evans to\u000a      make a video\u000a      explaining why adaptive learning theory implies that increasing interest\u000a      rates is the wrong policy\u000a      when deflation threatens. This\u000a        video was posted on Economists' View on Sept. 1, 2010. [S7].\u000a      According to Prof. Thoma, the video has had over 9,600 views. [text\u000a      removed for publication]\u000a      [S10]. [text removed for publication]\u000a    The policies of the FOMC have been in line with those recommended in the\u000a      research of this case\u000a      study. Aggressive monetary policy has been followed, and the Chairman has\u000a      been explicit\u000a      concerning the danger posed by deflation [S11(i)], a central focus of this\u000a      research. The Chairman\u000a      has also consistently stated that, in the context of longer-run plans for\u000a      fiscal stability, short-term\u000a      fiscal stimulus and deficit spending is desirable to support the economy.\u000a      [S11(ii)]. The policy of\u000a      Quantitative Easing can be viewed as a response to inadequate fiscal\u000a      stimulus. These policies\u000a      have been highly controversial. While the Chairman and the majority of the\u000a      FOMC had many\u000a      reasons for pursuing the policy they followed, the research of this case\u000a      study will have been helpful\u000a      in providing support for their stance.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The world financial crisis and recession of 2007-\u000a      2009, and the continued stagnation of global\u000a      economies, has raised the question of how\u000a      governments and central banks should respond\u000a      in deep recessions. Prof. Evans and colleagues\u000a      have shown using macroeconomic models with\u000a      adaptive learning that after large pessimistic\u000a      shocks, a rapid switch to aggressive monetary\u000a      easing is required and aggressive fiscal policy\u000a      may be needed. To achieve policy impact this\u000a      work has been presented in numerous central\u000a      bank conferences, and it has caught the\u000a      attention of several members of the US Federal\u000a      Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC). The\u000a      policies of the FOMC since 2008 have been consistently aggressive, despite\u000a      public criticism and\u000a      even dissension within the FOMC itself. This research has provided\u000a      important academic support\u000a      for the application of these policies.\u000a    \u000a    Divergent paths can result from large\u000a      negative expectation shocks.\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactType":"Economic","Institution":"\u000a    University of St Andrews\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"St Andrews (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of St Andrews","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"Scotland","UKPRN":10007803}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"7284890","Name":"Marseille 10"},{"GeoNamesId":"5391959","Name":"San Francisco"},{"GeoNamesId":"5150529","Name":"Cleveland"},{"GeoNamesId":"4407066","Name":"St. Louis"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1. \"Liquidity Traps, Learning and Stagnation,\" (George W.

The\u000a      previous literature focussed on model solutions under the \"rational\u000a      expectations\" (RE) hypothesis.\u000a      In contrast to this literature, and applying recently developed adaptive\u000a      learning techniques,\u000a      EGH2008 replaced RE with the assumption that agents (households and firms)\u000a      forecast future\u000a      output and inflation using simple statistical adaptive learning rules.\u000a      Such learning rules are\u000a      boundedly rational, but they are arguably a more realistic way to model\u000a      expectations.\u000a    EGH2008 shows that the potential for deep recession is much greater in\u000a      models with learning:\u000a      while the intended equilibrium is locally stable under learning, unstable\u000a      deflationary paths can arise\u000a      after large pessimistic shocks to expectations, including trajectories\u000a      with falling aggregate output.\u000a      EGH2008 demonstrates that aggressive monetary and fiscal policy is\u000a      necessary when the\u000a      economy has been hit by a large pessimistic shock. A 2008 companion paper2,\u000a      written following an\u000a      earlier visit by Prof. Evans to the Bank of Japan, provides additional\u000a      discussion. The results of\u000a      EGH2008 were disseminated widely in a 2009 Annual Reviews article.3\u000a    Three subsequent papers extended this research. \"Expectations, Deflation\u000a      Traps and\u000a      Macroeconomic Policy\"4 and \"Liquidity Traps and Expectation\u000a      Dynamics: Fiscal Stimulus or Fiscal\u000a      Austerity?\"6 incorporate long-horizon forecasts by households\u000a      and firms and non-Ricardian wealth\u000a      dynamics. \"The Stagnation Regime of the New Keynesian Model and Recent US\u000a      Policy\" (2013)5\u000a      shows that convergence to a locally stable stagnation regime can also\u000a      result from large negative\u000a      expectation shocks. This paper examines practical policy implications in\u000a      detail. It is shown that\u000a      sufficiently large temporary increases in government spending can dislodge\u000a      the economy from the\u000a      stagnation regime and restore the natural stabilizing dynamics. Other\u000a      policy proposals, including\u000a      quantitative easing, are discussed, as well as how nations and US States\u000a      can manage debt levels\u000a      to ensure fiscal flexibility in these settings.\u000a    In separate but related work, \"Learning about Risk and Return: A simple\u000a      model of bubbles and\u000a      crashes\" (2011)7, Branch and Evans study the propensity of\u000a      asset price bubbles and crashes to\u000a      emerge when traders use adaptive learning rules to forecast both risk and\u000a      returns. An asset price\u000a      crash, like the one in 2007-9 following the collapse of the housing price\u000a      bubble, can be a trigger for\u000a      a large pessimistic expectation shock with the potential for deep\u000a      recession.\u000a    In summary, the underpinning research on expectations and adaptive\u000a      learning in deep recessions\u000a      following large negative shocks has strong policy implications: (1) The\u000a      most serious danger is a\u000a      disequilibrium deflation trap in which deflation increases real interest\u000a      rates, leading to lower\u000a      aggregate output, which worsens deflation. (2) To avoid this trap monetary\u000a      policy, in response to a\u000a      large pessimistic shock, should quickly and aggressively reduce interest\u000a      rates to near zero. (3)\u000a      Fiscal policy, taking the form of a short-term fiscal stimulus is a\u000a      complementary policy that may\u000a      also be necessary. Austerity is usually ineffective. (4) If a sufficiently\u000a      large fiscal stimulus is\u000a      politically impossible, then less conventional monetary stimulus should be\u000a      used.\u000a    Key researchers:\u000a    George W.

[S1] Hence, it was only natural that research on monetary\u000d\u000a      policy and learning got attention in policy circles as evidenced in the\u000d\u000a      speeches by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and the President of the\u000d\u000a      ECB. [S2]. An indicator is the number of conferences devoted to this\u000d\u000a      topic, at least 14 of which have been sponsored by central banks including\u000d\u000a      those by the Federal Reserve St Louis 2006-08 and 2012, European Central\u000d\u000a      Bank (ECB) 2006, the Central Bank of Chile 2007 and the Bank of Spain\u000d\u000a      2013. [S3, S4, S5] It must be recognised that the impact of the\u000d\u000a      underpinning research is largely indirect. As discussed in Section 2, the\u000d\u000a      underpinning research in EHM (2009) [2] and HME (2013) [1] pioneered a\u000d\u000a      methodological approach that is now increasingly adopted by the economics\u000d\u000a      profession in addressing a series of issues that are of major concern to\u000d\u000a      policy makers; these include issues in both monetary and fiscal policy. In\u000d\u000a      particular, the underpinning research has contributed to an outgrowth of\u000d\u000a      research papers that have influenced discussion among policymakers about\u000d\u000a      the need for aggressive monetary and fiscal policy in the wake of the\u000d\u000a      recent Great Recession. The work has also influenced the worldwide\u000d\u000a      teaching of macro and monetary economics; it is part of the subject matter\u000d\u000a      taught in leading MPhil\/PhD programmes and has created a flow of PhD\u000d\u000a      students specialising in this broad research area internationally. [S1,\u000d\u000a      S6]\u000d\u000a    Macroeconomic Policy\u000d\u000a    As background, there has been considerable interest in the adaptive\u000d\u000a      learning approach as a way of analysing monetary policy in central banks,\u000d\u000a      e.g. see ECB\u000a        working paper1316. Since central banks are very secretive about the\u000d\u000a      way they arrive at policy decisions, the evidence of impact from the\u000d\u000a      research on learning to policy making is necessarily indirect. One way to\u000d\u000a      gauge the impact of this literature is to note that key people involved in\u000d\u000a      this particular research participate in monetary policy making decisions\u000d\u000a      in central banks. This is true for the Presidents and CEOs of the FRBs of\u000d\u000a      St Louis and San Francisco who participate in discussions of policy\u000d\u000a      options available to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the key\u000d\u000a      monetary policy making committee in the US. The San Francisco FED\u000d\u000a      President continues to do research on this topic, presenting related work\u000d\u000a      in the 2012\u000a        Learning Workshop in the FRB of St Louis and hosting a conference on\u000d\u000a      the same topic in 2013 in the San Francisco FED. The St. Louis FED\u000d\u000a      President was a keynote speaker at the CDMA conference \"Expectations\u000a        in Dynamic Macroeconomic Models\" in September 2011 at the University\u000d\u000a      of St Andrews [S3], which initiated the conferences of the same name at\u000d\u000a      the FRBs in 2012 and 2013. In addition, Prof. Mitra's long-term co-author\u000d\u000a      Dr Honkapohja is a Member of the Policy Board of the Bank of Finland,\u000d\u000a      which participates in ECB policy.\u000d\u000a    The underpinning research in Section 2 has broadly convinced the\u000d\u000a      profession that the plausible way to analyse policy changes under bounded\u000d\u000a      rationality is by using the IH approach. The methodology has inspired a\u000d\u000a      range of work in macroeconomic policy issues that in turn have been very\u000d\u000a      influential in affecting public discourse. A selection of these issues is\u000d\u000a      outlined below.\u000d\u000a    One piece of work has been the effects of fiscal policy on output in\u000d\u000a      economic models. Mitra, Evans and Honkapohja (2013) [4, 5], henceforth\u000d\u000a      MEH, show that increases in output can be significantly higher under\u000d\u000a      adaptive learning and fall within ranges reported in the empirical\u000d\u000a      literature. This work provides support to the fiscal stimulus packages\u000d\u000a      that have been adopted in various countries in the aftermath of the recent\u000d\u000a      Great Recession; a striking example is the American Recovery and\u000d\u000a      Reinvestment Act (ARRA) implemented in the US in February 2009. In\u000d\u000a      contrast under the (unrealistic) assumption of RE, the impacts of fiscal\u000d\u000a      stimulus on output are very low and well outside the range found in\u000d\u000a      empirical studies; thus under RE, there is little or no support for the\u000d\u000a      recent aggressive policies. Mitra has presented [5] at the First\u000a        Workshop [S7] of the International Network on Expectational\u000d\u000a      Coordination (INEXC) in Paris, 2012, which is an initiative supported by\u000d\u000a      the Institute\u000a        for New Economic Thinking. This work was also presented by Mitra's\u000d\u000a      co-author as part of a keynote talk at the July 2012 FRB St Louis\u000d\u000a      Conference on \"Expectations in Dynamic Macroeconomic Models as discussed\u000d\u000a      above, in the presence of the Presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks of\u000d\u000a      San Francisco and St Louis (and other members in policy circles) [S3].\u000d\u000a    In the wake of the economic crisis in 2007, central banks have had to\u000d\u000a      lower their interest rates to almost zero, creating an unprecedented\u000d\u000a      situation with various uncertainties. The methodology explained in Section\u000d\u000a      2 is a very natural modelling approach to analyse these situations and\u000d\u000a      there are an increasing number of studies using this approach. One example\u000d\u000a      is the analysis of problems, that could arise from the economy being stuck\u000d\u000a      in a deflationary state for a prolonged period of time especially when the\u000d\u000a      interest rate is at very low levels, and the consequent macroeconomic\u000d\u000a      policies that might be needed to pull the economy out of this state. This\u000d\u000a      was clearly a major concern in the US in the early 2000s which in turn was\u000d\u000a      partly influenced by the earlier experience of Japan in the 1990s. \"Expectations,\u000a        deflation traps and macroeconomic policy\" by Evans and Honkapohja\u000d\u000a      which uses the approach of EHM (2009), received widespread attention in\u000d\u000a      policy circles including at numerous conferences organised by central\u000d\u000a      banks, e.g. by the Swiss\u000a        National Bank and Norges\u000a        Bank in 2009 and by Erasmus\u000a        University in 2010 [S4, S8]. These conferences were attended by\u000d\u000a      important personalities in central banking circles including Governors of\u000d\u000a      the Central Banks of Cyprus and Norway and the Deputy Governor of the\u000d\u000a      Central Bank of Sweden; see also \"Seven\u000a        Faces of The Peril\" by the President of the St Louis FED. Like MEH\u000d\u000a      [5], this work has justified the type of aggressive monetary and fiscal\u000d\u000a      policies that have been adopted in countries since the onset of the Great\u000d\u000a      Recession. This is further detailed in the separate case study of Evans\u000d\u000a      titled \"Policy advocacy for economies in deep recessions\".\u000d\u000a    The IH approach in EHM (2009, 2012) [2, 3] has also inspired a related\u000d\u000a      strand of work on the effects of fiscal stimulus and austerity. Whether\u000d\u000a      governments should undertake fiscal stimulus to reduce unemployment or\u000d\u000a      engage in austerity because of rising concerns about debt is a hotly\u000d\u000a      debated topic since the advent of the Great Recession. Historically, some\u000d\u000a      fiscal consolidations have turned out to be expansionary and MEH [5] show\u000d\u000a      that the empirical effects of these consolidations are well captured by\u000d\u000a      the assumption of adaptive learning under the IH approach; in sharp\u000d\u000a      contrast, the assumption of RE fails to replicate important features\u000d\u000a      present in the data for these episodes. \"Liquidity\u000a        Traps and Expectation Dynamics: Fiscal Stimulus or Fiscal Austerity\"\u000d\u000a      by Benhabib, Evans and Honkapohja (2012) further analyses the global\u000d\u000a      dynamics of fiscal policies in the New Keynesian model using the IH\u000d\u000a      approach of EHM when the interest rate is subject to the zero lower bound.\u000d\u000a      This paper has been presented at the FRB\u000a        St Louis workshop in 2012 attended by the Presidents of the FRBs of\u000d\u000a      San Francisco and St Louis and at the Bank of Spain Workshop in 2013 also\u000d\u000a      attended by central banking personalities including the Deputy Governor of\u000d\u000a      the Bank of Spain [S3, S5]. A Board Member of the Bank of Finland has\u000d\u000a      cited this work in a speech\u000d\u000a      given in Istanbul in June 2012 [S9]. This work has emphasised the\u000d\u000a      importance of taking the (zero) lower bound on interest rates into account\u000d\u000a      when formulating macroeconomic policies.\u000d\u000a    Graduate Training\u000d\u000a    Mitra's underpinning research exemplified by the work listed in section 3\u000d\u000a      has made the learning literature more mainstream in macro and monetary\u000d\u000a      economics and has impacted the way the subject is taught in MPhil\/PhD\u000d\u000a      programmes in a range of universities worldwide. Learning topics have been\u000d\u000a      taught in PhD courses in top institutions like Harvard, Princeton,\u000d\u000a      Columbia, Cambridge, Oregon and Washington University, St Louis.

The usual paradigm in economics, rational expectations\u000d\u000a      (RE), unrealistically assumes complete knowledge on the part of\u000d\u000a      policymakers and households. Mitra's work has emphasised informational\u000d\u000a      limitations faced by policymakers and provides guidance for policies in\u000d\u000a      these situations. Monetary policy is an area where different types of\u000d\u000a      models are heavily used and their results are one input to the policy\u000d\u000a      decisions.

Agents need to have an\u000d\u000a      unrealistically complete level of knowledge about the economy in order to\u000d\u000a      be able to form RE. An alternative approach assumes that agents\u000d\u000a      (households, firms and policy makers) have incomplete understanding and\u000d\u000a      improve their knowledge by using simple methods. In this \"adaptive\u000d\u000a      learning\" approach, households\/central banks have vague ideas of how the\u000d\u000a      economy functions and gradually improve their understanding based on\u000d\u000a      observed data (inflation, GDP). Policymakers find this type of analysis\u000d\u000a      attractive since it is closer to their own way of thinking about the real\u000d\u000a      economy. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve said in a speech\u000a        in 2007 that \"many of the most interesting issues in contemporary\u000d\u000a      monetary theory require an analytical framework that involves learning by\u000d\u000a      private agents and possibly the central bank as well.\" While President of\u000d\u000a      the ECB said in a speech\u000a        in 2010, when discussing the limitations of existing economic and\u000d\u000a      financial models that \"we may need to consider a richer characterisation\u000d\u000a      of expectation formation. Rational expectations theory has brought\u000d\u000a      macroeconomic analysis a long way over the past four decades. But there is\u000d\u000a      a clear need to re-examine this assumption. Very encouraging work is under\u000d\u000a      way on new concepts, such as learning and rational inattention.\" This case\u000d\u000a      study is built around Impact stemming from adaptive learning models\u000d\u000a      developed by Mitra.\u000d\u000a    The focus of the early literature on adaptive learning was on whether\u000d\u000a      agents can behave as if they had RE in the long run, usually in ad hoc\u000d\u000a      models. Bullard and Mitra analysed monetary policy design in situations\u000d\u000a      with incomplete knowledge in the now standard micro-founded New Keynesian\u000d\u000a      (NK) model. Stability under adaptive learning (learnability) was\u000d\u000a      accepted as an additional criterion for good macroeconomic policies;\u000d\u000a      certain policy choices can lead to bad outcomes (in terms of high\u000d\u000a      inflation or output volatility) while others lead to good outcomes. The\u000d\u000a      approach used (the Euler Equation (EE) approach) assumed that agents'\u000d\u000a      decision horizon was short; this assumption limited their usefulness even\u000d\u000a      though important policy insights were obtained. An alternative approach\u000d\u000a      that emphasised agents have a long (even infinite) decision horizon was\u000d\u000a      developed in the middle of the past decade. This is the infinite horizon\u000d\u000a      (IH) approach relevant here.\u000d\u000a    When Mitra arrived at St Andrews in 2006, he began a new research\u000d\u000a      programme to evaluate the IH and EE approaches. With Dr Honkapohja (Bank\u000d\u000a      of Finland) and Prof. Evans (Professor of Economics at the University of\u000d\u000a      Oregon and part-time Professor at the University of St Andrews since\u000d\u000a      2007), he clarified the subtle connections between the approaches, showing\u000d\u000a      both to be valid ways of analysing monetary policy in HME (2013) [1]. In a\u000d\u000a      major study, Evans, Honkapohja and Mitra [2] developed techniques and\u000d\u000a      first results on how to model bounded rationality when policymakers make\u000d\u000a      announced policy changes. These techniques emphasized that the IH approach\u000d\u000a      is the natural way to analyse macroeconomic policy changes.\u000d\u000a      Fiscal\/tax changes involve long delays in their implementation (often\u000d\u000a      exceeding two years), and in these situations the IH approach is the\u000d\u000a      sensible one; it allows households\/firms to react to policy announcements\u000d\u000a      in advance of the policy change. In contrast, under EE learning, agents do\u000d\u000a      not react to announcements until the policy change takes place which makes\u000d\u000a      it implausible in these situations. It was recognised that the IH\u000d\u000a      approach, being forward looking, has merits in analysing future policy\u000d\u000a      changes. This is the theme of Mitra's work since 2006 supported by an ESRC\u000d\u000a      grant [6] where he is the sole investigator. This research has produced\u000d\u000a      additional papers [3, 4, 5 and EM2013]\u000d\u000a      expounding the benefits of the IH approach in analysing policy changes;\u000d\u000a      e.g. [3] has been cited in an important survey published by a leading\u000d\u000a      international monetary economist in the Annual\u000a        Review of Economics. The work of Mitra and co-authors [4, 5] are\u000d\u000a      seminal papers that introduce adaptive learning to examine the effects of\u000d\u000a      (surprise and anticipated) fiscal policies in a neoclassical model. They\u000d\u000a      show that the assumption of RE gives a misleading picture about the\u000d\u000a      effects of fiscal policy measures. When adaptive learning is realistically\u000d\u000a      incorporated, fiscal stimulus packages have a much bigger potential in\u000d\u000a      increasing GDP. This approach has also inspired work (discussed below) in\u000d\u000a      addressing other major policy concerns.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37210","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Prof Kotsogiannis' research has had clear practical impacts due to its\u000d\u000a      direct relevance to the policy debate about fiscal inefficiencies. His\u000d\u000a      findings have informed the debate on this issue both at key international\u000d\u000a      institutions and in countries directly affected through their federal\u000d\u000a      structure, including Germany, Italy, Switzerland, France, Australia,\u000d\u000a      Canada, and the US. Decentralization (`federalism') and reforms of\u000d\u000a      intergovernmental fiscal relations have been keenly debated in these\u000d\u000a      highly decentralized countries, in some cases resulting in new\u000d\u000a      legislation. These debates, and the relative merits of the reforms have\u000d\u000a      informed further research using Kotsogiannis' research, which has\u000d\u000a      influenced a similar discussion beginning in the UK, where Scottish\u000d\u000a      independence could have wide-ranging fiscal implications.\u000d\u000a    In the German state of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, the second part of a\u000d\u000a      report on revenue sharing and fiscal equalization commissioned by the\u000d\u000a      interior ministry was published in 2008 (1). The report, which\u000d\u000a      cited Kotsogiannis' research on \"accountability and fiscal equalization\",\u000d\u000a      was intensively discussed among members of the administration and state\u000d\u000a      government, and presented to a committee of the state parliament. The\u000d\u000a      initial report, published earlier in 2006, also cited Kotsogiannis'\u000d\u000a      research, and with reference to the arguments put forward in both these\u000d\u000a      documents the state government proposed a reform of the law of fiscal\u000d\u000a      equalization of the state Mecklenburg West Pomerania\u000d\u000a      (Finanzausgleichsgesetz Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, FAG M-V) in 2009. The\u000d\u000a      reports were cited extensively in the reasons given for the legislative\u000d\u000a      proposal, and the reform was duly enacted later in 2009.\u000d\u000a    Similarly, an Italian report published in 2008 (2), for the Prime\u000d\u000a      Minister (Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri), made recommendations for\u000d\u000a      federal reforms citing Kotsogiannis' work on the issues of tax base\u000d\u000a      commonality in its supporting arguments. In 2012 some proposals made by\u000d\u000a      this report were enacted by the government of Mario Monti as part of the\u000d\u000a      spending review. These included the introduction of a new `citt&#224;\u000d\u000a      metropolitana' (metropolitan municipality), to rationalise and contain\u000d\u000a      public administration costs.\u000d\u000a    In France, the French Agency for Development cited Kotsogiannis' research\u000d\u000a      in a study on decentralization (2011) (3), highlighting his name as\u000d\u000a      one of the researchers who have put the issue of overlapping taxation back\u000d\u000a      on the policy agenda.\u000d\u000a    In addition to Kotsogiannis' research informing earlier key IMF Country\u000d\u000a      Papers for Switzerland, he has presented his findings to the IMF (twice in\u000d\u000a      April and May 2008), and the World Bank (twice in March and June 2011),\u000d\u000a      with audiences in both cases being made up of staff members of these\u000d\u000a      institutions responsible for providing advice, and funds, to countries\u000d\u000a      worldwide. Kotsogiannis' findings also informed the OECD's declared goal\u000d\u000a      of helping governments re-establish healthy public finances through a 2009\u000d\u000a      report (4) entitled `Taxes and Grants: on the revenue mix of\u000d\u000a      sub-central governments', which again cites Kotsogiannis' research.\u000d\u000a    Professor Bev Dahlby (University of Alberta), an influential economist in\u000d\u000a      Canada, who holds advisory roles in both the Canadian National Statistics\u000d\u000a      Council and the Fraser Institute, cited Kotsogiannis' research in a 2008\u000d\u000a      article on British Columbia's incentive-based tax cuts (5). The\u000d\u000a      article was written for the Fraser Institute, an independent public policy\u000d\u000a      research organization which has been ranked as Canada's top think tank,\u000d\u000a      investigates the economic growth, investment, and revenue effects of\u000d\u000a      personal and corporate income taxation, which provides policy advice to\u000d\u000a      the Canadian government. Dahlby has also written a book, The Marginal\u000d\u000a        Cost of Public Funds: Theory and Applications, published in 2008,\u000d\u000a      which dedicates an entire chapter to Kotsogiannis' research.\u000d\u000a    In 2010, Dahlby gave a presentation on the Canadian experience of the\u000d\u000a      impact of tax competition between sub-central governments to the OECD in\u000d\u000a      Bern, Switzerland. In it he cited Kotsogiannis' research evidence from\u000d\u000a      Canada in front of an audience made up of members of the OECD's fiscal\u000d\u000a      federalism network (6).\u000d\u000a    In addition to the above, Kotsogiannis' work has been cited in numerous\u000d\u000a      policy documents of international organizations, such as the IMF, the\u000d\u000a      World Bank (7), (at which he acted as a consultant in 2011), the\u000d\u000a      OECD, and the EU, as well as policy documents of countries which have\u000d\u000a      undertaken public sector reforms, such as the aforementioned Germany and\u000d\u000a      Italy. His work has also directly informed research at the IMF, as shown\u000d\u000a      by an article published in 2008 (8) that explores the need for\u000d\u000a      better understanding of the relationship between fiscal decentralization\u000d\u000a      and efficiency and macroeconomic outcomes.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research carried out at the University of Exeter Business School (UoEBS)\u000d\u000a      into the design of fiscally decentralized institutions has been\u000d\u000a      instrumental in bringing `vertical fiscal externalities' (an inherent\u000d\u000a      feature of multi-level governments), and the resulting inefficiencies, to\u000d\u000a      the attention of international organizations including the International\u000d\u000a      Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic\u000d\u000a      Co-operation and Development (OECD) and governments worldwide.

This structure\u000d\u000a      can give rise to decentralised policy decisions which deliver a socially\u000d\u000a      sub-optimal result; particularly where federal and state governments share\u000d\u000a      the same tax base. Even where distinct federal levels have formally\u000d\u000a      different tax bases e.g., income and sales taxes, these may overlap in\u000d\u000a      real terms. Such shared tax bases mean that tax decisions at each level of\u000d\u000a      government elicit responses by the private sector that affect the shared\u000d\u000a      tax base, thereby giving rise to `vertical' externalities.\u000d\u000a    These issues have been the focus of research undertaken by Professor\u000d\u000a      Christos Kotsogiannis, Professor of Economics at UoEBS. Over a ten-year\u000d\u000a      period starting in 2001, when he joined the UoEBS as a lecturer, he has\u000d\u000a      collaborated with leading economists in and outside academia, including\u000d\u000a      the Deputy Director of the Fiscal Affairs Department at the IMF (since\u000d\u000a      2001); Kai Konrad, Chairman of the Council of Scientific Advisors to the\u000d\u000a      Ministry of Finance (Germany, since 2004); and Professors Sebastian\u000d\u000a      Kessing, Siegen University (since 2004) and Robert Schwager, Goettingen\u000d\u000a      University (since 2002).\u000d\u000a    Through theoretical investigation, modelling and empirical study\u000d\u000a      Professor Kotsogiannis has examined the design of fiscally decentralized\u000d\u000a      institutions, which exist commonly in countries where fiscal\u000d\u000a      responsibilities are allocated to different levels of government. His\u000d\u000a      analysis of the role of decentralized governance suggests that\u000d\u000a      intergovernmental fiscal relations need to appropriately respond to\u000d\u000a      changes in the economic environment. Early findings were presented in a\u000d\u000a      series of academic papers published in refereed international journals in\u000d\u000a      2002 (i), 2003 (ii), 2004 (iii), 2007 (iv),\u000d\u000a      2008 (v) and 2009 (vi).\u000d\u000a    Kotsogiannis' work identifies `vertical' externalities as a source of\u000d\u000a      inefficiency; extending the relevant existing literature that has instead\u000d\u000a      focused on horizontal externalities arising from mobility of the tax base\u000d\u000a      between lower-level governments. His findings elucidate the\u000d\u000a      inter-relationship and balance between horizontal and vertical\u000d\u000a      externalities in archetypal federal structures, and conclude that vertical\u000d\u000a      externalities distort levels of taxation in opposite directions.\u000d\u000a      Horizontal externalities tend to leave states' taxes too low, as each\u000d\u000a      lower-level government neglects the harm it does to others by cutting its\u000d\u000a      tax rate in order to attract a mobile tax base; whereas vertical\u000d\u000a      externalities are shown to leave lower-level taxes too high, as\u000d\u000a      lower-level governments unduly discount the pressure on federal spending\u000d\u000a      they create by raising their own tax rate.\u000d\u000a    With horizontal and vertical externalities thus pointing in opposite\u000d\u000a      directions, the research further identifies circumstances in which one\u000d\u000a      dominates the other, which can be critical for tax coordination and\u000d\u000a      important from a policy design perspective. Kotsogiannis has showed, for\u000d\u000a      instance, that vertical fiscal inefficiencies impede federally organized\u000d\u000a      countries in successfully attracting foreign direct investment due to\u000d\u000a      their limited ability to commit to a low overall tax burden.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38850","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The electricity industry in Great Britain is regulated by the Office of\u000a      Gas and Electricity Markets, Ofgem. Ofgem has to set limits on the overall\u000a      level of the prices charged for electricity transmission and distribution\u000a      to consumers, and to approve the methodology by which the particular\u000a      prices paid by each system user are set. Ofgem (or strictly speaking, its\u000a      governing Gas and Electricity Markets Authority) is also responsible for\u000a      approving or denying changes to the rules of the British Electricity\u000a      Transmission and Trading Arrangements, which interact with the prices set\u000a      by the transmission companies to determine the overall cost of buying\u000a      power.\u000a    Ofgem drew on research findings of the University of Birmingham when it\u000a      instructed the electricity industry to re-design transmission charges that\u000a      recover &#163;1.6 billion per year. This is a very significant impact because\u000a      of the geographical structure of supply of and demand for electricity.\u000a    Electricity typically flows from the north to the south of Great Britain,\u000a      and the flows have been greatest at the times of maximum demand. To\u000a      reflect the costs that these flows impose, transmission tariffs have been\u000a      based on the capacity of generators and are higher for generators in the\u000a      north than in the south. This imposes relatively high costs (per unit of\u000a      output) on renewable generators in Scotland and northern England, which\u000a      generate less per unit of capacity than most other power stations,\u000a      potentially raising the subsidy they require to break even.\u000a    Ofgem started Project TransmiT in 2010 to review whether these charging\u000a      arrangements would remain fit for purpose as the proportion of low-carbon\u000a      generation increased through 2020 and beyond. There was extensive industry\u000a      consultation, and three teams of academics were engaged to consider\u000a      whether changes to transmission prices were desirable and, if so, to\u000a      recommend changes. A fourth team produced a report on whether transmission\u000a      prices should be used to promote low-carbon generation; another team\u000a      academic peer-reviewed the reports (source 3 below).\u000a    Professor Green was recruited as the sole economist in one of the teams\u000a      on account of his extensive reputation among policy-makers in this area\u000a      (source 4); for instance, he had been a Specialist Advisor to the House of\u000a      Commons Trade and Industry Committee for two reports in 2003 and 2004. On\u000a      this team, he worked alongside four engineers from the University of\u000a      Strathclyde. Professor Green played a crucial role in the team's work\u000a      through evaluating the economic impact of several alternative\u000a      methodologies considered in their report (source 1). The team recommended\u000a      improvements to the current charging methodology; in particular that\u000a      charges per unit of electricity generated should be introduced alongside\u000a      the existing (but reduced) charges for generating capacity. The intention\u000a      was to send an approximate signal of the costs imposed by distant\u000a      generators at off-peak times but to avoid proposing radical changes that\u000a      might not be politically implementable (such concerns were discussed in R3\u000a      above). The other two academic reports proposed the radical change of\u000a      introducing a system of nodal pricing as used in the US electricity\u000a      markets (source 2, which includes references to R1 above). All the draft\u000a      reports were presented to Ofgem at a meeting in March 2011 and published\u000a      after responding to feedback from the regulator.\u000a    The regulator rejected nodal pricing as it would have involved changes to\u000a      energy trading as well as to transmission pricing (source 5). Instead, it\u000a      favoured the approach of improving the current system that was recommended\u000a      by the Birmingham-Strathclyde team (source 6). Following further analysis,\u000a      National Grid has now been directed to develop charging proposals along\u000a      these lines (source 7). This includes explicit consideration of charges\u000a      per unit of output (as recommended in source 1); much of the industry\u000a      analysis had been of charges per MW of capacity that would be linked to\u000a      the generator's load factor, and hence mathematically equivalent to\u000a      charges per unit of output.\u000a    The research has thus fundamentally shaped a significant change to the\u000a      future of electricity pricing in Great Britain, affecting the costs\u000a      incurred by the industry and the payments made by every consumer in the\u000a      country. These \"Transmission Network Use of System\" charges amounted to\u000a      &#163;1.58 billion in 2009\/10 (source 1, pp 23-24). Ofgem are still working to\u000a      quantify the benefits from the changes, but their broad conclusion is that\u000a      \"cost reflectivity drives more efficient decisions by market participants\u000a      and policy makers which creates value for consumers\" (source 6, page 5);\u000a      this is the key theme which was expanded and quantified in the research\u000a      presented in section 2 of this case study.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The energy regulator, Ofgem, drew on research from the University of\u000a        Birmingham when it instructed the electricity industry to re-design\u000a        transmission charges that recover &#163;1.6 billion per year. This\u000a      instruction, issued in May 2012, was the culmination of Project TransmiT\u000a      which Ofgem launched in September 2010.

One strand of\u000a      his research concerned the best way to organise the electricity wholesale\u000a      market in which generators sell power to the retailers (\"suppliers\" in the\u000a      UK) who then sell it on to customers. One of the key challenges is that\u000a      the location of the generator determines whether or not its output can\u000a      safely be accepted onto the network (over-loading the lines can lead to a\u000a      nation-wide blackout in the event of a failure) and also affects the\u000a      proportion of the generated power that can be delivered to customers. A\u000a      market mechanism known as nodal pricing has been adopted in\u000a      several parts of the US to take account of these factors, allowing prices\u000a      to vary across the power network to reflect the true marginal cost of\u000a      meeting extra demand at each point. In Great Britain, most electricity\u000a      trades ignore the generator's location on the network, but National Grid,\u000a      the system operator, then has to adjust the output from particular\u000a      generators to ensure that the physical constraints are met. These trades\u000a      are limited to meeting those constraints and do not result in a fully\u000a      optimal solution.\u000a    The research published in output 1 (R1; 2007) asked how important the\u000a      failure to reach an optimal solution was. It used a techno-economic model\u000a      of generation and transmission in England and Wales to calculate the\u000a      dispatch of power stations, and the resulting prices, under different\u000a      pricing rules. These included the current system, the \"optimal\" solution\u000a      of nodal pricing, and hybrids under which either consumers or generators\u000a      faced regionally differentiated prices. The research found that the\u000a      welfare benefits from moving to the optimal nodal prices were equal to\u000a      about 1 per cent of the wholesale market's turnover, that these came\u000a      mostly from exposing consumers to the true marginal cost of their\u000a      consumption, and that there were significant inter-regional welfare gains\u000a      and losses. The benefits of giving generators alone a price signal were\u000a      small.\u000a    Interdisciplinary research with electrical engineers from Strathclyde\u000a      (R2; 2007) asked how sensitive the transmission charges used in Great\u000a      Britain would be to different scenarios for the future evolution of\u000a      electricity generation to 2020. The differences between scenarios were\u000a      relatively small.\u000a    Another strand of research looked at the challenges of integrating\u000a      renewables and the demands that this would place on the spot market\u000a      mechanisms. Output 3 (R3; 2008) compared the generic wholesale market\u000a      designs used in the US and in Europe, and concluded that the balance of\u000a      advantage was swinging towards the US design, based on nodal pricing.\u000a      Output 4 (R4; 2010) continued this work, quantifying the swings in demand\u000a      and possible constraints on the England-Scotland border that the market\u000a      would have to cope with in Great Britain.\u000a    The majority of the research was funded by the Engineering and Physical\u000a      Sciences Research Council, under two Supergen Grants (details below). The\u000a      Principal Investigator on both grants was Professor J McDonald (University\u000a      of Strathclyde); Professor Green was a co-investigator, and was a\u000a      workstream leader on the second project\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38851","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Birmingham research findings have contributed to high profile\u000a      public and policy debates on the likely effect on crime patterns of\u000a      reductions in police staffing levels and changes to criminal justice\u000a      policy.

The second report, Acquisitive\u000a      Crime: Imprisonment, Detection and Social Factors (July 2012), put\u000a      forward the analysis of the impact of sentencing on crime levels (Source\u000a      2).The Deputy Director of Civitas has said that these reports \"...proved\u000a      to be of urgent interest to the public, the press, as well as several\u000a      government bodies\" and provoked significant high-level debate amongst\u000a      criminologists and policy researchers (source 3).\u000a    Civitas accompanied the publication of these reports with press releases\u000a      which highlighted the challenge they presented to public policy. They said\u000a      the March 2011 report challenged Government claims that police cuts would\u000a      not endanger the public; and that the 2012 report showed that tougher\u000a      prison sentences would actually contribute to reducing property crime\u000a      (source 4). These were &#8212; and remain &#8212; issues of extensive public and\u000a      political concern, and led to further comment in the national press and\u000a      within the policing policy community.\u000a    The reports were circulated to civil servants in the Home Office and\u000a      Ministry of Justice by Civitas, leading to a meeting between Bandyopadhyay\u000a      and senior Ministry of Justice officials who, as a result, expressed an\u000a      interest in expanding their evidence base. This developing relationship\u000a      was followed-up by a high profile seminar organised by Civitas in November\u000a      2012, where Bandyopadhyay used these findings to debate crime policy with\u000a      Richard Garside, Director of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies (an\u000a      independent body, established in 1931, that works for a safe and just\u000a      society), before an audience of Whitehall officials, including the\u000a      Ministry of Justice's Chief Scientific Adviser and representatives from\u000a      the Police Foundation (an independent think tank concerned with developing\u000a      knowledge and understanding of policing and crime reduction).\u000a    There was also growing media response to the Civitas reports. The\u000a      findings on the impact of detection were reported in The Guardian\u000a      (7th January 2011) under the headline \"Police cuts will boost\u000a      crime says thinktank Civitas\", prompting comment from the police minister\u000a      at the time, Nick Herbert MP, and a response from his Labour shadow. The\u000a      first commissioned report prompted further coverage, including from the Daily\u000a      Mail (Mail Online, 14th March 2011) focusing on the\u000a      effect cuts in police spending could have on crime levels (source 5).\u000a    Typical of the debate prompted by the analysis of the effect of\u000a      sentencing was an article in The Observer, \"Longer prison terms\u000a      really do cut crime, study shows\" (7th July 2012) which\u000a      generated 282 reader comments and the subsequent response in The Daily\u000a      Telegraph on 11th July (generating a further 477\u000a      comments), with other pieces in The Daily Express and The\u000a      Sunday Times. In response, Jack Straw MP, the former Secretary of\u000a      State for Justice, wrote an opinion piece (12th July 2012)\u000a      commenting on the Birmingham research findings in the CIVITAS report. The\u000a      CIVITAS report was particularly timely as government ministers, especially\u000a      the Secretary of State for Justice at the time, the Rt. Hon. Kenneth\u000a      Clarke MP, were debating with some of their backbench colleagues about\u000a      whether there was evidence that \"prison worked\" (source 6).\u000a    Policing websites and blogs also commented on the findings; for instance,\u000a      Simon Reed, Vice-Chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales\u000a      (the national organization representing 124,000 police officers),\u000a      commented that this was a significant report which showed \"that a\u000a      reduction in police officer numbers as a result of a 20 percent cut to\u000a      policing is highly likely to lead to increased crime rates and create a\u000a      more dangerous society\" (source 7).\u000a    Understanding falling crime rates\u000a    Bandyopadhyay participated in a panel discussion on `Why crime rates are\u000a      falling' organised by the Criminal Justice Alliance (CJA) in April 2013.\u000a      The CJA is a coalition of 70 organisations &#8212; including campaigning\u000a      charities, voluntary sector service providers, research institutions,\u000a      staff associations and trade unions &#8212; committed to improving policy and\u000a      practice across the criminal justice system.\u000a    Alongside Bandyopadhyay, the other panellists were Professor Mike Hough\u000a      (Professor of Criminal Policy and Co-Director of the Institute for\u000a      Criminal Policy Research, Birkbeck College, University of London), Richard\u000a      Garside, Director, Centre for Crime and Justice Studies, and Sara\u000a      Thornton, Chief Constable, Thames Valley Police. The panel discussion was\u000a      chaired by Mark Easton, the BBC's Home Editor and the audience included\u000a      representatives from the Home Office, the Sentencing Council (an\u000a      independent body created by the Ministry of Justice to promote greater\u000a      transparency and consistency in sentencing), the Howard League for Penal\u000a      Reform (a long-established criminal justice charity), the Police\u000a      Foundation, the Police Federation, and NACRO (which works with offenders\u000a      and those at risk of offending). This enabled Bandyopadhyay to disseminate\u000a      his work to a wide audience of government policy makers, professions and\u000a      agencies working in various parts of the criminal justice system, and\u000a      influential think tanks shaping policy and practice.\u000a    The Office of National Statistics (ONS) cited this research as one of the\u000a      possible explanations of reductions in acquisitive crime in England and\u000a      Wales in their publication Trends in Crime &#8212; A Short Story 2011\/12\u000a      (July 2012) (source 8). Bandyopadhyay's analysis was also reported in The\u000a      Economist (April 20th 2013) (source 9) as part of an analysis of\u000a      crime trends. Subsequent articles published by Police Life and Metropolitan\u000a      Life (both May 2013) by Bandyopadhyay, both professional journals\u000a      targeted at serving police officers, have also drawn upon his research in\u000a      analysing changing crime patterns.This has shown that the data can be used\u000a      to provide a consistent explanation for crime patterns.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Critical public policy debates on the likely effect of reductions in\u000a        police staffing levels and on understanding the implications of crime\u000a        patterns have been informed by findings from research conducted at the\u000a        University of Birmingham by Dr Siddhartha Bandyopadhyay.

The research\u000a      involves theoretical modelling as well as empirical analysis. The\u000a      theoretical research uses game theoretic modelling and provides an\u000a      understanding of how innovative policies such as encouraging citizen\u000a      reporting interact with standard policing and socio-economic factors in\u000a      affecting the incentive to commit crime. The empirical analysis looks at\u000a      the strength of the various determinants of crime, including the impact of\u000a      several policy variables such as the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 and the\u000a      Crime and Disorder Act 1998. The main findings from the research are:\u000a    1. An increase in crime detection by the police has an unambiguous impact\u000a      in lowering crime rates and so is an important deterrent.\u000a    2. The relationship between prison sentencing and crime rates is complex.\u000a      Prison sentences are lower for some categories, e.g. fraud and forgery,\u000a      but not for others, e.g. theft and handling. Short sentences do not\u000a      necessarily deter crime and in fact may even increase it as prison\u000a      introduces inmates to criminal networks leading to greater crime\u000a      opportunities once out of prison. For serious crimes, sentences may need\u000a      to be longer; longer sentences deter would-be criminals and keep hardened\u000a      criminals away from the public.\u000a    3. Socio-economic factors like inequality, employment and wages have a\u000a      less clear-cut role on variation in crime rates as changes in these\u000a      factors affect both costs and benefits of crime, making the net effect\u000a      ambiguous. Further, socio-economic factors affect crime differently across\u000a      high and low crime areas; for example, the impact of unemployment in\u000a      increasing crime is strongest in high crime areas.\u000a    4. Innovative measures like citizen reporting can be counterproductive\u000a      since without adequate training in crime detection, citizens may misread\u000a      innocent activity as criminal and thus waste police resources by directing\u000a      attention towards them. This leaves fewer resources to solve actual crimes\u000a      and criminals can take advantage of citizens misreporting crime by\u000a      generating false reports. Citizen bias about some groups having higher\u000a      crime rates can be self-perpetuating i.e. an initial bias can become true.\u000a      If citizens are known for their bias towards a group, law enforcement\u000a      treats reports about that group less seriously. The group in question\u000a      recognises that reports about them will be investigated less thoroughly\u000a      and would therefore have more incentives to commit crime. Thus the initial\u000a      bias against them leads to higher crime rates in that group even when\u000a      their propensity to commit crime is identical to other groups\u000a    The policy implications are:\u000a    \u000a      Initiatives to increase detection rates should be encouraged.\u000a      High levels of detection should be widely publicised to deter\u000a        potential criminals.\u000a      Non-custodial alternatives to short sentences should be actively\u000a        considered.\u000a      Citizen reporting and target group profiling need to be carefully\u000a        implemented.\u000a    \u000a    The research is novel for three reasons:\u000a    1. On the theoretical side, in its mathematical modelling of innovative\u000a      policies such as citizen engagement in crime reporting. To date there is\u000a      very little formal analysis of the way crime across groups is affected by\u000a      encouraging citizens to report signals of incipient criminal activity. The\u000a      research thus fills a gap in our understanding of complementary crime\u000a      policies which encourage citizen reporting by mapping out the mechanisms\u000a      by which it affects criminal activity.\u000a    2. On the empirical side, it uses modern econometric techniques to\u000a      separate out causation from mere correlation, and in modelling crime\u000a      dynamics by including a lagged dependent variable. Inclusion of a lagged\u000a      dependent variable poses estimation challenges which are overcome using\u000a      appropriate econometric techniques\u000a    3. In the use of both theoretical and empirical modelling to answer\u000a      specific policy questions such as: a) under what conditions are\u000a      neighbourhood reporting schemes useful in lowering crime? and b) are short\u000a      prison sentences counterproductive in terms of crime reduction? Question\u000a      a) is answered using a game theoretic model which derives conditions under\u000a      which neighbourhood reporting is useful and b) is answered empirically by\u000a      using a quadratic specification (instead of a linear regression model as\u000a      is standard) and estimating `turning points' for prison sentences below\u000a      which they increase rather than reduce crime.\u000a    The research commenced in 2004 and continues to date. This ongoing\u000a      research agenda is led by Dr. S. Bandyopadhyay, who joined the University\u000a      of Birmingham in 2003 and is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of\u000a      Economics. Two of the co-authors were in Birmingham during a substantial\u000a      part of the research: Dr. Lu Han as a PhD student from 2004-9 and Dr.\u000a      Marianna Koli as a Teaching Fellow from 2010-11.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39825","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    A 2010 survey of British political scientists by the Institute for\u000a      Government voted the National Minimum Wage (NMW) the most successful\u000a      government policy of the last 30 years (http:\/\/www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk\/events\/policy-reunion-national-minimum-wage).\u000a      As Tim Butcher, LPC Chief Economist, notes in his written testimonial,\u000a      `Professor Dickens' work has played an important role in achieving that\u000a      outcome'. Direct impacts of this research have included raising the wages\u000a      of thousands of young workers.\u000a    Research by Dickens and colleagues [see Section 3, R2 , R6] on the age\u000a      from which the NMW for adults is paid had a direct impact on young workers\u000a      through a change in legislation in 2010 whereby 21-year-olds became\u000a      eligible for the adult NMW (NMW Regulations 2010). This research was\u000a      commissioned by the LPC (Project LPC 2009-10) and findings were presented\u000a      to the LPC in the form of a report and presentations to Commissioners and\u000a      the Secretariat in April and October 2009.\u000a    The LPC had previously recommended to the government that the adult rate\u000a      should apply at age 21 rather than age 22. The government rejected this\u000a      proposal but the LPC persisted. In reporting to the government in 2009-10,\u000a      the LPC cited R2 and R6 in re-asserting their case. The research by\u000a      Dickens et al. was instrumental in persuading the government to\u000a      finally accept the LPC recommendations [see Section 5, testimonials]. The\u000a      change in legislation came into effect in October 2010 [C7]; workers aged\u000a      21 years were to be paid at the adult rather than the youth (development)\u000a      rate of the NMW. This resulted in a 20 per cent increase in the legislated\u000a      minimum wage for 21-year-olds. The LPC estimated that 55,000 young workers\u000a      benefited from this pay increase (see LPC 2010, p. 118) [C3].\u000a    The conclusions from the research were that there was no evidence of any\u000a      harmful effects on employment from paying 21-year-olds the adult rate.\u000a      These conclusions, and the reasoning behind them, were presented to the\u000a      LPC through a number of mechanisms outlined below. The 2010 LPC Report\u000a      stated that:\u000a    The research [R2] suggested that lowering the starting age of the adult\u000a      rate to 21 could actually increase employment of 21-year-olds. They\u000a      concluded that there would be little harm to the employment prospects of\u000a      21-year-olds in legislating to start the adult minimum wage rate at age\u000a      21. We continue to believe there is a case for applying the adult rate\u000a      from age 21.\u000a    Other studies by Dickens et al. [R1, R3, R5] are heavily cited by\u000a      the LPC in various reports (LPC 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013) [C2, C4-C6]. The\u000a      LPC seeks to build consensus across employee, employer and independent\u000a      members of the Commission and relies on an evidence base in its\u000a      deliberations. The evidence in R5 and R7 of negative impacts on employment\u000a      effects for part-time women was discussed extensively at an LPC workshop\u000a      in October 2011. This and the work on the age-related structure of the NMW\u000a      [R2, R6] informed subsequent LPC deliberations over the impact of the NMW\u000a      on vulnerable workers in the recession. Independent Member, Machin states:\u000a    It (the research by Dickens, Riley and Wilkinson) also fed in to\u000a      discussions in the last few years where the uprating of the youth\u000a      development rate was detached from that of the adult minimum because of\u000a      concerns about the employment position of younger workers during the\u000a      economic downturn.\u000a    R4 informs understanding of both the policy effectiveness of the NMW and\u000a      the methodological issues that may arise in the analysis of its employment\u000a      effects. After almost two decades of rising wage inequality, pay\u000a      differentials at the bottom of the distribution began to fall in the late\u000a      1990s. This work strongly supports the view that the NMW was largely\u000a      responsible for the observed falls and excludes most other explanations\u000a      such as migration, skill changes, etc. This provides the LPC and the\u000a      government with strong validation for the use of the NMW as a policy tool\u000a      and also allays fears that the NMW would lead to a significant wage-price\u000a      spiral as workers above the NMW try to maintain differentials. For\u000a      example, LPC Chief Economist Butcher's testimonial states:\u000a    This research, along with previous econometric analysis of the impact of\u000a      the NMW on differentials, suggests that this does not appear to have\u000a      happened to any significant extent. As a consequence, Commissioners have\u000a      not placed as much weight on these concerns as they did in the earlier\u000a      years of the Commission.\u000a    All the underpinning research cited was either funded by the LPC or\u000a      conducted jointly with LPC Chief Economist Butcher.

His work led to a legislative change (which became\u000a      effective in October 2010) whereby the starting age for eligibility for\u000a      the adult National Minimum Wage (NMW) was reduced from 22 to 21 years old.\u000a    More generally, Dickens' research on the wage and employment effects of\u000a      the NMW has long informed the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission\u000a      (LPC) &#8212; on the rate at which the NMW is set, on the associated regulations\u000a      and on the LPC's evaluation of the impact of the NMW.

Excerpt from written testimonial:\u000a    Professor Richard Dickens has been one of the most important contributors\u000a      to the evidence base of the LPC since it was established in 1997... His\u000a      most influential work has probably been on the impact of the minimum wage\u000a      on the employment of young people... They concluded that there would be\u000a      little harm to the employment prospects of 21-year- olds in legislating to\u000a      start the adult rate of the NMW at 21. This was a very important factor in\u000a      strengthening our evidence base sufficiently to convince the Government to\u000a      change policy. The starting age of adult rate was changed to 21 in October\u000a      2010.\u000a    Deputy Director, Analysis, Briefing and Minimum Wage, Department for\u000a      Business, Innovation and Skills. Written testimonial:\u000a    I, Bill Wells, as the civil servant responsible for National Minimum Wage\u000a      policy can confirm the research on young workers undertaken by Dickens,\u000a      Riley and Wilkinson. The LPC were considering at what age the adult rate\u000a      of the NMW should begin. This resulted in a recommendation that the adult\u000a      rate should be lowered from age 22 to 21. The research by Dickens, Riley\u000a      and Wilkinson was an important contributor to the recommendation from the\u000a      LPC and also to our advice that ministers should accept the\u000a      recommendation.\u000a    Independent Member, LPC. Excerpt from written testimonial:\u000a    I am writing ... as one of the nine Low Pay Commissioners to confirm the\u000a      importance of the research by Professor Dickens (and colleagues) on the\u000a      age variation of the UK National Minimum Wage. The research they undertook\u000a      (The Impact on Employment of the Age- Related Increases in the National\u000a        Minimum Wage, with Riley and Wilkinson) had an important impact on\u000a      the LPC deliberations on age-based variations in the minimum wage, and on\u000a      the Commission's recommendations to government on this matter. \u000a    ","Title":"\u000a    Improving the labour market experiences of young people through Britain's\u000a      National Minimum Wage\u000a    ","UKLocation":[],"UKRegion":[],"UOA":"Economics and Econometrics","UnderpinningResearch":"\u000a    Dickens' research on minimum wages dates back to the early 1990s, but the\u000a      research underpinning this specific impact occurred in the period 2007-12.\u000a      All the research cited was undertaken for the Low Pay Commission (LPC) and\u000a      presented in various LPC annual reports. Dickens' co-researchers on these\u000a      studies were Riley and Wilkinson (National Institute for Economic and\u000a      Social Research, NIESR), Dolton (Sussex), Butcher (LPC) and Manning (LSE).\u000a    Estimating the impact of the NMW in Britain has proved problematic since\u000a      no sizeable groups are excluded from coverage. Consequently, finding a\u000a      suitable control group with which to compare outcomes is difficult. In\u000a      their work for the LPC's 2010 Report, Dickens et al. (2010) [see\u000a      Section 3, R2] and (2013) [R6] exploit the age-related structure of the\u000a      NMW to investigate the effects of turning 22, and qualifying for the adult\u000a      NMW.\u000a    The study uses a `regression discontinuity' design to analyse the effect\u000a      on the various labour- market outcomes of the legislated difference that\u000a      existed between 1999 and 2009 in the NMW for 21- and 22-year-olds. The\u000a      results suggest a 3-4 percentage point increase in the employment rate of\u000a      low-skilled individuals as a result of the higher NMW paid at age 22,\u000a      explained in part by declines in male unemployment and female inactivity.\u000a      They find no such effect before the NMW was introduced and no robust\u000a      impacts at ages 21 or 23. The research concludes that there would be\u000a      little negative effect on employment from paying the adult minimum wage to\u000a      21-year-olds.\u000a    More broadly, existing evidence on the effects of the NMW on all workers\u000a      suggested that, while it raised the pay of affected workers, it had no\u000a      impact on employment. But this work had not focused on the most vulnerable\u000a      workers in terms of low pay and it used data from a period when economic\u000a      conditions were buoyant. Dickens et al. (2012) [R5, R7] use data\u000a      on individuals' employment histories between 1994 and 2010, a period\u000a      including the late 2000's recession. The study uses a `differences in\u000a      differences' approach to compare changes in employment retention among\u000a      those directly affected by the NMW with a group of workers who are paid\u000a      slightly more than the NMW. It finds that, for the most vulnerable workers\u000a      &#8212; namely part-time females &#8212; the NMW appears to be associated with\u000a      reductions in employment. In addition, the effect of the 2008 recession,\u000a      combined with the NMW, appears to lead to further falls in employment\u000a      among this group.\u000a    The results of Dickens and Dolton (2011) [R3] are based on data for\u000a      wages-council sectors from the 1970s to the 1990s. The study examines the\u000a      impact of industry-level minimum wages for the recessions of the early\u000a      1980s and 1990s but, in contrast to the results in R5, it finds no\u000a      employment impact from the minimum wage and no additional impacts in the\u000a      recession years. Finally, Butcher et al. (2012) [R4] examine the\u000a      impact of the NMW on pay distribution. Although the NMW never affects the\u000a      pay of more than 5 per cent of workers, inequality at the bottom end of\u000a      the pay distribution has declined, with relative wage increases up to the\u000a      25th percentile. This research develops a theoretical model of\u000a      `spillovers', whereby changes in the NMW have effects further up the wage\u000a      distribution. The empirical findings provide support for modest spillovers\u000a      from the NMW since its introduction that explain a sizeable proportion of\u000a      the observed changes in wage inequality.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39831","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The `social cost of carbon' (SCC) is an estimate of the monetary value of\u000d\u000a      the damages associated with a small increase in CO2 emissions.\u000d\u000a      The figure is meant to approximate losses from incremental climate change,\u000d\u000a      such as flood damage, disease, diminished crop production, etc.\u000d\u000a      Conversely, this monetary figure also represents the value of damages\u000d\u000a      avoided for a given emissions reduction.\u000d\u000a    In the United States, the SCC is incorporated into the cost-benefit\u000d\u000a      analyses of measures to reduce CO2 emissions. Until 2010,\u000d\u000a      different federal agencies used, if at all, a range of estimates for the\u000d\u000a      SCC. Since then a dozen agencies, from the EPA to the Department of\u000d\u000a      Transportation, decided to standardise their estimates of the SCC. The\u000d\u000a      original estimate was set at $21 per tonne of CO2 in 2010 by a\u000d\u000a      working group of experts from several government agencies, led by the\u000d\u000a      Council of Economic Advisers and the Office of Management and Budget.\u000d\u000a    These initial estimates of the SCC in 2010 derive from estimates provided\u000d\u000a      by an earlier version of the FUND model and two other Integrated\u000d\u000a      Assessment Models: DICE (Yale University) and PAGE (Cambridge University).\u000d\u000a      These estimates have been used to justify more stringent fuel efficiency\u000d\u000a      standards for new motor vehicles (EPA and Department of Transportation\u000d\u000a      2010) [see Section 5, C5] and energy efficiency standards for many\u000d\u000a      appliances (Department of Energy 2012) [C4]. The Federal Register reveals\u000d\u000a      that the SCC has been cited in 31 rules.\u000d\u000a    Richard Tol has worked as a consultant and adviser to the EPA since 2007.\u000d\u000a      In this role, he has been instrumental in helping the EPA to understand\u000d\u000a      the economic impacts of climate change and the methods and assumptions\u000d\u000a      that underpin estimates of the SCC. The FUND model has been developed by\u000d\u000a      Tol to study climate policy. Improvements and modifications to the model\u000d\u000a      are conducted by Tol with Anthoff and their collaborators. EPA staff have\u000d\u000a      been trained in the use of the FUND model. The application of the latest\u000d\u000a      peer-reviewed version of the model is performed by EPA staff under the\u000d\u000a      guidance of Tol and Anthoff.\u000d\u000a    In May 2013, the Obama administration increased the SCC to be used by\u000d\u000a      federal agencies to $38 per tonne of carbon. The new SCC recommendations\u000d\u000a      of the InterAgency Working Group draw on the revised version of the FUND\u000d\u000a      (FUND 3.7) model along with estimates from the other two IAMs. This model,\u000d\u000a      and the associated revisions, derive from Tol's research.\u000d\u000a    The new SCC currently applies only to energy-efficiency regulations for\u000d\u000a      microwave ovens (Department of Energy 2013) [C1]. However, the\u000d\u000a      standardisation of rates in 2010 means that it will apply to any\u000d\u000a      new or revised regulation by any branch of the US government from\u000d\u000a      June 2013 onwards. Consequently, the potential reach of this impact is\u000d\u000a      large as, over time, the new SCC will be extended to energy-efficiency\u000d\u000a      regulations covering all appliances, vehicles, machinery and buildings.\u000d\u000a      Proposed rules have been issued for metal halide lamp fixtures, commercial\u000d\u000a      refrigeration equipment, walk-in coolers and freezers, and residential\u000d\u000a      furnace fans.\u000d\u000a    However, even the impact of the new microwave legislation alone on both\u000d\u000a      consumers and the environment is substantial. The higher cost of carbon\u000d\u000a      implies that the estimated environmental damage from inefficient microwave\u000d\u000a      ovens is much higher than previously calculated. The legislation applies\u000d\u000a      to their energy use when in standby mode. Consequently, producers will be\u000d\u000a      forced to withdraw inefficient microwave ovens from the marketplace,\u000d\u000a      resulting in significant energy savings for consumers and a reduction in\u000d\u000a      greenhouse gas emissions. Estimates suggest $2.3 billion of savings for\u000d\u000a      consumers over coming decades and a reduction of 38 million tonnes in CO2\u000d\u000a      emissions (Department of Energy 2013) [C1].\u000d\u000a    The revised SCC is already being used in draft legislation in a number of\u000d\u000a      key areas. The SCC is used to underpin the draft rules for methane leaking\u000d\u000a      from shale oil and gas extraction, and for CO2 emissions from\u000d\u000a      new power plants (the final rule is in preparation http:\/\/epa.gov\/carbonpollutionstandard\/index.html\u000d\u000a      &#8212; see EPA (2012) [C6] for the regulatory impact analysis of the proposed\u000d\u000a      rule). The latter rules aim to make coal-fired electricity less\u000d\u000a      competitive.\u000d\u000a    The new SCC estimates are also feeding into proposed effluent regulations\u000d\u000a      for power plants (EPA 2013) [C2]. The EPA is proposing regulation that\u000d\u000a      would strengthen the controls on discharges from certain steam electric\u000d\u000a      power plants. These plants currently contribute 50-60 per cent of all\u000d\u000a      toxic pollutants discharged into US surface waters. The EPA is considering\u000d\u000a      four possible options for legislation, which have a large potential for\u000d\u000a      emissions reductions.\u000d\u000a    The revised SCC has already had direct impact on legislation for\u000d\u000a      microwave ovens. It is being used in draft legislation for power plants.\u000d\u000a      Any change in legislation from June 2013 will adopt the revised SCC. On 25\u000d\u000a      June 2013, President Obama outlined his `Climate Action Plan' (Obama 2013)\u000d\u000a      [C8]. This includes a raft of proposed legislation to cut US CO2\u000d\u000a      emissions over the coming decades. Implicit in these regulations is the\u000d\u000a      newly adopted SCC. Consequently, the current impact of Tol's work will\u000d\u000a      expand across a wide range of policy areas in the United States in future\u000d\u000a      decades.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The US government's announcement of an increase in the `social cost of\u000d\u000a      carbon' (SCC) from $24 to $38 a tonne has been made on the basis of\u000d\u000a      research by Richard Tol, of the University of Sussex.

The `Climate Framework for Uncertainty, Negotiation and\u000d\u000a        Distribution' (FUND) is an IAM developed by Richard Tol and his\u000d\u000a      students, notably David Anthoff (UC, Berkeley). FUND is a dynamic computer\u000d\u000a      model that continually updates in the light of changing assumptions and\u000d\u000a      new estimates of key parameters. Modelled impacts include agriculture,\u000d\u000a      forestry, sea levels, a range of diseases, energy use, water resources,\u000d\u000a      unmanaged ecosystems, and tropical and extra-tropical storm impacts.\u000d\u000a    The source code, data and a technical description of the model are\u000d\u000a      available at http:\/\/www.fund-model.org.\u000d\u000a      The most recent version (FUND 3.7) was developed on the basis of Tol's\u000d\u000a      research in 2012-13. The research papers in Section 3, R1-R6, have all\u000d\u000a      informed the development of the FUND 3.7 software in terms of providing\u000d\u000a      improved estimates and sensitivity analysis with respect to key parameters\u000d\u000a      of the model. R3 describes the model (an earlier version was published as\u000d\u000a      a working paper in September 2011; the published article uses a later\u000d\u000a      version of the model, developed in 2012).\u000d\u000a    FUND is considerably more complex than other IAMs and is able to assess\u000d\u000a      the relative importance of parameters not included in other models, such\u000d\u000a      as the sensitivity of different sectors and regions to climate change and\u000d\u000a      changes in vulnerability and relative prices with development. FUND 3.7 is\u000d\u000a      the first sophisticated version of this software to investigate the\u000d\u000a      relative contribution of all uncertain parameters on the SCC, when all\u000d\u000a      parameters are varied simultaneously. It is this version that has been\u000d\u000a      instrumental in producing the new estimates of the SCC adopted by the US\u000d\u000a      government.\u000d\u000a    There is large uncertainty about the SCC. R3 analyses the structure of\u000d\u000a      that uncertainty using FUND 3.7 by providing a decomposition of the\u000d\u000a      relative contribution of key parameters to the variation in the estimates\u000d\u000a      of the SCC. This also sets the priorities for further research. For\u000d\u000a      example, increased demand for air-conditioning in response to climate\u000d\u000a      change and economic growth emerge as important yet poorly understood\u000d\u000a      parameters.\u000d\u000a    R5 and R2 provide the first estimates of the economic impact of ocean\u000d\u000a      acidification, a problem closely related to climate change and also caused\u000d\u000a      by CO2 emissions. R1 uses FUND to investigate the `Schelling\u000d\u000a      conjecture', which asserts that economic development provides the best\u000d\u000a      defence against the impact of climate change. Thus, under this notion,\u000d\u000a      poverty implies vulnerability to climate change, and accelerated economic\u000d\u000a      growth may therefore be more cost-effective than emission abatement in\u000d\u000a      reducing the impact of climate change. The study shows that this holds\u000d\u000a      only for the least-developed countries.\u000d\u000a    R6 estimates the SCC as a function of the uncertainty about climate\u000d\u000a      change and demonstrates that emission reduction puts an upper bound on the\u000d\u000a      expected value of the SCC &#8212; extending Weitzman's `Dismal Theorem',\u000d\u000a      which states that society faces an arbitrarily large expected loss from\u000d\u000a      `fat tails' or high-consequence, low-probability scenarios. The research\u000d\u000a      shows that this only holds without climate policy. Greenhouse\u000d\u000a      gas-emission reduction rapidly thins the undesirable tail.\u000d\u000a    R4 considers alternative criteria for decision-making under fat-tailed\u000d\u000a      uncertainty, such as minimax regret, minimum tail risk and thinnest tail.\u000d\u000a      The authors find that the implied carbon prices corresponding to these\u000d\u000a      different criteria do not differ much from the SCC now advocated by the US\u000d\u000a      government on the basis of Tol's research.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40284","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The main pathways to impact were through Grout's central involvement in\u000a      Ofgem's key decisions and through his advisory role to various government\u000a      agencies.\u000a    4.1 Impact through Ofgem\u000a    Amongst many other activities, Ofgem sets the prices (allowed revenues)\u000a      that electricity and gas transmission companies (e.g., National Grid), and\u000a      the gas and electricity network operators can charge. Professor Grout's\u000a      research into private delivery of public services, including his research\u000a      into the interaction of regulation and the cost of capital of regulated\u000a      companies, impacts directly on the appropriate allowed revenues of\u000a      regulated companies. This research and his analysis of optimal structures\u000a      of delivery by the public sector led him to be appointed as the sole\u000a      special advisor of the key regulatory committees of the Ofgem Board (since\u000a      2008), and to the Board of Ofgem in 2012.\u000a    The UK approach to the provision of offshore transmission (i.e., the\u000a      transmission of electricity from offshore wind farms) is akin to a\u000a      traditional PPP model, and Grout's research into the assessment of when\u000a      PPPs are the appropriate model of delivery, when they can provide value\u000a      for money, and the appropriate rates of discount for a meaningful\u000a      public\/private comparison, led to him being appointed as Chair of Ofgem's\u000a      Offshore Committee (which deals with offshore transmission and\u000a      international interconnection) in January 2013. In addition, he has\u000a      chaired the key regulatory committees in the absence of the chairman of\u000a      the board and has chaired settlement committees that impose `fines' on\u000a      energy companies for failing to meet the legal obligations in their\u000a      licence.\u000a    In December 2012 alone the board and these committees, in a series of\u000a      decisions, granted over &#163;50bn of approved revenues for regulated\u000a      transmission and distribution companies. The fines on energy companies run\u000a      into millions of pounds. These decisions impact directly on almost every\u000a      individual and organisation in the UK. In addition to the impact on\u000a      household bills, energy prices affect UK business costs and profits which\u000a      impact on consumer prices both in the UK and around the world. They thus\u000a      also affect UK competitiveness and government tax revenues.\u000a    In recognition of his key contributions public officials have stated:\u000a      Professor Grout's `knowledge drawn from his research into the cost of\u000a      capital of regulated companies and how they are affected by the political\u000a      environment and large `one-off' events and his research into the decision\u000a      making processes of the Competition Commission have moulded final\u000a      decisions we have taken in these price reviews', (Chief Executive, Ofgem\u000a      [a]). Professor Grout's `voice has been significant, incisive and\u000a      important' ... `contributing a wealth of economic knowledge and\u000a      experience' (Chairman of the Board of Ofgem [b]). Grout was also cited in\u000a      the introduction to the 2012 Ofgem Annual Report for bringing his\u000a      considerable expertise in economics to help Ofgem.\u000a    (i) The RIIO Committees\u000a    The Board of Ofgem is the body that regulates and oversees the energy\u000a      markets in the UK. It has RIIO, E-Serve, Offshore, Remuneration and Audit\u000a      sub-committees. Since 2008 Grout has been special advisor to all of the\u000a      RIIO (Revenue equals Incentives + Innovation + Outputs) sub-committees\u000a      and since 2012 has also been a full board member. The RIIO committees\u000a      determine all allowed transmission and distribution charges in England,\u000a      Wales and Scotland. These network charges account for 21% of total\u000a      electricity bills and 18% of total gas bills. The typical dual fuel bill\u000a      (i.e. gas and electricity) for a UK household is &#163;1,340pa (Nov 2013).\u000a    In December 2012 RIIO-GD1 (Gas Distribution 1) approved total allowed\u000a      revenues for the gas distribution companies between 1\/4\/13 to 31\/3\/21 of\u000a      &#163;24.8bn (in 2009\/10 prices) [c], RIIO-T1 (Transmission 1) approved total\u000a      allowed revenues in nominal prices for the electricity transmission over\u000a      the same period of &#163;22.7bn ([d] and [e]) and RIIO-T1 also approved total\u000a      allowed revenues in nominal prices for the gas transmission for a similar\u000a      period of &#163;6.9bn [d].\u000a    When allowing these network charges Ofgem determines, amongst other\u000a      things, the cost of capital, approved revenues, and incentive schemes.\u000a      These are all intimately related to Professor Grout's research and\u000a      expertise (e.g., [1], [2] and [6]). Grout's research, for example, into\u000a      how the relevant cost of capital of regulated utilities is affected by\u000a      political and large shocks to markets (informing whether claims of\u000a      particular impact on regulated companies during the financial crisis was\u000a      consistent with empirical evidence) fed into this decision process. The\u000a      impact of Ofgem's choice of appropriate cost of capital is material. For\u000a      example, had Ofgem adopted a 1% higher cost of capital for transmission\u000a      and gas distribution companies in 2012 then the direct additional impact\u000a      would have been approximately &#163;3.3bn, or approximately an &#163;11pa direct\u000a      increase for each household, with a significant indirect effect through\u000a      higher energy costs in the corporate sector [f].\u000a    Companies are able to appeal against Ofgem's price controls and these\u000a      appeals are heard by the UK Competition Commission. Professor Grout's\u000a      research into the determinants of the decisions taken by the Competition\u000a      Commission [3] has fed directly into Ofgem's balancing between regulated\u000a      prices and avoidance of unnecessary appeals, which delay implementation of\u000a      price controls and as a result can be damaging to consumers and industry.\u000a    (ii) The Offshore Committee\u000a    Grout chairs Ofgem's Offshore Committee. This is a sub-committee of the\u000a      board that oversees all offshore investment and in particular the\u000a      tendering processes for offshore transmission. The UK approach to offshore\u000a      transmission is one of competitive tendering, and has many features that\u000a      resemble private finance initiative (PFI) and PPP projects. The National\u000a      Audit Office (NAO) estimates there will be potentially around &#163;8bn of\u000a      tenders for offshore transmission to be delivered between now and 2020\u000a      enabling approximately &#163;52bn of offshore investment. Grout's research into\u000a      PFI provides the platform for him to chair the Offshore Committee and\u000a      inform final decisions ([4], [6]). For example, feedback from the NAO and\u000a      the Public Accounts Committee [g] on the offshore tendering process and\u000a      policy has led to reconsideration of aspects of licence policy and current\u000a      changes to licence policy. Professor Grout's research into PFI models\u000a      contributed to amendments, which are currently under public consultation.\u000a    4.2 Impact through parliamentary committee and government agencies\u000a    i) Grout was the expert advisor (2008-10) to the House of Lords Economic\u000a      Affairs Committee for its review and report on `Private finance projects\u000a      and off balance sheet debt' [h]. The objective of the review was to assess\u000a      the current state of private finance projects and off balance sheet debt\u000a      and make recommendations to government for improvements. The expert\u000a      advisor has important influence (although no vote) on which witnesses are\u000a      brought to the committee, the questions and themes of each hearing, on the\u000a      decision making process leading to the report and its recommendations.\u000a      Professor Grout's input was heavily influenced by his research on PPPs\u000a      (e.g., [4] and [6]). In the Government's response [i] it accepted the\u000a      Review's concerns about data and stated that `it had already taken a\u000a      number of steps in this area to improve the availability of data on PFI\u000a      projects', and noted the suggestion that risk spreading could be expanded\u000a      and suggested that `HM Treasury will consider options for such expansion\u000a      with departments on a case by case basis'.\u000a    ii) Grout was a member of the advisory panel to the National Audit Office\u000a      (2006-2007) on their procurement report on PFI, `Improving the PFI\u000a      Tendering Process'. He also provided evidence on PPPs to the Scottish\u000a      Parliament. Both were based significantly on Professor Grout's research\u000a      [6].\u000a    iii) Grout was an advisor (2007-2008) on the Department for Business,\u000a      Economics and Regulatory Reform (BERR) Report on the Public Services\u000a      Industry Review [j] and provided commissioned work on the efficacy of\u000a      various public service models. Professor Grout's contribution was based\u000a      significantly on his research. Indeed, the definition of public services\u000a      used in this report to inform the scope of the review is taken from his\u000a      work [5]. The foreword to the Report points out that Professor Grout was\u000a      `of great help in unearthing the data and critiquing the evidence base of\u000a      the PSI'. The Report made eight high-level recommendations, which were a\u000a      major input into BERR's `Supporting Innovation in Services', August 2008.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Paul Grout has had a significant impact on national policy on\u000a      the delivery of public services by the private sector in the last five\u000a      years.

It\u000a      was carried out by Grout (Professor of Political Economy, 1986- ) and\u000a      colleagues at the Universities of Bristol (L. Garside, Research\u000a      Assistant\/Associate, 1999- , A. Jenkins, Research Assistant, 1998-2000),\u000a      Oxford (Professor M. Stevens) and Bath (Professor A. Zalewska). The\u000a      research can be grouped together into an examination of two overlapping\u000a      areas.\u000a    (i) The regulation of private provision of public services through\u000a        regulatory agencies\u000a    This research, notably but not exclusively in the area of regulation of\u000a      private utility companies, gives important insights into the appropriate\u000a      rate of return for regulated utilities [1]; the impact of government\u000a      policies and economic and stock market `shocks' on the risk and cost of\u000a      capital of private utility companies [1]; valuation of utilities [2];\u000a      competition law appeal processes [3], and privatisation [2].\u000a    For example, [1] shows empirically that uncertainty about the overarching\u000a      political environment (e.g., uncertainty about government policy) impacts\u000a      on the risk and cost of capital of regulated utility companies precisely\u000a      in the manner predicted by economic theory, and that large economic and\u000a      stock market shocks (e.g., the dotcom boom and bust) do not impact on the\u000a      risk and the cost of capital of regulated companies differently from the\u000a      impact on equivalent companies in the unregulated sector. [3], using a\u000a      sample of competition commission cases between 1970 and 2003, identifies\u000a      the characteristics of specific cases that affect the guilty\/not guilty\u000a      decisions made by the competition commission but also shows that the\u000a      decisions reached by the commission depend to a large extent on factors,\u000a      such as the experience of the chairman, that are extraneous to the merits\u000a      of the specific case.\u000a    (ii) The private provision of public services regulated by long-term\u000a        contracts\u000a    This deals with Public Private Partnerships (PPPs), in particular Private\u000a      Finance Initiative (PFI) versions of PPPs, across a broad array of public\u000a      services. PPPs typically involve long-term agreements between government\u000a      and a private sector consortium where the private consortium finances,\u000a      builds, owns and operates infrastructure (e.g., roads, hospitals, schools)\u000a      which the government pays for over the life of the contract. Examples of\u000a      the issues where the research provides important insights include: the\u000a      assessment of when a PPP is the appropriate model of delivery ([4], [5],\u000a      [6]); the assessment of value for money; and the appropriate rates of\u000a      discount for a meaningful public\/private comparison [4].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40285","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The Coalition government established an ambitious programme of\u000d\u000a      health-sector reform in England in 2010. An integral component was the use\u000d\u000a      of competition and choice as a means of delivering better health\u000d\u000a      care for patients. To ensure better health care though choice and\u000d\u000a      competition the government had to establish a structure of market\u000d\u000a      regulation which set the `rules of the game', including price regulation\u000d\u000a      and merger behaviour. Government policies on these matters directly affect\u000d\u000a      patients, through the quality of care delivered, and taxpayers, through\u000d\u000a      the costs associated with implementing the policies.\u000d\u000a    Officials testify that Propper's body of research has had a major impact\u000d\u000a      on decisions made throughout the process of developing a structure of\u000d\u000a      market regulation. A Department of Health director stated: \"In 2006 the\u000d\u000a      Department of Health commissioned a flagship Health Reform Evaluation\u000d\u000a      Programme [...] Of the research projects commissioned within the\u000d\u000a      programme, the work by Professor Carol Propper had the most practical\u000d\u000a      impact. It was cited and used during the passage of the Health and Social\u000d\u000a      Care Bill [2011], was quoted in the national media, was considered\u000d\u000a      carefully by Ministers and in particular the then Secretary of State for\u000d\u000a      Health, the Rt Hon Andrew Lansley CBE. The quality of the research and the\u000d\u000a      clarity of its conclusions directly led to Government amendments, to what\u000d\u000a      is now the Health and Social Care Act, ruling out the possibility of price\u000d\u000a      competition. In my 20 years' experience in Government it is most unusual\u000d\u000a      for even the best research work to have such influence as that on\u000d\u000a      competition undertaken by Professor Propper\" [a].\u000d\u000a    Examples where Propper's research was used to develop\/change policy\u000d\u000a      include:\u000d\u000a    i. The decision to use choice and competition as a means of delivering\u000d\u000a        better health care in England\u000d\u000a    Propper's research was part of the underpinning for the overall (highly\u000d\u000a      controversial) policy on the use of choice and competition contained in\u000d\u000a      the Health and Social Care Bill of 2012 [a] [b]. The research has been\u000d\u000a      used to decide who should be allowed to compete with NHS providers: \"[3]\u000d\u000a      was used as evidence in the review of the Operation of Any Willing\u000d\u000a      Provider for the Provision of Routine Elective Care [...] The Department\u000d\u000a      of Health accepted the key recommendations of this review\" [b]. \"[4] has\u000d\u000a      been used to demonstrate that there is an incentive for providers to\u000d\u000a      improve quality\" [b]. To achieve this impact, Propper disseminated the\u000d\u000a      work widely and gave a large number of presentations and individual\u000d\u000a      briefings to policymakers. Media coverage of the first set of research\u000d\u000a      findings into the 1990s internal market included The Guardian in January\u000d\u000a      2011 (http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/commentisfree\/2011\/jan\/17\/free-market-bill-blow-nhs-apart).\u000a      Her research was quoted several times in Tim Harford's `Undercover\u000d\u000a      Economist' blog (www.timharford.com),\u000a      e.g. `A healthy dose of competition will help the NHS pull through' (3\u000d\u000a      July 2010). She had one-to-one meetings with the Secretary of State for\u000d\u000a      Health (Andrew Lansley, June 2011) and the Number 10 policy advisor on\u000d\u000a      health (Paul Bate, July 2011); presented research findings at the UK\u000d\u000a      Department of Health, the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit, the Treasury and\u000d\u000a      the Cabinet Office (May 2012); and was a member of the expert panel for\u000d\u000a      the Office of Fair Trading 2011 review of competition in private medical\u000d\u000a      care and for the Office of Health Economics Commission on Competition\u000d\u000a      (2012).\u000d\u000a    ii. Decision on the use of centrally-regulated prices in the NHS\u000d\u000a    Initial Coalition plans envisaged allowing hospitals to negotiate prices\u000d\u000a      freely. The Financial Times, 7 January 2011, quoted Propper as warning\u000d\u000a      against allowing price competition: \"By taking this step, Andrew Lansley\u000d\u000a      is ignoring all the evidence on\u000d\u000a      the impact of price competition in the hospital sector\" [e]. In March\u000d\u000a      2011, the Secretary of State for Health changed course when he announced\u000d\u000a      that initial plans to scrap price regulation in the Health and Social Care\u000d\u000a      Bill had been abandoned. Propper's work was integral to this decision [b].\u000d\u000a      \"Propper's research [3] and [1] were used as evidence in internal\u000d\u000a      presentations, alongside similar papers, to set out the empirical support\u000d\u000a      for the theory that, by fixing a national price, and allowing providers to\u000d\u000a      compete only on non-price factors, competition can lead to better quality\u000d\u000a      outcomes for patients. Propper's papers were seen as especially valuable\u000d\u000a      since they set out the effects that occurred within the English NHS under\u000d\u000a      two distinct policy periods\" [b]. Reports by the health care regulator,\u000d\u000a      Monitor, regularly acknowledge or quote Propper's work (e.g., [d]). Media\u000d\u000a      reports also credit Propper's research as leading to the policy reversal &#8212;\u000d\u000a      e.g., Financial Times 4 March 2011[f].\u000d\u000a    iii. Writing of rules for mergers in the NHS\u000d\u000a    Merger policy is integral to balancing potential patient and taxpayer\u000d\u000a      gains and losses from hospital consolidation. Propper's research has been\u000d\u000a      used to inform decisions on health-care mergers. \"[3] and [6] have been\u000d\u000a      used as evidence in eight advisory reports of the Co-operation and\u000d\u000a      Competition Panel (CCP) to the Secretary of State for Health (and Monitor)\u000d\u000a      on whether proposed hospital mergers were consistent with quality\" [b].\u000d\u000a      \"[6] has been used in evidence in internal presentations [...] to provide\u000d\u000a      a general context on the tendency of hospital mergers to fail to achieve\u000d\u000a      efficiencies or to improve quality for patients. This is particularly\u000d\u000a      important, given the claimed efficiencies and clinical advantages that\u000d\u000a      merger parties have put to the CCP as the rationale for their proposed\u000d\u000a      merger. The panel has therefore had to form judgements on the\u000d\u000a      deliverability of those claims and this paper has helped inform those\u000d\u000a      judgements\" [b] [c].\u000d\u000a    Pathways to impact have included briefings to policy officials (Propper\u000d\u000a      gave briefings on research on mergers to Monitor (December 2010) and\u000d\u000a      Department of Health economists (November 2011)) and media coverage &#8212; for\u000d\u000a      instance, The Guardian (12 January 2012) quoted Propper as warning of the\u000d\u000a      potential negative consequences of hospital mergers brought about to solve\u000d\u000a      funding or capacity issues [g]. Impact has also been achieved through\u000d\u000a      presentations to the wider community. For example, Propper presented at\u000d\u000a      the Inaugural Festival of Economics in Bristol, attended by over 1,000\u000d\u000a      people (November 2012), and to economics and business students at Clifton\u000d\u000a      College (March 2013).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    National and international policy on the use of competition in health\u000d\u000a      care since 2006 has been strongly influenced by a series of studies\u000d\u000a      conducted at the University of Bristol led by Professor Carol Propper. By\u000d\u000a      providing compelling evidence on how competition affects patient care,\u000d\u000a      these studies have had a major impact on policy design at the highest\u000d\u000a      levels.

This body of research was initiated in the late\u000d\u000a      1990s at Bristol and is ongoing. It was initially undertaken with\u000d\u000a      Professor Simon Burgess at Bristol (late 1990s to 2008). Since 2008,\u000d\u000a      Propper's co-authors in the research have been from Imperial College\u000d\u000a      London (where Propper holds a 50% appointment), the LSE, Carnegie Mellon\u000d\u000a      and Stanford.\u000d\u000a    1. Whether competition in health care improves quality of patient care\u000d\u000a    The first studies of the impact of market structure on quality of\u000d\u000a      hospital care led by Propper [1] [2] examined the NHS internal market\u000d\u000a      reforms which were introduced in 1991 and abolished in 1997. In these\u000d\u000a      reforms, hospitals competed on price and volume. Propper's research showed\u000d\u000a      that such competition led to a decline in quality (indicated by higher\u000d\u000a      death rates in competitive markets) and suggested that these reforms cost\u000d\u000a      1,030 lives at a cost of around &#163;355.35 million.\u000d\u000a    The second set of studies examined the Labour government's `pro-choice'\u000d\u000a      reforms of 2006. These re-established competition between hospitals, but\u000d\u000a      under a system of regulated prices. Propper's research showed that the\u000d\u000a      reforms raised quality for patients without increasing resource-use [3].\u000d\u000a      Her work suggested that the reforms saved approximately 4,791 life years.\u000d\u000a      The researchers concluded that price regulation allowed competition to\u000d\u000a      occur on quality. A second paper examined whether the reforms increased\u000d\u000a      the elasticity of demand with respect to quality. This is a prerequisite\u000d\u000a      for pro-competitive reforms to have a positive impact on the quality\u000d\u000a      produced by hospital suppliers. Propper and her co-authors found that the\u000d\u000a      elasticity of demand with respect to quality rose post-reform,\u000d\u000a      particularly for sicker patients [4]. A third paper examined the\u000d\u000a      relationship between management, quality of care and competition and\u000d\u000a      suggested that one of the ways in which competition might bring about\u000d\u000a      improvements in care was through better management [5].\u000d\u000a    2. The effect of hospital mergers on patient care, deficits and\u000d\u000a        waiting times\u000d\u000a    Propper and colleagues exploited the large-scale closure of hospitals in\u000d\u000a      England between 1997 and 2003 to examine whether mergers in hospitals had\u000d\u000a      similar negative outcomes to those in the private sector. The research\u000d\u000a      analysed a range of patient- and taxpayer-relevant outcomes, including\u000d\u000a      death rates following emergency admissions, waiting times, expenditure,\u000d\u000a      deficits and staffing levels. The research design compared merged\u000d\u000a      hospitals with appropriate controls. It was found that mergers promised\u000d\u000a      gains ex-ante but brought, ex-post, negative outcomes: longer waiting\u000d\u000a      times, larger deficits and no evidence of improvement in clinical outcomes\u000d\u000a      [6]. The gains for patients and tax payers were therefore minimal.\u000d\u000a    In recognition of her research, Propper was awarded a CBE in June 2010\u000d\u000a      [11].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40286","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    a. Broad and sustained influence on national and international policy\u000d\u000a    Simon Burgess has had a broad and sustained influence on policy for the\u000d\u000a      schools market in the UK, of which the two specific cases on school\u000d\u000a      accountability are leading examples. Carole Willis, Director of Research\u000d\u000a      and Analysis at the Department for Education writes [a]: \"Simon Burgess's\u000d\u000a      work on school accountability has had a major impact on thinking in the\u000d\u000a      Department on this issue over a number of years. His research was cited in\u000d\u000a      the \"Importance of Teaching\" White Paper, and has fundamentally changed\u000d\u000a      Ofsted's risk assessments of which schools to inspect.\"\u000d\u000a    This influence is ongoing. Tim Leunig, Special Advisor to Secretary of\u000d\u000a      State Michael Gove, writes in September 2013 [b] \"On the basis of his\u000d\u000a      research leadership in this field, we asked Simon Burgess to contribute to\u000d\u000a      the development of the new pupil progress measure, and the school floor\u000d\u000a      targets that will form the basis for interventions in schools\". Burgess\u000d\u000a      was also asked to talk at the Permanent Secretary's Seminar on school\u000d\u000a      markets in May 2013. Strengthening school accountability is also a key\u000d\u000a      policy issue in many other countries and Burgess was asked to present his\u000d\u000a      results to the Spanish Minister for Education and Secretary of State for\u000d\u000a      Education [c].\u000d\u000a    In addition to school accountability, Burgess's wider research on\u000d\u000a      education has also influenced the thinking in the Department for Education\u000d\u000a      on key policy issues including teacher effectiveness, school choice,\u000d\u000a      school financial decisions and teacher performance information through\u000d\u000a      briefings, seminars, presentations and reports.\u000d\u000a    b. Impact of the research on the abolition of performance tables in\u000d\u000a        Wales\u000d\u000a    Publication of [1] was the lead item in the main evening news on BBC\u000d\u000a      Wales, 2 November 2010. The next day, questions on the research were put\u000d\u000a      to the First Minister of Wales on the floor of the Assembly. The findings\u000d\u000a      were described as a \"slap in the face with good data\" by the Senior Policy\u000d\u000a      Advisor to the Welsh Assembly, Professor David Reynolds [d]. The research\u000d\u000a      was further reported in other news and documentary programmes for BBC\u000d\u000a      radio and television, in the Financial Times and in The Economist (twice).\u000d\u000a    In February 2011, the Welsh Minister for Education announced a major\u000d\u000a      change of policy, to reverse the decade-long policy of not publishing\u000d\u000a      performance information [e]. The new system was introduced on 8 December\u000d\u000a      2011.\u000d\u000a    Burgess's research was influential in this decision as David Reynolds\u000d\u000a      confirms [f]: \"I can testify to the major impact that the research of\u000d\u000a      Simon Burgess and colleagues had on our educational thinking in general\u000d\u000a      and specific policies in particular. The Minister Leighton Andrews found\u000d\u000a      the research chimed with much of his own thinking about the need for\u000d\u000a      transparency on school performance and there was much internal discussion\u000d\u000a      within WG after the publication of the particular paper in October 2010.\u000d\u000a      The research helped to prepare for the introduction of the Banding system\u000d\u000a      we launched in 2012 which of course involved the publication of school\u000d\u000a      results. It was for us quite seminal research.\"\u000d\u000a    Burgess's research suggests that this policy reversal will have a major\u000d\u000a      impact on pupil attainment and life chances in Wales. For pupils on the\u000d\u000a      margin of achieving 5 good passes, the reform will raise them above this\u000d\u000a      crucial threshold, bringing them an estimated 25% earnings increase. The\u000d\u000a      policy change will also reduce educational inequality in Wales. The\u000d\u000a      research showed that the greatest fall in attainment following the removal\u000d\u000a      of league tables was for low-attaining pupils in deprived areas; hence the\u000d\u000a      reinstatement is likely to show the greatest benefit there too, leading to\u000d\u000a      greater earnings gains at the lower end of the distribution.\u000d\u000a    c. Impact of the research on the design of school performance tables\u000d\u000a    Initial discussions between Burgess and Allen and officials at the\u000d\u000a      Department took place in February 2010 on reforming school league tables.\u000d\u000a      Graham Stuart MP, Chair of the House of Commons Education Select\u000d\u000a      Committee, requested a meeting with Burgess and Allen in November 2011.\u000d\u000a    In November 2011 new league tables were released that adopted key\u000d\u000a      components of their proposal. Carole Willis states [a]: \"Specifically, his\u000d\u000a      work with Rebecca Allen of IOE was very influential in the re-casting of\u000d\u000a      the school performance tables from 2011. Their findings on contextual\u000d\u000a      value added (CVA) led directly to the Government withdrawing CVA from the\u000d\u000a      tables and the wider school accountability framework. Their thinking also\u000d\u000a      contributed to new measures of GCSE performance for pupils of different\u000d\u000a      levels of prior attainment alongside other expert views\"\u000d\u000a    The new tables included a measure showing the GCSE performance of\u000d\u000a      students with differing levels of initial ability. For each school the new\u000d\u000a      tables report the percentage of pupils attaining at least five A* to C\u000d\u000a      grades separately for low-attaining pupils, high attainers and a middle\u000d\u000a      group.\u000d\u000a    This change improves pupil attainment directly and indirectly. The new\u000d\u000a      form of tables will allow parents to make a better-informed decision on\u000d\u000a      where to send their child to school. Better matching between child and\u000d\u000a      school will raise attainment. The new measure also gives schools more of\u000d\u000a      an incentive to focus across the ability distribution, which benefits\u000d\u000a      students at the top and bottom of the ability distribution as well as\u000d\u000a      those near the crucial threshold, who were the focus of the previous\u000d\u000a      accountability system. Higher attainment will lead to higher incomes and\u000d\u000a      better life chances for individuals, and at a macro level will raise the\u000d\u000a      skill base of the economy.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    School accountability is a crucial part of most education systems. The UK\u000d\u000a      is a world leader in the use of school accountability and Professor Simon\u000d\u000a      Burgess's research at Bristol has had a significant impact on national\u000d\u000a      policy on school accountability in England and Wales. He has also provided\u000d\u000a      advice on this policy internationally. His research showed that the\u000d\u000a      abolition of comparative school performance information in Wales\u000d\u000a      significantly damaged pupil attainment, and widespread public reporting of\u000d\u000a      his results contributed to the reversal of this policy in 2011. In\u000d\u000a      England, his work influenced changes in the content of the school `league\u000d\u000a      tables' in 2011, leading directly to an improvement in their usefulness\u000d\u000a      for parents in their school choice and government in its role as funder\u000d\u000a      and regulator. In both cases, pupils are likely to benefit from the\u000d\u000a      changes following Burgess's work by achieving higher grades in their\u000d\u000a      crucial GCSE exams and thereby from higher lifetime income.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Bristol\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Bristol (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Bristol","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South West","UKPRN":10007786}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    The high quality of the research is corroborated by the quality of the\u000d\u000a      journal publications and the high amount of associated peer-reviewed\u000d\u000a      competitive grant funding.\u000d\u000a    \u000a[1] Burgess, S., Wilson, D., and Worth, J.

Together these papers showed that school\u000d\u000a      league tables play a key role as an accountability mechanism in regulating\u000d\u000a      the market for schools. Paper [1] showed that the removal of comparative\u000d\u000a      performance information from the public domain had a substantial negative\u000d\u000a      effect on pupil attainment, while paper [2] showed that the nature of the\u000d\u000a      performance information significantly affects its functionality.

This reform\u000d\u000a      provided an opportunity to test decisively for the first time the theory\u000d\u000a      that such information is important to school performance. Burgess and\u000d\u000a      co-authors collected data on all secondary school pupils over a decade,\u000d\u000a      before and after the reform, in both countries. The data included GCSE\u000d\u000a      performance, prior attainment, pupil demographics, school expenditure, and\u000d\u000a      neighbourhood characteristics. The analysis involved taking each secondary\u000d\u000a      school in Wales and comparing its performance to a very similar school in\u000d\u000a      England, both before and after the reform. It found significant and robust\u000d\u000a      evidence that the policy change substantially reduced school effectiveness\u000d\u000a      in Wales, on average by about two GCSE grades per pupil. The strongest\u000d\u000a      effect was on schools in more disadvantaged neighbourhoods. So the policy\u000d\u000a      resulted in both lower overall school effectiveness and greater\u000d\u000a      inequality.\u000d\u000a    This research was subsequently published in 2013 in the Journal of Public\u000d\u000a      Economics, [3].\u000d\u000a    b.

In 2010, Burgess and Allen set out a\u000d\u000a      model to determine the answer statistically by asking which metric was\u000d\u000a      most useful to parents trying to decide which school their child would do\u000d\u000a      best in academically. They used the entire cohort of more than half a\u000d\u000a      million pupils who chose secondary school in 2003 and tracked their\u000d\u000a      progress. The results showed that some school performance metrics were\u000d\u000a      very useful, significantly and substantially producing better choices than\u000d\u000a      choosing at random, while others were much less helpful.\u000d\u000a    The research has subsequently been published in a technical form [4] and\u000d\u000a      has also been incorporated in a broader discussion of the merits of\u000d\u000a      different forms of performance table, [5]. This latter paper proposes some\u000d\u000a      new metrics that were incorporated in the published league tables from\u000d\u000a      2011.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40400","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"4032283","Name":"Tonga"},{"GeoNamesId":"3723988","Name":"Haiti"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2134431","Name":"Vanuatu"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The two streams of research led by Alan Winters came together to underpin\u000d\u000a      New Zealand's\u000d\u000a      establishment of the Recognised Seasonal Employers Scheme (RSE) [see\u000d\u000a      Section 5, C2]. This\u000d\u000a      scheme, operational since 2008, allows recognised agricultural employers\u000d\u000a      to recruit workers from\u000d\u000a      certain Pacific Islands for a season's work subject to the workers meeting\u000d\u000a      certain (mild) criteria and\u000d\u000a      to the employers providing reasonable working and living conditions.\u000d\u000a      Workers with good records\u000d\u000a      can return in subsequent seasons.\u000d\u000a    Evaluation of the scheme in two of the island economies that have\u000d\u000a      benefited shows massive\u000d\u000a      effects: the per capita incomes of participating households have\u000d\u000a      risen by an average of 35-40 per\u000d\u000a      cent in Vanuatu and Tonga. Workers remit money to their families while\u000d\u000a      they are away and carry\u000d\u000a      income and goods back home when they return at the end of the season.\u000d\u000a      According to Vanuatu's\u000d\u000a      Labour Commissioner [C3], `The scheme has raked in around Vt 3.8 billion\u000d\u000a      so far for the country'\u000d\u000a      (approximately $40 million) and around 11,000 temporary placements have\u000d\u000a      been made. Virtually\u000d\u000a      all of the benefit was reaped over the period 2008-13, although the data\u000d\u000a      include a few hundred\u000d\u000a      workers who moved under the 2007 pilot scheme.\u000d\u000a    The key innovation of the RSE was that it not only suited New Zealand\u000d\u000a      farmers but that it also drew\u000d\u000a      on research to assuage society's fears about migration and to show\u000d\u000a      explicitly how it would foster\u000d\u000a      development in the Pacific region, a major foreign-policy objective for\u000d\u000a      New Zealand. The research\u000d\u000a      was central to these innovations, motivating migration as a development\u000d\u000a      policy and defining the\u000d\u000a      practical needs for success for both host and home countries. Its role is\u000d\u000a      evident in the World\u000d\u000a      Bank's report Home and Away [C1] and in the accounts of the RSE in\u000d\u000a      the evaluation documents by\u000d\u000a      John Gibson and David McKenzie [C4].\u000d\u000a    The confluence of the two research streams came in the Home and Away\u000d\u000a      report, following which\u000d\u000a      the New Zealand government sought the World Bank's help in constructing a\u000d\u000a      temporary-migration\u000d\u000a      scheme for the Pacific Islands. Winters worked closely with the senior\u000d\u000a      economist involved (Manjula\u000d\u000a      Luthria), especially on the design of the scheme and the presentation of\u000d\u000a      the case for what was a\u000d\u000a      very innovative and potentially contentious piece of policy.

Demonstrating the scheme's effectiveness objectively was important\u000d\u000a      politically and enabled\u000d\u000a      the idea to be exported to Australia (which adopted a similar small pilot\u000d\u000a      scheme in 2008 and a full\u000d\u000a      scheme in 2013 [see C5, C6] and elsewhere (see the testimonial from\u000d\u000a      Michael Clemens [C10]).\u000d\u000a    McKenzie et al.

Our evaluation was designed prospectively,\u000d\u000a      alongside the\u000d\u000a      launch of the program [with] baseline surveys ... before workers left to\u000d\u000a      work in New\u000d\u000a      Zealand, and then re-interview[s] ... 6, 12 and 24 months later. ... The\u000d\u000a      results show\u000d\u000a      that the RSE has had large positive effects on sending households in Tonga\u000d\u000a      and\u000d\u000a      Vanuatu. We find per capita incomes of households participating in\u000d\u000a      the RSE to have\u000d\u000a      increased by over 30 per cent relative to the comparison groups in both\u000d\u000a      countries...\u000d\u000a      Subjective economic welfare is estimated to have increased by almost half\u000d\u000a      a standard\u000d\u000a      deviation in both countries...

Every year 2500 plus workers are recruited to work in a New\u000d\u000a      Zealand farm.... For the last five years Vanuatu has over 11,000 RSE work\u000d\u000a      placements in New\u000d\u000a      Zealand. RSE also contributed greatly to the Vanuatu's economy. Each year\u000d\u000a      RSE\u000d\u000a      workers contributed over Vt 1 billion to the economy.\u000d\u000a    The New Zealand scheme has been closely copied in Australia. After a\u000d\u000a      pilot scheme between 2008\u000d\u000a      and 2012, Australia introduced a full scheme in 2013 [C5]. The pilot,\u000d\u000a      which naturally had only\u000d\u000a      modest coverage, suggests that Tongan participants increased the per\u000d\u000a        capita income of their\u000d\u000a      households by 36 per cent [C6].\u000d\u000a    The New Zealand experience also provided inspiration for the imaginative\u000d\u000a      US response to the\u000d\u000a      Haitian earthquake of providing 1,000 temporary unskilled-worker visas\u000d\u000a      specifically for Haitians.\u000d\u000a      The champion of this policy change &#8212; Michael Clemens of the Center for\u000d\u000a      Global Development\u000d\u000a      (CGD) &#8212; acknowledges the inspiration of the RSE for policy work in his\u000d\u000a      testimonial [C10].\u000d\u000a    Winters' research findings on small economies and on temporary migration\u000d\u000a      have both been\u000d\u000a      disseminated widely as separate themes &#8212; not only in academic outlets, but\u000d\u000a      personally at\u000d\u000a      conferences, seminars and policy meetings (for example, OECD, UNCTAD,\u000d\u000a      World Bank, IOM,\u000d\u000a      ComSec) and as policy briefs and by ComSec staff (notably Roman Grynberg)\u000d\u000a      in their operational\u000d\u000a      work. The work particularly underpins developing countries' efforts to\u000d\u000a      raise temporary labour\u000d\u000a      mobility as a significant element of the Doha Round; this goal still\u000d\u000a      informs many developing country\u000d\u000a      policy positions, although it has not yet borne fruit at the WTO.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Thousands of poor rural workers from 11 island states in the Pacific have\u000d\u000a      benefited from the\u000d\u000a      findings of twin research programmes led by Alan Winters of the University\u000d\u000a      of Sussex &#8212; one on\u000d\u000a      small island economies and one on the temporary mobility of labour. New\u000d\u000a      Zealand's Recognised\u000d\u000a      Seasonal Employers Scheme (RSE), which welcomes workers from poor Pacific\u000d\u000a      Islands for the\u000d\u000a      agricultural season, is a direct outcome of his research.

The evaluation shows that households in Vanuatu\u000d\u000a      and Tonga benefiting\u000d\u000a      from the scheme have experienced average increases in income of 35-40 per\u000d\u000a      cent.\u000d\u000a    The RSE has been described by World Bank staff as `among the most\u000d\u000a      effective development\u000d\u000a      projects ever evaluated'. Persuaded by the positive evaluation, the\u000d\u000a      Australian government has\u000d\u000a      overcome longstanding reservations and introduced a nearly identical\u000d\u000a      scheme, which is potentially\u000d\u000a      much larger.

The approaches reflected Winters' extensive\u000d\u000a      experience in applied\u000d\u000a      international trade research and his strong network of contacts in the\u000d\u000a      policy world around trade and\u000d\u000a      development. The results of the commissioned research have since been\u000d\u000a      published and become\u000d\u000a      widely cited.\u000d\u000a    The first stream of research concerned the excess production costs faced\u000d\u000a      by very small and\u000d\u000a      isolated economies, which Winters and Pedro Martins (then a Research\u000d\u000a      Assistant at Sussex and\u000d\u000a      now at the Overseas Development Institute) were able to measure more\u000d\u000a      carefully than previously\u000d\u000a      [see Section 3, R1]. With their small consignment sizes and great\u000d\u000a      distances from economic\u000d\u000a      centres, these countries face massive trading costs. As a result, imported\u000d\u000a      goods (most goods for\u000d\u000a      these small economies) are much more expensive, as are the locally\u000d\u000a      produced goods that use\u000d\u000a      imports as inputs. Similarly, most goods cannot be exported because, in\u000d\u000a      addition to high\u000d\u000a      production costs, the price in destination markets needs to cover the cost\u000d\u000a      of transporting them to\u000d\u000a      market.\u000d\u000a    As Winters and Martins showed, the outcome is that real wages in these\u000d\u000a      economies are very low\u000d\u000a      and will become lower as the rest of the world becomes more efficient and\u000d\u000a      island states lose their\u000d\u000a      tariff preferences in major markets. In many manufacturing activities,\u000d\u000a      even if wages fell to zero, the\u000d\u000a      island economies would still not be able to match world prices because\u000d\u000a      they pay so much more for\u000d\u000a      inputs. The researchers concluded that, if real wages were not to fall to\u000d\u000a      subsistence levels,\u000d\u000a      migration would have to play a fundamental role in income growth. Such\u000d\u000a      views have now become\u000d\u000a      widely accepted: one manifestation is in Chapter 1 of the World Bank's\u000d\u000a      2006 report, Home and\u000d\u000a        Away, which argues for a migration solution in the Pacific Islands\u000d\u000a      [see Section 5, C1].\u000d\u000a    The second stream of work &#8212; with Terrie Walmsley (Purdue), Zhen Kun Wang\u000d\u000a      (Sussex) and\u000d\u000a      Roman Grynberg (ComSec) &#8212; analysed the economic benefits of liberalising\u000d\u000a      the flow of temporary\u000d\u000a      workers between economies [R2-R6]. Mobility moves workers from places with\u000d\u000a      low productivity to\u000d\u000a      those with high productivity, with a resulting large gain in world output.\u000d\u000a      The research provided the\u000d\u000a      first numerical estimates of the benefits of mobility, which hugely exceed\u000d\u000a      those associated with\u000d\u000a      removing remaining barriers to trade in goods. It also analysed the\u000d\u000a      practicalities of introducing\u000d\u000a      temporary mobility schemes and showed that any potential problems would be\u000d\u000a      far from\u000d\u000a      insurmountable.

Macroeconomics research at\u000a      Surrey (currently within its\u000a      Centre for International Macroeconomic Studies, CIMS, of which all authors\u000a      named in Section 3\u000a      below are members) has been at the forefront of key developments in models\u000a      to take account of\u000a      these issues and a number of the results have influenced macroeconomic\u000a      policy and policymakers\u000a      in several such economies.\u000a    The key features of Surrey's research revolve around significantly\u000a      amended dynamic stochastic\u000a      general equilibrium (DSGE) models of the economy in which agents and\u000a      policymakers base their\u000a      actions over time on the current state of the economy, their understanding\u000a      of how it functions and\u000a      perceived present and future policy. In this context, policy rules are\u000a      designed to minimise\u000a      consumers and producers vulnerability to `shocks' particularly those\u000a      arising from international\u000a      openness. Policy needs to be `robust' in the sense of performing well\u000a      against such shocks, and\u000a      uncertainty about the true model of the economy. We note several results\u000a      arising from our work.\u000a    First, over a number of years, CIMS has produced leading research in the\u000a      design of robust\u000a      monetary policy. Papers (1), (2) and (3) provide new results and clear\u000a      policy guidance about the\u000a      nature of the probability models necessary here and (in paper (4)) the\u000a      need for commitment from\u000a      policy makers. In 2009, Levine gave the State Bank of Pakistan's annual\u000a      Zahid Hussain memorial\u000a      lecture, and an invited keynote Conference lecture for the Central Bank of\u000a      Nigeria, both on the\u000a      application of these results to research in emerging economies. This told\u000a      policy makers to\u000a      recognise serious microstructural differences between emerging and\u000a      developed economies when\u000a      building and applying macro-models, and the role of measurement error in\u000a      creating uncertainty\u000a      which could be ameliorated by better data collection.\u000a    Second, by amending DSGE models to take account of the openness of\u000a      emerging economies and\u000a      key financial frictions, we have identified robust policies for such\u000a      settings. Paper (5) demonstrates\u000a      that this involves the \"twin pillars\" of flexible exchange rates and\u000a      inflation targeting. This is a new\u000a      result with the clear policy recommendation: economies exhibiting emerging\u000a      market frictions should\u000a      consider adopting these twin policies, as opposed to their more\u000a      traditional use of active exchange\u000a      rate management, to accommodate fluctuations in capital inflows and anchor\u000a      the inflation rate.\u000a    Third, recognising informal (i.e. `black market') activity in emerging\u000a      economies leads to key\u000a      modelling changes and new results. Paper (6) examines a DSGE model where\u000a      an `informal' sector\u000a      avoids the attention of the tax and regulatory authorities. Here, the use\u000a      of standard inflation\u000a      measures weakens the link between monetary policy and economic activity\u000a      and effective policy\u000a      must recognise this; in particular, it needs better measurement of price\u000a      formation in the informal\u000a      sector.\u000a    Fourth, another strand of CIMS' research has examined forward-looking\u000a      inflation targeting. Paper\u000a      (3) highlights the implications of such policy, but cautions against\u000a      incorporating especially `long'\u000a      sighted expectations, which can render policy `un-robust' (in the sense\u000a      above).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40561","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research described above has produced several kinds of impact:\u000a    (a) impact on policy debate within Government\u000a    (b) impact on specific policies\u000a    (c) impact on other policy stakeholders\u000a    (d) impact on national media debate\u000a    (a) Impact on policy debate within Government\u000a    Blanden has provided reviews of her work and policy advice to a number of\u000a      organisations. As [C2]\u000a      reports, in January 2008 she was invited to 10 Downing Street to explain\u000a      her findings at a meeting\u000a      including Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband (Cabinet Office\u000a      Minister); [C1] notes that\u000a      this input \"helped to fashion the [2009] White Paper\". In the same year\u000a      she gave evidence based\u000a      on the above research to the Children and Families Select Committee and\u000a      the Liberal Democrat\u000a      Social Mobility Commission. Blanden advised meetings about the Cabinet\u000a      Office Discussion\u000a      Paper `Getting On, Getting Ahead' [C4]. In 2011, she advised officials at\u000a      the Cabinet Office on the\u000a      Government's Social Mobility Strategy and was a member of Alan Milburn's\u000a      advisory group in his\u000a      capacity as Independent Reviewer on Social Mobility. In 2013, she used\u000a      paper (5) to advise\u000a      officials from the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission about the\u000a      content of their annual\u000a      report &#8212; see [C3].\u000a    (b) Impact on specific policies\u000a    The last two Governments have prioritised improving intergenerational\u000a      mobility, as confirmed in the\u000a      2009 Social Mobility White Paper and the 2011 Social Mobility Strategy. It\u000a      can be clearly\u000a      demonstrated that Surrey research influenced this: [C3] describes the work\u000a      as \"very influential in\u000a      getting mobility onto the Government's policy agenda\" and \"is drawn on\u000a      heavily in the\u000a      Government's social mobility strategy\". It features eight times in the\u000a      2008 Cabinet Office\u000a      Discussion Paper which preceded the White Paper (see [C4]) and papers (1)\u000a      and (3) are \"heavily\u000a      referenced\" according to [C2] in the recent Social Mobility Strategy [C5].\u000a      As a particular example,\u000a      the chapter on `Foundation Years' recognises the findings that\u000a      socioeconomic differences in child\u000a      development appear early (paper (1)) and that poor non-cognitive skills\u000a      diminish mobility (paper\u000a      (2)).\u000a    In turn, the Strategy uses these findings to justify two other \"specific\u000a      instances of [this] research\u000a      influencing Government policy since 2008\" (quoted from [C2] &#8212; see also\u000a      [C1]): (i) an expansion of\u000a      Family Nurse Partnerships, which increases the number of families\u000a      benefiting from 6000 to 13000\u000a      by 2015 (costing &#163;17.5m) and (ii) an increase in the number of 2-year olds\u000a      benefiting from free\u000a      nursery places to about 20% of the cohort by 2015 (ultimately costing\u000a      &#163;760m). In addition, the\u000a      importance of the findings on mobility drawn from the 1958, 1970 and 2000\u000a      cohorts has led to\u000a      Government funding of &#163;33.5m for a new birth cohort study (from 2012),\u000a      offering wide benefits for\u000a      social science and policy (see paragraphs 6.17 and 6.18 of [C5]).\u000a    (c) Impact on policy debate within other policy\u000a          stakeholders\u000a    Surrey's work has also influenced groups outside of Government. It\u000a      warranted six references in\u000a      the National Equalities Panel report (see [C6]) and received international\u000a      attention in the OECD's\u000a      `Growing Unequal' (see [C7]). Blanden has spoken about the work to the\u000a      Bridge Group, Into\u000a      University and Universities UK. Two particularly strong examples of the\u000a      research generating\u000a      impact beyond Government are two conferences held in Summer 2008. The\u000a      first was the Sutton\u000a      Trust-Carnegie Foundation Transatlantic Summit where Blanden presented the\u000a      opening paper on\u000a      international comparisons of mobility (now paper (3)); this conference was\u000a      designed to promote\u000a      policy debate and a broad spectrum of US and UK policy makers attended;\u000a      [C1] describes the\u000a      importance of the conference, and notes that \"[this] work in particular\u000a      helped to set the future\u000a      research priorities for the [Sutton] Trust\". The second conference, held\u000a      at LSE in Summer 2008,\u000a      was organised by Blanden and Kirstine Hansen (Institute of Education).\u000a      This included a policy\u000a      round table involving Lynn Featherstone (then Minister for Equalities),\u000a      David Willetts (Minister for\u000a      Universities and Science), Polly Toynbee (The Guardian) and Lee Elliott\u000a      Major (the Sutton Trust).\u000a      The attendees ranged across academia, Government, think tanks and policy\u000a      bodies and Toynbee\u000a      explicitly referred to results in papers (1)-(4) in a subsequent article\u000a      [C8].\u000a    (d) Impact on media debate\u000a    The research in Section 2 has attracted extensive and continuing media\u000a      attention; [C2] places it \"at\u000a      the heart of the lively media debate\" on intergenerational mobility, and\u000a      the research's \"frequent\u000a      mentions in the press have raised public awareness ... and served to\u000a      develop the debate in\u000a      Government\". As a result, CEP has recorded more than 10 media reports\u000a      which explicitly\u000a      mentioned this research in both 2010 and 2011. In addition, Blanden was\u000a      interviewed on BBC\u000a      Radio Five Live (2010) and BBC Radio 4's World at One (2013), and was\u000a      consulted about the\u000a      preparation of the BBC documentary in (2011) [C9]. The controversy between\u000a      the work of\u000a      economists and sociologists (paper (4)) has also attracted media attention\u000a      &#8212; see [C8].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The association between incomes across generations is known as\u000a      `intergenerational mobility'.\u000a      Knowledge of this is important for understanding the extent of inequality\u000a      within society and can\u000a      measure equality of opportunity.

She has been at\u000a      the \"core of the team producing a number of extremely important papers\"\u000a      (see [C1) in the area,\u000a      undertaking a majority of the empirical research, raising research income\u000a      and organising a major\u000a      conference attended by policy makers and media.\u000a    Having established that intergenerational mobility was lower in 1970 than\u000a      1958, the research\u000a      progressed to consider the mechanisms that led to changes in this\u000a      mobility. In work presented in a\u000a      special session of the Royal Economics Society 2006, paper (1) used a\u000a      decomposition approach to\u000a      highlight the mechanisms that generated changes in intergenerational\u000a      mobility. The key\u000a      mechanism discovered was the increasingly unequal access to higher\u000a      education in the UK, in part\u000a      reinforced by a strengthening relationship between parental income and\u000a      better non-cognitive skills\u000a      amongst children. Stated differently, in the second cohort higher income\u000a      families were more likely\u000a      to have children with good non-cognitive skills who then went on to\u000a      university.\u000a    In work published in 2012 (paper (2)), but initially produced as a\u000a      background paper for the Sutton\u000a      Trust-Carnegie Foundation Transatlantic Summit on intergenerational\u000a      mobility, the research\u000a      provided the first systematic international comparison of\u000a      intergenerational mobility using a variety\u000a      of measures, income, education and social class. This work revealed that\u000a      the UK compares poorly\u000a      with other OECD nations, although it also stressed the difficulty of\u000a      forming simple league tables\u000a      here.\u000a    As is natural for influential findings, the results that\u000a      intergenerational mobility previously declined in\u000a      Britain, and the mechanism for this, have been subject to scrutiny.\u000a      Results on the trend in\u000a      intergenerational mobility based on social class are not always consistent\u000a      with those based on\u000a      income (and described above). A further paper in this series (paper (3))\u000a      explores why this is the\u000a      case. There are two important elements in this paper. First, it is\u000a      demonstrated that the result\u000a      above is robust, and not a consequence of measurement error. Second, it is\u000a      demonstrated that\u000a      results based on income differ because of large and persistent\u000a      intergenerational inequalities in\u000a      incomes among families of the same social class. This debate has been\u000a      conducted with eminent\u000a      sociologists Goldthorpe and Erikson.\u000a    In order to update our knowledge about how intergenerational mobility has\u000a      evolved more recently\u000a      we can observe how gaps in early outcomes and educational achievements\u000a      have evolved for more\u000a      recent cohorts and use these to predict future patterns of mobility. This\u000a      approach has been taken\u000a      in work published in 2008 (paper (4)) and in a current project (paper (5))\u000a      which examines the\u000a      implications of education policy for mobility and shows the extent to\u000a      which looking at average\u000a      measures of educational achievement (as often happens in policy debate)\u000a      may be misleading.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40562","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research described above has reached policy makers at the highest\u000a      level across a range of\u000a      global organisations and has had a clear influence on policy reform. It\u000a      can be shown to have had\u000a      \"impacts on public policy\", by \"shaping and influencing policy made by\"\u000a      the IMF, the European\u000a      Central Bank and the Bank of Canada, \"stimulating and influencing policy\u000a      debate by research\u000a      evidence\" leading to a \"change in policy direction\" and \"implementation\",\u000a      and \"enabling a challenge\u000a      to conventional wisdom\".\u000a    In the period since 2008 the IMF has reformed its lending facilities, by\u000a      introducing a Flexible Credit\u000a      Line and by modifying the range of facilities through which it assists low\u000a      income countries,\u000a      introducing the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust, the Extended Credit\u000a      Facility, the Standby\u000a      Credit Facility and the Rapid Credit Facility. It has also significantly\u000a      increased its lending capacity\u000a      (recognizing that its catalytic effect is actually nuanced and muted) and\u000a      approved an additional\u000a      allocation of Special Drawing Rights. These reforms have been intended to\u000a      improve country\u000a      ownership and the implementation of programmes. Our research has had a\u000a      clear and significant\u000a      impact on these policy changes. These are exemplified by the following\u000a      detailed examples:\u000a    (a) impact on changes in the IMF's policy towards the catalytic\u000a      effects of its lending\u000a    (b) impact on changes in the IMF's policy towards conditionality\u000a    (c) impact on changes in the IMF's policy on debt sustainability\u000a    (d) impact on stimulating policy debates within the IMF, ECB and\u000a      central banks such as the Bank\u000a      of Canada\u000a    (a) Impact on changes in the IMF's policy towards the catalytic\u000a          effect of its lending\u000a    Since 2008, the IMF has evaluated when its lending benefits recipients (a\u000a      `catalytic effect'). [C2]\u000a      describes our research here as exerting \"significant impact on IMF\u000a      thinking\" about programmes\u000a      and implementation since 2008. The testimony highlights several papers,\u000a      especially paper (5),\u000a      which \"challenged the conventional view\" originally within the IMF that\u000a      its programs had a positive\u000a      catalytic effect. It \"contributed significantly to modifying the Fund's\u000a      approach ... and its views\u000a      regarding the adequacy of its resources\", resulting in a series of reforms\u000a      over recent years (listed\u000a      above) and substantial increases in the Fund's lending capacity.\u000a    Testimony in [C3] cites Bird's research as having had \"a particular\u000a      influence\" on the Fund's\u000a      approach to the catalytic effect of lending programmes. The finding that\u000a      this effect was often\u000a      insignificant (or even negative) \"played a key part in [the] shift in\u000a      policy\" towards increasing its\u000a      programmes \"enormously\".\u000a    The impact of our work on the catalytic effect of aid is also apparent\u000a      beyond the IMF. This is\u000a      confirmed by [C5], which also comments that \"Reforms since 2008 that have\u000a      sought to expand the\u000a      Fund's lending capacity... reflects the impact\" of our research.\u000a    (b) Impact on changes in the IMF's policy towards conditionality\u000a    Since 2008 the IMF has \"overhauled\" (according to [C1]) its guidelines on\u000a      the conditions\u000a      accompanying its funding (`conditionality'). Our role here is evident from\u000a      [C1], which describes\u000a      research led by Bird as \"contributing to the debate on these issues within\u000a      the Fund\", with the\u000a      change of policy coming \"as a result\". [C5] confirms this impact: \"Further\u000a      modifications to\u000a      conditionality that are in the spirit of a more parsimonious approach have\u000a      been made in the period\u000a      since 2008 and have been significantly influenced by the debates that\u000a      Bird's research helped\u000a      stimulate.\"\u000a    (c) Impact on changes in the IMF's policy towards debt\u000a          sustainability and low income countries\u000a    An important issue at the IMF since 2008 has been strengthening its role\u000a      in low income countries\u000a      (LICs) and reforms have been introduced to change the portfolio of lending\u000a      facilities and\u000a      substantially increase the resources available for LICs. [C4] cites papers\u000a      (2) and (3) as being\u000a      \"important in helping to inform the policy debate\" before stating that\u000a      paper (6) \"led [in 2009] to Bird\u000a      being asked to participate in a project supervised by the Assistant\u000a      Director of the IMF's Strategy\u000a      and Policy Review Department, which focused on the Fund's role in economic\u000a      development.\" This\u000a      was designed to provide an informed basis for the design of future policy\u000a      and \"exerted an important\u000a      impact on thinking at the Fund\" (see [C4]) in terms of the Fund's recent\u000a      transition from a `financing'\u000a      role towards a `facilitating' one in relation to LICs.\u000a    (d) Impact on stimulating policy debates within the IMF, ECB and\u000a          central banks including\u000a          the Bank of Canada\u000a    In the above instances, our research can be directly related to specific\u000a      changes in IMF\u000a      programmes but testimony also confirms that this research is valued for\u000a      its impact on thinking\u000a      within the Fund more broadly (see [C2] and [C4]) and outside it ([C5] and\u000a      [C6]). Thus, [C2]\u000a      remarks that \"Altogether Bird's research is highly respected at the IMF.\u000a      It has always stimulated\u000a      debate within the institution and, in the period since 2008 (as it did\u000a      before), has exerted an\u000a      important impact on the direction that reform has taken.\" Further, outside\u000a      the IMF, [C6] comments\u000a      that, \"Bird's research has informed and stimulated debate in the ECB ...\u000a      and has thus helped to\u000a      shape policy debates within the ECB, including on the design of policy and\u000a      the direction of policy\u000a      reform.\"\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The role and operations of the IMF are of central importance to the\u000a      efficient functioning of the world\u000a      economy.

Over a period of many years,\u000a      Surrey has gained a strong\u000a      reputation for providing research-based analysis of many of the Fund's\u000a      operations, helping to\u000a      inform and strengthen IMF lending and adjustment policies.\u000a    Surrey research has been conducted under the umbrella of the Surrey\u000a      Centre for International\u000a      Economic Studies, of which Bird was Director and all authors named below\u000a      were members. (It\u000a      became the Centre for International Macroeconomic Studies in 2010). The\u000a      research has focused\u000a      on the various stages in the `life cycle' of IMF programmes.\u000a    The first stage relates to the factors determining whether or not\u000a      countries turn to the Fund for\u000a      assistance (`participation'). Surrey undertook the first academic study of\u000a      this issue, spawning a\u000a      growing literature to which economists and political scientists have\u000a      subsequently contributed.\u000a      Paper (1) provided a comprehensive large sample analysis of the role of\u000a      economic, political and\u000a      institutional factors and showed that, while a number of variables\u000a      influence participation, the overall\u000a      explanatory power of even the best fitting model is limited. Our\u000a      subsequent research developed\u000a      the analysis of participation. Paper (2), originally presented at the\u000a      Annual Meetings of the American\u000a      Economic Association, offered the first rigorous empirical analysis of the\u000a      prolonged use of IMF\u000a      resources, identifying the characteristics of `IMF recidivists'. Another\u000a      paper (3) showed that one\u000a      model of participation does not fit all, with middle income countries\u000a      turning to the IMF in different\u000a      circumstances than low income ones. However, while the Fund was beginning\u000a      to distinguish\u000a      informally between different users, our research showed that its\u000a      classification missed significant\u000a      differences.\u000a    The second stage of the life cycle of IMF programmes relates to the\u000a      design and implementation of\u000a      the conditions incorporated within them (`conditionality'). Surrey\u000a      research was some of the first to\u000a      analyse the implementation of IMF programmes using a framework that,\u000a      again, integrated\u000a      economic and political factors. Whilst the Fund was extending\u000a      conditionality, Bird had noted\u000a      circumstances when this could undermine ownership, commitment and\u000a      credibility and threaten\u000a      achievement of a programme's objectives. Paper (4) built on these ideas to\u000a      provide a\u000a      comprehensive empirical investigation of the implementation of IMF\u000a      conditions, drawing on the\u000a      theory of special interest groups and utilising new World Bank data. It\u000a      showed that successful\u000a      implementation was far from guaranteed and depended on the openness of\u000a      economies and\u000a      programme scale.\u000a    The third stage in the life cycle of programmes relates to their effects.\u000a      The IMF has claimed that its\u000a      programmes encourage other capital inflows. Bird (with Rowlands), was\u000a      amongst the first to\u000a      analyse and estimate this so-called `catalytic effect' rigorously. Paper\u000a      (5), for example, provided a\u000a      comprehensive, disaggregated, investigation showing that the effect was\u000a      nuanced, with much\u000a      depending on the type of international capital, the particular IMF\u000a      facility used and the economic\u000a      circumstances of the countries involved. The research also examined how\u000a      catalysis might work,\u000a      distinguishing between conditionality and liquidity. In subsequent papers,\u000a      the authors have been\u000a      the first to use treatment effects models to examine the catalytic effect\u000a      of IMF funds. Overall, the\u000a      Surrey-based research has shown that the effect of IMF programmes on other\u000a      capital flows may in\u000a      some cases be significantly negative (or negligible). These findings have\u000a      strongly challenged what\u000a      was the conventional view of catalysis. In other research, paper (6)\u000a      examines the effect of IMF\u000a      programmes on aid flows, finding that the relationship is significantly\u000a      different for aid than for\u000a      private capital flows.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40911","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"895949","Name":"Zambia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    NATURE OF THE IMPACT: The impact of the research came by changing the\u000d\u000a      guiding principles of personnel policies of the Ministry of Health in\u000d\u000a      Zambia. In particular, the Ministry modified its approach by evaluating\u000d\u000a      the benefits of alternative hiring policies using focused trials steered\u000d\u000a      by the research findings in Section (2) and using the outcomes of such\u000d\u000a      trials to inform strategy. Oriana Bandiera led this intervention in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with MOH using a design inspired by the above research.\u000d\u000a    In 2008\/09, the MOH began designing a programme to create a new cadre of\u000d\u000a      health workers, the Community Health Assistants or CHAs, to address the\u000d\u000a      shortage of health workers in rural areas. The context in which the policy\u000d\u000a      is being implemented is similar to that in most of sub-Saharan Africa,\u000d\u000a      where weak healthcare systems are undermined by shortages of qualified\u000d\u000a      health workers, especially in rural areas where people are rarely willing\u000d\u000a      to work. CHAs are embedded community members to whom the MOH offers health\u000d\u000a      training and whose main task is to do preventative care in rural\u000d\u000a      communities. CHAs carry out the same tasks as informal community health\u000d\u000a      workers. But in contrast with informal health workers, they are trained\u000d\u000a      for a full year, placed on the civil service payroll and provided with a\u000d\u000a      ladder for professional advancement and de facto tenure. Selection,\u000d\u000a      motivation, and retention are critical to programmes that want to attract\u000d\u000a      competent individuals and motivate them to serve the community long-term.\u000d\u000a    Given the difficulty in retaining qualified staff for this work, the MOH\u000d\u000a      was very mindful of adopting effective recruitment and motivation\u000d\u000a      strategies for this new cadre. At the same time, the then Director of\u000d\u000a      Research at the MOH (Dr Victor Mukonka) heard about Bandiera and\u000d\u000a      colleagues running a field experiment on the motivation of health\u000d\u000a      promoters with the Society for Family Health in Lusaka and thought the\u000d\u000a      research methodology could be fruitfully implemented to understand how too\u000d\u000a      best recruit and motivate CHAs (Source B). Dr Mukonka commissioned a\u000d\u000a      review paper on existing evidence of recruitment and motivation strategies\u000d\u000a      for CHAs, which draws on Bandiera's research on incentives (Source A).\u000d\u000a      Following this, Mr Mwila, then Director of Human Resources at the MOH,\u000d\u000a      organised a meeting with the research team in July 2010.\u000d\u000a    During the meeting, Mr Mwila stated the MOH's dilemma clearly: `It is\u000d\u000a      important that we formalise and support community health workers, but what\u000d\u000a      will happen if they now see themselves as typical civil servants? Will\u000d\u000a      they retain their connection to the community?' On the one hand, Mwila\u000d\u000a      elaborated, having CHAs with high technical capacity and who are motivated\u000d\u000a      to excel in their careers could make them more effective. On the other\u000d\u000a      hand, such workers may be more likely to seek personal gain or leave for\u000d\u000a      more lucrative job opportunities.\u000d\u000a    The questions raised by Mr Mwila resonated with Bandiera and her\u000d\u000a      colleagues as their earlier research was aimed precisely at understanding\u000d\u000a      the interactions between different sources of motivation and in particular\u000d\u000a      whether private rewards, financial or otherwise, crowd out pro-social\u000d\u000a      motivation.\u000d\u000a    At that meeting the Ministry and the researchers devised a new mode of\u000d\u000a      collaboration that embedded research into policy design, with a dual\u000d\u000a      feedback mechanism such that research findings shape future policy and new\u000d\u000a      policy challenges inform new research questions. This research design had\u000d\u000a      key features in common with Bandiera's earlier published work using field-based\u000d\u000a\u0009  studies which provided a template for what could be achieved.\u000d\u000a      (Sources C,F)\u000d\u000a    The collaboration began in July 2010 with the first cohort of 314 CHAs.\u000d\u000a      At its core were three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) designed by\u000d\u000a      Bandiera and her colleagues and implemented by the MOH with technical\u000d\u000a      support from the researchers. The results of each trial informed\u000d\u000a      subsequent stages of the programme and the combined results are informing\u000d\u000a      the design of recruitment and motivation strategies for the 5,000 CHAs who\u000d\u000a      will be hired over the next five years.\u000d\u000a    The first policy trial addresses Mr Mwila's question\u000d\u000a      directly by measuring the effect of the job `mission' on the selection,\u000d\u000a      retention and performance of CHAs. At the recruitment stage in the summer\u000d\u000a      of 2010, the nature of the job mission was experimentally varied: in half\u000d\u000a      of the districts, the mission was advertised as `help the community';\u000d\u000a      whereas in the other half, the mission was advertised as leading to career\u000d\u000a      advancement in the health sector (Source E). The researchers then\u000d\u000a      collected information on the skill level, pro-social motivation and career\u000d\u000a      ambitions of the two groups of applicants, and put in place systems to\u000d\u000a      measure performance on the field when CHAs were deployed in July 2012.\u000d\u000a    Performance was measured over the course of one year until July 2013 and\u000d\u000a      the results showed a marked difference in skill levels and performance\u000d\u000a      between the two groups. Applicants recruited on the basis of career\u000d\u000a      opportunities have higher skills, stronger scientific background and\u000d\u000a      stronger field performance. This does not come at the expense of lower\u000d\u000a      pro-social motivation, as the two groups score similarly on a battery of\u000d\u000a      tests that measure social preferences towards the community. Retention\u000d\u000a      rates are also similar in the two groups in the short term, but CHAs\u000d\u000a      recruited on the basis of career opportunities are more likely to want to\u000d\u000a      move up the ladder, suggesting a trade-off between job retention and\u000d\u000a      performance in the long-run.\u000d\u000a    Upon hearing about the findings, the Permanent Secretary and the Minister\u000d\u000a      have agreed that highlighting career opportunities is a more effective\u000d\u000a      recruitment strategy and the career advancement advert is currently being\u000d\u000a      used to recruit the 2013 CHA cohort (Source H).\u000d\u000a    The second policy trial was embedded in the one-year\u000d\u000a      training programme for CHAs that ran from July 2011 until July 2012.\u000d\u000a      During training, four forms of non-monetary motivation schemes (providing\u000d\u000a      various combinations of rank feedback and social recognition) were offered\u000d\u000a      to motivate study effort. (Source D)\u000d\u000a    The findings indicate that providing relative performance feedback\u000d\u000a      reduces performance, but that both MOH recognition and community\u000d\u000a      recognition increase performance. But since all recognition schemes\u000d\u000a      implicitly provide relative performance feedback, the net effect is zero\u000d\u000a      (Source G). Qualitative evidence from interviews with the trainees\u000d\u000a      suggests that these responses are partly due to their reluctance to draw\u000d\u000a      attention to themselves or be seen as non-team players. These results\u000d\u000a      directly affected the design of motivational strategies at the deployment\u000d\u000a      stage. Indeed, while originally the MOH was considering social recognition\u000d\u000a      schemes, in the light of the results and after consultation with the\u000d\u000a      researchers, the MOH decided not to implement recognition schemes once\u000d\u000a      CHAs were deployed to the field.\u000d\u000a    The third policy trial, which started in December 2012,\u000d\u000a      aims to quantify the effect of work autonomy on performance. The\u000d\u000a      experiment randomly assigns CHAs to two groups that vary their autonomy in\u000d\u000a      setting goals for the number of household visits to complete in a given\u000d\u000a      month. In the first group, goals are set by supervisors; in the second,\u000d\u000a      CHAs set their own goals. In line with most of the research evidence on\u000d\u000a      workers' motivation, the MOH sees goal-setting as a fundamental tool to\u000d\u000a      ensure good performance. The experiment is shedding light on which\u000d\u000a      goal-setting strategy is most effective.\u000d\u000a    Links between research and impact: The previous field research had\u000d\u000a      a direct impact on MoH in the approach that it has taken to investigating\u000d\u000a      options for policy reform, leading the MoH to use an experimental\u000d\u000a      intervention to inform policy. The use of field-based interventions by\u000d\u000a      policy makers is rare and, without having access to prior successful\u000d\u000a      peer-reviewed papers by the authors, the MoH would have been less likely\u000d\u000a      to embrace this approach. The work has fundamentally changed personnel\u000d\u000a      practices within MoH leading to the use of state of the art research\u000d\u000a      designs embedded in the policy itself to provide evidence base for future\u000d\u000a      policy design. This mode of collaboration between policy makers and\u000d\u000a      academic researchers represents a major departure from the standard model\u000d\u000a      whereby policies are evaluated ex-post by commercial consultants. The\u000d\u000a      success of the CHA research collaboration has started a new dialogue to\u000d\u000a      reform recruitment and motivation strategies for nurses, doctors and civil\u000d\u000a      servants within MoH. The impact on policy is on-going. Yet already, the\u000d\u000a      results of the recruitment experiment have informed the recruitment\u000d\u000a      strategy for all subsequent cohort of CHAs; the results of the training\u000d\u000a      experiment have dissuaded the ministry from using social recognition\u000d\u000a      schemes as motivation.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The recruitment and retention of qualified health workers is one of the\u000d\u000a      most pressing challenges in developing countries today, especially in\u000d\u000a      rural areas. Research by Oriana Bandiera and her colleagues is\u000d\u000a      underpinning a policy implemented by the Ministry of Health in Zambia to\u000d\u000a      recruit and motivate a new cadre of health workers called `community\u000d\u000a      health assistants' (CHAs). The collaboration between the researchers and\u000d\u000a      policy-makers involved three randomised controlled trials to determine\u000d\u000a      effective recruitment and motivation strategies for CHAs.

The programme applies an innovative methodology &#8212;\u000d\u000a      field experiments run in collaboration with firms and non-governmental\u000d\u000a      organisations (NGOs) &#8212; to study the interaction between financial\u000d\u000a      incentives and other determinants of behaviour in the workplace, such as\u000d\u000a      social relations, rank status and non-monetary rewards.\u000d\u000a    In a series of papers with Imran Rasul (University of Chicago, then\u000d\u000a      University College London) and Iwan Barankay (Warwick University, then\u000d\u000a      Wharton School), Bandiera implemented an exogenously timed sequence of\u000d\u000a      incentive schemes in a controlled way during the regular operations of a\u000d\u000a      firm over a four-year period. The interplay between incentives and the\u000d\u000a      social organisation of the workplace is identified by combining the firm's\u000d\u000a      personnel data with custom-designed surveys that measure the social\u000d\u000a      connections of each and every employee and manager.\u000d\u000a    The research yields four sets of findings. First, social connections\u000d\u000a      drive behaviour in the workplace: workers and managers internalise the\u000d\u000a      effect of their effort on colleagues to whom they are socially connected.\u000d\u000a      Second, the extent to which workers and managers internalise the\u000d\u000a      externality depends on the strength of monetary incentives. Third,\u000d\u000a      workers' effort is shaped by their peers, so that the social organisation\u000d\u000a      of the workplace affects productivity and profits. Fourth, performance\u000d\u000a      feedback and rank incentives can backfire by reducing the productivity of\u000d\u000a      the least productive work teams.\u000d\u000a    The results have been published in a series of papers (1-6), of which\u000d\u000a      four were placed in `top five' economic journals and one was awarded the\u000d\u000a      2007 IZA Young Labor Economist Award established to `honor an outstanding\u000d\u000a      published paper in labor economics written by young researchers' (www.iza.org).\u000d\u000a    In 2007, this body of research led to a dialogue with Nava Ashraf\u000d\u000a      (Harvard Business School), who was looking for an expert in incentive\u000d\u000a      design to study how to motivate agents hired by a Zambian NGO to\u000d\u000a      distribute condoms in urban areas. The conversation crystallised in a new\u000d\u000a      field experiment run in collaboration with the Society for Family Health\u000d\u000a      in Lusaka to investigate whether financial incentives are effective at\u000d\u000a      motivating health workers or whether (as is suggested by previous research\u000d\u000a      in psychology and behavioural economics) financial incentives crowd out\u000d\u000a      intrinsic motivation and reduce performance. The experiment randomly\u000d\u000a      assigned 1,200 agents hired to sell condoms to four different incentive\u000d\u000a      schemes. The study provides the first field evidence that financial\u000d\u000a      incentives do not crowd out intrinsic motivation but neither are they\u000d\u000a      effective at motivating effort. It also found that non-monetary rewards\u000d\u000a      led to a 50% increase in condom sales and were cost-effective. The\u000d\u000a      effectiveness of the non-monetary rewards seemed to be because they\u000d\u000a      allowed social comparisons among agents (7).\u000d\u000a    KEY RESEARCHER: Bandiera has been full-time at LSE since 1999.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40931","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Research on the impact of immigration on public finances [c] filled a\u000a      perceived gap in public knowledge and also led to significant\u000a        influence on public debate in the UK. Public debate on immigration\u000a      is often highly emotional and partisan: by providing undisputed evidence\u000a      and clear figures on the effects of immigration, the research challenged\u000a      unfounded claims and meant that interest groups had to engage with the\u000a      evidence, thus influencing the tone and nature of the public debate. The\u000a      importance of this debate is exemplified by the dispute in the months\u000a      running up to the full access of Bulgarians and Romanians to the EU labour\u000a      market starting from January 2014, and the impact that may have on UK\u000a      public finances. Previously, no work existed that had examined the impact\u000a      of A8 immigration on UK public finances since 2004, and the debate was\u000a      dominated by anecdotes and best guesses, often vastly exaggerating the\u000a      burden that A8 migration imposed on the public purse. Our work [c] changed\u000a      that debate by providing well-researched evidence that could not be (and\u000a      has not been) disputed. The results of the research have been referred\u000a        to both in discussion within the broader media and in House of Commons\u000a        debates, as the only conclusive evidence on the fiscal impact of A8\u000a      immigration (see e.g. [6]).\u000a    The methodological innovations and empirical plausibility of our results\u000a      led to the work [a, b] being more broadly influential in policy discussion\u000a      regarding the economic impact of immigration in the UK. The research thus\u000a      provided an important challenge to conventional wisdom, and has been\u000a        frequently cited in policy debate. As the sole source of factual\u000a      evidence on the effects of immigration on wages and fiscal impact of\u000a      immigration, the research has been cited by government bodies and in\u000a      various policy documents, Parliamentary debates and inquiries, and the\u000a      media.\u000a    Impact on government bodies\u000a      The work in question relating to labour market impact [a], though\u000a      subsequently developed and published in a leading academic journal [b],\u000a      was initially commissioned for the specific purpose of advising the Low\u000a      Pay Commission (LPC) on implications of migration for the setting of the\u000a      minimum wage. Our work addressed these key questions by developing new\u000a      methodology to analyse the impact of migration around the 5th percentile\u000a      of the wage distribution, around where the minimum wage is set.\u000a    As the LPC's Chief Economist confirms, this research provided\u000a        important insights that aided the commission when setting the minimum\u000a        wage in 2007. Specifically, it \"re-assured Commissioners that\u000a      minimum wage was providing an effective floor in the face of major changes\u000a      to the labour market as a result of increases in migration ... and\u000a      continues to influence the decisions of Commissioners\" [1]. Concern about\u000a      the impact of recent increases in migration was a theme noted in earlier\u000a      reports and specifically addressed by the commissioned research [2],\u000a      feeding, along with other commissioned research, into the decision to\u000a      recommend a rise in the minimum wage from &#163;5.35 to &#163;5.52 in October 2007,\u000a      affecting an estimated 1.3 million low-paid workers in October 2007 to\u000a      October 2008.\u000a    More recently, the most important and influential official investigation\u000a      into the impact of immigration on the UK economy conducted under the\u000a      Coalition government was the January 2012 report of the Migration Advisory\u000a      Committee [6], which, again, refers repeatedly to the research in that\u000a      report [a]. The research is now widely recognised as the only informed\u000a      source of knowledge on this particularly important aspect of immigration\u000a      policy, and led to the commissioning of a further report [d] to inform the\u000a      Migration Advisory Committee publication mentioned above [6].\u000a    Influence on Select Committee inquiry and Parliamentary debate\u000a      A report for a House of Lords Select Committee inquiry into the economic\u000a      effects of immigration was published in April 2008 [3]. This was the first\u000a      comprehensive examination into the way immigration has impacted on the UK\u000a      economy and its citizens. It drew together all the existing empirical\u000a      evidence and interviewed a large number of experts on the subject and\u000a      significantly influenced the debate on migration in the years to come [4].\u000a      This referred repeatedly to [a, c] above (7 times to [a] and 7 times to\u000a      [c]), as well as evidence Dustmann and Preston were invited to give to the\u000a      Select Committee the preceding October. It noted our finding of an overall\u000a      positive wage effect but also the lowering of wages in the lowest paid\u000a      jobs. The report also recognised the finding from earlier work that \"if\u000a      there is an impact of immigration on unemployment then it is statistically\u000a      poorly determined and probably small in size.\" Indeed, our work on\u000a      migration figures prominently in the evidence on which the report was\u000a      based [3] and in the Government's response [5], and it greatly enhanced\u000a      the impact of our findings on the effects of immigration on the public and\u000a      policy debate.\u000a    The research has figured in debates within the House of Commons in\u000a      relation to the minimum wage and cited, for example, by the then Secretary\u000a      of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform to answer\u000a      questions in 2008 on the impact of immigration on wages [7]. It has been\u000a      recognised as the leading research allowing assessment of the impact of\u000a      immigration on the GDP per capita of the native population. For instance,\u000a      the then Home Office minister with specific responsibility for migration,\u000a      Liam Byrne MP, referred to the work [a] in the House of Commons in April\u000a      2008 as \"the one good report in this area\" [8]. In his oral evidence to\u000a      the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee in June 2008, referred to an\u000a      estimate, based on the report [d], that migration contributed 0.15% per\u000a      annum to the GDP per capita of the native population [4], a number\u000a      described as \"small, but ... not insignificant\".\u000a    Impact on the media\u000a      The research described in section 2 remains the primary analysis of the\u000a      effects of immigration, both on wages and on public finances. As a result,\u000a      it has played a central role in informing media coverage of this issue,\u000a      particularly in the financial press. Examples may be found through the\u000a      impact period, and the research in [c], particularly, saw renewed interest\u000a      in 2012-13 in the run-up to allowing Bulgarians and Romanians into the UK\u000a      labour market. Indicative examples of media coverage are:\u000a    - the Independent described the net benefits of immigration (July\u000a      2009) [9].\u000a    - Petros Fassoulas in the New Statesman used the research to\u000a      argue that immigration is a boon for society (January 2009) [10]; 24,910\u000a      circulation.\u000a    - Tim Harford in the Financial Times cited research as evidence\u000a      of the net contribution A8 immigrants have made to the public purse (March\u000a      2013) [11]; 393k daily print and web readers.\u000a    - Brian Groom in the Financial Times cited the wages study as\u000a      evidence of the negligible effects on wages (March 2013) [12]; 393k daily\u000a      print and web readers.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research at UCL provided the primary analysis of the effects of\u000a      immigration on wages and the fiscal costs and benefits of A8 migration to\u000a      the UK.

This work\u000a      has focused on two strands: the effect of immigration on wages in the host\u000a      country, and the fiscal consequences of immigration.\u000a    In 2007, we were commissioned by the Low Pay Commission (LPC) to research\u000a      the implications of immigration for the setting of the minimum wage in the\u000a      UK. The resulting report [a] was written by Dustmann and Ian Preston (also\u000a      Professor of Economics at UCL and CReAM) and Tommaso Frattini (then a PhD\u000a      student). At the time, the debate on immigration, and the existing\u000a      conceptual and empirical models focused either on the overall wage effects\u000a      of migration or the effects on particular skill groups. However, for the\u000a      LPC, what was of interest was how immigration affected native wages at\u000a        the low end of the wage distribution, particularly the 5th\u000a      percentile, where the minimum wage is more likely to be binding.\u000a    We developed novel theory and conceptual work and a new empirical\u000a      framework for the estimation of these effects, with several key\u000a      innovations. The academic paper emerging from this research [b] was\u000a      published in 2012. We found that over the period studied (1997-2005)\u000a      immigration to the UK contributed positively to average wage growth of\u000a      UK-born workers. However, while benefiting workers in the middle and upper\u000a      part of the wage distribution, it put downward pressure on wages of\u000a      workers at the bottom of the distribution. Over the period considered, our\u000a      estimates suggested that immigration held wages back by 0.7p per hour at\u000a      the 10th percentile but contributed about 1.5p per hour to wage growth at\u000a      the median and slightly more than 2p per hour at the 90th percentile.\u000a    As a response to an ongoing academic and public debate on the fiscal cost\u000a      of A8 migration (i.e. from countries who joined the EU in 2004) to the UK,\u000a      which was based on no factual evidence, Dustmann, Frattini and Caroline\u000a      Halls (an MSc student and Research Assistant at CReAM) began research on\u000a      this issue in 2009, which resulted in a paper published in Fiscal\u000a        Studies in 2010 [c]. That same year, it became part of a research\u000a      report for the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) [d]. We found that:\u000a    - A8 immigrants who arrived after EU enlargement in 2004, and who have at\u000a      least one year of residence &#8212; and are therefore legally eligible to claim\u000a      benefits &#8212; are about 60% less likely than natives to receive state\u000a      benefits or tax credits, and to live in social housing.\u000a    - Comparing the net fiscal contribution of A8 immigrants with that of\u000a      individuals born in the UK, in each fiscal year since enlargement in 2004,\u000a      A8 immigrants made a positive contribution to public finance.\u000a    - In the latest fiscal year, 2008-09, A8 immigrants paid 37% more in\u000a      direct or indirect taxes than was spent on public goods and services that\u000a      they received. We also showed that on average, A8 workers have a better\u000a      educational background than UK-born workers, but receive lower wages,\u000a      especially in the period immediately after coming to the UK.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40937","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    The research described in section 2 has stimulated and fundamentally\u000d      changed the public and policy debate about taxation, and has had direct\u000d      consequences for tax legislation in the United Kingdom. A key example of\u000d      this was the publication of the Mirrlees Review of Tax Reform\u000d      established by the ESRC Centre, under the direction of Richard Blundell\u000d      and underpinned by his research, which has had a significant impact on tax\u000d      and benefit reform in the UK and abroad.\u000d    Each volume of the report was received with widespread acclaim in the\u000d      major news outlets. On 18 September 2011, the Financial Times ran\u000d      a glowing lead editorial on the policy recommendations of the Review,\u000d      ending: `Were Mr Osborne to pursue such aims, he would do Britain a\u000d      service', echoing the Economist's enthusiastic appraisal a year\u000d      earlier [1]. While Larry Summers, the then US Treasury Secretary (and\u000d      Professor at Harvard University) wrote in 2010, on the release of the\u000d      first volume: `Theory and practice rarely are brought together\u000d      effectively. It should be read by anyone who cares about the future of\u000d      taxation &#8212; that is anyone who cares about the future of government'\u000d      (quoted in [e] in section 3).\u000d    The publication of the first volume was an important factor in the Treasury\u000a        Select Committee's decision to launch an important inquiry into the\u000d        principles of tax policy. On 24 November 2010, the Select Committee\u000d      wrote: `In the last month, the Institute for Fiscal Studies in London and\u000d      the OECD have each published important reports into the fundamentals of\u000d      tax policy. The Mirrlees Review, published by the IFS, argues that\u000d      the tax system should be considered as a whole with the benefit system,\u000d      seek neutrality, and achieve progressivity as efficiently as possible. The\u000d      Treasury Committee has decided to launch its own inquiry into the\u000d      principles which should underpin the tax system' [2].\u000d    After the final volume of the report was launched, Blundell delivered\u000d      specific presentations of the tax reform proposals from this research to\u000d      various policy audiences in the UK and abroad, ensuring that the research\u000d      made an integral contribution to debate on tax policy reform. These\u000d      included, for example, discussions with the following audiences:\u000d    - Oral testimony to HM Treasury in the UK (25 January 2011) [3];\u000d    - European Union Tax Commissioners (29 November 2011);\u000d    - The International Monetary Fund (22 November 2011).\u000d    The Review is now an intrinsic part of policy discussion\u000d      regarding tax reform in the UK and abroad, and is routinely cited in\u000d      policy reports and in the media. The launch of each volume was covered in\u000d      the press, and the findings are regularly referred to, e.g. in articles in\u000d      the Telegraph as recently as September 2012 and March 2013 [4].\u000d      Some key examples of its use in policy are described below.\u000d    The Review provided the foundation evidence, presented by\u000d      Professor Blundell and colleagues, for the influential Treasury Select\u000d      Committee Report on Principles of Tax Policy published on 10 March 2011.\u000d      The proposals on earnings tax reform in the Mirrlees Review, which\u000d      were based on Blundell's research, formed the key evidence for the\u000d        Treasury Committee Report, Principles of Tax Policy, 2011 (see\u000d      especially p. 11 of [3]) which used it as a framework to formulate its own\u000d      recommendations.\u000d    Similarly, the Office of Tax Simplification, which was mandated with\u000d      assessing the worth of the UK's tax allowances and relief in 2010-11,\u000d      relied heavily on the Mirrlees Review as a far more exhaustive\u000d      assessment of the overall tax system (p. 5), as well as in discussing\u000d      specific aspects such as inheritance tax (p. 15) (for which it recommended\u000d      a top-down review, following the conclusions of the Review) and\u000d      corporation tax [4]. This report was presented to the Chancellor to inform\u000d      the 2011 Budget.\u000d    The research not only helped make the original business case for the\u000d        Universal Credit reform introduced as part of the Welfare Reform Act\u000d      2012, but also had direct impact on the design of the reform. This\u000d      reform involved a complete redesign of the benefit and tax credit system\u000d      in the UK, involving some &#163;55bn of government expenditure impacting on\u000d      more than 8 million families, with a limited rollout beginning from April\u000d      2013. As HM Treasury writes, `Professor Blundell's micro-econometric\u000d      research on labour supply and the tax and benefit system has directly\u000d      influenced UK economic analysis and policy making with respect to the\u000d      design of tax, tax-credit and benefit integration reforms. For example we\u000d      have drawn on his work in considering the business case for Universal\u000d      Credit, the Government's flagship reform of the welfare system, and in\u000d      other modelling and analysis of the welfare system and labour market to\u000d      inform policy thinking and advice to ministers' [5].\u000d    In June 2012, Blundell was invited by Lord Freud (Minister for Welfare)\u000d      to join a high level Universal Credit Evaluation Committee at the\u000d      Department of Work and Pensions. This committee meets regularly to\u000d      actively monitor and critically assess the roll out of Universal\u000d        Credit, according to a Universal Credit Evaluation Framework\u000d      released in December 2012 [6]. Given the delays with the roll out, this\u000d      committee plays an essential role. As the department's Permanent Secretary\u000d      confirms, `Professor Blundell's micro-econometric research on labour\u000d      supply and the tax and benefit system is one of the Department's primary\u000d      sources for understanding the possible employment impacts of the new\u000d      Universal Credit' [7].\u000d    The research has also influenced policy debate in Europe. For\u000d      instance, in 2010, the CPB Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis\u000d      (CPB) at that country's Ministry of Finance announced that a Study\u000d      Committee on Taxation had been established, `inspired by the Mirrlees\u000d        Review', and charged with offering a broad review of the Dutch tax\u000d      system and proposing directions for reform.' The study group published its\u000d      recommendations in April 2010 [8].\u000d    In recognition of the contribution of Blundell's research, in 2012 he was\u000d      awarded the Prize in Labor Economics by the German institute for the study\u000d      of labour, IZA, for `his path-breaking contributions to the econometric\u000d      analysis of labor markets and public policy reforms.' It added: `Professor\u000d      Blundell has played a major role in the development of modern labor and\u000d      policy analysis. His work has been enormously influential in the worldwide\u000d      debates about tax and welfare reforms over the past decades.' This came\u000d      shortly after the IZA itself proposed a tax reform for Germany `which is\u000d      based largely on the methodology developed by Richard Blundell' [9].\u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    The research carried out by Professor Richard Blundell transformed\u000d      understanding of the responsiveness of labour supply to tax and welfare\u000d      reform, and fundamentally changed the public debate about taxation. This\u000d      was achieved most clearly through the Mirrlees Review of Tax Reform,\u000d      co-authored by Professor Blundell, and through publications that provided\u000d      the key scientific evidence behind the tax rate, tax credit and benefit\u000d      integration proposals. These proposals had substantive impact on policy\u000d      reform at home and abroad, ranging from public debate on the fundamental\u000d      principles of taxation to immediate impact on tax and welfare reform\u000d      legislation, such as the business case for the Universal Credit reform.\u000d    ","ImpactType":"Economic","Institution":"\u000d    University College London\u000d    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"University College London","InstitutionName":"University College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007784}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d    \u000a[a] `Estimating Labour Supply Responses using Tax Reforms', Econometrica,\u000d      Vol. 66, No. 4, 827-861, July 1998; co-authored with Costas Meghir (UCL)\u000d      and Alan Duncan (Centre Research Fellow).

In 1991 he established the ESRC Research Centre for the\u000d      Microeconomic Analysis of Public Policy at the Institute for Fiscal\u000d      Studies (IFS) that used this rigorous microeconomic research to inform the\u000d      tax policy debate. This research was supported at UCL by the award of a\u000d      six-year Leverhulme Professorial Research Fellowship in 1998.\u000d    A key publication from this research was a paper [a, in section 3 below]\u000d      by Richard Blundell (UCL), Costas Meghir (UCL 1985-present) and Alan\u000d      Duncan (Centre Research Fellow, 1993-present) entitled `Estimating Labour\u000d      Supply Responses Using Tax Policy Reforms' and published in Econometrica\u000d      in 1998. This paper established a robust method for estimation and\u000d      produced new estimates for labour supply elasticities in the UK. It won\u000d      the Frisch Prize in 2000 awarded to the best applied paper published in Econometrica,\u000d      the most prestigious international refereed journal in econometrics. This\u000d      research was subsequently developed [b] to establish clear differences in\u000d      labour supply behaviour at the extensive and intensive margins.\u000d    This research was put to work in the tax policy context in the 2001\u000d      Keynes Lecture by Professor Blundell [c], the annual British Academy\u000d      Public Lecture in Economics presented to a wide policy audience, and also\u000d      in a 2000 paper on the impact of the then-proposed Working Family Tax\u000d      Credit reform [d]. This work was described as `a remarkable combination of\u000d      academic excellence and policy relevance' in the statement of the IZA\u000d      Prize in Labour Economics, the leading international prize in labour\u000d      economics, awarded to Blundell in 2012.\u000d    This work by Blundell, his colleagues and his students provided new and\u000d      robust microeconometric methods for estimating labour supply parameters\u000d      from individual micro-data. These new methods allowed for unobserved\u000d      heterogeneity across families, fixed costs of work, and for stigma costs\u000d      in the take-up of tax-credits and welfare benefits. Using micro-data from\u000d      the UK over a long period of time, publications [a-c] are considered to\u000d      have established the key facts on the responses of labour supply to tax\u000d      reform. The methodology developed there and the estimated elasticities\u000d      from that work have been used extensively in tax and welfare policy design\u000d      and analysis, both in the UK and abroad. The research uncovered robust\u000d      estimates of the differences in labour supply response by family type, the\u000d      key role of stigma costs and the importance of distinguishing between\u000d      impacts of employment and weekly hours worked.\u000d    This research underpinned the analysis and recommendations of the Mirrlees\u000a        Review, published in two volumes in 2010 and 2011 by the Institute\u000d      for Fiscal Studies [e, f]. This review used Blundell's research to show\u000d      how to improve the design of tax credit and benefit policy reforms for\u000d      low-wage workers, particularly families with children. The research papers\u000d      [a-d] described above provided the scientific evidence for the\u000d      recommendations on the tax rate, tax credit and benefit integration\u000d      proposals in the Review. The final report was launched by\u000d      Professors Richard Blundell and James Mirrlees (Cambridge) at the\u000d      Institute for Government in 2011.\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41637","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"146669","Name":"Cyprus"},{"GeoNamesId":"597427","Name":"Lithuania"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    THE IMPACT: Official EU policy for increasing employment now includes\u000d\u000a      healthcare and low-skill domestic services. There is more emphasis on\u000d\u000a      labour-intensive sectors than on technologically advanced sectors. This\u000d\u000a      was not previously the case: the `Lisbon strategy' of 2000 established\u000d\u000a      overall targets without reference to sectors of employment. The overall\u000d\u000a      target for the rate of employment across the EU was 70% of the 15-64 age\u000d\u000a      group, to be achieved by 2010. Despite the failure to reach this target,\u000d\u000a      the Europe 2020 Strategy (currently in force) raised the target to 75% for\u000d\u000a      the age group 20-64. Initially, the guidelines for increasing employment\u000d\u000a      rates to these levels were based on recommendations about the acquisition\u000d\u000a      of skills, increasing labour mobility, computerisation, technological\u000d\u000a      innovation and `good jobs' (a phrase that lacked precise definition). Now\u000d\u000a      more emphasis is given to sectors such as `green' employment and\u000d\u000a      healthcare.\u000d\u000a    LINKS BETWEEN RESEARCH AND IMPACT: Pissarides has been active in the\u000d\u000a      policy debate on employment and unemployment for several decades.\u000d\u000a      Beginning with his keynote at the Employment Conference of the Austrian\u000d\u000a      Presidency in Vienna in 2006 [A], he became a key contributor to European\u000d\u000a      debates about the sources of job creation. In March 2011, at an event to\u000d\u000a      celebrate his recent Nobel Prize attended by the Commission President and\u000d\u000a      all the Commissioners connected with economic policy, Pissarides made his\u000d\u000a      argument about the importance of labour-intensive services more\u000d\u000a      forcefully, urging the Commission to shift its emphasis in that direction.\u000d\u000a      In the Commission's Growth Strategy 2012, published in September 2011 (and\u000d\u000a      follow-up documents published in April 2012), there is a new emphasis on\u000d\u000a      healthcare and unskilled services.\u000d\u000a    At the `Jobs for Europe' summit in September 2012, the emphasis was on\u000d\u000a      job creation in ICT, the green economy and healthcare, respectively\u000d\u000a      addressing new technology and productivity growth, environmental concerns\u000d\u000a      and employment at lower skill levels [B]. Pissarides was given the most\u000d\u000a      prestigious platform to explain his analysis of employment creation and\u000d\u000a      several members of the Commission staff connected with employment,\u000d\u000a      including the Commissioner, credited him in their presentations at least\u000d\u000a      partly with the shift in emphasis.\u000d\u000a    The way in which the 2012 Employment Package put the concept of dynamic\u000d\u000a      labour markets into the heart of EU employment policy, had a direct\u000d\u000a      connection with Pissarides's scholarly work. The March 2011 event was the\u000d\u000a      first intellectual milestone in its preparation and his continued presence\u000d\u000a      in the policy debate strengthens the implementation [C].\u000d\u000a    Following the summit, work currently at the Commission is examining the\u000d\u000a      potential of healthcare and unskilled household services for employment\u000d\u000a      generation. When the work is completed, there will be another summit to\u000d\u000a      discuss the next phase in the role that could be played by these sectors\u000d\u000a      in the pursuit of the Europe 2020 employment objectives. Pissarides has\u000d\u000a      been invited to participate in the next phase of this work.\u000d\u000a    Pissarides has repeatedly emphasised in his involvement in EU policy\u000d\u000a      debates that raising employment opportunities is the best social policy,\u000d\u000a      in terms of both income growth and social inclusion. But apart from the\u000d\u000a      benefits to society overall, the emphasis on the healthcare sector is also\u000d\u000a      important in light of the ageing population. The sector will be both\u000d\u000a      provider of services to an ageing population and a source of employment\u000d\u000a      for many older people, especially women, who have a comparative advantage\u000d\u000a      in healthcare.\u000d\u000a    This shift of emphasis in the type of jobs that are created is important\u000d\u000a      for Europe, as the eurozone emerges from the financial crisis.\u000d\u000a      Unemployment is high, especially for young people, mainly because of the\u000d\u000a      austerity associated with the debt reduction programme. The key question\u000d\u000a      debated at both national and EU levels is how to create new jobs that will\u000d\u000a      absorb the unemployed, and how to encourage more women and older people to\u000d\u000a      enter the labour force and stay on at work.\u000d\u000a    National governments look to the Commission for guidance, in addition to\u000d\u000a      their own research. In that respect, the Commission's new emphasis on\u000d\u000a      employment expansion sectors could prove very influential in the design of\u000d\u000a      national policies for employment. Pissarides has been active in this\u000d\u000a      dissemination process. Over the past 12 months, he has been involved in at\u000d\u000a      least five high-level events focused on these issues. In October 2012, in\u000d\u000a      connection with the Cyprus Presidency of the European Union, he was the\u000d\u000a      invited speaker at the Informal Meeting of Education Ministers, where he\u000d\u000a      outlined his views on youth unemployment and education. In January 2013,\u000d\u000a      he was invited as an academic expert on austerity and rebuilding Europe's\u000d\u000a      labour markets at the Informal Meeting of World Leaders during the World\u000d\u000a      Economic Forum's annual meetings in Davos. In July 2013, he participated\u000d\u000a      at the European Leaders Summit on youth unemployment in Berlin, with the\u000d\u000a      participation of the majority of EU heads of government and employment\u000d\u000a      ministers. And in October 2013 he was invited back in Brussels to be the\u000d\u000a      guest of honour at the tenth annual high-level \"State of Europe\" summit\u000d\u000a      that Friends of Europe co-organised with the Lithuanian EU\u000d\u000a      Presidency and the Financial Times, where he spoke again about the\u000d\u000a      need to shift the emphasis to job creation in Europe from the current\u000d\u000a      austerity agenda.\u000d\u000a    Better understanding of the sources of job creation enables better\u000d\u000a      educational and infrastructure planning. It also enables better national\u000d\u000a      polices with respect to wages and social transfers. In countries like the\u000d\u000a      UK, this research is of particular interest because of the involvement of\u000d\u000a      the state with healthcare. With healthcare spending expected to increase\u000d\u000a      rapidly as the demand for healthcare services increases, the UK government\u000d\u000a      needs to formulate a policy for the future of the NHS and the extent to\u000d\u000a      which it wishes to see an expansion of employment under the public sector\u000d\u000a      umbrella.\u000d\u000a    A commitment to continue meeting healthcare demands within the NHS would\u000d\u000a      necessitate higher taxes, which is likely to be incompatible with other\u000d\u000a      government objectives, such as encouraging a low-tax corporate culture.\u000d\u000a      Other countries in Europe face similar problems as they plan their\u000d\u000a      healthcare systems for the future. A recent plea to the Chancellor to\u000d\u000a      think of the bigger questions about future job creation and the fiscal\u000d\u000a      balance is in Pissarides' comment on the Autumn Statement 2012, published\u000d\u000a      by the British Academy [D]. More recently, in October 2013, he was invited\u000d\u000a      to a discussion between a small group of experts and the deputy Prime\u000d\u000a      Minister where he again emphasised the role of NHS in job creation and the\u000d\u000a      dilemma of public sector funding, a topic that attracted a lot of\u000d\u000a      attention in the subsequent discussion.\u000d\u000a    WHY THE IMPACT MATTERS: Higher employment drives a rise in living\u000d\u000a      standards and the reduction of poverty, as more people share in Europe's\u000d\u000a      prosperity. Enhancing it at the top end of the skills distribution\u000d\u000a      improves EU competitiveness and becomes a driver for growth. But unless it\u000d\u000a      can also be improved at the bottom end, the benefits from growth are not\u000d\u000a      equally shared and poorer sections of society must rely on social\u000d\u000a      transfers to maintain their living standards. This is not a satisfactory\u000d\u000a      situation.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research by Christopher Pissarides and his LSE colleague Rachel Ngai has\u000d\u000a      led to official acceptance by European Union (EU) policy-makers that a\u000d\u000a      major source of new jobs will be sectors that provide services to the\u000d\u000a      general public, notably healthcare and low-skill domestic services. The\u000d\u000a      European Commission was initially hostile to this view, preferring the\u000d\u000a      emphasis of the EU's so-called `Lisbon strategy' on job creation in\u000d\u000a      advanced technology industries. But the Commission's Growth Survey 2012\u000d\u000a      indicates that it has now adopted Pissarides' approach, and at the `Jobs\u000d\u000a      for Europe' summit in September 2012 he was invited to deliver a keynote\u000d\u000a      speech on the same platform as the `three Presidents' (of the Commission,\u000d\u000a      the European Council and the European Parliament). His policy\u000d\u000a      recommendations &#8212; including the need for better incentives for the\u000d\u000a      `marketisation' of activity in the care and unskilled services sectors &#8212;\u000d\u000a      are now part of the official EU agenda on job creation. He has also\u000d\u000a      advised national governments, including in his native Cyprus, where he was\u000d\u000a      appointed president of the government's Economic Policy Council in 2013.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    London School of Economics and Political Science\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"London School of Economics and Political Science","InstitutionName":"London School of Economics & Political Science","PeerGroup":"C","Region":"London","UKPRN":10004063}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2267057","Name":"Lisbon"},{"GeoNamesId":"2800867","Name":"Bruxelles-Capitale"},{"GeoNamesId":"2761369","Name":"Vienna"},{"GeoNamesId":"2950159","Name":"Berlin"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a1.

But from the late 1990s, he shifted his\u000d\u000a      attention to employment. The observation that prompted the research with\u000d\u000a      Ngai is that during periods of economic growth, the structure of\u000d\u000a      employment is changing all the time. The initial big changes are the\u000d\u000a      decline of agricultural employment, the rise and subsequent decline of\u000d\u000a      industrial employment and the rise of service employment. But structural\u000d\u000a      change continues even in post-industrial economies: some sectors decline\u000d\u000a      or disappear while others continue to flourish; and some service sectors\u000d\u000a      increase rapidly while others decline.\u000d\u000a    Ngai and Pissarides developed a model of a growing economy that undergoes\u000d\u000a      structural change (2). The key result is that structural change co-exists\u000d\u000a      with aggregate balanced growth, thus confirming the facts of the Solow\u000d\u000a      growth model in an economy experiencing large employment shifts. The model\u000d\u000a      has become the most highly cited model of the co-existence of balanced\u000d\u000a      growth and structural change (around 600 citations in Google Scholar as of\u000d\u000a      October 2013).\u000d\u000a    The approach emphasises the importance of technological progress in the\u000d\u000a      reallocation of labour across sectors. It shows that eventually labour\u000d\u000a      will leave the fast-growing sectors and be drawn to sectors with low\u000d\u000a      productivity growth, in particular the caring services (childcare and\u000d\u000a      healthcare services), retailing and personal services. Previous empirical\u000d\u000a      studies had described the facts of structural change, but the Ngai and\u000d\u000a      Pissarides formalisation was new; other researchers have since built on\u000d\u000a      their work to show that it is an important explanation of structural\u000d\u000a      change in mature economies (3).\u000d\u000a    Building on this framework, Ngai and Pissarides studied long-term trends\u000d\u000a      in aggregate hours of work (4). The long swings in hours are explained by\u000d\u000a      substitutions between home and market production, when the latter has\u000d\u000a      productivity growth at least as fast as the former. Sectors with slow\u000d\u000a      productivity growth attract labour from faster-growing sectors that\u000d\u000a      produce distant substitutes, because distant substitutes are consumed in\u000d\u000a      more or less fixed proportions.\u000d\u000a    This research opened up two further fruitful avenues with policy\u000d\u000a      relevance. First, employment rates vary widely across sectors of economic\u000d\u000a      activity and the countries that fail to achieve high employment are\u000d\u000a      failing in a particular set of sectors. Second, taxation and other forms\u000d\u000a      of regulation have a different impact on different sectors, with an\u000d\u000a      especially strong influence in sectors that have home substitutes.\u000d\u000a    Building on these findings, Ngai and Pissarides examined the distribution\u000d\u000a      of employment across the OECD and found that countries that fail to\u000d\u000a      satisfy the EU's `Europe 2020' targets fail mainly in the sectors that\u000d\u000a      have home substitutes &#8212; the best examples being healthcare, childcare and\u000d\u000a      unskilled services, including retail trade, such as shop assistants (5).\u000d\u000a      There are also some failures in the provision of business services, but it\u000d\u000a      is not yet clear if this is because of differences in the organisation of\u000d\u000a      firms and the extent to which they franchise services.\u000d\u000a    To increase employment, especially of women and older people, European\u000d\u000a      countries have to provide better incentives for the `marketisation' of\u000d\u000a      activity in the care and unskilled services sectors. The Scandinavian\u000d\u000a      countries do so by heavily subsidising social services but this requires\u000d\u000a      high tax rates elsewhere, hurting economic activity in the other sectors.\u000d\u000a      The United States and (to a lesser extent) the UK achieve it by\u000d\u000a      deregulating the lower skilled occupations and tolerating more income\u000d\u000a      inequality. Neither solution is perfect, but the two strategies need to be\u000d\u000a      brought into the open and discussed at national and EU levels.\u000d\u000a    KEY RESEARCHERS: Professor Pissarides has been at LSE since 1976;\u000d\u000a      Dr Ngai since 2001.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42605","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The OFT estimates that UK consumers spent &#163;300 million on payment\u000d\u000a      surcharges at the ten largest airlines during 2009 alone [1]. Upon\u000d\u000a      receiving a super-complaint from Which? in March 2011, the OFT\u000d\u000a      commissioned research into the advertising of prices, part of which was\u000d\u000a      our experimental study as described in section 2. The experimental study\u000d\u000a      [e] became the prime evidence for the OFT's new stance against drip\u000d\u000a      pricing.\u000d\u000a    On 2 December 2010, OFT announced that it had identified, based on\u000d\u000a      `ground-breaking behavioural economics research' among other sources, that\u000d\u000a      drip pricing, time-limited offers and baiting sales were pricing\u000d\u000a      techniques with the potential to cause the greatest harm to consumers [2].\u000d\u000a      It warned that: \"On drip pricing, for example, businesses that ensure all\u000d\u000a      compulsory charges are included in the headline price, and make details of\u000d\u000a      all genuinely optional charges available at the early stages of the buying\u000d\u000a      process are less likely to be subject to OFT enforcement action.\"\u000d\u000a    On 28 June 2011, the OFT took action on this finding, specifically in the\u000d\u000a      travel sector where abuse was felt to be most rampant. It announced that\u000d\u000a      it had put passenger travel companies \"on notice to change misleading\u000d\u000a      debit and credit card surcharging practices or face enforcement action\u000d\u000a      under consumer protection laws\" [3].\u000d\u000a    It further added: \"Publishing its findings on these surcharges, following\u000d\u000a      a super-complaint from Which?, the OFT also calls for the law to\u000d\u000a      be updated to stop consumers being surcharged when buying goods and\u000d\u000a      services with any debit card.\"\u000d\u000a    As an immediate result, in July 2012, 12 major UK airlines (including\u000d\u000a      Easyjet and Ryanair) announced that they would include debit card charges\u000d\u000a      in their headline prices [4]. Thus, for instance, Ryanair announced that\u000d\u000a      its &#163;6 per flight administrative fee would be included in advertised\u000d\u000a      prices by August 2012, and in the website headline price by December. The\u000d\u000a      popularity of this move may be gauged by the fact that the news article\u000d\u000a      regarding this on the BBC website received 371 comments in a single day,\u000d\u000a      the content of which demonstrated the extreme frustration drip pricing had\u000d\u000a      caused consumers [4].\u000d\u000a    At this time, the EU Consumer Rights Directive, which would ban\u000d\u000a      businesses in many sectors, including the airline sector, from imposing\u000d\u000a      above-cost surcharges on any form of payment, was due to be implemented\u000d\u000a      from mid-2014. In December 2011, however, the UK government announced its\u000d\u000a      intention of becoming the first European country to ban this practice by\u000d\u000a      bringing forward its legislation. It cited the OFT recommendations based\u000d\u000a      on research as underpinning this decision [5].\u000d\u000a    In September-October 2012, the Department for Business, Innovation and\u000d\u000a      Skills (BIS) held a consultation on bringing the ban forward. This was\u000d\u000a      formally published on 18 January 2013 [6]. Meanwhile, on 18 December 2012,\u000d\u000a      the Consumer Rights (Payment Surcharges) Regulations 2012 was laid before\u000d\u000a      Parliament, and came into force from 6 April 2013 [7].\u000d\u000a    The research and its wide coverage in the press [e.g. 8] also contributed\u000d\u000a      to public debate on drip pricing and contributed important evidence to\u000d\u000a      general public dissatisfaction with the practice. As suggested by the\u000d\u000a      number of comments on the BBC news item described above, as well as the\u000d\u000a      439 comments received at the government announcement of December 2011, the\u000d\u000a      ban was immensely popular amongst UK consumers [9].\u000d\u000a    The UCL research has begun to influence regulation in other countries,\u000d\u000a      notably in the United States, where the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)\u000d\u000a      held a conference on drip pricing in 2012 where the OFT's chief economist,\u000d\u000a      Amelia Fletcher, presented the work [10]. As a result, in November 2012,\u000d\u000a      the FTC issued a warning to 22 hotel operators to stop drip pricing in the\u000d\u000a      United States [11].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    From the 1990s UCL Economics invested in the capacity to conduct\u000d\u000a      fundamental and applied research in behavioural and experimental\u000d\u000a      economics. This was the basis for the research which provided the evidence\u000d\u000a      base for the Office of Fair Trading to identify and act upon misleading\u000d\u000a      pricing practices, particularly `drip pricing', in 2010. As a result, 12\u000d\u000a      major airlines announced that they would include debit card charges in\u000d\u000a      their headline prices, and government announced that the EU-wide Consumer\u000d\u000a      Rights Directive would be implemented a year earlier than it was due to go\u000d\u000a      into effect.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Economic","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University College London\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"University College London","InstitutionName":"University College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007784}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a[a] Binmore, K. and Klemperer, P.

In the late 1990s Ken\u000d\u000a      Binmore (then Professor of Economics at UCL) started the dual strategy of\u000d\u000a      conducting experiments for purely academic work as well as to inform\u000d\u000a      real-world interventions at the Economic and Social Research\u000d\u000a      Council-funded Economic Learning and Social Evolution (ELSE) centre, where\u000d\u000a      often one informed the other. The most spectacular example of this was how\u000d\u000a      auction theory and experiments carried out at UCL informed the design of\u000d\u000a      the UK 3G auction in 2000, which raised an astonishing &#163;22.5bn and\u000d\u000a      triggered much subsequent research into the design and conduct of auctions\u000d\u000a      [a].\u000d\u000a    With Steffen Huck joining UCL in 2002, the Department began to build a\u000d\u000a      larger group in experimental and behavioural economics. In the area of\u000d\u000a      consumer decision-making, the group generated a wide array of high-quality\u000d\u000a      research. For example, in 2005 researchers examined the effects of\u000d\u000a      different forms of feedback information on the performance of markets that\u000d\u000a      suffer from moral hazard problems due to sequential exchange, and found\u000d\u000a      that two-sided market transparency is an important ingredient for the\u000d\u000a      design of well-functioning markets that are prone to moral hazard [b].\u000d\u000a      Subsequent work estimated risk preferences using novel elicitation\u000d\u000a      techniques [c], and explored the consequences of competition in the\u000d\u000a      presence of behavioural biases [d]. These studies provided the academic\u000d\u000a      foundation for capacity development in consumer policy questions.\u000d\u000a    In parallel, the group developed the capacity for more applied work. For\u000d\u000a      example, Huck and Brian Wallace developed experiments to inform Ofcom on\u000d\u000a      issues such as price transparency of telephone calls or ease of switching\u000d\u000a      telecom and internet providers. Huck also co-authored the first-ever\u000d\u000a      behavioural\/experimental study for the European Commission, an\u000d\u000a      investigation into retail finance titled \"Consumer decision making in\u000d\u000a      retail financial services\".\u000d\u000a    In 2009, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) commissioned UCL researchers\u000d\u000a      and London Economics to investigate various ways of `framing' prices, and\u000d\u000a      the impact on consumers. UCL's Huck and Wallace designed and carried out\u000d\u000a      the study, and did the data analysis and interpretation, while London\u000d\u000a      Economics provided administrative support and contributed to the policy\u000d\u000a      implications. The study investigates six different ways of \"framing\"\u000d\u000a      prices:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Standard upfront per-unit pricing (serving as a baseline);\u000d\u000a      Drip pricing where the consumers see only part of the full price\u000d\u000a        upfront and price increments are dripped through the buying process'\u000d\u000a      Sales in which a sale price is given and a pre-sale price is also\u000d\u000a        given as a reference to the consumer, `was &#163;2 is now &#163;1' (actual prices\u000d\u000a        are identical to the baseline treatment);\u000d\u000a      Complex pricing where the unit price requires some computations, `3\u000d\u000a        for the price of 2';\u000d\u000a      Baiting in which sellers may promote a special price but there is only\u000d\u000a        a limited number of goods actually available at that price;\u000d\u000a      Time-limited offers where the special price is only available for a\u000d\u000a        pre-defined short period of time.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    These frames were investigated in an experimental search market in the\u000d\u000a      UCL experimental laboratory where 166 consumer subjects were endowed with\u000d\u000a      a concave utility function and could buy multiple units of a good sold by\u000d\u000a      two different sellers. There were search costs (travel costs) each time a\u000d\u000a      consumer visited one of the two sellers. Each subject was confronted with\u000d\u000a      the baseline and two of the other frames, and all possible combinations of\u000d\u000a      frames were explored.\u000d\u000a    The research showed that all frames had adverse effects on consumer\u000d\u000a      behaviour and welfare, but identified drip pricing as, by far, the worst\u000d\u000a      offender, followed by time-limited offers and baiting. Drip pricing wiped\u000d\u000a      out 25% of consumer surplus relative to the baseline with straight per\u000d\u000a      unit prices shown upfront. The study also examined in close detail the\u000d\u000a      question of the external validity of its laboratory results, demonstrating\u000d\u000a      that, if anything, drip pricing would be an even bigger problem in\u000d\u000a      real-world shopping. The study was published as a working paper [e] and\u000d\u000a      written up for a policy audience in an OFT report.\u000d\u000a    In addition to Huck and Binmore, UCL researchers working in areas\u000d\u000a      contributing to the consumer agenda included Syngjoo Choi (then Assistant\u000d\u000a      Professor; now Associate Professor at UCL), Ran Spiegler (Professor at UCL\u000d\u000a      since 2006) and Brian Wallace (Senior Research Fellow; at UCL since 2006).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42637","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"146669","Name":"Cyprus"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    In demonstrating that bank nationalisation is not as costly as had been\u000d\u000a      thought, research by Andrianova and Demetriades went\u000d\u000a      against previous orthodoxy promoted by the World Bank and the IMF. Their\u000d\u000a      new research was presented at numerous academic conferences and seminars\u000d\u000a      in the UK and around the world, including Australia, Austria, China,\u000d\u000a      France, Germany, New Zealand and the Unites States, and in a series of\u000d\u000a      papers, the first of which was published in the Journal of Development\u000d\u000a        Economics on line in 2006 (in 2008 on paper).\u000d\u000a    Their ideas spread across both the academic and practitioner communities,\u000d\u000a      and were taken up by the media and policy commentators. For example, Handelsblatt,\u000d\u000a      Germany's leading financial newspaper, ran a feature on 15 February 2010\u000d\u000a      (\"Are state banks better than their reputation?\") comparing the findings\u000d\u000a      of the anti-nationalisation La Porta et al (2002) with those of Andrianova\u000d\u000a      et al (2008, 2011). The newspaper concluded that the findings of La\u000d\u000a      Porta et al were ideologically driven ([Source 1]). The research\u000d\u000a      was also cited by the media during the debate on proposals to privatise\u000d\u000a      Sberbank, Russia's largest savings bank. In addition, an article warning\u000d\u000a      against the risks of early de-nationalisation, citing the research, was\u000d\u000a      posted in February 2010 on VOX EU, the leading economic policy\u000d\u000a      portal in Europe.\u000d\u000a    The research played a crucial role in changing the academic and policy\u000d\u000a      climate, laying the intellectual foundation for the wave of bank\u000d\u000a      nationalisations that started in 2007 at the outset of the financial\u000d\u000a      crisis. Many bank nationalisations that have taken place since have been\u000d\u000a      directly or indirectly influenced by the research described above. The\u000d\u000a      impact of the research is most evident in two cases. These are the\u000d\u000a      nationalisation of Northern Rock in 2007-8, and the reform of Cyprus'\u000d\u000a      banking system in 2012-3.\u000d\u000a    Northern Rock is perhaps the first important episode in the great\u000d\u000a      financial crisis in the UK. The bank applied for, and was offered,\u000d\u000a      liquidity support on 17 September 2007. It was then fully nationalised on\u000d\u000a      22 February 2008. The Journal of Economic Development paper\u000d\u000a      mentioned above was presented at a seminar at HM Treasury on 14 September\u000d\u000a      2007 ([Source 2]). The seminar was attended by a large number of\u000d\u000a      government economists and officials. Many of these were directly involved\u000d\u000a      in the policy decisions that eventually led to the nationalisation of\u000d\u000a      Northern Rock. The bank's successful nationalisation in early 2008 paved\u000d\u000a      the way for further nationalisations in the autumn of the same year, both\u000d\u000a      in the UK and overseas.\u000d\u000a    Partly as a result of his influential research on bank ownership, in May\u000d\u000a      2012 Demetriades was appointed as governor of the Central Bank of\u000d\u000a      Cyprus and member of the European Central Bank's governing council. When\u000d\u000a      he took charge, the Cypriot banking sector was already in a critical\u000d\u000a      situation, having suffered huge losses because of the Greek bonds crisis.\u000d\u000a      Since January 2012, Cyprus had been relying on an emergency loan from\u000d\u000a      Russia to re-finance its maturing debt. On 13 March 2012, credit rating\u000d\u000a      agency Moody's slashed Cyprus's rating to the lowest \"junk\" status.\u000d\u000a    On 30 June 2012, a month after Demetriades' appointment, the Cypriot\u000d\u000a      government recapitalised the country's second-largest bank, Cyprus Popular\u000d\u000a      Bank (also known as Laiki Bank). As a result, the government acquired 84%\u000d\u000a      of the bank's equity &#8212; a de facto nationalisation.\u000d\u000a    In the spring of 2013, after long and complex negotiations between the\u000d\u000a      Cypriot Government, the Central Bank of Cyprus, the European Commission,\u000d\u000a      the European Central Bank and the IMF, Cyprus Popular Bank was shut down.\u000d\u000a      The bank's bad assets are being liquidated, and any remaining good assets\u000d\u000a      will be transferred to the country's other bank, the Bank of Cyprus. A\u000d\u000a      substantial fraction of the Bank of Cyprus' equity is therefore to be\u000d\u000a      owned by the government.\u000d\u000a    It is therefore evident that government's acquisitions played a major\u000d\u000a      role in the solution to the crisis of the Cypriot banking sector. Although\u000d\u000a      the entire process has been controversial, many commentators argue that\u000d\u000a      the solution achieves financial stability while avoiding issues of moral\u000d\u000a      hazard, by putting the burden of future bank restructuring onto creditors\u000d\u000a      and depositors rather than taxpayers in general. (Cyprus Popular Bank's\u000d\u000a      shareholder capital has been written off, and the uninsured deposits &#8212;\u000d\u000a      along with other creditor claims &#8212; will be largely lost).\u000d\u000a    In any case, the Cypriot banking sector has been stabilised, preserving\u000d\u000a      the viability of the Euro system. Given the risks of financial contagion,\u000d\u000a      failure to solve the Cyprus crisis might have had catastrophic\u000d\u000a      consequences for a number of Southern European countries.\u000d\u000a    In his capacity as Governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus, Demetriades\u000d\u000a      has actively contributed to the rescue of the Cypriot banking sector\u000d\u000a      ([Source 3], [Source [4]). In doing so, he has implemented the ideas\u000d\u000a      developed in his academic research at Leicester, to manage one of the\u000d\u000a      world's most complex banking crises.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Since the financial crisis of 2007-8, many failing banks have had to be\u000d\u000a      rescued.

In particular, La Porta et al provide\u000d\u000a      empirical evidence that the degree of government ownership in the banking\u000d\u000a      system is negatively correlated to subsequent financial development and\u000d\u000a      economic growth, and positively correlated with financial instability. The\u000d\u000a      estimated effects were quite large: a 10 percentage points rise in the\u000d\u000a      share of government ownership of banks would reduce the growth rate by\u000d\u000a      approximately 0.25% per annum.\u000d\u000a    Research carried out by Andrianova, Demetriades and\u000d\u000a      Shortland has challenged the views underlying the Washington consensus\u000d\u000a      both theoretically and empirically. It has highlighted that while the\u000d\u000a      Washington consensus posits a causal relationship between government\u000d\u000a      ownership of banks and financial development, all that La Porta et al\u000d\u000a      demonstrate is just a statistical correlation, which can be interpreted in\u000d\u000a      different ways. Furthermore, even the statistical correlation is not very\u000d\u000a      robust.\u000d\u000a    In particular, in [Ref 1] Andrianova, Demetriades and Shortland develop a\u000d\u000a      theoretical model in which public ownership of a bank depends on the\u000d\u000a      quality of institutions and financial development rather than causing\u000d\u000a      them. The model provides a rationale for government ownership of banks,\u000d\u000a      and shows that publicly owned banks may be especially important as a means\u000d\u000a      to prevent contagion in a financial crisis.\u000d\u000a    [Ref 1] also provides empirical evidence that supports a different\u000d\u000a      interpretation of the observed correlation: government ownership of banks,\u000d\u000a      that is to say, does not cause financial under-development and\u000d\u000a      instability, but is caused by them. This suggests that state banks will\u000d\u000a      die a natural death when they are no longer useful, but may be crucial\u000d\u000a      while financial instability is a key concern.\u000d\u000a    Follow-on research (see [Ref 2], [Ref 3] and [Ref 4]) suggests that the\u000d\u000a      concern that governments may be unable to run nationalised banks\u000d\u000a      efficiently may also have been exaggerated. In particular, [Ref 4] shows\u000d\u000a      that the results in La Porta et al (2002) are fragile to inclusion\u000d\u000a      of more fundamental determinants of growth. It also reveals that during\u000d\u000a      the period 1995-2007, government ownership of banks was robustly\u000d\u000a      associated with higher, not lower growth rates.\u000d\u000a    In sum, this research strongly suggests that the costs of bank\u000d\u000a      nationalisation had been over-estimated. The implications for policy are\u000d\u000a      evident. When a bank has to be rescued, and policy-makers must choose\u000d\u000a      among different forms of intervention, they must explicitly or implicitly\u000d\u000a      make a comparison between the costs of different policy options. By\u000d\u000a      showing that bank nationalisation is not as costly as previously thought,\u000d\u000a      this research laid the intellectual foundation for the wave of bank\u000d\u000a      nationalisations that occurred during the financial crisis of 2007-8 and\u000d\u000a      the on-going Euro crisis.\u000d\u000a    The research was carried out by Panicos Demetriades (University of\u000d\u000a      Leicester since 2000) and Svetlana Andrianova (University of Leicester\u000d\u000a      since 2003) in collaboration with Anja Shortland (Brunel University) and\u000d\u000a      Chenggang Xu (University of Hong Kong).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42639","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Incorporating supply side economics into an econometric model for\u000a          the UN\u000a    The United Nations is one of the three main organisations which help\u000a      organise the world economy\u000a      (along with its sister institutions of the World Bank and the\u000a      International Monetary Fund). Its special\u000a      brief is to enable global cooperation in areas such as international law,\u000a      international security and\u000a      economic development, as well as world peace. It uses an econometric model\u000a      to make effective\u000a      predictions based on the global economy.\u000a    In the late 1960s, Nobel Laureate Laurence Klein set up a world modelling\u000a      project called Project\u000a      LINK, designed to integrate independently developed national econometric\u000a      models into a global\u000a      econometric model. By the mid 1980s, this project had expanded\u000a      considerably and was taken\u000a      over by the United Nations' economic analysis department as its main\u000a      forecasting and policy tool.\u000a    By 2005, the original LINK model had grown to such an extent that it had\u000a      become unwieldy and\u000a      was no longer fit for purpose. So, in 2007, the UN launched a project to\u000a      build a new world model,\u000a      called the Global Policy Model, and invited Professor Stephen Hall from\u000a      the University of Leicester\u000a      to act as a consultant to this project ([Source 1], [Source 2]).\u000a    The UN is currently using this new model in their twice yearly\u000a      forecasting and policy analysis which\u000a      forms the basis of the UN's submission for the G8 policy round each year.\u000a      This is published\u000a      regularly by the UN in its document, World Economic Situation and\u000a        Prospects.

At\u000a      the 2009 summit, for\u000a      example, the G8's members promised to contribute $20 billion to the issue\u000a      over three years.\u000a      Other global issues addressed at the annual summit include health, law\u000a      enforcement, labour,\u000a      economic and social development, energy, environment, foreign affairs,\u000a      justice, terrorism, and\u000a      trade.\u000a    Incorporating learning into an econometric model for the ECB\u000a    Macroeconomic models have very real and practical benefits for large\u000a      banks, in their work to\u000a      balance the economy. They can be used to analyse the likely impact of the\u000a      bank's actions in a\u000a      range of areas. How might the raising or lowering of interest rates, for\u000a      example, affect the\u000a      manufacturing sector, unemployment levels or retail spending &#8212; and how\u000a      will the respective\u000a      impacts on each of those sectors affect each other? Similarly, how would\u000a      the raising of interest\u000a      rates in Greece affect the economy in France?\u000a    An important aspect of the ECB's work is the forecasting and policy\u000a      analysis of the Eurozone\u000a      countries. This work is largely carried out and co-ordinated through the\u000a      use of a policy model called\u000a      the Multi Country Model (MCM). The first MCM model was set up at the ECB\u000a      between 1994 and\u000a      2000 and has been refined over the years according to experience and new\u000a      research.\u000a    In 2008, Professor Hall was asked to help to develop a new version of the\u000a      MCM which would\u000a      incorporate learning into the structure of the model (previous versions\u000a      had only been solved under\u000a      rational expectations). The European Central Bank had recognised that its\u000a      approach to modelling\u000a      the European countries was inadequate in an important respect. By basing\u000a      their analysis on a\u000a      model which used rational expectation, it was essentially impossible to\u000a      analyse the possible costs\u000a      of a policy which is strongly affected by economic agents' expectations,\u000a      except under the\u000a      assumption that agents get things right.\u000a    The new multi-country model which Professor Hall worked on incorporated\u000a      learning as one of the\u000a      options for exploring expectations effects. This latest version fully\u000a      incorporates a consistent set of\u000a      supply side equations using a nested CES production function. This model\u000a      also has the ability to\u000a      be solved either under the rational expectations assumption or under\u000a      learning.\u000a    This project was successfully completed in 2010 and the model now\u000a      constitutes the main\u000a      forecasting tool for the ECB ([Source 4], [Source 5]). It is the main\u000a      policy tool which is able to\u000a      investigate individual country effects within the Eurozone.\u000a    These modifications to the forecasting tool enable the ECB to make more\u000a      accurate predictions\u000a      about the economy, improving the Bank's ability to take effective and\u000a      timely action to keep inflation\u000a      low and minimise deflation. The ECB works as a hub for all the Eurozone\u000a      member countries, so all\u000a      the constituent central banks of the Eurozone will now be contributing and\u000a      using the new multi-country\u000a      model. So the influence of the learning procedures has spread to all the\u000a      member banks.\u000a      Many of the individual member banks are also developing versions of the\u000a      model for their own\u000a      countries to be used in-house.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The European Central Bank (ECB) uses forecasting tools to make\u000a      predictions about the Eurozone\u000a      economy as a whole.

These\u000a      statistical frameworks can be used to analyse a scenario with multiple\u000a      contributing factors,\u000a      including those which contain an element of uncertainty. These econometric\u000a      models can be used\u000a      to analyse the potential effects of governmental actions and are therefore\u000a      useful forecasting tools\u000a      for policymakers, enabling them to \"test out\" the impact of decisions\u000a      before they are made.\u000a    Stephen Hall, professor of economics at the University of Leicester, is\u000a      an expert in the theory and\u000a      design which underpins such models. Early econometric models were flawed\u000a      in that they ignored\u000a      both expectation effects and the supply side of the economy. This created\u000a      serious difficulties in\u000a      effectively and accurately modelling national and international economic\u000a      trends. Throughout the\u000a      1980s and 1990s, academic economists played an important role finding\u000a      solutions to these\u000a      difficulties and Professor Hall was a key contributor to this work.\u000a    Since joining the University of Leicester in 2005, Professor Hall has\u000a      continued his research in this\u000a      area, working in collaboration with global organisations such as the ECB\u000a      and United Nations (UN)\u000a      to refine his economic theories and apply them in real-world settings.\u000a      This has resulted in novel\u000a      research and impact of worldwide reach and significance.\u000a    Incorporating supply side economics into an econometric model for\u000a          the UN\u000a    Work in collaboration with the UN between 2007 and 2012 addressed the\u000a      difficulties associated\u000a      with incorporating the supply side of the economy into an econometric\u000a      model. Supply side\u000a      economics is concerned with the supply of goods and services within an\u000a      economy. Early\u000a      econometric models concentrated on the demand side of the economy. This\u000a      made it impossible to\u000a      analyse supply-side policies, such as the lowering of income tax and\u000a      capital gains tax rates, or the\u000a      reduction of regulation, making it difficult to fully understand the\u000a      longer-run development of\u000a      economies which is generally understood to be dominated by supply-side\u000a      effects.\u000a    The solution was offered by econometrically estimating a set of equations\u000a      which acted as the core\u000a      of a large econometric model. These equations were based around a\u000a      production function and were\u000a      estimated in a consistent way with full cross equation restrictions using\u000a      co-integration (see [Ref 3],\u000a      [Ref 4] and [Ref 5]; the co-author of [Ref 3] is a former student of\u000a      Hall's who is now based at the\u000a      International Monetary Fund, the co-author of [Ref 4] is a long-time\u000a      collaborator of Hall who is now\u000a      retired, the co-authors of [Ref 5] are the same long-time collaborator and\u000a      two former research\u000a      assistants one of whom is now at Brunel and the other at the Monetary\u000a      Authority of Hong Kong).\u000a    Professor Hall's contribution to the research project with the UN was to\u000a      adapt this approach to the\u000a      setting of a large multi-country model. The project with the\u000a      United Nations has involved the creation\u000a      of a complete world model with more than 180 countries represented.\u000a      Although data limitations for\u000a      some countries has meant that not every country can have a fully\u000a      articulated supply side, all the\u000a      major developed countries were treated in this way, as well as many of the\u000a      others.\u000a    Incorporating learning into an econometric model for the ECB\u000a    Early econometric models were flawed in that they largely ignored\u000a      expectation effects, i.e. how\u000a      previously formed expectations can alter emotional responses to an event\u000a      itself. Work in the 1980s\u000a      recognised that incorporating human expectations into the model was\u000a      crucial when studying how a\u000a      large number of individuals, firms or organisations make choices under\u000a      uncertainty.\u000a    However, more recently, problems associated with the extreme assumptions\u000a      required for rational\u000a      expectations have become apparent. By basing their analysis on a model\u000a      which used rational\u000a      expectation, it was essentially impossible to analyse the possible costs\u000a      of a policy which is strongly\u000a      affected by the expectations of economic agents (i.e. those people whose\u000a      actions affect the\u000a      economy, typically producers or consumers) and where agents get their\u000a      expectations wrong.\u000a    Research at Leicester conducted by Professor Hall between 2008 and 2010\u000a      in collaboration with\u000a      researchers at the European Central Bank has explored the use of learning\u000a      as a means to\u000a      overcome these problems. Professors Hall's special contribution to this\u000a      joint work was to propose\u000a      the use of learning and to explain how it could be implemented in a\u000a      practical way. The introduction\u000a      of learning has important implications for a model's ability to analyse\u000a      historical events. It also\u000a      substantially improves the forecasting ability (see [Ref 1], [Ref 2] and\u000a      [Ref 6]; the co-authors of [Ref\u000a      1] and [Ref 2] are all based at the ECB, the co-authors of [Ref 6] are a\u000a      former long-time\u000a      collaborator of Hall's who is now retired, a PhD student of Hall's who has\u000a      left the academic world,\u000a      and a collaborator who is now at the Barcelona Graduate school of\u000a      Economics).\u000a    The concept of learning in economics has a long history dating back to\u000a      the 1970s but this has\u000a      almost always been conducted in the context of small, largely abstract\u000a      models. The introduction of\u000a      these ideas in a large model setting and their practical implementation\u000a      represents an innovation.\u000a      The translation of the theory from small to large models was done by\u000a      setting up small auxiliary\u000a      expectations equations. These equations would have time-varying parameters\u000a      and the parameters\u000a      were updated in a model-consistent way using a Kalman filter.\u000a    This gives the model the ability to learn over time about any change in\u000a      policy or exogenous event.\u000a      It has been demonstrated that this procedure converges on a rational\u000a      expectations solution\u000a      asymptotically but that the impact effect of a change allows agents to\u000a      make mistakes as the\u000a      learning procedure takes place. This gives the model much more reasonable\u000a      forecasting properties\u000a      (as rational expectations jumps do not occur in the initial period of the\u000a      forecast). It also gives the\u000a      model more reasonable policy properties as many policy questions rest on\u000a      the ability to analyse\u000a      the mistakes which agents make in forming their expectations.\u000a    A method for incorporating the Kalman filter into the actual econometric\u000a      model was developed as\u000a      part of this research, as well as the software implementing the method.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42640","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    How the research led to the impact\u000d\u000a    The National Bank of Poland (NBP) began its interest in the forecasting\u000d\u000a      methodology developed by\u000d\u000a      Charemza and Makarova after the research seminar held in 2003\u000d\u000a      mentioned above, where\u000d\u000a      Charemza presented their initial results.

In June 2006, the first pilot application of the index was published\u000d\u000a      in an internal bulletin of\u000d\u000a      NBP under the title of `Krotkookresowa prognoza inflacji i ocena klimatu\u000d\u000a      decyzyjnego' (Short-term\u000d\u000a      inflation forecast and the evaluation of the monetary policy climate).\u000d\u000a    Since then, the bulletin has been regularly produced on a monthly basis.\u000d\u000a      It is delivered to the\u000d\u000a      members of the Monetary Policy Council one week before their monthly\u000d\u000a      meetings. A typical issue\u000d\u000a      of the bulletin would report both systematic forecasts (updated every\u000d\u000a      month) and occasional\u000d\u000a      information relevant for the special circumstances of each period.\u000d\u000a    An important feature of the Bulletin is its timeliness. The most relevant\u000d\u000a      information used for\u000d\u000a      updating the forecast is the consumers' price index (CPI). This is\u000d\u000a      published by the Polish Central\u000d\u000a      Statistical Office three or four days before the so-called working meeting\u000d\u000a      of the Monetary Policy\u000d\u000a      Council. When Charemza was at NBP, the preliminary version of the\u000d\u000a      forecast was usually\u000d\u000a      produced within 2-3 hours after the CPI figure was released. The\u000d\u000a      preliminary version of the bulletin\u000d\u000a      was available about 6 hours after the release for scrutiny by the Director\u000d\u000a      of the Macroeconomic\u000d\u000a      Research Bureau of NBP. The final version of the bulletin was usually\u000d\u000a      ready for delivery to the\u000d\u000a      Council less than 24 hours after the release of the CPI figure. In other\u000d\u000a      words, its cut-off date (i.e.\u000d\u000a      the moment after which new statistical data could not be included in the\u000d\u000a      forecast) was just 24 hours\u000d\u000a      prior to its publication date. By comparison, the usual cut-off date for\u000d\u000a      other forecasts produced at\u000d\u000a      NBP, based on quarterly rather than monthly data (ECMOD forecast), was\u000d\u000a      three weeks.\u000d\u000a    In March 2008, Charemza's and Makarova's secondments ended and they left\u000d\u000a      NBP. However,\u000d\u000a      they retained control over the bulletin until September 2009. Overall they\u000d\u000a      produced 37 regular\u000d\u000a      issues of the bulletin. Before leaving the NBP, they provided training and\u000d\u000a      consultation to the team\u000d\u000a      of NBP researchers which took over the bulletin in September 2009. The\u000d\u000a      bulletin is still delivered to\u000d\u000a      the Monetary Policy Board on a monthly basis.\u000d\u000a    Evidence of the impact\u000d\u000a    Due to the confidential nature of the bulletin (and of the computer\u000d\u000a      program used to calculate the\u000d\u000a      MPI), it is difficult to provide written evidence of the computational\u000d\u000a      details. However, permission to\u000d\u000a      release a sample bulletin for the purpose of REF evaluation has been\u000d\u000a      granted ([Source 1]).\u000d\u000a    The former Deputy Governor of National Bank of Poland is the person who\u000d\u000a      actually engaged\u000d\u000a      Charemza in the project. He participated in the Monetary Policy\u000d\u000a      Council meetings in his capacity of\u000d\u000a      the Deputy Governor. He said: \"One of the main duties of Prof Charemza was\u000d\u000a      to prepare a monthly\u000d\u000a      forecasting bulletin, containing probabilistic forecast of inflation and\u000d\u000a      evaluation of index of monetary\u000d\u000a      policy climate, which identifies appropriate timing for undertaking policy\u000d\u000a      decisions. The\u000d\u000a      methodology of this index as well as concepts used for the probabilistic\u000d\u000a      forecasting had been\u000d\u000a      developed by Professor Charemza in collaboration with Dr Svetlana\u000d\u000a      Makarova, also employed by\u000d\u000a      the NBP at that time. It is my understanding that the methodology was\u000d\u000a      original and described in\u000d\u000a      academic paper authored by Charemza and Makarova. (...) the bulletin\u000d\u000a        was considered as one\u000d\u000a        of the main auxiliary information used by the members of the Monetary\u000d\u000a        Policy Council, who\u000d\u000a        often commented favourably on its quality and original content.\"\u000d\u000a      See [Source 2].\u000d\u000a    A former member of the Monetary Policy Council of Poland and currently\u000d\u000a      Director of the Institute of\u000d\u000a      Economics at the National Bank of Poland was one of the final recipients\u000d\u000a      of the bulletin, as the\u000d\u000a      voting member of the Monetary Policy Council. He said: \"In the period from\u000d\u000a      2004 - 2010 I was a\u000d\u000a      member of the Monetary Policy Council of the National Bank of Poland,\u000d\u000a      responsible for conducting\u000d\u000a      monetary policy...

I can confirm that\u000d\u000a        some methods developed by Wojciech Charemza are still in use and\u000d\u000a        contribute to the\u000d\u000a        forecasting analysis made by the Institute for the benefit of the\u000d\u000a        Monetary Policy Council.\u000d\u000a      Most notably the indicator of monetary policy climate has been\u000d\u000a      re-programmed and is now\u000d\u000a      included in the currently produced bulletins.\" See [Source 3].\u000d\u000a    The former Director of the Research Department of the National Bank of\u000d\u000a      Poland is currently\u000d\u000a      Deputy Director of the Institute of Economics of the National Bank of\u000d\u000a      Poland.

He said: \"The monetary policy conducted by the National Bank of\u000d\u000a      Poland in the period of\u000d\u000a      2005-2008 is generally regarded as being successful. In particular Poland\u000d\u000a      was the only country in\u000d\u000a      European Union which avoided negative growth in 2009 and maintained\u000d\u000a      positive growth record\u000d\u000a      throughout. Also its inflation, albeit occasionally breaching the target\u000d\u000a      bands, was never greater\u000d\u000a      than 5% in this period. This is, to a large extent, attributed to the\u000d\u000a      effective monetary policy. Overall,\u000d\u000a        I can conclude that the forecasting methodology developed by Professor\u000d\u000a        Charemza and his\u000d\u000a        collaborators contributed significantly to the enhancement of the\u000d\u000a        analytical and forecasting\u000d\u000a        tools used at the National Bank of Poland.\" See [Source 4].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The making of monetary policy requires accurate forecasts of key monetary\u000d\u000a      variables, and in\u000d\u000a      particular of the inflation rate.

The research was conducted in collaboration\u000d\u000a      with Svetlana\u000d\u000a      Makarova (EUSP then, now University College London).\u000d\u000a    The MPI is an index that allows the decomposition of real and monetary\u000d\u000a      shocks which have been\u000d\u000a      econometrically identified in the past. This decomposition enables to\u000d\u000a      identify the exact moment in\u000d\u000a      time when a possible shock induced by a monetary policy move (in most\u000d\u000a      cases, a change in the\u000d\u000a      monetary interest rate) would be most effective. That is to say, when the\u000d\u000a      monetary policy move\u000d\u000a      would minimise the output loss in case of a contractionary decision, and\u000d\u000a      maximise the output gain\u000d\u000a      in case of an expansionary decision.\u000d\u000a    In 2003, Charemza described the idea of an MPI at a seminar at\u000d\u000a      the National Bank of Poland\u000d\u000a      (NBP) &#8212; i.e., the central bank of Poland, which is responsible for\u000d\u000a      conducting monetary policy. This\u000d\u000a      led to his appointment as a visiting advisor to the Governor of the\u000d\u000a      National Bank of Poland the\u000d\u000a      following year, on secondment from the University of Leicester. (In this\u000d\u000a      period, he continued to\u000d\u000a      work at Leicester at 0.75FTE.) The principal aim of the appointment was to\u000d\u000a      develop the MPI further\u000d\u000a      and to implement it as a working tool for the Monetary Policy Council.\u000d\u000a    In 2005, Charemza's co-author, Makarova, joined NBP, on secondment from\u000d\u000a      EUSP. They jointly\u000d\u000a      developed a complex forecasting program. Apart from the MPI, the\u000d\u000a      forecasting program computes\u000d\u000a      the probabilities with which monetary policy targets will be achieved, the\u000d\u000a      probabilities of turning\u000d\u000a      points in inflation dynamics, and other indicators.\u000d\u000a    The results of the first stage of the research were presented in [Ref 1]\u000d\u000a      and [Ref 2]. These papers\u000d\u000a      provide the general derivation of the MPI, some simulation results, and\u000d\u000a      preliminary empirical\u000d\u000a      results. A more complete presentation of the results was hampered and\u000d\u000a      delayed by security\u000d\u000a      clauses of NBP, which prevented disclosure of the technical details. This\u000d\u000a      has long been an\u000d\u000a      obstacle towards publication in more highly ranked academic journals,\u000d\u000a      which typically impose fuller\u000d\u000a      disclosure requirements.\u000d\u000a    In 2005 Charemza and Makarova, in collaboration with Lifshits (St\u000d\u000a      Petersburg State University,\u000d\u000a      Russia) published [Ref 3], which can be regarded as a complement to [Ref\u000d\u000a      1] and [Ref 2]. Although\u000d\u000a      it could not deal with the MPI explicitly for the reasons explained above,\u000d\u000a      it presented a novel\u000d\u000a      method of modelling time series without the explicit assumption of\u000d\u000a      normality, which was\u000d\u000a      instrumental to develop the MPI. This method was implemented by Charemza\u000d\u000a      and Makarova and\u000d\u000a      incorporated into the NBP's programming suite for identification of\u000d\u000a      inflationary and real shocks,\u000d\u000a      which were further utilised for computing MPI.\u000d\u000a    Research on the MPI has continued even after Charemza and\u000d\u000a      Makarova left the National Bank of\u000d\u000a      Poland in 2008: see, in particular, [Ref 4], which provides a more\u000d\u000a      detailed analysis of the MPI.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43145","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"6290252","Name":"Serbia"},{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    EUROMOD has an impact at EU-level through informing analysis and policy\u000d\u000a      formation within the European Commission.

These reports provide analytical underpinning for the policy\u000d\u000a      formulation by the European Commission in the employment and social\u000d\u000a      fields\" [1]. For example, the Annual Report on Employment and Social\u000d\u000a        Development (2012) cites EUROMOD in numerous places, including a\u000d\u000a      number of explicit references to Essex research [corroborating source 2].\u000d\u000a    Much of the DG-EMPL's use of EUROMOD has involved modelling the effects\u000d\u000a      of austerity measures, and it has confirmed that \"Euromod data are used to\u000d\u000a      support the analysis of consolidation packages implemented in a number of\u000d\u000a      Member States, which in turn underpins Commission policy recommendations\u000d\u000a      to the Member States\" [1].

Although these simulations are not\u000d\u000a      publically available, the Chairman of the Greek Government's Council and\u000d\u000a      of Economic Advisors has informed us of four specific impacts: (i) a new\u000d\u000a      real estate tax has been introduced, which is linked with the cadastral\u000d\u000a      value of the dwelling and other variables that are mostly available in the\u000d\u000a      EUROMOD data base (this tax was introduced in Law 4021\/2011 and updated in\u000d\u000a      Law 4152\/2013); (ii) \"radical change\" in the design of family benefits &#8212;\u000d\u000a      tax allowances have been abolished and the benefits have become\u000d\u000a      income-related (these changes came into force through Law 4093\/2012 and\u000d\u000a      Law 4110\/2013); (iii) progressive cuts have been applied to the sum of\u000d\u000a      pensions received by individual pensioners &#8212; until recently Greece had no\u000d\u000a      register of pensioners, only pensions (this change was introduced in Law\u000d\u000a      4110\/2013); (iv) the decision to introduce means testing to disability\u000d\u000a      benefits was abandoned due to EUROMOD simulations, which showed that the\u000d\u000a      cost incurred would outweigh the potential benefit [7].\u000d\u000a    Austria\u000d\u000a    The Austrian Federal Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Consumer\u000d\u000a      Protection (bmask) has used EUROMOD in two ways as part of a project in\u000d\u000a      which Essex is an official partner [8]. Firstly, the Social Reform\u000d\u000a      Microsimulation was designed in order to help Austria meet\u000d\u000a      poverty-reduction targets in line with the \"Europe 2020 strategy\". This\u000d\u000a      reduced version of EUROMOD was introduced in January 2013 to assess the\u000d\u000a      effects of policy change in particular \"impact dimensions\". Secondly, this\u000d\u000a      simplified version of EUROMOD allows the public to assess the potential\u000d\u000a      impact of policy changes. This can be done through a web portal that all\u000d\u000a      Austrians can use &#8212; registration is required but the service is provided\u000d\u000a      free of charge. Bmask has stated that \"without the existing EUROMOD model\u000d\u000a      it would not have been possible to offer an instrument for the\u000d\u000a      quantitative impact assessment of the Europe 2020 target group within the\u000d\u000a      Austrian impact assessment system at reasonable cost\" [9]. The ultimate\u000d\u000a      impact of this work with bmask is not yet known, but the impact to date is\u000d\u000a      that a national government is relying on EUROMOD to develop strategies to\u000d\u000a      reduce poverty and to help the public better understand policy change.\u000d\u000a    3.

For instance, a team\u000d\u000a      in Serbia (with Essex as a partner) developed the SRMOD microsimulation,\u000d\u000a      which has been used in the development of the Law on Social Protection\u000d\u000a      (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, No. 24\/2011) [10]. The World\u000d\u000a      Bank office in Belgrade asked the SRMOD team to make the ex-ante analysis\u000d\u000a      of the distributional and poverty effects of the draft law. The World Bank\u000d\u000a      then used the results of this analysis as the basis for recommendations\u000d\u000a      for improvement of the draft law. Some of these recommendations were then\u000d\u000a      included in the final version of the law [10]. A further example is in\u000d\u000a      South Africa where the SAMOD microsimulation has been developed by the\u000d\u000a      South African government and a team at the University of Oxford's Centre\u000d\u000a      for the Analysis of South African Social Policy, with Essex having joint\u000d\u000a      ownership and Sutherland acting as an advisor [11]. To date, six projects\u000d\u000a      have been commissioned by the Department of Social Development, Office of\u000d\u000a      the Presidency, and Statistics South Africa. A member of the Oxford team\u000d\u000a      has confirmed that \"SAMOD is thus having a direct impact on policy\u000d\u000a      development within Government, particularly on policy development planning\u000d\u000a      within the Department of Social Development\" [12].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    EUROMOD, a tax-benefit microsimulation model developed at Essex, has been\u000d\u000a      used by the European Commission and various national administrations to\u000d\u000a      improve the evidence base for policymaking.

A\u000d\u000a      first version was initiated in 1998 and since relocating to Essex it has\u000d\u000a      been re-constructed, extended from 15 to 28 countries, and is now\u000d\u000a      regularly updated with the latest microdata and policy information.\u000d\u000a    EUROMOD is the tax-benefit microsimulation model for the EU28 member\u000d\u000a      states, based on household microdata from Eurostat's European Union\u000d\u000a      Statistics on Income and Living Conditions. It provides consistent and\u000d\u000a      comparable cross-country analysis of the effects of tax-benefit policies\u000d\u000a      and policy reforms on national budgets, the distribution of household\u000d\u000a      incomes, and work incentives. It is used to evaluate the effectiveness of\u000d\u000a      current policies, to explore the implications of change to policies or\u000d\u000a      economic conditions, and to design new policies with particular goals.\u000d\u000a      Results may be evaluated for individual countries on their own or in\u000d\u000a      comparison with each other, for the EU as a whole, or any sub-group of\u000d\u000a      countries, such as the Eurozone.\u000d\u000a    EUROMOD was constructed and is maintained and kept up-to-date by bringing\u000d\u000a      together an appreciation of the analytical demands of a range of academic\u000d\u000a      disciplines (e.g. public economics, comparative social policy, social\u000d\u000a      statistics), drawing on state-of-the-art technical expertise (e.g. data\u000d\u000a      analysis and management, software design and development) and a network of\u000d\u000a      28 national teams and many stakeholders. EUROMOD is not only a tool for\u000d\u000a      carrying out research on policy-relevant topics, but it can also be\u000d\u000a      applied to address particular questions of current interest to\u000d\u000a      policymakers, either at EU or national level. Bridging academic enquiry\u000d\u000a      and the analytical needs of policymakers it brings the two communities\u000d\u000a      closer, especially as analysis using EUROMOD becomes increasingly\u000d\u000a      recognised and respected in each of them.\u000d\u000a    EUROMOD is unique in two respects: covering many countries and being\u000d\u000a      generally accessible to all not-for-profit researchers. It is also\u000d\u000a      designed to maximise flexibility and does not restrict the user to a fixed\u000d\u000a      range of options but at the same time does not require specialised skills\u000d\u000a      to use it. All these attributes mean that it can be straightforwardly\u000d\u000a      adapted for use in any country with suitable microdata, and national\u000d\u000a      components can be developed and elaborated as stand-alone projects.\u000d\u000a      EUROMOD offers a short-cut for any national administration or other\u000d\u000a      policy-focused body to build its own model. Research using EUROMOD has\u000d\u000a      demonstrated how such models enhance the evidence base for policymaking\u000d\u000a      and encourages the adoption of such techniques.\u000d\u000a    In particular, recent dramatic changes due to the financial and economic\u000d\u000a      crises have posed challenges for public policies affecting personal\u000d\u000a      incomes. Publications by Essex researchers using EUROMOD have explored the\u000d\u000a      implications of unemployment for household incomes, the distributional\u000d\u000a      effects of austerity measures, and the design of new sources of public\u000d\u000a      revenues and of social protection systems able to meet new demands.\u000d\u000a      Comparing across countries provides new perspectives and allows for mutual\u000d\u000a      policy learning. The need to make short-term predictions of the effect of\u000d\u000a      recent and current changes on poverty and income distribution, in the\u000d\u000a      absence of timely micro-data, is an analytical challenge that is being met\u000d\u000a      using EUROMOD to \"nowcast\" income distribution, focusing on countries\u000d\u000a      experiencing the most unstable economic conditions.\u000d\u000a    The EUROMOD team at Essex also includes: Silvia Avram, Senior Research\u000d\u000a      Officer (joined Feb 2011); Mari&#241;a Fernandez Salgado, Research Assistant\u000d\u000a      (Nov 2010 - Jul 2012); Francesco Figari, Research Fellow (Aug 2006 - Nov\u000d\u000a      2010); Maria Iacovou, Senior Research Fellow; Chrysa Leventi, Senior\u000d\u000a      Research Officer (joined June 2013); Horacio Levy, Research Fellow (Mar\u000d\u000a      2011 - Oct 2012); Jekaterina Navicke, Senior Research Officer (joined Feb\u000d\u000a      2012); Alari Paulus, Research Fellow (joined Jul 2006); Olga Rastrigina,\u000d\u000a      Senior Research Officer (joined Feb 2012); Alexandra Skew, Senior Research\u000d\u000a      Officer (Feb 2009 - Apr 2012); Alberto Tumino, Senior Research Officer\u000d\u000a      (joined Oct 2009).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43197","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research has contributed significantly to the UK policy debate, and\u000a      the policy response, surrounding poverty and income inequality. It has\u000a      done this partly by providing new empirical evidence about the nature of\u000a      poverty and inequality in the UK, which has formed the basis of useful\u000a      inputs for policymakers, and partly by showing the value of a longitudinal\u000a      analysis of income inequality and poverty in the UK. The research has had\u000a      impact on government policy and on third- sector organisations.\u000a    Impact on government legislation and policy\u000a    The main impact of this research has been to fundamentally change the way\u000a      in which poverty statistics are reported in Britain. Prior to this\u000a      research, the annual official poverty statistics, as reported in the\u000a      Department for Work and Pensions' report, Households Below Average Income\u000a      (HBAI), concentrated solely on point-in-time measures of poverty and\u000a      income inequality. Because of Essex research on poverty and low-income\u000a      dynamics, the HBAI series now routinely produce statistics relating to\u000a      income-dynamics poverty persistence and poverty transitions. The most\u000a      recent example of this is the DWP's 2011 Low-Income Dynamics\u000a      report. Section 4 of this report is on `Transitions into and out of Low\u000a      Income' and explicitly states that the methodology used is that developed\u000a      by Jenkins and Rigg (2001) [corroborating source 1].\u000a    As a direct consequence of the change to the HBAI reports, a measure of\u000a      persistent poverty now forms one of the four statutory measures of child\u000a      poverty named in the Child Poverty Act 2010, against which future\u000a      governments have to report progress [corroborating source 2]. Before\u000a      bringing forward the Bill, the previous government consulted on how they\u000a      should define and measure child poverty, and the consultation document [3]\u000a      refers to research by Jenkins and Rigg (2001). These sorts of statistics\u000a      continue to inform policymaking at the highest level: Figure 1.3 of the\u000a      Cabinet Office's 2010 State of the nation report&#8212;a document which\u000a      represents the current government's overall approach to poverty and\u000a      disadvantage&#8212;cites statistics on persistent poverty [4]. This impact was\u000a      generated largely through the academic outputs in Section 3, but also\u000a      through writing reports for government departments and publishing more\u000a      accessible versions of academic findings.\u000a    Essex research informed the work of the National Equality Panel (NEP),\u000a      which was established by the Labour government in 2008 to identify the\u000a      extent and depth of inequality in Britain. The NEP's final report, An\u000a        anatomy of economic inequality in the UK, identified a range of\u000a      deep-seated and systematic differences between social groups across many\u000a      dimensions of life, and it has attracted a great deal of policy and media\u000a      attention (over 400 items of media coverage since January 2010). Stephen\u000a      Jenkins was a member of the NEP, and his work directly influenced the\u000a      panel's thinking through Jenkins (2009), which was commissioned to support\u000a      the panel's deliberations. The final report makes extensive reference to\u000a      Jenkins' research [5].\u000a    Impact on the third sector\u000a    The research has also had significant impact on the way in which\u000a      charitable organisations understand poverty. Essex research has been used\u000a      extensively by The Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF), which has stated:\u000a    \"The way that JRF approaches poverty (as outlined for example in its\u000a      strategic plan and new programme to develop anti-poverty strategies) is\u000a      informed by research undertaken by Stephen Jenkins while he was at the\u000a      University of Essex Institute for Social and Economic Research... A clear\u000a      thread of Stephen's work can be seen within JRF thinking on poverty over\u000a      the last decade, influencing two major reviews and at least five separate\u000a      programmes of research\" [6].\u000a    The JRF's programme on `recurrent poverty' was informed by Essex\u000a      research, which is demonstrated by the very concept being drawn from\u000a      Jenkins' work [5] and the final summary report in 2010 [7] directly\u000a      referencing Jenkins and Rigg (2001). This review then fed into a further\u000a      JRF programme on the future of the UK labour market, which again draws\u000a      heavily on the dynamic approach to poverty developed at Essex [6].\u000a      Furthermore, the JRF's strategic plan states that one of its aims is to\u000a      \"equip policy-makers around the UK to understand the complex causes and\u000a      dynamics of poverty, including how it relates to ethnicity, disability and\u000a      ill-health across the age range\" [8] [6]. A JRF programme called\u000a      `Anti-poverty strategies for the UK', which began in 2012, reflects these\u000a      strategic aims and has as its core principle the ideas that poverty is\u000a      dynamic and should be understood over the life-course [6].\u000a    Jenkins' work on income-changes after divorce has provided evidence on\u000a      the link between single parenthood and poverty, which has been central to\u000a      policy development work by the charity Gingerbread, which represents lone\u000a      parents:\u000a    \"Gingerbread has made significant use of research work undertaken by\u000a      Stephen Jenkins on income changes after couples separate. This has been\u000a      particularly valuable for us in policy development relating to the\u000a      incidence and experience of poverty in single parent families. This, in\u000a      turn, has played a particularly key role in our influencing work on child\u000a      poverty, as a significant component in explaining why children in single\u000a      parent families are disproportionately likely to be affected by poverty,\u000a      and informing our development of relevant policy measures to tackle\u000a      poverty\" [9].\u000a    Essex research is referred to frequently in Gingerbread's policy\u000a      documents, including briefing materials and responses to government\u000a      consultations.

They produced new\u000a      substantive results on the extent and nature of dynamics in household\u000a      income and poverty in the UK.\u000a    In the mid-1990s, using the newly-available data on household income,\u000a      Jenkins and Jarvis (1998) gave the first robust impression of the extent\u000a      of income mobility in the UK, showing that much of this involves small\u000a      changes in household income. As more data became available, Jenkins and\u000a      Rigg (2001) were able to go beyond the usual conventional way of analysing\u000a      low income in the UK (which was to measure incomes at a point in time, and\u000a      estimate what fraction lives in a household whose equivalised income is\u000a      below 60% of the contemporaneous national median) to both construct\u000a      measures of persistent poverty, and analyse the dynamics in the usual\u000a      poverty measure (showing, for example, that one in three individuals\u000a      experience relative poverty at least once in a four-year period).\u000a    Cappellari and Jenkins (2002) and Jenkins and Rigg (2001), the latter\u000a      commissioned directly by the Department for Work and Pensions, found that\u000a      children, pensioners, female adults, lone parent families, and working-age\u000a      workless families were all subgroups that are especially likely to\u000a      experience persistent and recurrent poverty. These findings allow policy\u000a      initiatives to be directed towards the most vulnerable. Jenkins and Rigg\u000a      (2001) analysed the factors associated with moves in and out of poverty,\u000a      finding that changes in a household's labour earnings accounted for 62% of\u000a      exits from poverty and 44% of entries to poverty &#8212; this is one of the key\u000a      pieces of evidence behind many UK policymakers' claims that work is the\u000a      best route out of poverty.\u000a    Related work (Jenkins, 2008) using the same longitudinal data on\u000a      household incomes has documented the changes in income that are associated\u000a      with the breakdown of marital partnerships, and established the\u000a      substantial average decline in equivalised income experienced by\u000a      separating women, whereas separating men see an average rise in\u000a      equivalised income.\u000a    The research has involved significant methodological developments.\u000a      Cappellari and Jenkins (2004) modelled poverty transitions that account\u000a      for state dependence, initial poverty status and non-random attrition.\u000a      Jenkins (2009) developed, in work commissioned by the National Equality\u000a      Panel, a modelling framework for describing income-age trajectories that\u000a      summarises not only the average profile for a group of similar\u000a      individuals, but also how individual trajectories differ from the group\u000a      average. Jenkins and Van Kerm (2006) show how, for any member of the\u000a      generalised Gini class of indices, the change in inequality between two\u000a      points in time can be additively decomposed into two components, one\u000a      summarising mobility in the form of re-ranking, and one summarising\u000a      progressivity in income growth (i.e. whether income growth is pro-poor\u000a      rather than pro-rich). This allows for a more meaningful assessment of the\u000a      extent of income mobility in society.\u000a    The research team included:\u000a    Stephen Jenkins, Professor, at Essex 1994 - 2010\u000a    Lorenzo Cappellari, Nuffield Career Development Fellow, at Essex 2000 - 2001\u000a    Francesco Devicienti, Research Officer, at Essex 1999 - 2001\u000a    Sarah Jarvis, Senior Research Officer, at Essex 1995 - 1999\u000a    John Rigg, Senior Research Officer, at Essex 1999 - 2002\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43236","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Reform of the UK's parallel systems of social care and disability\u000a      benefits &#8212; Attendance Allowance\u000a      (AA) and Disability Living Allowance (DLA) &#8212; for older people have been\u000a      the subject of active\u000a      debate for a number of years. AA and DLA are not means-tested. The 2006\u000a      King's Fund Review of\u000a      Social Care (chaired by Sir Derek Wanless) suggested that public funds\u000a      used for AA and DLA\u000a      might be better channelled through the means-tested social care system, on\u000a      the grounds that AA\u000a      and DLA were not well-targeted on those in greatest financial or\u000a      disability need. The then\u000a      Government's 2009 Green Paper on the future of care endorsed the option of\u000a      redirecting funds\u000a      away from disability benefits into social care as worthy of further\u000a      consideration. Our research\u000a      challenged the premise that AA and DLA are not well-targeted. The impact\u000a      documented below was\u000a      achieved jointly by the researchers at Essex and UEA, and is underpinned\u000a      by the research\u000a      publications to which the two institutions made equal contributions.\u000a    We highlighted a fundamental flaw in previous analyses which had\u000a      suggested that recipients of AA\u000a      and DLA were located within the middle and upper parts of the income\u000a      distribution. Our first\u000a      analysis drawing attention to this flaw was published in February 2008 and\u000a      also presented to a\u000a      seminar held at number 11 Downing Street, in the presence of the then\u000a      minister for social care.\u000a      On the same day, Berthoud and Hancock presented our findings in a piece in\u000a      the Society pages of\u000a      The Guardian [corroborating source 1].\u000a    We then conducted more detailed research and drew on it in written\u000a      evidence to the Work and\u000a      Pension Select committee's 2008\/9 Inquiry into Pensioner Poverty and the\u000a      Health Select\u000a      Committee's 2009-10 Inquiry into Social Care. Our written evidence to the\u000a      latter was used by Age\u000a      UK in their oral evidence:\u000a    \"I think that other submissions have provided you detailed modelling on\u000a      the different income\u000a      groups who are claiming [AA]. There does seem to be evidence that it is a\u000a      reasonably well\u000a      targeted benefit, in terms of which income groups receive it and what\u000a      their incomes would be\u000a      without it, taking into account the cost of their disability\"\u000a      [corroborating source 2(a)].\u000a    The then Acting Charity Director of Age UK has confirmed that this\u000a      implicit reference was indeed\u000a      referring to our written evidence (Pudney et al., 2010 &#8212; in Section 2)\u000a      [3]. Our work was also cited\u000a      by a member of the Select Committee [2(b)] and was quoted heavily in the\u000a      Committee's report\u000a      published on 4th March 2010 [4]. The Committee called on the Department of\u000a      Health to publish\u000a      evidence that contradicted our research, if they had any. The White Paper\u000a      on Social Care\u000a      published on 30th March 2010 ruled out, at least for the next Parliament,\u000a      any reform of AA and\u000a      DLA to fund its proposed reform of social care. The Head of Public Policy\u000a      at Age UK states that\u000a    \"we believe that their report, and your submission to them, influenced\u000a      the then Government's\u000a      decision not to reform AA or integrate it with means-tested care\u000a      support... It is our impression\u000a      that the research has had an influence on the way the Department for Work\u000a      and Pensions views\u000a      the financial position of disabled older people in receipt of AA or DLA\"\u000a      [5]\u000a    The subsequent change of government led to the establishment of the\u000a      Commission on Funding\u000a      Care and Support (CFSC), whose report recommended retaining non\u000a      means-tested disability\u000a      benefits for older people. Before its report was funded we presented our\u000a      research at a high-profile\u000a      seminar organised by the Strategic Society Centre, which was attended by\u000a      representatives from\u000a      the CFSC, relevant government departments (HM Treasury, Department of\u000a      Health, Department for\u000a      Work and Pensions), voluntary sector organisations (e.g. Age UK), Local\u000a      Authorities, the private\u000a      insurance sector and academics [6]. Papers and briefings published by the\u000a      Strategic Society\u000a      Centre and Age UK have quoted heavily from our work [7] [8] [9], and have\u000a      continued to do so [10].\u000a    The 2012 Welfare Reform Act has replaced DLA with Personal Independence\u000a      Payment for new\u000a      claimants, which differs from DLA in detail but remains a non means-tested\u000a      benefit for disabled\u000a      people. AA is still in place. For the foreseeable future older people in\u000a      the UK therefore retain\u000a      access to non means-tested cash disability benefits to help them meet the\u000a      costs that disability\u000a      brings. As of 2012, they reach some 2.44 million people aged 65+ in Great\u000a      Britain. These are the\u000a      immediate beneficiaries of the decision to retain these benefits. Some of\u000a      them would have lost as\u000a      much as &#163;77.45 per week (April 2012 rates) had AA and DLA been withdrawn\u000a      completely. Perhaps\u000a      more importantly, a public policy change based on an incorrect premise has\u000a      been avoided.\u000a    There were of course many voices arguing for the retention of AA and DLA,\u000a      and providing\u000a      evidence of their benefit to older people. Our distinct and material\u000a      contribution was to highlight the\u000a      flaw in previous analysis, conduct rigorous academic research which\u000a      corrected this flaw and\u000a      improved in other ways on previous analysis of the influence of income and\u000a      disability on receipt of\u000a      AA\/DLA.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    A policy proposal to reduce the system of disability benefits received by\u000a      2.44 million over-65s\u000a      across the UK was abandoned in 2012, partly as a result of research\u000a      conducted at the University of\u000a      Essex.

This system consists of two main types of support: care,\u000a      largely in the form of\u000a      services, provided via public bodies after an assessment of care needs,\u000a      for which recipients pay\u000a      user charges determined through a means test; and cash benefits paid on\u000a      the basis of disability\u000a      and care needs, which are not means tested. The impacts described in this\u000a      case study resulted\u000a      from our research analysing data from three high-quality household surveys\u000a      (the Family Resources\u000a      Survey, the British Household Panel Survey and the English Longitudinal\u000a      Study of Ageing). Our\u000a      analysis sought to establish the determinants of receipt of the two\u000a      disability benefits, Attendance\u000a      Allowance (AA) and Disability Living Allowance (DLA), among older people,\u000a      paying particular\u000a      attention to: (i) the role of income (measured excluding these benefits);\u000a      (ii) the influence of severity\u000a      of disability, taking into account the potential for measurement error in\u000a      the self-reported indicators\u000a      of disability available in surveys; and (iii) the degree of agreement in\u000a      data from different surveys.\u000a      We also examined the likely consequences for poverty rates among older\u000a      people of various forms\u000a      of means-testing AA and DLA to assess the extent to which older disabled\u000a      people could afford (or\u000a      not) to lose AA\/DLA.\u000a    Our analysis made a specific contribution in highlighting the need to\u000a      exclude AA\/DLA (or the costs\u000a      they are intended to meet) from the definition of income when considering\u000a      where recipients are in\u000a      the distribution of income (and, by implication, of living standards). To\u000a      do otherwise gives a\u000a      misleadingly favourable view of the position of disabled people. Through a\u000a      comparison excluding\u000a      and including AA\/DLA we demonstrated that the misleading effect of\u000a      inappropriately including\u000a      AA\/DLA in income is substantial. A second contribution was to derive\u000a      continuous measures of\u000a      `latent' disability (using a latent variable structural equation modelling\u000a      approach), which enabled a\u000a      better assessment of the influence of severity of disability on receipt of\u000a      AA\/DLA than is possible\u000a      using only the discrete indicators of disability in surveys. Finally we\u000a      were able to show through our\u000a      analysis that three major British surveys led to the same conclusion: AA\u000a      and DLA are well-targeted\u000a      in terms of both financial and care needs.\u000a    The research team included Professor Stephen Pudney, Professor Richard\u000a      Berthoud, Professor\u000a      Ruth Hancock (moved from Essex to UEA in January 2008 but remains a member\u000a      of the MiSoC\u000a      research centre at Essex), and Francesca Zantomio (Senior Research\u000a      Officer, left Essex in 2009).\u000a      The underpinning research and dissemination activities were undertaken in\u000a      collaboration with\u000a      colleagues at the University of East Anglia, with each institution making\u000a      equal contributions.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43318","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research has informed social-mobility policy in two main ways.\u000a      Firstly, through informing strategy, including influencing the policy of\u000a      government and third-sector organisations. Secondly, through influencing\u000a      the development of practical measures to support breastfeeding &#8212; a key way\u000a      of fostering social mobility.\u000a    Informing social mobility strategy\u000a    The work conducted as part of the project on cross-national study of the\u000a      intergenerational transmission of advantage has played an important role\u000a      in informing the UK policy debate. The first major impact of the study\u000a      stemmed from Del Bono and Ermisch's Educational Mobility in England\u000a      policy report for the Sutton Trust. The Sutton Trust has stated that \"the\u000a      research was a centrepiece for an international summit on social mobility\u000a      attended by the leaders of the three main political parties. The policy\u000a      influence from this was manifested in the Coalition's 2011 Social Mobility\u000a      Strategy, which set out a number of key policies attempting to improve\u000a      social mobility\" [corroborating source 1]. The Educational Mobility\u000a      report was referred to in the Sutton Trust's submission (October 2011) to\u000a      the House of Commons Education Select Committee inquiry into social\u000a      mobility [corroborating source 2]. In addition, the research on inequality\u000a      in adolescence, as well as other international evidence on the interaction\u000a      between educational institutions and social mobility, was presented at a\u000a      workshop held at the British Academy in May 2011 to an audience of\u000a      policymakers and journalists [3].\u000a    The Russell Sage Foundation, an American charitable organisation, has\u000a      outlined two specific impacts arising from Ermisch and Del Bono's (2012)\u000a      chapter on inequality in adolescent achievement. Firstly, the findings of\u000a      this work were central to the Foundation's engagement with policymakers\u000a      and non-academic audiences. A non-technical summary of the From Parents to\u000a      Children project, which highlighted the work of Ermisch and Del Bono, was\u000a      devised for the purpose of engaging with such audiences [4] [5]. Secondly,\u000a      the Foundation has confirmed that Ermisch and Del Bono's findings on\u000a      income gradients have led to investment in \"several grants looking at\u000a      exactly these issues to build upon and extend the findings from the\u000a      Ermisch and Del Bono work\". Further to this, the Foundation now has four\u000a      visiting scholars working on these issues and is looking to fund further\u000a      projects on developmental patterns [5].\u000a    Influencing practical measures to support breastfeeding\u000a    Essex devised a programme of dissemination for the findings of the work\u000a      on social mobility and breastfeeding, which has led to various impacts. In\u000a      October 2011, Essex organised a policy workshop, `Early Intervention and\u000a      Social Mobility: Are pro-breastfeeding policies worth it?' at the British\u000a      Academy in London to discuss some preliminary results from the research.\u000a      The workshop was chaired by Dr Miriam Stoppard, a well-known author of\u000a      books on child development. It featured a panel of healthcare experts and\u000a      representatives of third-sector organisations, including Janet Fyle\u000a      (Policy Advisor for the Royal College of Midwives), Alison Baum (CEO of\u000a      Best Beginnings), Belinda Phipps (CEO of the National Childcare Trust),\u000a      and an MP who is both a member of the Health Select Committee and chair of\u000a      the All Party Group on Maternity Services [6].\u000a    As an immediate consequence of this workshop, the MP addressed the\u000a      under-secretary of State for Public Health in a parliamentary debate on 21st\u000a      November 2011 to ask about the provisions set in place by the current\u000a      Government to support breastfeeding in the long-term [7] [8]. The MP, now\u000a      a Minister in the Department of Health, has confirmed that various policy\u000a      decisions have been informed by the research, including the Government's\u000a      support for the Healthy Child Programme, the inclusion of breastfeeding in\u000a      the Public Health Outcomes Framework, supporting breastfeeding through\u000a      increasing the number of health visitors, providing information about\u000a      breastfeeding through the NHS Information Services, and promoting National\u000a      Breastfeeding Awareness Week [8].\u000a    Essex research on breastfeeding and social mobility has been vital to the\u000a      work of UNICEF UK's Baby Friendly Initiative, which works with public\u000a      services to promote and support breastfeeding. The Director of the\u000a      programme writes that \"ISER's research has been valuable in giving strong\u000a      evidence for the efficacy of the Baby Friendly Initiative &#8212; particularly\u000a      in areas of lower socio-economic status, where breastfeeding is less\u000a      common\" [9]. The necessity of providing such evidence is that \"it is\u000a      important that we can show that the programme has a measurable impact on\u000a      practice and breastfeeding rates in order that the investment in staff\u000a      time and resources is justifiable &#8212; particularly during a time when\u000a      budgets are being cut\" [9]. The Director also states that the research has\u000a      been providing vital evidence on why breastfeeding is important,\u000a      especially in providing an effective methodology to demonstrate the\u000a      association between breastfeeding and IQ [9]. Further to this, Iacovou and\u000a      Sevilla-Sanz's 2010 working paper is cited multiple times in a 2012 report\u000a      by UNICEF UK on the benefits to health services that breastfeeding\u000a      provides [10].\u000a    Most recently, the 2013 paper on breastfeeding and intergenerational\u000a      social mobility from Archives in Diseases of Childhood has\u000a      received extensive media coverage, including articles in the Independent\u000a      and Daily Mail. It has also been the subject of a feature on the NHS\u000a        Choices website [11].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Essex research, conducted between 2009 and 2012, has used cohort studies\u000a      to investigate the sources of intergenerational social mobility in the UK.\u000a      The results show that two variables have highly significant effects on\u000a      children's social mobility patterns: the educational level of parents and\u000a      the prevalence of maternal breastfeeding. The cohort analysis conducted by\u000a      Professor John Ermisch and Dr Emilia Del Bono shows that there are strong\u000a      intergenerational correlations in educational attainment across different\u000a      cohorts of UK individuals. The findings have informed UK Government policy\u000a      and influenced the work of a major US charitable foundation. Analysis\u000a      conducted by a team of researchers led by Del Bono has demonstrated the\u000a      cognitive and socio-emotional benefits of maternal breastfeeding, and\u000a      shown that its uptake can be used to foster social mobility. These\u000a      findings have been vital to UNICEF UK's Baby Friendly Initiative and have\u000a      provided evidence to demonstrate its efficacy and to justify its\u000a      continuation.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Essex\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Essex (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Essex","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"East","UKPRN":10007791}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000aDel Bono, E. and J.

The research\u000a      team has found that parental educational attainment and maternal\u000a      breastfeeding are key determinants of cognitive achievement in children,\u000a      which in turn have powerful effects in determining social mobility in\u000a      adulthood.\u000a    In 2009 Ermisch and Del Bono undertook research on inequality in\u000a      Achievements During Adolescence as part of a cross-national study of the\u000a      intergenerational transmission of advantage &#8212; the findings of which were\u000a      published in a volume co-edited by Ermisch, From parents to children\u000a      (2012). This cross-national study was carried out under the auspices of\u000a      the Russell Sage Foundation and co-directed by Ermisch, with funding for\u000a      the UK component coming from the Sutton Trust. A life-cycle approach was\u000a      adopted to understand where in the life-course divergences in outcomes\u000a      between high and low socio-economic status children occur, how they evolve\u000a      and how those differences may be related to policies, processes and\u000a      institutions operating in various countries. Ermisch and Del Bono's\u000a      research showed that in England the gap between adolescents with\u000a      higher-educated parents and those with lower-educated parents is clearly\u000a      evident by age 11, increases between ages 11 to 14, and remains stable\u000a      thereafter. They argue that the change in the socio-economic gap was most\u000a      likely due to higher-educated parents sending their children to better\u000a      secondary schools, as both observed and unobserved secondary-school\u000a      characteristics account for most of the increase.\u000a    An associated policy report produced by Ermisch and Del Bono for the\u000a      Sutton Trust provided more detailed analysis for the UK: (i) over time\u000a      (comparing the BCS70 and NCDS cohorts); (ii) over the life-course of an\u000a      individual (using LSYPE); and (iii) in an international perspective (using\u000a      TIMMS 2003 and 2007). This report, Educational Mobility in England,\u000a      focused on the link between the education level of parents and the\u000a      educational outcomes of teenagers. This report found, inter alia,\u000a      no change in education mobility for the least educated households, but\u000a      noted that the advantage of having degree-educated parents had diminished\u000a      compared to previous generations.\u000a    Del Bono's research on social mobility also included leading a research\u000a      team that was conducting new studies on the effects of breastfeeding on\u000a      early childhood outcomes. This research, conducted between 2009 and 2012,\u000a      needed to explicitly consider the influence of the educational level of\u000a      parents since in the UK, as in other developed countries, rates of\u000a      breastfeeding are higher among more educated mothers. The main objective\u000a      of this research was to investigate whether breastfeeding can have effects\u000a      on health, socio-emotional and cognitive outcomes early in life that are\u000a      independent of maternal characteristics. In that case, policies aimed at\u000a      promoting breastfeeding among more disadvantaged families can foster\u000a      social mobility.\u000a    The studies analysed the relationship between breastfeeding and: (i)\u000a      various child health measures; (ii) indicators of child cognitive\u000a      development, including assessments of children's early literacy and\u000a      numeracy skills; and (iii) aspects of children's social and emotional\u000a      development. Some of the studies additionally provided an evaluation of\u000a      policies to support breastfeeding at the hospital level, such as those\u000a      implemented by the UNICEF Baby Friendly Initiative in the UK, or those\u000a      supported by employers, such as the availability of breastfeeding\u000a      facilities at the workplace.\u000a    The research found evidence that breastfeeding affects children's health\u000a      and cognitive outcomes, and some aspects of social and emotional\u000a      development. The findings also showed how hospital-based policy\u000a      interventions in support of breastfeeding are an effective tool to\u000a      increase breastfeeding rates among less educated mothers, while the\u000a      availability of breastfeeding facilities at work facilitates women's\u000a      return to employment but only among more educated employees. These results\u000a      highlight the way in which existing policies in support of breastfeeding\u000a      have different effects on different groups of the population, and while in\u000a      some cases may enhance social mobility, in other cases may actually reduce\u000a      it.\u000a    Research conducted at Essex in 2012, and published in Archives of\u000a        Disease of Childhood in 2013, attempted to identify the particular\u000a      mechanisms that lead to the association between breastfeeding and\u000a      intergenerational social mobility. This research analysed data from the\u000a      British Cohort Studies of 1958 and 1970 and found that breastfed\u000a      individuals were more likely to be upwardly mobile and less likely to be\u000a      downwardly mobile, with similar effects identified in each cohort.\u000a      Mediation models identified a key mechanism to be that breastfeeding\u000a      advances neurological development, resulting in improved cognitive\u000a      performance, which in turn supports upward social mobility and protects\u000a      against downward mobility.\u000a    The research team included: Professor John Ermisch (left Essex October\u000a      2011), Dr Emilia Del Bono (Reader), Dr Birgitta Rabe (Senior Research\u000a      Fellow), Dr Maria Iacovou (Senior Research Fellow), Professor Amanda\u000a      Sacker (left Essex December 2012), and Professor Yvonne Kelly (at Essex\u000a      January 2011 &#8212; December 2012).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43346","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research described above has been found valuable and employed by\u000d\u000a      investors, policy-makers\u000d\u000a      within the UK Government, and also by House of Commons Committees who\u000d\u000a      influence policies.\u000d\u000a      Often acknowledgement of the value of the research has been made privately\u000d\u000a      but sometimes\u000d\u000a      publicly. In June 2009 the House of Commons Select Committee on Energy and\u000d\u000a      Climate Change\u000d\u000a      published a report entitled UK Offshore Oil and Gas (Vol.1, HC\u000d\u000a      341-1) in which the Memorandum\u000d\u000a      and Oral Evidence given by Professor Kemp was cited several times and his\u000d\u000a      recommendations on\u000d\u000a      the fiscal regime and related issues were incorporated in the conclusions\u000d\u000a      of the Committee's\u000d\u000a      report.\u000d\u000a    The study by Kemp and Kasim (2006) highlighted the particular economic\u000d\u000a      problem of securing\u000d\u000a      stranded gas developments in the West of Shetland region where there was\u000d\u000a      little infrastructure and\u000d\u000a      the investment costs correspondingly high. This had some influence on the\u000d\u000a      introduction in 2010 of\u000d\u000a      tax allowances for stranded gas fields. A later paper (Kemp and Stephen\u000d\u000a      2011) identified the\u000d\u000a      problems of developing fields generally in the UKCS, but particularly oil\u000d\u000a      fields in the West of\u000d\u000a      Shetland region. This informed policy regarding the introduction of the\u000d\u000a      special allowance for large,\u000d\u000a      deepwater fields in Budget 2012 as outlined below.\u000d\u000a    The results of the research paper produced after Budget 2011\u000d\u000a      (Kemp and Stephen 2011) were\u000d\u000a      quoted in support of her views by Justine Greening, Economic Secretary to\u000d\u000a      the Treasury, in her\u000d\u000a      evidence to the House of Commons Energy and Climate Change Select\u000d\u000a      Committee on 4th May\u000d\u000a      2011 in support of the Government's position (see House of Commons Energy\u000d\u000a      and Climate\u000d\u000a      Change Committee, HC108-i, January 2012). The study by Kemp and\u000d\u000a      Stephen (2011) produced\u000d\u000a      evidence of the need for further field tax allowances to mitigate the\u000d\u000a      effects of the tax rate hike in\u000d\u000a      Budget 2011.\u000d\u000a    In Kemp and Kasim (2005) the research paper on production decline rates\u000d\u000a      in the UKCS found that\u000d\u000a      the generally assumed exponential production decline rates did not\u000d\u000a      correspond with the realities of\u000d\u000a      the UKCS. Detailed econometric modelling demonstrated that production\u000d\u000a      decline rates were more\u000d\u000a      likely to be logistic rather than exponential. It was also found that\u000d\u000a      decline rates were very sensitive\u000d\u000a      to the presence or otherwise of incremental investments during the mature\u000d\u000a      phase of a field's life.\u000d\u000a      At this time there were no tax incentives for such investments. This study\u000d\u000a      and that by Kemp and\u000d\u000a      Stephen (2011) provided independent evidence of the need to incentivise\u000d\u000a      investments in mature\u000d\u000a      fields. In Budget 2012 provision was made to introduce the\u000d\u000a      brownfield allowance to apply to\u000d\u000a      incremental investments. In the Green Budget published by the influential\u000d\u000a      Institute for Fiscal\u000d\u000a      Studies in February 2013 there is a section on North Sea oil taxation in\u000d\u000a      which the paper by Kemp\u000d\u000a      and Stephen (2011) is cited approvingly.\u000d\u000a    The various oil company and Scottish Enterprise sponsors have been\u000d\u000a      sufficiently impressed with\u000d\u000a      the research work that they have continuously renewed their sponsorship\u000d\u000a      throughout the REF\u000d\u000a      period (and for many earlier years). Their sponsorship is on a one-year\u000d\u000a      basis only, and no\u000d\u000a      promises are made about any further funding. They have clearly revealed\u000d\u000a      their satisfaction by\u000d\u000a      continually agreeing to fund further research studies on this important,\u000d\u000a      ongoing subject. They see\u000d\u000a      the benefit of independent research which models the entire North Sea oil\u000d\u000a      sector and measures\u000d\u000a      the aggregate effect of tax changes on the sector. The impact of the\u000d\u000a      research on the private sector\u000d\u000a      has been generated by providing a public analytical service to individual\u000d\u000a      oil companies, who\u000d\u000a      generally lack industry-wide knowledge of the impact of tax measures. In\u000d\u000a      turn this has enabled the\u000d\u000a      companies to make better-informed decisions. This private sector impact\u000d\u000a      further augments the\u000d\u000a      impact on the UK Government.\u000d\u000a    Based on his research papers on North Sea oil, in the REF period,\u000d\u000a      Professor Kemp has given\u000d\u000a      many television interviews to the BBC, STV, Channel Four, Al Jazeera, and\u000d\u000a      Bloomberg, radio\u000d\u000a      interviews to Radio 4, Radio 5, BBC Radio Scotland, and North Sound, and\u000d\u000a      press interviews to\u000d\u000a      The Financial Times, Times, Guardian, Scotsman, Herald, Aberdeen Press and\u000d\u000a      Journal, and Le\u000d\u000a      Monde.

The paper by Kemp and Kasim (2003a) produced insights into\u000d\u000a      the factors (including\u000d\u000a      taxation) which determine the pace of exploration, development, and\u000d\u000a      production. A further study\u000d\u000a      (Kemp and Kasim 2003b) used econometric techniques to forecast activity\u000d\u000a      levels in the UKCS.\u000d\u000a      Learning from the results in these papers, financial simulation models\u000d\u000a      were modified and employed\u000d\u000a      (Kemp and Stephen 2005 and 2011) to enhance understanding of the factors\u000d\u000a      determining likely\u000d\u000a      future activity levels, including the role of the tax arrangements.\u000d\u000a    Altogether the research identified and quantified the effects on\u000d\u000a      investment and production likely to\u000d\u000a      emanate from the changing UK tax system. The studies were conducted in a\u000d\u000a      period when three\u000d\u000a      large tax increases were introduced on North Sea oil and gas production.\u000d\u000a      The research\u000d\u000a      highlighted the consequences of what was basically a flat rate\u000d\u000a      (proportional) tax system across\u000d\u000a      fields personified by highly differentiated profitability.

The paper by Kemp and Kasim\u000d\u000a      (2006) clearly\u000d\u000a      demonstrated the importance of these features and indicated the need for\u000d\u000a      incentives to be\u000d\u000a      differentiated according to geographic areas and cost characteristics, if\u000d\u000a      economic rents were to be\u000d\u000a      efficiently collected by the state without causing deadweight losses and\u000d\u000a      investment disincentives.\u000d\u000a    A further strand of research on rates of decline in production (Kemp and\u000d\u000a      Kasim 2005)\u000d\u000a      demonstrated the need to incentivise incremental investments in mature\u000d\u000a      fields to moderate decline\u000d\u000a      rates and enhance economic recovery.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43347","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The early study (Kemp and Stephen, 1999) broke new ground and has been\u000a      cited in the debate on\u000a      constitutional change since that time. The results of the economic\u000a      modelling of the hypothetical tax\u000a      take for historic years have been used in the recent report of the House\u000a      of Lords Select Committee\u000a      on Economic Affairs (see below). The study by Kemp and Stephen (2008) has\u000a      been used every\u000a      year since then by the (SNP) Scottish government in its yearly\u000a      publication, Government\u000a        Expenditure and Revenue, Scotland (ISBN: 978-1-78045-705-5) and was\u000a      also used by the Scottish\u000a      Government in their publication An Oil Fund for Scotland (2009)\u000a      (ISBN: 978-0-7559-8119-9). Kemp\u000a      and Stephen have been asked by the Scottish Government to update the oil\u000a      related estimates\u000a      every year since 2008. It should be noted no other reputable source of\u000a      information is available on\u000a      the hypothetical Scottish shares of production, investment, gross revenues\u000a      and tax revenues from\u000a      North Sea oil and gas. The modelling has widely been accepted as being\u000a      independent and reliable\u000a      in the on-going debate. Tax revenues would form a substantial part of a\u000a      Scottish Government\u000a      budget in the event of independence or enhanced devolution and an\u000a      understanding of their\u000a      potential size, volatility, and long term behaviour is clearly important\u000a      to the constitutional debate.\u000a    Professor Kemp was asked to give written and oral evidence to (1) the\u000a      House of Commons Select\u000a      Committee on Energy and Climate Change (March 2012) and (2) the House of\u000a      Lords Select\u000a      Committee on Economic Affairs (October 2012) on the implications of\u000a      Scottish independence for\u000a      the North Sea oil and gas industry. A major element in both instances\u000a      concerned petroleum\u000a      taxation and licensing issues. These related to (1) the intricate problems\u000a      of taxing the industry\u000a      separately in Scotland and the rest of the UK and (2) the likely size of\u000a      the tax revenues from the\u000a      Scottish sector. Kemp was able to call on his updated research to give\u000a      useful information on the\u000a      subject. The House of Lords Committee published its report in April 2013 (The\u000a        Economic\u000a        Implications for the United Kingdom of Scottish Independence, HL\u000a      Paper 152). The report\u000a      incorporates material from Kemp's modelling of the hypothetical Scottish\u000a      share of North Sea tax\u000a      revenues since 1976, and his Memorandum and Oral Evidence are published in\u000a      full. A further\u000a      publication by the Scottish Government entitled Maximising the Return\u000a        from Oil and Gas in an\u000a        Independent Scotland (ISBN: 978-1-78256-776-9) cited Kemp (2013) as\u000a      a credible source of\u000a      estimates of potential future oil production and decommissioning costs\u000a      relating to the likely Scottish\u000a      continental shelf.\u000a    Professor Kemp was invited to become a member of the Council of Economic\u000a      Advisers (2007-2011)\u000a      to the Scottish Government, where his expertise on oil and gas matters was\u000a      utilised. In\u000a      2008-2009 Kemp was appointed a member of the Independent Expert Group to\u000a      the Calman\u000a      Commission on Scottish Devolution.

This public impact was further strengthened through his written\u000a      and oral evidence to\u000a      parliamentary committees investigating this controversial topic, with\u000a      frequent references to his\u000a      research and evidence in published reports.

It is complemented by\u000a      research relevant to Scottish\u000a      devolution elsewhere within the University of Aberdeen Business School,\u000a      such as work by David\u000a      Heald (Professor of Accountancy &#8212; submitted under UoA19) on the Barnett\u000a      formula and\u000a      constitutional change.\u000a    The paper by Kemp and Stephen (1999) used financial simulation modelling,\u000a      and produced\u000a      estimates of the investment and operating expenditures, gross revenues,\u000a      and tax revenues for the\u000a      hypothetical Scottish sector of the UK Continental Shelf since the\u000a      mid-1970s. This involved the\u000a      designation of a dividing line in the North Sea between the Scottish and\u000a      rest of UK sectors, as well\u000a      as the incorporation of complex tax arrangements for offshore oil and gas\u000a      and allocations of\u000a      various non-field specific costs to the two sectors.\u000a    Understanding the economics of the North Sea oil sector is essential to\u000a      produce reliable estimates\u000a      of the hypothetical Scottish shares. This was enhanced by the paper by\u000a      Kemp and Kasim (2006)\u000a      which developed an econometric model that highlighted the different\u000a      characteristics of the five\u000a      main geographic regions of the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS). Kemp and\u000a      Stephen (2008) used\u000a      financial simulation modelling to estimate the hypothetical Scottish\u000a      shares of expenditures and\u000a      revenues, the quality of which was enhanced by the earlier econometric\u000a      modelling by Kemp and\u000a      Kasim. Findings emphasised (1) the relatively large tax revenues which\u000a      would have accrued to a\u000a      Scottish government, but also (2) their extreme volatility. With an\u000a      inevitable decline in the longer\u000a      term, the implications are that an independent Scottish government should\u000a      be wary of relying\u000a      substantially on North Sea oil revenues for normal budget purposes. The\u000a      research concluded that\u000a      borrowing rights and an Oil Fund (i.e. a fund separated from normal\u000a      government revenues and\u000a      expenditures) are desirable to handle the volatility of the revenues. The\u000a      research over the years\u000a      was conducted with the aid of sponsorship from the Scottish Government, a\u000a      group of oil companies\u000a      and Scottish Enterprise.\u000a    A further issue central to the constitutional debate is the evolving role\u000a      of the Barnett formula.\u000a      Heald's Barnett formula expertise is widely acknowledged, as reflected in\u000a      the House of Commons\u000a      Justice Committee &#8212; Fifth Report (2009) which points out that it was Heald\u000a      who initially coined the\u000a      phrase `Barnett formula'. His publications on devolution and the formula\u000a      are numerous. Of interest\u000a      in this context is a paper, stemming from an ESRC funded project\u000a      undertaken in Aberdeen, Heald\u000a      and McLeod (2005), which tracks the implementation of the Barnett formula\u000a      since devolution in\u000a      three UK spending reviews of the early to mid-2000s in order to deepen\u000a      public understanding of\u000a      how devolution finance is embedded within the UK public expenditure\u000a      framework. It demonstrated\u000a      that the formula's implementation was far from transparent and there was\u000a      much more\u000a      governmental discretion in fiscal transfers between Westminster and\u000a      Scotland, Wales and\u000a      Northern Ireland than was previously recognised.\u000a    Heald's research was financed by the Nuffield Foundation (1997-98), the\u000a      ESRC Devolution\u000a      Programme (2001-03) and the Northern Ireland Economic Council (2001-03).\u000a      These awards\u000a      totalled &#163;184,956.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43348","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Research conducted by Theodossiou and Pouliakas has impacted on national\u000d\u000a      and international policy through feeding into influential policy papers\u000d\u000a      and reviews.

In November 2010, Prime Minister David\u000d\u000a      Cameron proposed that the government should no longer use just economic\u000d\u000a      indicators to assess the UK's progress, but that it should also take\u000d\u000a      people's sense of well-being into consideration. Socio-economic status and\u000d\u000a      labour market experiences both have substantial influence on employees'\u000d\u000a      job satisfaction, health and well-being, affecting their performance and,\u000d\u000a      in some cases, even their ability to work.\u000d\u000a    It is on these areas that Ioannis Theodossiou, Professor of Economics at\u000d\u000a      the Centre for European Labour Market Research at the University of\u000d\u000a      Aberdeen since 1998, together with Konstantinos Pouliakas, a PhD student\u000d\u000a      (2003-2007) and Research Fellow (2007-2011) at the University of Aberdeen,\u000d\u000a      has focused a substantial body of research. This consisted in three EU\u000d\u000a      Commission-funded projects investigating the effects of different aspects\u000d\u000a      of pay, job structure and health and safety on well-being at work.\u000d\u000a    The first research project, Socio-economic and occupational effects\u000d\u000a        on the health inequality of the older workforce (SOCIOLD), examined\u000d\u000a      from November 2002 how inequalities in socio-economic and occupational\u000d\u000a      status affect the physical and mental health of older people in the\u000d\u000a      workforce, as well as their ability to participate in the labour market\u000d\u000a      and thus to provide for themselves in retirement. It also looked at how\u000d\u000a      policy initiatives might be developed to enhance the effectiveness of\u000d\u000a      welfare services for the older workforce. One thousand people aged 50 to\u000d\u000a      65 were questioned in each of six countries &#8212; France, UK, Greece, Finland,\u000d\u000a      Denmark and The Netherlands. The three-year study revealed that short term\u000d\u000a      contracts and unemployment have a detrimental effect on health and life\u000d\u000a      expectancy.\u000d\u000a    Also starting in 2002, the second project, Societal and economic\u000d\u000a        effects on quality of life and well-being: preference identification and\u000d\u000a        priority setting in response to changes in labour market status\u000d\u000a      (EPICURUS), examined job satisfaction and quality of life. One thousand\u000d\u000a      people aged 18 to 65 were questioned in the six countries already\u000d\u000a      mentioned plus Spain, on working patterns and changes to them, and\u000d\u000a      inequalities in socio-economic status affecting the quality of life of\u000d\u000a      individuals. It explored the effects of different pay incentives &#8212;\u000d\u000a      including bonuses, piece-rates, options and profit sharing &#8212; on the job\u000d\u000a      satisfaction of workers.\u000d\u000a    EPICURUS established that considering the organisational environment and\u000d\u000a      the nature of the job is crucial when designing pay policies to enhance\u000d\u000a      the well-being of the workforce while full time employment is best for\u000d\u000a      quality of life and well-being. It also found there is a much stronger\u000d\u000a      case for linking pay to performance at senior levels of public\u000d\u000a      organisations than for the rest of the workforce.\u000d\u000a    From 2007 to 2010, the third research project, HEALTHatWORK, reviewed\u000d\u000a      existing data from national surveys conducted in 15 countries into safety\u000d\u000a      and health at work and its effects on quality of work and life, job\u000d\u000a      satisfaction and reduction of lost time at work in an era of aging\u000d\u000a      populations, feminised labour markets and increasing numbers of small and\u000d\u000a      medium sized employers. Additional surveys about illness and injury at\u000d\u000a      work were carried out in the Netherlands, UK and Poland.\u000d\u000a    The study concluded that that while competitive markets require employees\u000d\u000a      to have all the information available to employers about workplace risks,\u000d\u000a      this often does not occur, particularly in relation to accident prone\u000d\u000a      occupations and the likely severity of potential incidents. It also found\u000d\u000a      that the social class distribution of occupational accidents and illnesses\u000d\u000a      is skewed, and that individuals who suffer work-related accidents or\u000d\u000a      ill-health face a higher probability of unemployment, experience early\u000d\u000a      exit from the labour market or face increased difficulties in finding a\u000d\u000a      suitable job.

This is evidenced by invited presentations\u000a      at public debates, roundtable stakeholder discussions and advisory boards\u000a      (e.g., Westminster Health Forum Keynote Seminars, October 2010 and 2013;\u000a      House of Commons dinner debate, February 2011; PharmaTimes debate, April,\u000a      2011; and Myeloma UK Symposium, November 2011). Invitations to present and\u000a      advise research consultancy organisations (e.g., Mapi Values, April 2008,\u000a      IMS Health, June 2011, Heron, May 2012), manufacturers (Sanofi Aventis,\u000a      February 2011, Roche Pharmaceuticals, London, February 2011, May, July and\u000a      December 2012) and national bodies which represent the interest of the\u000a      sector (Association of British Pharmaceutical Industries, February 2011\u000a      and February 2012) also evidence the impact of this research. The research\u000a      has also had an impact on the international debate about pharmaceutical\u000a      pricing [5, 6] and has influenced policy formation in global health, e.g.,\u000a      Global Fund, Gates Foundation, GAVI Alliance, and how prices are\u000a      negotiated by HTA Agencies [4, 22]. This impact is also evidenced by\u000a      invitations to present and advise institutions and policy makers in North\u000a      America (CADTH, Ottawa, March 2012 and St Johns 2013), Europe (e.g., SBU,\u000a      the Swedish Council on Health Technology Assessment, Stockholm, May 2011;\u000a      Portuguese Secretary of State for Health sponsored by Exigo Consultores,\u000a      Lisbon October 2011; and the European Healthcare Innovation Leadership\u000a      Network, London November 2011) and South America (e.g., acting Minister of\u000a      Health for Chile, Santiago, March 2012).\u000a    The research has also had an impact on the closely related public debate\u000a      about whether decisions made by bodies like NICE sufficiently reward\u000a      innovation. During the review of NICE methods undertaken by Sir Ian\u000a      Kennedy in 2009 researchers at York were invited by Sir Ian to present at\u000a      the associated stakeholder workshops. The NICE Decision Support Unit\u000a      report on Innovation (led by Claxton) was part of the NICE submission to\u000a      the Kennedy Study and informed his recommendations [7, 8]. This report\u000a      drew heavily on the underpinning research.\u000a    In part this impact has been achieved by communicating key economic\u000a      insights in a way that is accessible to wide audience, which has led to\u000a      many reports and appearances in the media (e.g., Financial Times, Nature,\u000a      PharmaTimes, BBC News 24 and Radio 4 Today Programme [9]), and through\u000a      timely publication to inform the consultation on the government's\u000a      proposals [10]. This publication was quoted or cited in submissions made\u000a      by manufacturers as well as the Royal College of General Practitioners,\u000a      Royal Pharmaceutical Society and the Stockholm Network [11- 13]. Other\u000a      publications have been targeted at a parliamentary and political audience,\u000a      e.g., an invited article for the Bow Group magazine [14], with evidence of\u000a      influence on Conservative Party policy [15]. University and Departmental\u000a      support has been critical in engaging a range of stakeholders and policy\u000a      makers, in part, through organising number of symposia to present the\u000a      underpinning research.\u000a    The work at York has also had a direct impact on the formation of\u000a      Government policy and the details of how the scheme will operate. For\u000a      example, the importance of an empirical assessment of the\u000a      cost-effectiveness threshold is evident in the original DH proposals [16]\u000a      and the associated Impact Assessment [17]. This was reiterated in the\u000a      government's response to the consultation in July 2011 [18]. The MRC\/NIHR\u000a      funded research provides an estimate of the `basic threshold' described in\u000a      the policy documents which is a key determinant of pharmaceutical prices.\u000a      The findings of this work were submitted as written evidence to the recent\u000a      HCHC investigation of NICE and members of the research team were also\u000a      invited to give evidence [19]. At the request of DH, the results of this\u000a      research have been presented to key civil servants in DH (March, June and\u000a      July 2013), Department of Business Innovation and Skills (March 2013) and\u000a      the HM Treasury (March 2013). The results, suggest that the threshold\u000a      currently used by NICE should not be increased and may be lower. It also\u000a      found little evidence that it had grown with NHS prices or real growth in\u000a      the NHS budget. These findings, \"have been discussed at the highest levels\u000a      of Government and have had a direct impact on national policy making\" [27]\u000a      and negotiations between Government and the Association of the British\u000a      Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI).\u000a    One of the Governments objectives is to ensure that prices more fully\u000a      reflect the greater value of health benefits in areas of high disease\u000a      burden and where they also offer wider social benefits to carers, other\u000a      public expenditure and the wider economy. York research on the `basic'\u000a      threshold identifies where (by disease area), how (in terms of mortality\u000a      and quality of life) and for whom (by age and gender) health outcomes are\u000a      likely to be displaced as a consequence of additional NHS costs. As part\u000a      of the EEPRU project this work also provided the analytic and evidential\u000a      foundation for valuing or weighting such displacements by type of health\u000a      and any adverse wider social impacts (on carers, public expenditure and\u000a      the wider economy). The importance of this assessment of opportunity cost\u000a      (`displacement') is evident in the instructions DH gave to NICE when\u000a      specifying how the scheme should be implemented. This work was presented\u000a      to the NICE Working Party on VBP (July and August 2013) and reflects these\u000a      social values and wider effects while taking proper account of opportunity\u000a      costs when setting prices [23, 24]. The way that wider social benefits\u000a      (consumption effects that fall outside the NHS budget constraint), are to\u000a      be taken into account alongside health benefits and NHS resources has also\u000a      been informed by work undertaken at York. Therefore, the underpinning\u000a      research at York has had a direct impact on the life cycle of policy from\u000a      public debate, policy formation to the details of how policy objectives\u000a      are delivered.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The NHS spends about &#163;11bn annually on pharmaceuticals, of which &#163;8bn is\u000a      on branded drugs, representing about 13% and 10% respectively of available\u000a      NHS resources. Research at York has been central to the public and policy\u000a      debate about how branded pharmaceuticals ought to be priced and has made a\u000a      material contribution to the development of government policy to introduce\u000a      a value based pricing (VBP) scheme for all new pharmaceuticals. VBP has\u000a      significance for the prices that the NHS pays for pharmaceuticals, access\u000a      to new drugs for NHS patients, and the return that manufacturers can\u000a      expect from future research and development. There is also an\u000a      international impact in two respects: UK prices are estimated to influence\u000a      25% of the world market and York has contributed to a wider policy debate\u000a      about international pharmaceutical pricing and the potential role of value\u000a      based pricing in European, North American, South American and South East\u000a      Asian health care systems.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Economic","Institution":"\u000a    University of York\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"York (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of York","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"Yorkshire And Humberside","UKPRN":10007167}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"6094817","Name":"Ottawa"},{"GeoNamesId":"2267057","Name":"Lisbon"},{"GeoNamesId":"2673730","Name":"Stockholm"},{"GeoNamesId":"3871336","Name":"Santiago"}],"References":"\u000a    Peer reviewed publications:\u000a    \u000a[1] Claxton K.

The work details how a VBP scheme can be\u000a      specified in a way that mirrors competitive markets in other sectors where\u000a      innovation is protected by patent and protecting manufacturers from the\u000a      potential exploitation of monopsony power by bodies like NICE, while\u000a      ensuring that value accrues to the NHS following patent expiry and entry\u000a      of generics. It demonstrates how the type of cost-effectiveness analysis\u000a      conducted for NICE, can be used to align incentives for manufacturers with\u000a      the objectives and resource constraints of a collectively funded health\u000a      care system like the NHS.\u000a    This research makes clear that an estimate of the shadow price of the NHS\u000a      budget constraint (the cost-effectiveness threshold or the health\u000a      displaced by additional NHS costs), is central to any assessment of the\u000a      price the NHS can afford to pay for a new drug. Underpinning research at\u000a      York [3], demonstrated how national data, which identifies expenditure by\u000a      broad programmes of care, can be linked to mortality outcomes and used to\u000a      estimate the relationship between expenditure and health outcomes, while\u000a      addressing issues of endogeneity by identifying and testing suitable\u000a      instruments. This work was further developed through MRC\/NIHR funding [6]\u000a      to estimate expenditure and outcome equations across all 23 programmes of\u000a      NHS care; capturing the effects of changes in expenditure on length and\u000a      quality of life [4]. This research also identifies where (by disease area)\u000a      and what types of health outcomes (mortality and quality of life effects)\u000a      are likely to be lost as a consequence of additional NHS costs and for\u000a      whom (by age and gender). It provides the analytic and evidential\u000a      foundation to incorporate a range of values that can be attached to\u000a      different types of health effects (gained or displaced), as well as the\u000a      wider consumption effects associated with them. Research, commissioned by\u000a      the Department of Health (DH), also demonstrates how wider consumption\u000a      effects can be valued relative to constrained NHS resources and health\u000a      effects [7].\u000a    Research at York [1, 5] has also shown how uncertainty and the value of\u000a      additional evidence about the performance of a technology ought to\u000a      influence approval and pricing decisions. This was developed in MRC\/NIHR\u000a      funded research, which demonstrated how NICE methods of appraisal can be\u000a      extended to take account of the value of additional evidence and the\u000a      commitment of irrecoverable costs on a decision to approve a technology at\u000a      launch when its performance is uncertain [8]. At the request of the\u000a      Department of Health this work was extended as part of the Economic\u000a      Evaluation Policy Research Unit (EEPRU) [9] to inform how the VBP scheme\u000a      might include these considerations.\u000a    Researchers at York: Claxton K (Professor, Oct 1989-); Culyer AJ\u000a      (Professor, 1969-); Rice N (Professor; 1994-); Martin S (Senior RF;\u000a      1989-); Sculpher M (Professor, Nov 1997-); Palmer S (Professor; April\u000a      1995-); Smith PC (Professor, 1984-Sep 2009); Griffin S (Senior RF; Oct\u000a      2002-) ; Soares M (RF, 2007-); Hind S (RF, Oct 2010-); Spackman E (RF, Feb\u000a      2010-) and Walker S (RF; Oct 2006-).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43454","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    4.1 Mandatory wage floors in the national labour market &#8212; the National\u000d\u000a        Minimum Wage\u000d\u000a      The Low Pay Commission (LPC) is an independent statutory non-departmental\u000d\u000a      public body set up\u000d\u000a      under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998.

However as important\u000d\u000a      (and arguably even more\u000d\u000a      so for in-work poverty) is whether the working hours of those workers\u000d\u000a      directly affected by the\u000d\u000a      minimum wages alter e.g. even if employment probabilities may not. Stewart\u000d\u000a      &amp; Swaffield (2008)\u000d\u000a      considered this neglected dimension, the \"intensive margin\". Findings\u000d\u000a      showed that the introduction\u000d\u000a      of the minimum wage reduced the basic hours of low-wage workers by between\u000d\u000a      one and two hours\u000d\u000a      per week. The effects on total paid hours were similar (indicating\u000d\u000a      negligible effects on paid\u000d\u000a      overtime), and lagged effects (the year after the introduction and before\u000d\u000a      the first uprating)\u000d\u000a      dominated the smaller and less significant initial effects.\u000d\u000a    The impact of minimum wages on the wage growth of low-wage workers:\u000d\u000a      ESRC RES-000-22-0841\u000d\u000a      and Swaffield (2013) show how the probability of low-wage employees\u000d\u000a      receiving positive\u000d\u000a      real wage growth has been significantly increased by the minimum wage\u000d\u000a      upratings. However,\u000d\u000a      whether the actual wage growth has been significantly raised or not\u000d\u000a      depends on the magnitude of\u000d\u000a      the minimum wage uprating considered. These findings are consistent with\u000d\u000a      employers complying\u000d\u000a      with the legally binding minimum wage but holding down or offsetting the\u000d\u000a      wage growth that they\u000d\u000a      might have awarded in periods of relatively low minimum wage upratings.\u000d\u000a      This analysis has shown\u000d\u000a      how the NMW has impacted on the wage growth of low-wage workers and\u000d\u000a      extends initial work in\u000d\u000a      Stewart &amp; Swaffield (2002) on the immediate impact of the NMW\u000d\u000a      introduction on wage levels.\u000d\u000a    The impact of the NMW on young people's education\/employment\u000d\u000a        decisions: De Coulon et al\u000d\u000a      (2010) estimated the impact of the October 2004 NMW extension to youths\u000d\u000a      (16-17 years old) on\u000d\u000a      the staying-on rates by local authority area (high-wage vs. low-wage\u000d\u000a      areas), as well identifying the\u000d\u000a      primary determinants of the post-compulsory schooling decision. Findings\u000d\u000a      show little evidence of a\u000d\u000a      negative impact of the youth minimum wage on staying-on rates, and\u000d\u000a      analysis of the individual\u000d\u000a      staying-on decision showed the key driver to be pupil educational\u000d\u000a      attainment and parental\u000d\u000a      aspirations rather than local wage rates. Crawford et al (2011)\u000d\u000a      subsequently extended this work\u000d\u000a      with a further LPC funded research project looking at the effects of local\u000d\u000a      labour market conditions\u000d\u000a      on young people's education and labour market choices and whether the\u000d\u000a      reduction in the age of\u000d\u000a      entitlement of the adult NMW rate (in October 2010) from 22 to 21 years of\u000d\u000a      age affected the\u000d\u000a      education\/labour market choices of 21 year olds (compared to 20 years\u000d\u000a      olds). Findings suggest\u000d\u000a      there had been no adverse effect on the education or labour market choices\u000d\u000a      of this group.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43455","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1220409","Name":"Tajikistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1527747","Name":"Kyrgyzstan"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research questions addressed by the ECuity Projects were shaped by\u000d\u000a      the concerns of national policy-makers, health services professionals, and\u000d\u000a      international organisations, all of whom have an interest in truly\u000d\u000a      comparable findings across countries. The motivation for ECuity II\u000d\u000a      responded to concerns that had been expressed in several European\u000d\u000a      countries over the possible adverse consequences, in terms of both equity\u000d\u000a      in health care utilisation and inequalities in health, of the continued\u000d\u000a      growth of user charges, private insurance and of income inequality. ECuity\u000d\u000a      III focused on the transmission of inequalities in health to old age, and\u000d\u000a      the inequitable treatment of the elderly by health care systems,\u000d\u000a      reflecting differences in insurance coverage and pension entitlement.\u000d\u000a    To engage with health policy-makers the ECuity Project communicated its\u000d\u000a      findings through policy-oriented conferences and journals as well as in\u000d\u000a      peer-reviewed academic journals. The ECuity II and III Projects held\u000d\u000a      annual workshops that were attended by representatives from international\u000d\u000a      organisations (OECD, WB, WHO). These were the most direct route through\u000d\u000a      which the methods and findings reached a non-academic audience (ECuity III\u000d\u000a      workshops were in Belgirate, 2003; Helsinki, 2004; IZA Bonn, 2005).\u000d\u000a      Furthermore, the findings were presented and discussed at meetings with\u000d\u000a      officials from several international organisations, including the EU,\u000d\u000a      OECD, WB and WHO. The assimilation of the methods and the use of evidence\u000d\u000a      by these international decision makers can be traced in their publications\u000d\u000a      and official statistics: for the EU see for example Eurostat (2010a &amp;\u000d\u000a      2010b); for the OECD see Devaux and Looper (2012), Marcial et al. (2008),\u000d\u000a      and Verbist et al. (2011); for the WB see Smith and Nam (2013); and for\u000d\u000a      the WHO Mladovsky et al. (2009).\u000d\u000a    Evidence of the assimilation of the research done at York at the\u000d\u000a      international level is provided by factual statement [1] from the Director\u000d\u000a      of the Health Systems and Financing Department at the World Health\u000d\u000a      Organisation based in Geneva:\u000d\u000a    \"Redressing inequalities in health has always been fundamental to the\u000d\u000a        work of the World Health Organization. The ECuity Projects in their\u000d\u000a        various forms were valuable in helping WHO think through many questions\u000d\u000a        linked to how to do this. I refer to four areas as examples.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The fact that inequalities in health are linked to inequalities in\u000d\u000a        income, as confirmed by the ECuity Project, was not itself surprising,\u000d\u000a        but the fact that income related inequalities were growing in many\u000d\u000a        countries was. Equally as important was the development by the Project\u000d\u000a        of a way of rigorously comparing indices of inequality in health that\u000d\u000a        allows the contribution of inequalities in income to be clearly\u000d\u000a        identified.\u000d\u000a      At the same time the Project, for example in the work of Silvia\u000d\u000a          Balia and Andrew Jones, showed that individual choices about lifestyle\u000d\u000a          influence mortality independently from social and economic factors.\u000d\u000a          This is critical for identifying what can be done to reduce the risks\u000d\u000a          of premature mortality.\u000d\u000a      In papers by Eddy van Doorslaer and Andrew Jones, and by\u000d\u000a          Cristina Hernandez, Andrew Jones and Nigel Rice, the Project explored\u000d\u000a          the area of self-report bias and heterogeneity in self-assessed health\u000d\u000a          responses, something that has long concerned the World Health\u000d\u000a          Organization. Self-assessed health responses are simpler to undertake\u000d\u000a          than measured tests, but the capacity to compare them over time or\u000d\u000a          across settings is a concern. The finding that at least in the UK\u000d\u000a          self-assessment did not seem to vary consistently with socio-economic\u000d\u000a          characteristics of patients was somewhat reassuring.\u000d\u000a      The Organization's work on health financing strategies was\u000d\u000a          helped by the ECuity Project's analysis of the role health shocks play\u000d\u000a          in the decision to retire, something that is also linked to the\u000d\u000a          generosity of the country's social security system &#8212; explored in\u000d\u000a          papers by Andrew Jones, Nigel Rice and colleagues. This has\u000d\u000a          implications for the sustainability of financing for health based on\u000d\u000a          wage deductions, as well as for understanding the broader implications\u000d\u000a          of poor health for overall social welfare.\"\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Evidence of changes in practice within the World Bank is provided in\u000d\u000a      factual statements [2] and [3]. A Senior Economist in the Health and\u000d\u000a      Nutrition Unit, Eastern Europe and Central Asia at the World Bank\u000d\u000a      describes the influence on practice at the Bank in factual statement [2]:\u000d\u000a    \"The methods and tools initially developed in the context of the\u000d\u000a        ECuity project are now frequently used to measure the performance of\u000d\u000a        health systems, to inform policy dialogue, and to build capacity in\u000d\u000a        client countries. The World Bank developed a module to automate health\u000d\u000a        equity analyses in the free software platform ADePT and is promoting its\u000d\u000a        use both within and outside the institution.

As co-ordinator Jones provided research\u000d\u000a      leadership to national research teams working across 15 countries\u000d\u000a      (Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy,\u000d\u000a      Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, and USA). Professors\u000d\u000a      Jones and Nigel Rice were employed at the University of York throughout\u000d\u000a      the period of both projects, Dr Cristina Hernandez Quevedo was a Research\u000d\u000a      Fellow for ECuity III, and Teresa Bago d'Uva and Silvia Balia were PhD\u000d\u000a      students during the project. Key output and findings from the York team's\u000d\u000a      contribution to the ECuity II and III Projects include:-\u000d\u000a    Socioeconomic inequality in health: To what extent do the\u000d\u000a      better-off enjoy better health than the poor? How much do these\u000d\u000a      inequalities vary across countries and what causes the differences?\u000d\u000a      Answers to these questions require measures of health inequality applied\u000d\u000a      to data that can be compared across countries. Jones and Lop&#233;z Nicol&#225;s\u000d\u000a      (2004) developed a method to compare indices of inequality in health that\u000d\u000a      are based on short-run (within year) and long-run (across years) measures\u000d\u000a      of health and income which was used by Hern&#225;ndez Quevedo, Jones and Rice\u000d\u000a      (2006) to decompose the contributions of different factors associated with\u000d\u000a      health inequalities using the European Community Household Panel (ECHP).\u000d\u000a      This showed the existence of \"pro-rich\" inequality in health across EU\u000d\u000a      member states, in both the short-term and the long-term, with health\u000d\u000a      limitations concentrated among those individuals with lower incomes. For\u000d\u000a      many countries, these inequalities in health were shown to be widening.\u000d\u000a      How much of this socioeconomic inequality in health is explained by\u000d\u000a      differences in lifestyles and by living conditions? Balia and Jones (2008,\u000d\u000a      &amp; 2010) provided evidence that lifestyles and unobservable\u000d\u000a      individual heterogeneity strongly contribute to inequality in mortality,\u000d\u000a      reducing the contribution of socioeconomic factors.\u000d\u000a    Horizontal equity in health care: Are people in equal need\u000d\u000a      of health care treated the same, irrespective of how well-off they are?\u000d\u000a      Does the degree to which this is true vary from country to country and do\u000d\u000a      the differences reflect features of the health care systems? Answering\u000d\u000a      these questions requires measures of horizontal inequity in health care.\u000d\u000a      ECuity II research by Van Doorslaer, Koolman and Jones (2004) showed how\u000d\u000a      to decompose measures of horizontal inequity in health care based on\u000d\u000a      nonlinear regression models for doctor visits. The analysis was taken\u000d\u000a      further in ECuity III by Bago d'Uva and Jones (2009) who analysed the\u000d\u000a      factors that determine utilisation of primary care across Europe using the\u000d\u000a      ECHP and latent class hurdle models for panel data. The empirical analysis\u000d\u000a      was extended to study health care inequity in Bago d'Uva, Jones and van\u000d\u000a      Doorslaer (2009). Their findings confirm evidence of horizontal inequity\u000d\u000a      in the use of specialist health care that favours the better-off across\u000d\u000a      nearly all European countries.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43456","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"3895114","Name":"Chile"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Research at York has shaped the analysis required during the appraisal of\u000d\u000a      health technologies undertaken by NICE and the (mandatory) guidance that\u000d\u000a      it issues to the NHS. Since 2008 NICE has issued 161 pieces of Technology\u000d\u000a      Guidance relevant to clinical practice in conditions that are major causes\u000d\u000a      of mortality and morbidity which also place significant demands on NHS\u000d\u000a      resources, e.g., over half of NICE guidance has been in the areas of\u000d\u000a      cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory heath, which, in 2008, were\u000d\u000a      responsible for almost 350,000 deaths associated with over 2m years of\u000d\u000a      life lost and accounted for over &#163;16bn of NHS spending.\u000d\u000a    The NICE Guide to the Methods of Technology Appraisal specifies the type\u000d\u000a      of analysis required in submissions made by manufacturers and independent\u000d\u000a      assessments by academic units (the `Reference Case'). It also specifies\u000d\u000a      how such analysis will be used by the Appraisal Committees in developing\u000d\u000a      guidance about the use of health technologies in the NHS. In 2008 NICE\u000d\u000a      published the updated the NICE Guide to the Methods of Technology\u000d\u000a      Appraisal. The briefing paper for the Methods Review Workshop on exploring\u000d\u000a      uncertainty drew heavily on the underpinning research [see sources 1 and 2\u000d\u000a      in Section 5]. Claxton was invited to present this briefing at the Methods\u000d\u000a      Review Workshop (2007) and participated in the Methods Review Working\u000d\u000a      Party (2007) responsible for updating the Guide. The updated Guide\u000d\u000a      required the use of probabilistic analysis to characterise decision\u000d\u000a      uncertainty as part of the Reference Case. It recommended the use of VOI\u000d\u000a      analysis to understand the consequences of uncertainty and the need for\u000d\u000a      additional evidence to inform the research recommendations made when NICE\u000d\u000a      issues guidance [3, 15]. The Guide informed all subsequent appraisals and\u000d\u000a      the guidance issued by NICE.\u000d\u000a    The NICE Guide to the Methods of Technology Appraisal was updated during\u000d\u000a      2011-12 and a new Guide was published in 2013. The research funded by\u000d\u000a      MRC\/NIHR, which built on other underpinning research, had an important\u000d\u000a      impact on the 2013 Guide. It was presented and evaluated at two\u000d\u000a      stakeholder workshops hosted by NICE (2010 and 2011) which included\u000d\u000a      members of NICE and its advisory committees, Department of Health,\u000d\u000a      clinicians, patient representatives, and manufacturers. Claxton was a\u000d\u000a      Specialist Advisor to the Methodology Working Party, responsible for\u000d\u000a      updating the Guide, and the finding of this research formed the basis of\u000d\u000a      the briefing paper on uncertainty and only in research recommendations\u000d\u000a      (Nov 2011). The 2013 Guide maintained a requirement to use probabilistic\u000d\u000a      analysis to characterise decision uncertainty and continued to recommend\u000d\u000a      the use of VOI to understand its consequences. Importantly, the guidance\u000d\u000a      on when `only in research' recommendations will be made also reflects the\u000d\u000a      principles, considerations and type of assessments set out in the York\u000d\u000a      research [4, 16]. This Guide continues to inform all appraisals undertaken\u000d\u000a      by NICE. The significance and relevance of this research is also evidenced\u000d\u000a      by requests to present the key finding to the NICE Technical Forum (Oct\u000d\u000a      2011), Diagnostic Technologies Appraisal Committee (May 2012) and the\u000d\u000a      Medical Technologies Appraisal Committee (June 2012). Work at York has\u000d\u000a      also informed how NICE clinical guidelines are developed by the Royal\u000d\u000a      Collages [5], technical guidance on use of methods [6] and the House of\u000d\u000a      Commons investigation of NICE in 2012 [7]\u000d\u000a    The research has also had an impact on how publically funded evaluative\u000d\u000a      research is prioritised and commissioned. For example, the MRC and NIHR\u000d\u000a      funded research has included the use of VOI analysis in initial grant\u000d\u000a      funding before committing to funding large scale research proposals. More\u000d\u000a      recently Claxton was invited to present work developed for PCORI to the\u000d\u000a      HTA Commissioning Board (2013) and researchers at York are currently\u000d\u000a      working with the NIHR Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre\u000d\u000a      (NETSCC) to use these methods to routinely prioritise all research topics\u000d\u000a      considered by NETSCC.\u000d\u000a    Research at York has also had an international impact on how uncertainty\u000d\u000a      should be characterised and the adequacy of evidence judged. The\u000d\u000a      international reach of this research is evidenced by the recommendations\u000d\u000a      to use these methods in international guidelines on evaluation of health\u000d\u000a      technologies [8-10], as well as citation and use of these methods in\u000d\u000a      policy documents in Europe and the US [9-11]. It is also evidenced by\u000d\u000a      invitations to present and advise institutions and policy makers (e.g.,\u000d\u000a      Swedish Council on Health Technology Assessment, 2011; Canadian Agency for\u000d\u000a      Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH), 2009; US Agency for Healthcare\u000d\u000a      Research and Quality, 2008) and a European policy network which includes\u000d\u000a      manufacturers, regulators, reimbursement authorities from across Europe\u000d\u000a      (European Healthcare Innovation Leadership Network, 2011, and European\u000d\u000a      working group on post launch research, 2012).\u000d\u000a    The research has had an impact on the methods of analysis used in low and\u000d\u000a      middle income countries to assess the cost-effectiveness and health\u000d\u000a      technologies and the adequacy of evidence through guidance from WHO [10,\u000d\u000a      12] and the guides to methods of evaluation adopted by national agencies\u000d\u000a      in health care systems in South East Asia (e.g., HTAsiaLink region) and in\u000d\u000a      South America (Chile, Columbia and Brazil) [10, 16]. It is also\u000d\u000a      influencing policy formation in global health and the type of analysis\u000d\u000a      required by global funding bodies, e.g., Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation\u000d\u000a      (BMGF), World Bank and Department for International Development (DFID)\u000d\u000a      [16]. Claxton was invited to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF,\u000d\u000a      2011) to present and advise how these methods of analysis can inform the\u000d\u000a      research, development and funding decisions made by the foundation. In\u000d\u000a      2013 BMGF commissioned development of reference case guide for the methods\u000d\u000a      used in funded research. Researchers at York are playing a key role in\u000d\u000a      developing this guide, including how uncertainty and the need for evidence\u000d\u000a      should be assessed [16].\u000d\u000a    This research has had an impact on research prioritisation in the United\u000d\u000a      States where the Patient Centred Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) is\u000d\u000a      using the principles of VOI analysis to inform the prioritisation of the\u000d\u000a      initial $3.8bn allocated by the US Congress for `comparative effectiveness\u000d\u000a      research' as part of the recent health care reforms. Researchers at York\u000d\u000a      have worked with PCORI in developing methods which can be routinely\u000d\u000a      applied in ways that are consistent with the remit of this federally\u000d\u000a      funded body. Claxton was an expert advisor at the PCORI Methodology\u000d\u000a      Committee meeting (Baltimore March 2012) to present the principles of VOI\u000d\u000a      analysis and act as discussant for the `white papers' presented, which\u000d\u000a      also cited work at York [13, 18] . Claxton was commissioned to develop a\u000d\u000a      `white paper' on how these methods could be used by PCORI consistent with\u000d\u000a      its particular remit and demonstrate their application through a number of\u000d\u000a      case studies. This work was presented to the PCORI methodology workshop in\u000d\u000a      Washington in December 2012 [17]. The principles of VOI analysis outlined\u000d\u000a      in this research are being used to inform prioritisation of the many\u000d\u000a      research topics that have been suggested to it [14, 17, 18].\u000d\u000a    The impact was achieved by demonstrating the feasibility and benefits of\u000d\u000a      the application of these methods [10, 11] and long term engagement with\u000d\u000a      decision makers (Claxton was a founding member of: the NICE Technology\u000d\u000a      Appraisal Committee, 1999 to 2010; the NICE Medical Technologies Appraisal\u000d\u000a      Committee 2010-12; and the NICE DSU, 2003-). It also required development\u000d\u000a      of methods relevant to a range of different contexts [12] and\u000d\u000a      communicating insights in a way that was accessible to a wide policy\u000d\u000a      audience, through workshops, seminars and invited lectures around the\u000d\u000a      world; as well publications in more general clinical and policy journals.\u000d\u000a      It also required a number of short courses to be developed and delivered\u000d\u000a      to train analysts from the pharmaceutical sector, public agencies and\u000d\u000a      ministries of health in how to use these methods. The core 3-day course\u000d\u000a      has been running at least twice each year since 2003 and has been\u000d\u000a      delivered to almost 1000 participants in 5 countries across 4 continents.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research at York has had a direct impact on national guidance about the\u000d\u000a      use of health technologies in the NHS. It provided methods that are used\u000d\u000a      to assess whether a technology is expected to be a cost-effective use of\u000d\u000a      NHS resources, how uncertain this assessment is likely to be and whether\u000d\u000a      additional evidence is sufficiently valuable to recommend further research\u000d\u000a      to support its widespread use. It has had an impact on the technologies\u000d\u000a      available in the NHS and the evidence available to support their use:\u000d\u000a      improving patient outcomes; saving NHS resources and strengthening the\u000d\u000a      evidence base for clinical practice. It gives an explicit signal and\u000d\u000a      incentive to manufacturers; informing development decisions and the type\u000d\u000a      of evidence collected. It has had an international impact on how the\u000d\u000a      adequacy of evidence is judged and research is prioritised; particularly\u000d\u000a      in recent reforms in the United States (US) where the principles of this\u000d\u000a      value of information (VOI) analysis are informing the prioritisation of\u000d\u000a      $3.8bn for `comparative effectiveness research'. It has also informed the\u000d\u000a      methods used in low and middle income countries, especially national\u000d\u000a      agencies in health care systems in South East Asia and South America, as\u000d\u000a      well as global funding bodies.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Political","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of York\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"York (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of York","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"Yorkshire And Humberside","UKPRN":10007167}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"4347778","Name":"Baltimore"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a[1] Claxton K.

It rejected traditional statistical methods\u000d\u000a      (whether based on frequentist hypothesis testing or Bayesian error\u000d\u000a      probabilities and credible intervals) in favour of a more general\u000d\u000a      framework, based on the principles of Bayesian decision theory. This\u000d\u000a      identifies when: i) a health technology should be approved based on\u000d\u000a      existing evidence; ii) whether the value of additional evidence would\u000d\u000a      justify further research to inform these decisions in the future; and iii)\u000d\u000a      what type of research is needed and how it should be designed. Subsequent\u000d\u000a      development of this framework identified when the approval of a\u000d\u000a      technology, that is expected to be cost-effective based on current\u000d\u000a      evidence should be withheld until research findings or other sources of\u000d\u000a      uncertainty resolve [3], e.g., when widespread use reduces the prospects\u000d\u000a      of conducting the type of research that would be valuable, and\/or commits\u000d\u000a      (opportunity) costs that cannot be recovered should approval be withdrawn\u000d\u000a      once research reports or other sources of uncertainty resolve over time.\u000d\u000a      Work at York has also established the implications that these\u000d\u000a      considerations have for research design [4] and drug pricing [8].\u000d\u000a    Research at York has demonstrated how this framework for decision making\u000d\u000a      can be implemented using probabilistic decision analytic models (using\u000d\u000a      simulation methods) and VOI analysis. It has changed the way uncertainty\u000d\u000a      about the cost-effectiveness of health technologies is characterised [5],\u000d\u000a      represented [6] and used to inform health care decisions. Researchers at\u000d\u000a      York have demonstrated how decisions can be informed during the appraisal\u000d\u000a      of health care technologies, including when access to a technology should\u000d\u000a      be restricted until further research is completed [8]. This body of\u000d\u000a      underpinning research also provides a means to identify research\u000d\u000a      priorities and the efficient design of subsequent research [7]. It has\u000d\u000a      provided the methodological foundations for a range of diverse\u000d\u000a      applications and further development of methods, most of which has been\u000d\u000a      undertaken at York.\u000d\u000a    This programme of methodological research at York has strong\u000d\u000a      international and multidisciplinary recognition with significant impacts\u000d\u000a      on methods within related and international fields. It has been funded\u000d\u000a      from a number of external sources, including the Medical Research Council\u000d\u000a      (MRC) and National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) methodology\u000d\u000a      programme, which demonstrates its originality and rigour [8, 9]. The two\u000d\u000a      externally funded pilot studies [10, 11] and the funding from National\u000d\u000a      Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) to form the NICE\u000d\u000a      Decision Support Unit, as well as a number of other applications funded by\u000d\u000a      MRC and the NHS HTA programme, demonstrates its significance and\u000d\u000a      relevance. Its international reach is evidenced by the commissioning of\u000d\u000a      research at York, which details how these principles and methods can be\u000d\u000a      used to prioritise `comparative effectiveness research' in the US [12].\u000d\u000a    Researchers at York: Claxton K (Professor, Oct 1989-); Sculpher M\u000d\u000a      (Professor, Nov 1997-); Palmer S (Professor; April 1995-); Griffin S\u000d\u000a      (Senior RF; Oct 2002-) ; McKenna C (RF, Oct 2006-); Ginnelly (now Bojke) L\u000d\u000a      (Senior RF; Oct 1999-) and Fenwick E (RF; Oct 1999-2005).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43703","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"337996","Name":"Ethiopia"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    NATURE OF THE IMPACT: Stern developed dialogues on climate finance during\u000d\u000a      2008 and 2009 with a number of leaders and ministers in key countries,\u000d\u000a      outlining the case for significant funding for developing countries. In\u000d\u000a      June 2009, the UK Prime Minister, Gordon Brown (Brown, 2009: Source A),\u000d\u000a      announced his support for a fund to provide $100 billion a year from the\u000d\u000a      rich countries to developing countries by 2020.\u000d\u000a    Stern worked closely with the Ethiopian Prime Minister, Meles Zenawi,\u000d\u000a      ahead of the UN climate change conference in Copenhagen in December 2009\u000d\u000a      on the development of a proposal to be presented at the negotiations to\u000d\u000a      commit rich countries to providing $50 billion by 2015 and $100 billion by\u000d\u000a      2020, and to establish a mechanism through which to explore potential\u000d\u000a      sources.

A significant\u000d\u000a      portion of such funding should flow through the Copenhagen Green Climate\u000d\u000a      Fund.'\u000d\u000a    In February 2010, the UN Secretary-General announced the establishment of\u000d\u000a      a High Level Working Group on Climate Change Financing, to be chaired by\u000d\u000a      Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles and Prime Minister Brown (later replaced by\u000d\u000a      Prime Minister Stoltenberg of Norway), and including Stern among its\u000d\u000a      members. The Group was asked to undertake a study on potential sources of\u000d\u000a      revenue for the scaling up of new and additional resources from developed\u000d\u000a      countries for financing climate change mitigation and adaptation\u000d\u000a      activities in developing countries. Stern contributed to a number of\u000d\u000a      analytical papers about different potential sources of revenue, which were\u000d\u000a      produced to inform the deliberations of the Group.\u000d\u000a    The Group's final report was published in November 2010 ahead of the 16th\u000d\u000a      session of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC in Canc&#250;n, Mexico,\u000d\u000a      concluding that it was `challenging but feasible' to meet the goal of\u000d\u000a      providing developing countries with $100 billion a year from public and\u000d\u000a      private sources by 2020. The report emphasised the importance of a carbon\u000d\u000a      price in the range of $20-25 per ton of carbon-dioxide-equivalent as a key\u000d\u000a      element of reaching the target (United Nations, 2010: E). The Parties at\u000d\u000a      COP16 acknowledged the work of the Group and incorporated the commitments\u000d\u000a      by rich countries to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012, and $100\u000d\u000a      billion a year by 2020, as well as establishing a new Green Climate Fund\u000d\u000a      to facilitate some of the financial transfers to developing countries\u000d\u000a      (UNFCCC, 2011: F). The 17th session of the Conference of the Parties\u000d\u000a      (COP17) to the UNFCCC, in Durban in December 2011, established a work\u000d\u000a      programme on long-term climate finance, drawing on the work of the High\u000d\u000a      Level Advisory Group on Climate Change Financing, to explore how to scale\u000d\u000a      up the $30 billion fast-start finance provide between 2010 and 2012 to\u000d\u000a      meet the target of $100 billion a year by 2020 (UNFCCC, 2012: G).\u000d\u000a    By the end of 2012, developed countries reported that they had exceeded\u000d\u000a      their fast-start finance goal (CFU, 2013: H). Overall, in the words of\u000d\u000a      Andrew Steer (2013: Source I): `There is no doubt that Lord Stern's work\u000d\u000a      has had a more important impact on climate finance developments than any\u000d\u000a      other body of work. I was Director-General in the UK Department for\u000d\u000a      International Development (DFID) at the time of the Copenhagen climate\u000d\u000a      negotiations ... The commitment of advanced countries to provide $100\u000d\u000a      billion per year for climate investments in developing countries owes much\u000d\u000a      of its intellectual basis to Lord Stern. ... The High Level Commission on\u000d\u000a      Climate Finance set up by Ban Ki Moon and chaired (initially) by PM Gordon\u000d\u000a      Brown [UK] and PM Meles Zenawi [Ethiopia] was, in many ways, an outcome of\u000d\u000a      Stern's research and influence. During the course of that High Level\u000d\u000a      Panel's work Lord Stern was the dominant intellectual leader, drawing upon\u000d\u000a      the results of his research program'.\u000d\u000a    WHY THE IMPACT MATTERS: The potential cost of climate change if nothing\u000d\u000a      is done is conservatively estimated at several percentage points of global\u000d\u000a      income, averaged over location, time, and possible outcomes. The potential\u000d\u000a      global temperature increases that could arise from inaction have not been\u000d\u000a      seen on the planet for millions or tens of millions, of years and are way\u000d\u000a      beyond the experience of homo sapiens. Such changes could involve the\u000d\u000a      movement of hundreds of millions of people and severe and extended\u000d\u000a      conflict. Stern's analyses of potential impacts, and possible responses,\u000d\u000a      have contributed significantly to &#8212; and on key occasions led &#8212; the agenda\u000d\u000a      for addressing the problem.\u000d\u000a    These risks, and how they can be radically reduced, matter for investment\u000d\u000a      reasons (spending now reduces the future costs of climate change); they\u000d\u000a      matter for insurance reasons [J]; and they matter for reasons of\u000d\u000a      distributive justice: `[e]ven if environmental costs were distributed\u000d\u000a      equally ... developing countries would still bear 80% of the burden\u000d\u000a      (because they account for 80% of world population).

These included `enhanced action on the\u000d\u000a      provision of financial resources and investment to support action on\u000d\u000a      mitigation and adaptation and technology cooperation'. In the run-up to\u000d\u000a      COP15, Stern and colleagues carried out research into the required scale,\u000d\u000a      nature and potential sources of such support for developing countries.\u000d\u000a    Stern (1) pointed out that managing the huge risks of climate change\u000d\u000a      would require a reduction in annual global emissions of greenhouse gases\u000d\u000a      by at least 50% by 2050. Firm commitments by developed countries to reduce\u000d\u000a      their emissions of greenhouse gases would be a necessary, but not\u000d\u000a      sufficient, prerequisite for an efficient, effective and equitable\u000d\u000a      international agreement to manage the risks of climate change. As eight\u000d\u000a      billion people of the projected global population of nine billion by 2050\u000d\u000a      would be living in what are today considered to be developing countries,\u000d\u000a      rich countries, given their responsibilities, would need to provide\u000d\u000a      additional assistance to pay for the greater costs of development caused\u000d\u000a      by climate change.\u000d\u000a    Stern`s 2008 study (which was based on his Richard T. Ely Lecture to the\u000d\u000a      American Economic Association and written after Stern re-joined the LSE in\u000d\u000a      2007) estimated that if rich countries delivered on their previous\u000d\u000a      commitment to provide 0.7% of their GDP as official development\u000d\u000a      assistance, at least $80 billion a year extra would be required to help\u000d\u000a      developing countries adapt to the impacts of climate change. Zenghelis and\u000d\u000a      Stern (2) proposed an expansion of existing emissions baseline-and-credit\u000d\u000a      schemes between rich and poor countries, such as the Clean Development\u000d\u000a      Mechanism, which could generate annual flows of $20-75 billion by 2020.\u000d\u000a    Stern (3), which built on Stern (1) and was written for a general\u000d\u000a      audience and published in a number of languages, estimated that rich\u000d\u000a      countries should be providing $130 billion a year in public funding to\u000d\u000a      support both adaptation and the transition to low-carbon economic growth\u000d\u000a      in developing countries, while flows of a further $100 billion from rich\u000d\u000a      to poor countries could be generated by developing carbon markets by the\u000d\u000a      2020s. He argued that the $100 billion in public funding represented just\u000d\u000a      0.3% of the GDP of rich countries, and should be additional to existing\u000d\u000a      overseas aid commitments.\u000d\u000a    Stern (3) also highlighted the importance of carbon taxes or auctioning\u000d\u000a      of permits as sources of revenue that would also create an incentive to\u000d\u000a      reduce emissions. He suggested that carbon pricing should not only be\u000d\u000a      applied by national governments to their domestic emissions, but also that\u000d\u000a      it should be extended to international shipping and aviation.\u000d\u000a    Stern (4), which was published just ahead of COP15, noted that the UK\u000d\u000a      Prime Minister, Gordon Brown had proposed that developing countries should\u000d\u000a      receive financial support of $100 billion a year by 2020, and suggested\u000d\u000a      that for such a commitment to be viewed as credible, about $50 billion a\u000d\u000a      year would need to be delivered by 2015, equivalent to 0.1% of rich\u000d\u000a      countries' GDP.

They have also been\u000d\u000a      widely studied by academic researchers, in part because of the\u000d\u000a      availability of rich data collected to evaluate them. Professor Attanasio\u000d\u000a      has been a major contributor to both policy and academic debate about such\u000d\u000a      programmes; as a result, he and his research have played an important role\u000d\u000a      in the development and design of CCTs benefiting millions of people in\u000d\u000a      Latin America.\u000d\u000a    Examples of the impacts of Attanasio's research on individual CCT\u000d\u000a      programmes in Latin America are described below; the broader significance\u000d\u000a      of his work, however, is suggested by its citation more than 50 times in\u000d\u000a      the 2009 World Bank Policy Research report, Conditional Cash\u000d\u000a        Transfers: Reducing Present and Future Poverty. This influential\u000d\u000a      report shaped the World Bank's policy on providing US$ 2.4 billion in\u000d\u000a      lending to scale up and start CCT operations in 2009 alone [1, 2].\u000d\u000a    Reshaping Oportunidades (Mexico): PROGRESA, which was renamed\u000d\u000a      Oportunidades in 2003 when it was expanded to urban areas, is one of the\u000d\u000a      most successful cash transfer programmes in Latin America and a key\u000d\u000a      instrument of Mexican social policy. The programme now has over 20 million\u000d\u000a      beneficiaries and is widely seen as an effective method of reducing\u000d\u000a      poverty (especially in rural Mexico), increasing enrolment in secondary\u000d\u000a      school, improving the nutritional status of children and empowering women\u000d\u000a      living in poor households.\u000d\u000a    Between 2002 and 2008, Attanasio's work as a member of the advisory board\u000d\u000a      supporting the evaluation of Oportunidades by the Government of Mexico\u000d\u000a      (see [a] [b] and [d]) allowed him to recommend a set of changes which, he\u000d\u000a      argued, would maximise the benefits of conditional cash transfers. In 2009\u000d\u000a      the Mexican government followed this advice in its expansion of the\u000d\u000a      programme to the cities of Puebla and Ecatepec. In particular, it drew on\u000d\u000a      Attanasio's research to pilot a revised grant structure abolishing primary\u000d\u000a      school grants and increasing those supporting secondary school attendance\u000d\u000a      [4]. These changes were introduced in Puebla and Ecatepec, each of which\u000d\u000a      has over 2 million inhabitants, many of whom live in poverty. Since the\u000d\u000a      evaluation had revealed relatively small impacts of the existing programme\u000d\u000a      on school enrolment in urban areas, it was particularly salient to\u000d\u000a      redesign the programme in this way before it was rolled out in these\u000d\u000a      cities.\u000d\u000a    Two versions of the programme, revised to reflect findings and\u000d\u000a      recommendations in [a] and [b], were piloted in Puebla and Ecatepec\u000d\u000a      between 2008 and 2011, alongside a traditional version of the programme.\u000d\u000a      Both of the alternative versions eliminated primary school grants and\u000d\u000a      increased secondary school grants; in one version, however, a further\u000d\u000a      increase in school grants was triggered by academic performance meeting\u000d\u000a      certain minimum standards. New families registered into the CCT in these\u000d\u000a      cities were randomly allocated either to one of these two new versions, or\u000d\u000a      to the traditional version of the programme. In January 2008, Professor\u000d\u000a      Attanasio was invited by the Mexican government and the IADB to advise on\u000d\u000a      the design of this experiment, and to direct its evaluation, which the\u000d\u000a      IADB partly financed; he did so between 2008 and 2010.\u000d\u000a    In 2008, of the 35,000 households included in the programme in Puebla and\u000d\u000a      Ecatepec, about 9,000 were included in the experiment. Of these, a control\u000d\u000a      group of around 3,000 were assigned to the original programme and 6,000 to\u000d\u000a      the two new versions. The evaluation found that the new grant structure &#8212;\u000d\u000a      which added about 15% to the traditional secondary school grant &#8212;\u000d\u000a      increased the attendance of girls in Ecatepec (but not Puebla) by about\u000d\u000a      8%. The results of the study were presented in a report delivered to the\u000d\u000a      IADB and the Mexican government in 2011.\u000d\u000a    The results of the evaluation prompted a significant change in and\u000d\u000a      benefit to the Mexican government's approach to Oportunidades [3],\u000d\u000a      particularly in terms of enhancing understanding of those modifications to\u000d\u000a      the programme that would improve secondary school attendance without\u000d\u000a      significant extra cost [10]. Research was the main reason behind the\u000d\u000a      Mexican government's decision in subsequent years to reshape school\u000d\u000a      assistance programmes [10]. A change in government at the end of 2011\u000d\u000a      delayed the implementation of these modifications for political reasons,\u000d\u000a      but by mid-2013 Attanasio's findings were again being studied and\u000d\u000a      considered by the new Oportunidades administration to inform planned\u000d\u000a      changes throughout Mexico. This is demonstrated by the fact that in July\u000d\u000a      2013 the IADB requested Attanasio's advice on forthcoming changes to the\u000d\u000a      programme. He was invited to meet and advise the new administration on the\u000d\u000a      design and evaluation of all changes to Oportunidades between 2014 and\u000d\u000a      2018 [5].\u000d\u000a    Expansion of Familias in Acciones (Colombia): Between 2004 and\u000d\u000a      2006 Attanasio presented the results of his evaluation of the Colombian\u000d\u000a      CCT programme, Familias en Accion through a series of briefings for\u000d\u000a      policymakers [c, d, e] and officers from the World Bank and IADB. At that\u000d\u000a      time, the Colombian government was thinking of closing down Hogares\u000d\u000a      Comunitarios (HC), a large community nursery programme reaching 1 million\u000d\u000a      children, to finance the possible expansion of Familas en Accion. The\u000d\u000a      evaluation conducted by Attanasio and his team had also considered the\u000d\u000a      impacts of HC [d], finding that it had positive effects on the nutritional\u000d\u000a      status of the poorest young children. Attanasio's research was key in\u000d\u000a      ensuring that, during its expansion phase, the project&#180;s design followed\u000d\u000a      evidence-based best practices and included a solid impact evaluation\u000d\u000a      design [10].\u000d\u000a    In 2005, and again in 2007, the Colombian government drew explicitly on\u000d\u000a      Attanasio's evaluation to inform its expansion of Familias en Accion [6].\u000d\u000a      These successive expansions made Familias en Accion the country's largest\u000d\u000a      welfare programme throughout the impact census period. In 2008 the\u000d\u000a      programme was piloted in Bogota, where the government experimented with\u000d\u000a      different grant structures, some of which were inspired by the advice\u000d\u000a      given in Attanasio and his co-authors' reports. Although these expansions\u000d\u000a      took place before the start of the impact period, the benefits are both\u000d\u000a      ongoing and substantial for the 3 million households affected by them [6].\u000d\u000a    In 2009 Professor Attanasio's close engagement with the Familias en\u000d\u000a      Accion programme led to an important collaborative project (funded by the\u000d\u000a      ESRC, the IADB, the World Bank and DfID to a total of about &#163;1 million)\u000d\u000a      piloting an 18-month stimulation and nutrition intervention to foster\u000d\u000a      cognitive development in young children in Colombia. The intervention was\u000d\u000a      tested in 96 small towns, each with 5,000-50,000 inhabitants, and targeted\u000d\u000a      children aged 12-24 months. Part of its novelty lay in its delivery by\u000d\u000a      community women who acted as representatives of Familas en Accion. The\u000d\u000a      intervention, which was significantly underpinned by the collaboration\u000d\u000a      with Attanasio, demonstrated a remarkable impact on children's cognitive\u000d\u000a      and language development. As well as benefiting the children involved in\u000d\u000a      it (who showed cognition and language improvements of about 25% of a\u000d\u000a      standard deviation of the score), the project increased awareness of the\u000d\u000a      importance of child development, and of the pivotal role that mothers and\u000d\u000a      the immediate family could play in promoting that, even when financial\u000d\u000a      resources are limited [7]. The project was awarded a prize for outstanding\u000d\u000a      international impact at the ESRC Celebrating Impact Awards 2013.\u000d\u000a    This pilot project also made significant contributions to policy\u000d\u000a        discussion, debate and formulation both in Colombia and more widely,\u000d\u000a      including through two large events organised by the research team to\u000d\u000a      disseminate its findings among decision-makers around the world. The\u000d\u000a      first, held in Bogota on 26 March 2012 and co-organised with the IADB, was\u000d\u000a      attended by Colombian policymakers, practitioners and researchers who had\u000d\u000a      the opportunity to discuss the lessons learned from the Familias en Accion\u000d\u000a      example [8]. The second was a conference on `Early Childhood Development\u000d\u000a      and Human Capital Accumulation', held in London on 25-26 June 2012.\u000d\u000a      Co-organised with the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation\u000d\u000a      (3IE), this academic conference included a high level of participation by\u000d\u000a      practitioners, donors, and government officials from all over the world,\u000d\u000a      who discussed how this cutting-edge research could be applied to their own\u000d\u000a      national contexts [9]. Professor Attanasio has also presented the\u000d\u000a      project's results in a number of other forums, e.g. a high-profile\u000d\u000a      conference at the National Academy of Sciences (March 2013) and a webinar\u000d\u000a      for the van Leer foundation (May 2013). Written summaries of the project\u000d\u000a      and its preliminary findings were widely disseminated, generating\u000d\u000a      considerable attention amongst policymakers within and beyond Colombia.\u000d\u000a      This led, for example, in early 2013 to a technical assistance\u000d\u000a      collaboration with the Peruvian Government, facilitated by the IADB.\u000d\u000a      Drawing on their experience and the results of the research conducted in\u000d\u000a      Colombia, the research team has since supported the Peruvian Government in\u000d\u000a      the design of a comparable home visiting programme targeting children 0-3\u000d\u000a      years old, which is a fundamental component of their wider early childhood\u000d\u000a      development strategy (Cuna M&#225;s) [7]. The programme was launched on 24\u000d\u000a      March 2013, and will eventually reach millions of poor children in Peru.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research conducted at UCL by Professor Orazio Attanasio and his direct\u000d\u000a      engagement with policymakers has been instrumental in the implementation,\u000d\u000a      design and evaluation of conditional cash transfer (CCT) programmes to\u000d\u000a      stimulate the accumulation of human capital in Mexico and Colombia.

CCT programmes transfer cash\u000d\u000a      to poor households if they comply with a set of conditions that typically\u000d\u000a      have to do with the accumulation of human capital, for instance sending\u000d\u000a      children to school or bringing them to health centres for growth and\u000d\u000a      development check-ups. The cash transfers are targeted at women.\u000d\u000a    Professor Orazio Attanasio (UCL Professor of Economics since 1995) has\u000d\u000a      conducted extensive research on both the Mexican and the Colombian\u000d\u000a      versions of this programme. This has included analyses of the impacts of\u000d\u000a      CCTs on a variety of outcomes in both countries, from school enrolment and\u000d\u000a      consumption to women's empowerment (see, for example, [d] and [e] in\u000d\u000a      section 3). In 2001, in collaboration with colleagues at UCL and the\u000d\u000a      Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), Attanasio began to evaluate the\u000d\u000a      Colombian version of the CCT programme, Familias en Accion.\u000d\u000a    From 2002 to 2008, Attanasio was part of an academic advisory group\u000d\u000a      assisting the Mexican government with the evaluation and redesign of its\u000d\u000a      CCT programme, PROGRESA, which they planned to expand to urban areas under\u000d\u000a      the new title of Oportunidades (launched 2003). As well as making\u000d\u000a      recommendations about the design of that urban expansion scheme, the group\u000d\u000a      designed and implemented its evaluation. In addition to the general design\u000d\u000a      of that evaluation, Attanasio was specifically responsible for evaluating\u000d\u000a      the effect of the transfer on household consumption and expenditure [d].\u000d\u000a    In [b], first circulated in 2001 and published in 2012 as an influential\u000d\u000a      and heavily cited article, Attanasio, in collaboration with Costas Meghir\u000d\u000a      (Professor at UCL until 2011) and Ana Santiago (a PhD student at UCL)\u000d\u000a      analysed the impact of PROGRESA. They combined the evaluation analysis\u000d\u000a      with the use of a structural model to address the issue of the programme's\u000d\u000a      optimal design.\u000d\u000a    An important feature of PROGRESA was the inclusion of a rigorous process\u000d\u000a      for evaluating its impacts, based on the allocation of its early\u000d\u000a      implementation to randomly chosen localities. In [a] and [b], Attanasio\u000d\u000a      used data collected from an evaluation survey to assess the programme's\u000d\u000a      impact. Moreover, they used that data to estimate a behavioural model of\u000d\u000a      education choices, which could be used not only to assess the impact of\u000d\u000a      the programme, but also to predict the effects of different\u000d\u000a      designs on student enrolment. As such, it could be used to revise and\u000d\u000a      refine existing programmes and devise new ones to maximise their\u000d\u000a      beneficial effects.\u000d\u000a    The research found that PROGRESA's impact was substantial for attendance\u000d\u000a      in high school, but close to zero for primary school, partly because\u000d\u000a      primary school enrolment was already very high. At the same time, however,\u000d\u000a      primary school grants constituted the most expensive component of the\u000d\u000a      programme. Attanasio advised that the programme's impact could be\u000d\u000a      increased by changing the structure of its grants. More specifically, he\u000d\u000a      recommended reducing (or abolishing) primary school grants to free up\u000d\u000a      resources to increase the amount of secondary school grants.\u000d\u000a    In 2001, with funding from the World Bank and the Inter-American\u000d\u000a      Development Bank (IADB), and in collaboration with a Colombian public\u000d\u000a      policy institute and a data collection firm, Attanasio designed and\u000d\u000a      directed an impact evaluation of the Colombian CCT programme, Familias en\u000d\u000a      Acci&#243;n. Results presented in 2004 and 2006 showed that the programme had\u000d\u000a      impacts on children's nutritional status and secondary school enrolment\u000d\u000a      mainly in rural areas, while the effects in urban centres were more\u000d\u000a      limited. This led to the production of three reports for the Colombian\u000d\u000a      government, the World Bank and the IADB that were widely circulated among\u000d\u000a      policymakers. It also generated several academic papers on the impacts of\u000d\u000a      the CCT programme (on school enrolment [e] and other outcomes), as well as\u000d\u000a      other related programmes. These included a paper on community nurseries\u000d\u000a      written with M. Vera (lecturer at UCL) and V. DiMaro (doctoral student at\u000d\u000a      UCL) [c] which shows that the community nurseries had a positive impact on\u000d\u000a      children from the poorest families.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44369","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    In 2011, BIS put forward proposals to reform the competition regime and\u000d\u000a      invited stakeholders to contribute their feedback.

BIS was\u000d\u000a      formally represented in the audience by its senior competition policy\u000d\u000a      staff who were involved in establishing the CMA. The CCRP agreed that the\u000d\u000a      second event would focus on the topic of market investigations conducted\u000d\u000a      by the CMA and the implications of this decision on the efficacy and\u000d\u000a      legitimacy of the new regime, as well as the implications of the new\u000d\u000a      regime on concurrency (i.e., the use by sectoral regulators of their\u000d\u000a      competition powers, rather than the regulation powers, where appropriate).\u000d\u000a    The Round Table 2012 recommended that the regulatory agencies should not\u000d\u000a      only retain their role as enforcers of the Competition Act (e.g.,\u000d\u000a      concurrent competition powers), but also make more active use of such\u000d\u000a      powers. Regulatory agencies (with the exception of Ofcom) have made scant\u000d\u000a      use of their competition powers, preferring to use their toolkit of\u000d\u000a      regulatory enforcement powers to avoid time delays and uncertainty over\u000d\u000a      the outcome.\u000d\u000a    At the time of the second Round Table it was clear that the Government\u000d\u000a      had heeded the earlier advice from the first Round Table: it would not\u000d\u000a      only retain the competition powers of the regulators, but also expect the\u000d\u000a      new regime to facilitate concurrency and ensure that regulators use their\u000d\u000a      competition powers where appropriate as one of its key goals. This latter\u000d\u000a      point was discussed in greater detail in the second Round Table where it\u000d\u000a      was stressed that it would be very difficult for the new competition\u000d\u000a      regime to work properly and act as a deterrent to competition abuse\u000d\u000a      practices, unless this was changed. It was also recommended that clear\u000d\u000a      guidance should be provided to the sectoral regulators regarding both CA\u000d\u000a      enforcement and better coordination with the competition authorities, OFT\u000d\u000a      and CC, in raising and resolving competition cases [5]. These\u000d\u000a      recommendations are clearly reflected both in the final proposals document\u000d\u000a      from BIS (March 2012) and in the Bill and the ensuing discussion of it in\u000d\u000a      Parliament (e.g., see [6] on the strengthening of the concurrency regime\u000d\u000a      by the Bill on the first day of its discussion in the Lords). As advocated\u000d\u000a      in the 2012 and 2013 CCRP events and corresponding summary documents, the\u000d\u000a      Bill, through clause 45 and a series of amendments in the Lords [6], gives\u000d\u000a      stronger powers to the CMA to coordinate CA enforcement work and assigns\u000d\u000a      to sector regulators more explicit duties to use their general competition\u000d\u000a      powers instead of their sector specific regulatory powers. The CMA will\u000d\u000a      co-ordinate CA enforcement work by sector regulators and report on the use\u000d\u000a      of their concurrent powers. Finally, the Secretary of State has been\u000d\u000a      granted a power to remove the concurrent competition enforcement powers of\u000d\u000a      sector regulators such as Ofgem and Ofwat. This may lead to the sector\u000d\u000a      regulators making greater use of their competition powers such as the\u000d\u000a      referral of MIs to the CMA.\u000d\u000a    The Round Table 2013 also stressed the importance to the credibility of\u000d\u000a      the competition regime of retaining both Phase 1 of a merger or market\u000d\u000a      inquiry (performed by the OFT to explore whether there may be a\u000d\u000a      competition problem) and Phase 2 (if Phase 1 finds a competition problem,\u000d\u000a      the merger or market is examined in depth by the CC to establish whether\u000d\u000a      this is the case and if so to specify remedies) as separate and\u000d\u000a      independent when both will be performed under the CMA. BIS's CMA\u000d\u000a      Transition Project Leader contacted us following the event to note that\u000d\u000a      this latter point was one of the most critical and enlightening arising\u000d\u000a      from the Round Table discussion and summary of recommendations and that it\u000d\u000a      would impact on the application of competition policy by the CMA. The\u000d\u000a      decision by BIS to use the CCRP meeting to inform its modus operandi\u000d\u000a      was stated by Lord Currie during the Round Table 2013. He indicated that\u000d\u000a      both he and the BIS team had come to the event in a \"listening\" mode.\u000d\u000a    The panel membership and attendance at both events [7] and [8] testify to\u000d\u000a      our stakeholder dissemination achievement. The City research and\u000d\u000a      consequent reputation in this field had a significant impact on the\u000d\u000a      eventual form of the CMA, especially in relation to the need to\u000d\u000a      demonstrate independence in merger and market inquiries. The CCRP's input\u000d\u000a      was also central in influencing how the CMA will retain and enhance the\u000d\u000a      role of members of the panel of independent \"external\" experts.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research in the Centre for Competition and Regulatory Policy (CCRP) at\u000d\u000a      City University London has influenced extensively UK competition policy\u000d\u000a      and continues to do so. The research has influenced directly the\u000d\u000a      Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) in the development of\u000d\u000a      the new Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 (ERR Act). A process of\u000d\u000a      engagement including two Round Tables chaired by Professor John Cubbin and\u000d\u000a      a corresponding documentary submission, shaped the way in which the ERR\u000d\u000a      Act gives enhanced powers to a unified competition authority, the\u000d\u000a      Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The research impacted on the\u000d\u000a      eventual form of this new institution, especially in its independence in\u000d\u000a      merger and market inquiries between Phase 1 (Could there be a problem?)\u000d\u000a      and Phase 2 (What do we do about it?), which were previously carried out\u000d\u000a      by the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission respectively.\u000d\u000a      The Centre's input into the Act has also been central in influencing how\u000d\u000a      the CMA will retain and enhance the role of members of the panel of\u000d\u000a      independent \"external\" experts.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Political","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    City University London\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"City University, London","InstitutionName":"City University, London","PeerGroup":"C","Region":"London","UKPRN":10001478}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"6167865","Name":"Toronto"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a[a] Cubbin J. &amp; Currie D.

Cubbin joined City as a\u000d\u000a      Professor in 1995 and in 1997 established the first MSc in Economic\u000d\u000a      Regulation and Competition in the UK. In 2005, he subsequently established\u000d\u000a      the CCRP with the aim of developing and disseminating research that can\u000d\u000a      improve the functioning of regulated and non-regulated markets. He has\u000d\u000a      been a panel member of the Competition Commission since 2005 and is now an\u000d\u000a      Emeritus Professor at City.\u000d\u000a    Professor Cubbin co-authored with Lord Currie (Chair Designate of the\u000d\u000a      CMA, which will assume its powers in April 2014) the influential and\u000d\u000a      heavily-cited paper on regulatory creep and regulatory withdrawal in May\u000d\u000a      2002 [a].

This research paper heralded the widespread regulatory\u000d\u000a      withdrawal of price cap regulation, most noticeably by Ofgem and Ofcom,\u000d\u000a      allowing competition to flourish in major parts of the utility sectors.\u000d\u000a      The policy relevance of this paper on the current policy reforms was\u000d\u000a      highlighted by Lord Currie during the 2013 Round Table and is reflected in\u000d\u000a      the emphasis placed in the Bill for the CMA to strengthen concurrency. He\u000d\u000a      stressed that the future of the market investigations was at stake because\u000d\u000a      \"it will be difficult to implement the new ERR Act if sectoral\u000d\u000a        regulators continue to be hesitant to refer cases &#8212; particularly MI\u000d\u000a        [Market Inquiry] cases &#8212; to competition agencies.\" Cubbin's 2006\u000d\u000a      policy review paper [h] points to the absence of regulatory MI references\u000d\u000a      by sector regulators. His 2007 paper [i] examines the role of competition\u000d\u000a      policy, explains its purpose and importance and identifies its\u000d\u000a      beneficiaries, which he shows are not only consumers but also businesses\u000d\u000a      and indeed the economy as a whole, since countries with effective\u000d\u000a      competition policies grow faster that those without. It has therefore been\u000d\u000a      critical for the CCRP to act as an academic\/practitioner forum to examine\u000d\u000a      and inform the reforms process as changes in competition policy have been\u000d\u000a      proposed and then to analyse and comment on how the reforms will be\u000d\u000a      applied in practice by the CMA, when it commences operation.\u000d\u000a    Dr Xeni Dassiou is a co-founder of the CCRP and has been its Director\u000d\u000a      since 2008.

NICE\u000d\u000a      2013's Methods Review specifically refers to the new value set study led\u000d\u000a      by Professor Devlin as relevant to NICE technical appraisal for\u000d\u000a      cost-effectiveness analyses. The UK value sets are accordingly being\u000d\u000a      awaited with interest by academics, industry and decision-makers. Secondly\u000d\u000a      in the UK EQ-5D data based on the value sets will be used as evidence to\u000d\u000a      set prices for all new medicines under Value-Based Pricing which will be\u000d\u000a      introduced in 2014.\u000d\u000a    Examples of the new EQ-5D uses abroad:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The government of Abu Dhabi is supporting a study to establish a\u000d\u000a        mapping, specific to the Middle East, of EQ-5D answers to health\u000d\u000a        valuations for use in HTA decision-making about new medicines. The\u000d\u000a        Health Authority will also require all Arab Emirate nationals to\u000d\u000a        complete the EQ-5D yearly as part of its public health screening\u000d\u000a        programme (Weqaya).\u000d\u000a      Professor Devlin has been working with Alberta Health Services in\u000d\u000a        Canada, which wishes to make routine use of EQ-5D in its health care\u000d\u000a        system.

Ensuring that health budgets\u000d\u000a      produce maximum health benefits for all patients and that services are\u000d\u000a      delivered efficiently requires governments to measure health. The EQ-5D is\u000d\u000a      a widely used questionnaire for measuring patients' self-reported health\u000d\u000a      and it is applicable to a wide range of health conditions and treatments.\u000d\u000a    Professor Devlin's research focuses on how best to translate EQ-5D\u000d\u000a      answers into health valuations (value sets). To put this in context, EQ-5D\u000d\u000a      answers generate health state valuations on a scale from 1 (= full health)\u000d\u000a      to 0 (= dead) and negative values (&lt; 0) are given to states worse than\u000d\u000a      being dead. Professor Devlin's work in this area has produced\u000d\u000a      methodological advances and has influenced health care decision-making\u000d\u000a      (e.g., judgements on the funding of new medicines and the quality of\u000d\u000a      surgeons' operations).\u000d\u000a    Professor Devlin's original research highlighted some EQ-5D data quality\u000d\u000a      issues and yielded the first EQ-5D scoring system (which translates EQ-5D\u000d\u000a      data into health valuations) for New Zealand. It is still used in all\u000d\u000a      decisions about pricing and access to new drugs.\u000d\u000a    This research was further pursued in her work after joining City\u000d\u000a      University London in 2002 (Devlin et al. 2004) and identified ways\u000d\u000a      that valuation methods could be improved and how health valuations equal\u000d\u000a      to 0 (`being dead') are handled (Devlin et al 2005).\u000d\u000a    During her years at City, Devlin's research identified fundamental\u000d\u000a      theoretical considerations related to how health state valuations of worse\u000d\u000a      than being dead (negative values) should be handled. The standard method,\u000d\u000a      \"Time Trade Off\" (TTO), generated problematic outcomes (Buckingham and\u000d\u000a      Devlin 2006 &amp; 2009).

This allowed the identification of\u000d\u000a      the new method `lead time TTO' (Tilling et al. 2010, Devlin et\u000d\u000a        al. 2010) which provides a simple and consistent approach.\u000d\u000a    In 2010 Professor Devlin joined the Office of Health Economics (OHE) but\u000d\u000a      has maintained links with City University London as an honorary professor\u000d\u000a      and active research collaborations with City health economists Dr Patricia\u000d\u000a      Cub&#237;-Moll&#225;, Professor Mireia Jofre-Bonet and Dr Victoria Serra-Sastre.

The conclusions of the World Bank report on Education Reform in\u000a      the Middle East and\u000a      North Africa are also based on Wahba (2008) [3.4]; Drawing on her\u000a      research the report concluded,\u000a      \"the overall benefits from migration seem to outweigh the output loss and\u000a      the cost of migrants'\u000a      education.\"\u000a    Jean-Christophe Dumont, Head of International Migration Division at the\u000a      OECD, says that, `Wahba\u000a      made valuable inputs on `return migration and entrepreneurship' for a\u000a      conference that the OECD\u000a      organised in 2008 with the Italian ministry of foreign affairs. More\u000a      recently, she has drafted a piece\u000a      on `migrants' skills and development' which we have used extensively for a\u000a      policy brief to be\u000a      published by the OECD and the French ministry of foreign affairs. This\u000a      document will be tabled at\u000a      the next meeting of the Global Forum of Migration and Development in\u000a      Mauritius' (November\u000a      2012).\u000a    Through its Network on Poverty Reduction, the Organisation for Economic\u000a      Co-operation and\u000a      Development (OECD) cited Wahba's research in its Development Assistance\u000a      Committee's 2009\u000a      Policy Guidance Note. The policy note drew on Wahba's findings on the\u000a      entrepreneurship of return\u000a      migrants as a key reason to encourage temporary migration. Wahba has acted\u000a      as an OECD\u000a      consultant, advising them on how countries can best maximise the benefits\u000a      of their return migrants\u000a      and the investment and entrepreneurism they bring with them. The relevance\u000a      of her research on\u000a      entrepreneurship and return migration is not confined to one region, but\u000a      extends to all labour\u000a      sending developing countries, as shown in her research being cited, for\u000a      example, in the OECD's\u000a      International Migration Outlook report in 2008 (pp. 197 &amp; 200) and in\u000a      the OECD's 2010 Latin\u000a      American Economic Outlook (p. 107)\u000a    The International Organisation for Migration (IOM 2009, p. 34) used\u000a      Wahba's 2008 research to\u000a      inform their 2009 recommendations on the formulation of bilateral and\u000a      regional agreements on\u000a      migration and return migration of workers within the Arab region.\u000a    Wahba's work was used to inform the UN Institute for Training and\u000a      Research's Global Migration\u000a      Group at the UN Practitioners Symposium in 2010 (p. 3) and the World\u000a      Bank's Migration and\u000a      Development Briefings (Feb. 2008, p. 3), intended for the World Bank staff\u000a      interested in migration\u000a      and development.\u000a    Wahba was invited to give a talk on return migration at the UNFPA\/OECD\u000a      conference on \"Migrants\u000a      Skills for Development in the MENA region\" in Tunis, in May 2013, which\u000a      aimed at identifying\u000a      strategies by public and private sectors in origin and destination\u000a      countries that could enable the,\u000a      utilisation and mobilisation of migrants' skills. She was also invited to\u000a      talk about entrepreneurship\u000a      and investment by return migration, and to co-draft the recommendations of\u000a      the OECD Conference\u000a      on `Migration, Return and Development' in Milan, in 2008. She was also a\u000a      panellist on the Future\u000a      International Migration Research Agenda in March 2011 and was invited to\u000a      speak at a conference\u000a      on migration in the Arab region in Lebanon in November 2011. Her speech\u000a      received widespread\u000a      coverage across the Egyptian national press and online media, raising the\u000a      issue's profile among\u000a      the public. Wahba's research featured in several editions of the ESRC's\u000a      magazine Society Now\u000a      (2012, 2013 and 2014) and her findings on how joblessness increases return\u000a      migration were\u000a      featured on the University of Oxford's Migration Observatory, an online\u000a      resource designed to\u000a      inform public policy. In 2012, Wahba was invited to the World Bank by the\u000a      Chief Economist of the\u000a      MENA Region to present her latest work. More recently, Wahba was invited\u000a      to speak about return\u000a      migration in North Africa, at the Public Policy Day organised by the World\u000a      Bank and the Ministry of\u000a      Moroccans Residing Abroad, in Rabat, May 2013.\u000a    Another example of the impact of Wahba's research is evident in her\u000a      appointment by the Home\u000a      Office to the UK Migration Advisory Committee for three years from\u000a      December 2012. Wahba is one\u000a      of five economists advising the UK Government on migration issues.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Southampton based research has demonstrated to policymakers the benefits\u000a      of temporary\u000a      migration through overseas savings and skill acquisition which contribute\u000a      to the economic\u000a      development of the home country.

Her\u000a      work reveals that temporary migration can have multiple positive effects\u000a      on the country of origin.\u000a      Migrants return with more skills, money to invest and are more likely to\u000a      found businesses. Her\u000a      findings highlight the positive impact temporary migrants have on home\u000a      nations, countering the\u000a      notion that high skilled emigration is a loss to developing countries who\u000a      invest scarce resources in\u000a      financing the education of their people who then emigrate. Wahba's\u000a      empirical research has\u000a      focused mostly on Egypt, where 10 percent of the 90 million populations\u000a      are return migrants and\u000a      money sent by migrants (remittances) amounted to US$14 billion (5% of\u000a      Egypt's Gross Domestic\u000a      Product) in 2011, 20% of which is used for productive investment. The\u000a      impacts of Wahba's work\u000a      are wide-reaching to other developing countries as well, as demonstrated\u000a      in Section 4, and by\u000a      Wahba's on-going work on return migration in Morocco and China.\u000a    Wahba's 2001 paper [3.1] was the first to provide empirical\u000a      evidence that showed overseas\u000a      savings and newly acquired skills increase the probability of becoming an\u000a      entrepreneur upon\u000a      return. Wahba focused on Egyptians migrating to rich oil Gulf states like\u000a      Saudi Arabia. She\u000a      demonstrated that uneducated returnees have a markedly positive impact on\u000a      the economy. They\u000a      return with savings, allowing them to set up their own businesses which\u000a      would not have been\u000a      possible without migration. Wahba found that skills are more important\u000a      than savings for highly\u000a      educated returnees, who use knowledge and experience gained abroad to set\u000a      up enterprises back\u000a      home. Wahba demonstrated that Egypt's return migrants increase investment\u000a      in the country by\u000a      15%, underscoring the importance of return migration to home countries'\u000a      economic development,\u000a      and raising awareness among policymakers of the need to support would-be\u000a      entrepreneurs.\u000a    Wahba's 2003 research [3.2] found that return migrants largely\u000a      invest their savings and skills in\u000a      urban areas. Businesses set up by return migrants are better in the sense\u000a      of employing more\u000a      people and the jobs they provide are more likely to involve formal\u000a      contracts, rather than informal\u000a      working arrangements. There is greater emphasis on workers' rights, with\u000a      return migrants more\u000a      likely to run businesses that provide benefits like sick leave and holiday\u000a      pay. This work highlighted\u000a      how returnees, not only, are more likely to set up businesses, but indeed\u000a      they create \"better\"\u000a      businesses.\u000a    Wahba's 2007 paper [3.3] examined how working overseas impacts on\u000a      migrants' wages upon their\u000a      return home. Focusing on return migrants and non-migrants in Egypt, her\u000a      findings provided strong\u000a      evidence that people who temporarily migrate to work abroad enjoy a wage\u000a      premium when they\u000a      return home. Return migrants earn 38% more than non-migrants. For every\u000a      year they are abroad\u000a      and up to five years, their wage premium increases with the length of time\u000a      spent abroad. Wahba\u000a      has extended this work in 2012-13 showing further that return migration\u000a      benefits people's skill sets,\u000a      as well as their earning potential. She found that migrants are likely to\u000a      return with more skills and a\u000a      greater ability to apply those skills. Her research suggests this is\u000a      particularly true for `educated'\u000a      migrants, as they are able to build on, and develop, their existing skill\u000a      set.\u000a    In an expansion of this research on migration, Wahba in 2013 collaborated\u000a      with Dr Christian\u000a      Schluter, Reader in Econometrics at Southampton, and Dr Govert Bijwaard,\u000a      Researcher at the\u000a      Netherlands Interdisciplinary Demographic Institute in a study that\u000a      examines the effects of\u000a      unemployment on a migrant's decision to stay in the receiving country or\u000a      return home. Focusing on\u000a      unemployment among migrants in Holland, the team found that unemployment\u000a      leads to return\u000a      migration: almost half of recent labour immigrants leave if they\u000a      experience unemployment [3.5].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44542","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"453733","Name":"Estonia"},{"GeoNamesId":"719819","Name":"Hungary"},{"GeoNamesId":"597427","Name":"Lithuania"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"798549","Name":"Romania"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The University of Southampton's research on labour market instruments and\u000a      worker motivation has\u000a      been used widely by the US and several European governments and\u000a      international agencies to help\u000a      shape their economic policies (e.g. Hungary, Sweden, International Labour\u000a      Organisation, OECD,\u000a      World Bank), and has featured in the mainstream media to describe the\u000a      latest thinking about the\u000a      world of work.

In line with the research recommendations, the tax credit has been\u000a      gradually expanded in\u000a      several steps since its introduction in 2007, becoming, in the\u000a      government's own words, `the single\u000a      most important reform... to get more people working and reduce exclusion'.\u000a      The research was also\u000a      used in a report to the European Commission (2010) on `Modelling of Labour\u000a      Markets in the\u000a      European Union' (page 33) to assess the use of active labour market\u000a      policies in the European\u000a      context.\u000a    Further evidence that the research in Kolm and Tonin (2011) has shaped\u000a      government employment\u000a      policy can be found in a recent report from the Economic Affairs\u000a      Department at the Swedish\u000a      Ministry of Finance. Such reports provide detailed analyses of economic\u000a      policy matters that serve\u000a      as the basis for government policy. The December 2011 report titled `How\u000a      should the functioning of\u000a      the labour market be assessed?' highlights the importance of the research\u000a      of Kolm and Tonin\u000a      (2011) in its role for better understanding the role of taxes on labour\u000a      force participation.\u000a    Tonin's research on the impact of employment protection on job tenure has\u000a      been used by the ILO;\u000a      The Head of its Employment Trends Unit, Dr Ekkehard Ernst, says it `has\u000a        proven to be very helpful\u000a        to underpin policy recommendations brought forward in my unit... [the]\u000a        analysis has been very\u000a        valuable in informing our policy discussion on the role of employment\u000a        protection in high\u000a        unemployment rates for young people in Southern European countries.'\u000a      The research has also\u000a      been used in the ILO report, Global Employment Trends for Youth (2010,\u000a      page 19), to analyse the\u000a      impact of the global economic crisis on young people and provide policy\u000a      recommendations and in\u000a      the ILO World of Work Report 2012 (2012, pages 42-43). The research has\u000a      also been discussed in\u000a      the OECD report, Off to a Good Start? Jobs for Youth (2010), to help shape\u000a      a new agenda of\u000a      youth-friendly employment policies and practices.\u000a    Besides the above traditional labour market policy oriented research\u000a      Tonin's work has also\u000a      expanded into the more novel area of behavioural economics, looking at\u000a      workers motivation and\u000a      pro-social behaviour in the context of labour market policies. With\u000a      growing governmental interest in\u000a      policy recommendations in areas such as payroll giving Tonin's work in\u000a      this area has been picked\u000a      up by policy makers from both sides of the Atlantic.\u000a    The influence of Tonin's research on charitable giving and worker\u000a      motivation for instance has been\u000a      acknowledged by the Behavioural Insights Team of the UK Cabinet Office in\u000a      drawing up its 2011\u000a      White Paper on Giving, which sought to renew Britain's culture of\u000a      philanthropy. The same research\u000a      has also been used by the Joint committee on taxation of the US congress\u000a      [p. 36] to evaluate the\u000a      policy related to the federal tax treatment of charitable donations and\u000a      presented to the House\u000a      Committee of Ways and Means (February 11, 2013). The committee on Ways and\u000a      Means is the\u000a      main committee in the US congress whose role is to write tax policy.\u000a    This research also attracted widespread media coverage, with the emphasis\u000a      on gender disparities\u000a      in worker motivation, from 2010 onwards, including in The Independent on\u000a      Sunday, The Daily\u000a      Telegraph, The Economist, The Wall Street Journal, Grazia and on the\u000a      website of Philanthropy UK.\u000a      In addition, various aspects of Tonin's research have been presented to\u000a      several institutions directly\u000a      linked to policymaking, including the German Federal Employment Agency,\u000a      the ILO, the World\u000a      Bank, the Hungarian Central Bank, the Bank of Estonia and the Lithuanian\u000a      Institute of Labour and\u000a      Social Research.

They\u000a      cover wage-setting\u000a      institutions, mandatory social benefits, the unemployment insurance system\u000a      and labour legislation,\u000a      including minimum wage and employment protection legislation.\u000a    Research by Dr Mirco Tonin, senior lecturer in Economics at the\u000a      University of Southampton,\u000a      focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of labour market policies in\u000a      maximising economic\u000a      performance. Tonin began this research at Stockholm University and\u000a      developed and completed it\u000a      at Southampton, which he joined in September 2007. The first strand of his\u000a      work focused on the\u000a      relationship between minimum wage legislation and tax evasion, and came to\u000a      the unexpected\u000a      conclusion that introducing or increasing a minimum wage can actually\u000a      reduce people's disposable\u000a      income [3.1, 3.5]. This is because it is common in developing and\u000a      transition countries for people to\u000a      underreport earnings in order to avoid paying tax on them. When minimum\u000a      wage legislation is\u000a      passed the tendency is to increase compliance rather than go underground\u000a      completely. This\u000a      produces a significant rise in declared earnings at the minimum-wage\u000a      level, but the workers who\u000a      appear to be receiving a higher wage are actually losing income as they\u000a      swap undeclared earnings\u000a      for declared, and therefore taxable, ones.\u000a    Tonin's research into in-work benefits such as tax credits [3.2],\u000a      which are designed to alleviate\u000a      poverty while simultaneously boosting employment levels by creating\u000a      incentives to work was\u000a      carried out in collaboration with Ann-Sofie Kolm, Professor of Economics\u000a      at Stockholm University.\u000a      In-work benefits are increasingly common around the world, so this was a\u000a      timely model for\u000a      understanding their ability to make the labour market more efficient and\u000a      finding the best way to\u000a      finance them and set their levels. This research showed how universal\u000a      benefits could be more\u000a      effective than targeted benefits in fighting unemployment and encouraging\u000a      participation in the\u000a      labour market.\u000a    Further research by Tonin explored employment protection legislation and\u000a      was carried out jointly\u000a      with Sandrine Cazes [3.4], Head of the Employment Analysis and\u000a      Research Unit of the ILO. It\u000a      looked at legislation in areas such as regular contracts, temporary\u000a      contracts and collective\u000a      bargaining to determine their impact on job tenure across the European\u000a      Union. The analysis found\u000a      evidence of a trend in many countries towards shorter tenure among young\u000a      workers, associated\u000a      with a weakening of employment protection laws and the protection provided\u000a      by trade unions. This\u000a      research called for a strengthening of employment protection for young\u000a      people against the risk of\u000a      job loss.\u000a    A fourth research strand of Tonin's work looked at labour markets from a\u000a      behavioural point of view.\u000a      In this context, his core project featured a field experiment into\u000a      workers' motivation [3.3, 3.6]. With\u000a      ESRC funding, Tonin devised the experiment with Dr Michael Vlassopoulos,\u000a      Lecturer in Economics\u000a      since 2007. They recruited subjects from among the university's students,\u000a      targeting equal numbers\u000a      of males and females, by offering them paid work inputting computer\u000a      records. Participants were\u000a      offered the chance to donate some of their earnings to charity in a way\u000a      that allowed the effect of\u000a      this altruistic motivation to be measured. The experiment produced\u000a      evidence that what's known as\u000a      warm-glow altruism &#8212; when helping others confers a sense of personal\u000a      satisfaction &#8212; was\u000a      instrumental in increasing effort by female workers but generally had no\u000a      effect on males. These\u000a      findings helped explain the overall gender earnings gap on the basis of\u000a      gender differences in\u000a      preferences rather than differences in household responsibilities, career\u000a      interruptions, or\u000a      discrimination. Thus, it suggests that policy interventions may not fully\u000a      succeed in closing the gap.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44543","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Ornaghi's research on competition between prescription drugs, and how the\u000a      entry of generic drugs affects pricing and advertising strategies has been\u000a      used by the Department of Health of Cataluna as well as the EU competition\u000a      commission:\u000a    In 2010 the Department of Health of the Government of Cataluna (CatSalut)\u000a      set up a task force to review and provide the foundations of new policies\u000a      for reforming the financing and access to new prescription drugs and\u000a      managing innovation in the pharmaceutical industry. As a member of this\u000a      taskforce Ornaghi's invited contribution involved advising how the\u000a      industry could reconcile innovation with controlling expenditure. This\u000a      intervention and the ensuing discussions resulted in a 2011 policy paper\u000a      published by CatSalut [5.1]. In a letter dated 1 February 2013, Dr\u000a      Antoni Gilabert, managing director at CatSalut, writes that `[Dr\u000a        Ornaghi's] participation in our 2010 Task Force has proven to be very\u000a        helpful to adjust the strategies, performed in both pricing and\u000a        reimbursement commissions.'\u000a    The same line of research has also proactively informed policy within the\u000a      European Union.

In the USA the research has been cited by several\u000a      economists working for the Antitrust Division of the US Department of\u000a      Justice. Ornaghi's findings are referenced in two 2009 studies: one on the\u000a      necessity of issuing new merger guidelines written by G. Werdner, a senior\u000a      economic counsel [5.3] and the other by Professor Michael Katz, a\u000a      former Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Economic Analysis [5.4].\u000a    As the author of some of the first and most exhaustive research papers in\u000a      this subject area, Ornaghi has shown possible avenues towards a fairer\u000a      industry, a more sustainable health service and better patient access to\u000a      the latest drugs and technologies. Ornaghi discussed and presented the\u000a      research to economists in the EU Competition Commission, most notably to\u000a      Professor George Siotis, former advisor to the Commission's Chief\u000a      Competition Economist, Professor Damien Neven. In a letter dated 27\u000a      November 2012, Siotis states that:\u000a    `Dr Ornaghi's research on the pharmaceutical industry has been having\u000a        a relevant impact on the work of economists working for antitrust\u000a        authorities and other public institutions.'\u000a    He confirms that he used key insights and results from Ornaghi's paper to\u000a      prepare for a talk he delivered to the EU think tank Bruegel, and that the\u000a      work, `some of the most relevant in the field', also informed a policy\u000a      workshop on innovation held at the Toulouse School of Economics.\u000a    Most significantly, Siotis was also directly involved in most of the\u000a      antitrust cases to surface during the EU Competition Directorate's sector\u000a      enquiry in the pharmaceutical industry, completed in 2009. He attributes\u000a      `most of [his] insights on competitive dynamics in the pharmaceutical\u000a      industry' to Ornaghi's work. Ornaghi's research findings have also\u000a      informed a policy paper published in 2011 by the Organisation for Economic\u000a      Co-operation and Development (OECD Trade Policy Papers). In an\u000a      acknowledgement of what Ornaghi terms the `depreciation of human capital'\u000a      following a merger, author Nobuo Kiriyama notes that: `While M&amp;As can\u000a      bring about cost reduction by eliminating duplication, and promote\u000a      synergies by unifying the expertise of two companies, the large reduction\u000a      in the number of researchers following a merger, together with cultural\u000a      friction, may hamper innovative performance' [5.2].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research by the University of Southampton on competition and innovation\u000a      in the pharmaceutical industry has had an impact on the pricing and\u000a      reimbursement system used by the Department of Health of Catalu&#241;a when\u000a      assessing the introduction of new drugs and treatments.

According\u000a      to the Department for Business Innovation and Skills, the UK\u000a      pharmaceutical industry, which employs more than 70,000 people, is\u000a      responsible for the discovery and development of more leading medicines\u000a      than any other country, apart from the US. But drugs cost the country\u000a      money too. The UK government is under increasing pressure to sustain\u000a      innovation and give patients affordable access to the best treatments.\u000a    Dr Carmine Ornaghi, Senior Lecturer in Economics at the University of\u000a      Southampton since 2004, has addressed this economic tension in several\u000a      research projects. Starting in 2006, Ornaghi first examined the effects of\u000a      mergers and acquisitions on research efforts and outputs of pharmaceutical\u000a      organisations. This was an area which until then had received little\u000a      attention &#8212; traditionally, antitrust authorities have avoided questioning\u000a      the long-term effects of mergers. Ornaghi's original initiative involved\u000a      matching financial data from large pharmaceutical firms with patent data\u000a      from the National Bureau of Economic Research and the resulting 2009\u000a      paper, [3.1] is among the first and most exhaustive analyses of\u000a      its kind. Results suggest that mergers are rarely as successful as\u000a      anticipated and the effect on research is generally negative. Companies\u000a      may seek to acquire firms with similar technology or product portfolios in\u000a      order to soften competition, which in turn can lead to higher prices and\u000a      fewer incentives to innovate.\u000a    Ornaghi's second paper also published in 2009 [3.2] investigated\u000a      the relationship between how closely two firms' technologies and products\u000a      are aligned and how well they will perform together, post merger. Using\u000a      patent holdings data and the product portfolios of major pharmaceutical\u000a      companies, he showed that merger deals are more likely to be struck\u000a      between firms with related technology and drug portfolios, and that\u000a      mergers may have a positive effect on product development but a negative\u000a      effect on technology.\u000a    The third paper, co-authored with Professors Maria-Angeles De Frutos and\u000a      Georges Siotis of the Universidad Carlos III in Madrid and published in\u000a      2013 [3.3], examined how quality differences in prescription drugs\u000a      shape advertising strategies. It used a theoretical model to illustrate\u000a      firstly that firms with lower-quality drugs benefit more from advertising,\u000a      and secondly that advertising serves to increase price &#8212; predictions which\u000a      are confirmed using a unique dataset of price, quantity and advertising\u000a      expenditures. The finding is that advertising can act as a barrier to\u000a      innovation, and that greater controls on advertising expenditure may free\u000a      up funds for research and reduce the NHS' drug bill.\u000a    The last paper [3.4] studied the effects of generic entry on the\u000a      price and advertising strategies of branded drugs. Laws have increased the\u000a      speed with which generic medicines may enter the market, yet aggressive\u000a      advertising strategies mean consumers will often still favour the branded\u000a      equivalent. These findings call for more effective laws to increase the\u000a      use of generic drugs &#8212; an important issue for the NHS, which currently\u000a      spends around 10% of its budget on drugs.\u000a    "}]

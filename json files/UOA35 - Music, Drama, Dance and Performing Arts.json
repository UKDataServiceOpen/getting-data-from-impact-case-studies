Year,\u000d\u000aredrew a central figure of twentieth-century theatre practice and theory [4]. The project's impact\u000d\u000aranges from enhancing specific skills and knowledge amongst artists and teachers to raising and\u000d\u000aenriching public awareness about Polish and European theatre practice and history [4, 5]. It did\u000d\u000athis in practice and theory, crossing boundaries between the two. Director Richard Schechner\u000d\u000acommented on Allain's Grotowski's Empty Room that theatre practitioners `will use the book for\u000d\u000amany years to come' (email to Allain 14.08.09).\u000d\u000aThe project was shortlisted for the Times Higher Education (THE) Award for Excellence and\u000d\u000aInnovation in the Arts, 2010. In 2009, Allain was awarded a medal for Services to Polish Culture\u000d\u000afrom the Polish government.\u000d\u000aThe impact was achieved through a range of activities, from high profile engagements such as an\u000d\u000aexhibition held at the National Theatre and another that was touring, to focussed practical\u000d\u000aand teacher-training sessions, which are ongoing. Direct embodied impact has extended to over\u000d\u000a600 UK theatre practitioners, audiences, school teachers, school children and theatre enthusiasts.\u000d\u000aWorkshops developed practitioners' skills (including body and voice work, understanding of ritual\u000d\u000apractices, directorial montage) and understanding. Theoretical and practical sessions for\u000d\u000aschoolteachers and school children have helped improve knowledge of Grotowski at GCSE and A\u000d\u000aLevel [6,7,8].\u000d\u000aThe impact can be located in three specific areas:\u000d\u000aTheatre Practice\u000d\u000aThe project had impact on experimental theatre artists mainly through the seven workshops we\u000d\u000aorganised, supported in part by a grant from the Polish Cultural Institute (&#163;1500). These were with\u000d\u000ainternational artists, including former Teatr Laboratorium actors Rena Mirecka and Zygmunt Molik\u000d\u000aand Milon Mela from India, all of whom collaborated closely with Grotowski [5]. The visit of Milon\u000d\u000aMela, coorganised with Organic Theatre, attracted additional funding (&#163;2,500) from Arts Council\u000d\u000aEngland. Such workshops, including Traces, a laboratory led by three British performer\/directors\u000d\u000a(Persis-Jade Maravala, Ian Morgan and Anna-Helena McLean) were a chance for practitioners,\u000d\u000ateachers and students to engage directly with the Grotowski tradition.\u000d\u000aSome practitioners attended all the workshops we held (eg Kindle Theatre, and members of\u000d\u000aParaactive and Zecora Aura) [1,2,3]. Emily Ayres, Artistic Director of Kindle Theatre found the\u000d\u000aproject, `very inspiring...[it] has impacted upon the vision we have had for our work ever since. 'The\u000d\u000aproject was an `[i]ncredibly rare opportunity to train with original and second generation Grotowski\u000d\u000aactors &#8212; Rena Mirecka, Zygmunt Molik, Jola Cynkutis and Ang Gey Pin [...] an embodiment of\u000d\u000aphysical discipline that we had only read about thus far...[the experience] gave us something to\u000d\u000aaspire to in our own practice' [3]. Jorge Lopes Ramos of Zecora Ura has described the work as\u000d\u000a`transformative and invigorating' [1].\u000d\u000aFurther impact was achieved through the involvement of overseas participants in the June 2009\u000d\u000aInternational British Grotowski conference as well as all our workshops, which were for practising\u000d\u000atheatre artists as well as scholars. At our 2009 postgraduate\/practitioner symposium, which\u000d\u000afollowed the main conference, practitioners had a platform to present practically or theoretically.\u000d\u000aOur call for papers received over 70 responses, resulting in the participation of 50 contributors from\u000d\u000aacross the globe [4].\u000d\u000aTeaching\u000d\u000aThe project had impact which is ongoing on schoolteachers and their pupils through a range of key\u000d\u000aactivities including:\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aa `Weekend Workout: The Physical Actor after Grotowski' (26\/27.09.2009) at the\u000d\u000aBarbican Theatre, attended by 20 actors, directors and school teachers. One participant\u000d\u000astated `The experiential understanding has been fantastic' [7].\u000a\u000d\u000aAllain has twice (October 2012 and 2013) led Continuing Professional Development\u000d\u000asessions on Grotowski and a lecture\/masterclass for 200 A level students and teachers at\u000d\u000athe National Theatre. One teacher described Allain's seminar\/workshop as `[e]xceedingly\u000d\u000aunexpected and energetic' [8].\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000aAHRC-funded Public Engagement talk at the Marlowe Theatre Studio, Canterbury as\u000d\u000apart of Lifting the Curtain: Theatre Research@Kent (01.05.2013).\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aAlice Taylor, Head of Drama at a Canterbury secondary school, has commented that the whole\u000d\u000aBritish Grotowski project `enabled me to deepen my knowledge and create visual teaching\u000d\u000amaterials' [6]. Allain is extending the reach and significance of such impact by advising as\u000d\u000aacademic expert on the new Edexcel A Level Theatre Studies course throughout 2013.\u000d\u000aCultural Understanding\u000d\u000aTwo exhibitions, as well as the project more broadly, enriched cultural understanding of Polish\u000d\u000atheatre and Jerzy Grotowski's work in particular. Both exhibitions were organised with the\u000d\u000aGrotowski Institute [4], and were free and open to the public.\u000d\u000aA touring exhibition, Jerzy Grotowski: Theatre and Beyond, was presented in summer 2009 at\u000d\u000athe University of Kent for four weeks, at Battersea Arts Centre for two weeks and then Aberystwyth\u000d\u000afor a week hosted by the Centre for Performance Research. This was targeted at students,\u000d\u000apractitioners and academics and included original props and elements of scenography (boots,\u000d\u000apipes and a wheelbarrow from Akropolis) as well as a scaled down reconstruction of The Constant\u000d\u000aPrince set. On YouTube, a filmed record of the exhibition at Canterbury has received 4,456 views:\u000d\u000ahttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/results?search_query=grotowski+theatre+and+beyond (23.10.13).\u000d\u000aDust , a five-week exhibition of 45 black and white photographs of Grotowski's last performance,\u000d\u000aApocalypsis cum Figuris, took place at the National Theatre in the Olivier Foyer in June\/July 2009.\u000d\u000aThe National Theatre was an ideal platform for the presentation of our research and collaboration,\u000d\u000areaching a wide audience of theatregoers, professionals and enthusiasts. It could be seen by\u000d\u000aaudiences attending events at the Olivier Theatre and general visitors to the building (estimated\u000d\u000a`20,000 viewers,' John Langley, National Theatre Manager [5]).\u000d\u000aThe British Grotowski Project thus generated significant impact across a range of beneficiaries,\u000d\u000afrom professional theatre-makers, to schoolteachers and students, through to the general\u000d\u000atheatregoing public. The understanding and appreciation among these groups of Grotowski's\u000d\u000acontribution to theatre culture and practice has been significantly enhanced by the outcomes and\u000d\u000aactivities of the project.\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aThe AHRC-funded British Grotowski Project has enhanced international theatre practice and the\u000d\u000ateaching of theatre in schools, as well as broadening cultural understanding in the UK.\u000d\u000aThe project enabled the development of new theoretical and embodied understanding of Jerzy\u000d\u000aGrotowski's oeuvre within and beyond the theatre profession, enhancing theatre skills in actor\u000d\u000atraining and directing amongst professional practitioners, schoolteachers and pupils.

The project included an AHRC-funded PhD student Dr Pablo Pakula and a Research\u000d\u000aAssistant, Dr Giuliano Campo, both Kent-based for the project's duration. It re-evaluated the work\u000d\u000aof Polish theatre practitioner Jerzy Grotowski and his influence on British theatre in particular.\u000d\u000aGrotowski's reception has for decades been hampered by a dearth of textual and audio-visual\u000d\u000amaterials, misconceptions about his oeuvre, and limited access in the UK to his `living tradition'.\u000d\u000aThe project enabled direct experience of previously unknown aspects of Grotowski's work and\u000d\u000apractical Grotowski-focussed laboratory research. It reassessed how non-Polish speaking\u000d\u000ascholars, teachers and artists might better understand his work. Its methodologies involved\u000d\u000ascholarly research and publications (foregrounding historical, polylingual and editorial approaches\u000d\u000apromoting the work of Grotowski's collaborators, and European debates about Grotowksi) as well\u000d\u000aas laboratory workshops, exhibitions, a conference and symposia.\u000d\u000aThe research made five main discoveries:\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aIt brought into the public domain new insights including European perspectives, practices\u000d\u000aand audio-visual materials with translations from Polish, French and Italian, broadening\u000d\u000aunderstanding of the breadth of Grotowski's influence in Europe, particularly in Poland and\u000d\u000aItaly [1, 2, 5, 6].\u000a\u000d\u000aThe touring and fixed (National Theatre) exhibitions brought into the public domain rarely\u000d\u000aseen materials from Grotowski's practice, including posters, props, a scaled down set of\u000d\u000aThe Constant Prince, as well as specially commissioned photographs and films (eg of\u000d\u000aBrzezinka outside Wroclaw, home of paratheatre and of Grotowski's influence on Indian\u000d\u000acultural practices) [3].\u000d\u000aIt challenged and realigned familiar interpretations of Grotowski's oeuvre in what are\u000d\u000anormally considered separate phases of activity, and articulated the continuity in\u000d\u000aGrotowski's own processes [1, 5, 6].\u000a\u000d\u000aIt challenged misconceptions of Grotowski as an authoritarian director. The project's focus\u000d\u000aon Grotowski's collaborators, literary manager Ludwik Flaszen and performer\/teacher\u000d\u000aZygmunt Molik helped dismantle these misunderstandings [2, 4, 5, 6].\u000a\u000d\u000aIt highlighted the significance of text and dramaturgy in Grotowski's work. Allain's edition of\u000d\u000aFlaszen's collected writings revealed the complexity of the poetic language and dramaturgy\u000d\u000aused in Grotowski's performances, usually ignored by non Polish-speaking critics. Similarly,\u000d\u000athe Molik book focussed on the richness of Grotowski's voice and text work [4, 5, 6].\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aThe research was undertaken at Kent by Paul Allain: Senior Lecturer (2000-2003), Professor\u000d\u000a(2003-Present).\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"978","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The live performance and the DVD of St Pancreas reached beyond\u000a      the academic community by both enhancing public understanding of diabetes\u000a      and challenging some of the assumptions about the condition. The principal\u000a      user groups who benefited were diabetes sufferers, their families and\u000a      carers, diabetes organisations, healthcare professionals and charities.\u000a      Additionally, stand-up comedy culture &#8212; fellow comedians, critics, and\u000a      audiences as a central part of this community &#8212; benefited from the work's\u000a      exploratory and challenging expansion of the genre's accepted conventions.\u000a    Diabetes sufferers and their families, and the public understanding\u000a          of diabetes\u000a    By July 2013, 292 copies of the DVD Saint Pancreas had been sold\u000a      through the University of Kent. Order addresses show a distribution across\u000a      the UK and some internationally. The DVD was also acquired by the British\u000a      Library, by more than ten Universities (other than Kent), and by Diabetes\u000a      UK. Further free copies have been made available to journalists as well as\u000a      professional comedians. Many of these copies will have been seen by\u000a      multiple viewers.\u000a    The show and DVD were reviewed in The Guardian by William Cook,\u000a      who wrote that despite its `highly unlikely subject for comedy,' the show\u000a      was `a tender and uplifting monologue that's surprisingly funny' [6].\u000a      Furthermore, the DVD received positive responses from specialist diabetes\u000a      publications [7, 9].\u000a    The responses captured in the audience interviews published on the DVD\u000a      itself are indicative of this type of response, and thus of the\u000a      significance of the show's impact. Double also received numerous personal\u000a      letters from parents of children with diabetes suggesting that the sharing\u000a      of experiences was valuable to them, offering a sense of relief and\u000a      validation [1]. For example, one parent comments that the show\u000a      `made me feel less alone...someone else out there \"gets it.\"' Another\u000a      wrote that `Watching Saint Pancreas allowed us to have a good\u000a      laugh with someone who truly understood what living with diabetes is\u000a      really like. It was very cathartic but also made us feel that we were a\u000a      part of something with other families. Instead of feeling that our family\u000a      life was different and we had to avoid talking about diabetes too much, we\u000a      felt more normal' [2].\u000a    The diabetes community: professional healthcare and charity\u000a          organisations\u000a    The release of the DVD and the further dissemination of its underpinning\u000a      research, both scholarly and practice-based, led to an invitation to\u000a      Double from the leading charity, Diabetes\u000a        UK, to write an official blog for their website. Joe Freeman,\u000a      Digital Engagement Manager at Diabetes UK comments in an email to Oliver\u000a      Double (18.10.11) that `reactions to what you've written have been more\u000a      varied and frequent than those on posts from other bloggers... Parents of\u000a      children with diabetes seem to relate well to what you write ... and your\u000a      posts are the most popular on the site' [3]. To end of July 2013,\u000a      30 blogs have generated a total of 15,319 unique views and Double's posts\u000a      have been shared 1437 times on Facebook and 150 times on Twitter.\u000a    Double's activities with Diabetes UK in turn led to invitations to\u000a      perform St Pancreas at key national and international conferences\u000a      and events, aimed at diabetes sufferers, their families and professionals.\u000a      These included the Friends for Life family conferences organised\u000a      by the US-based NGO Children with Diabetes (CWD) in Windsor, UK\u000a      (2010 and 2012), Orlando, Florida (2011 and 2012), and Glasgow, UK (2013)\u000a      [9,10]. Double's stand-up comedy show was also performed at the\u000a      Diabetes Wellness Day in Greenwich, UK (2011), organised by the UK Charity\u000a        Diabetes Research and Wellness Foundation (DRWF), and at the Type 1\u000a      Discovery Evening in London, UK (2013), organised by the leading\u000a      charitable funder of diabetes research, the Juvenile Diabetes Research\u000a        Foundation (JDRF). Through these routes, the show has been seen, as\u000a      of July 2013, by approximately 4,710 live audience members.\u000a    Jeff Hitchcock, founder and president of CWD, explains why stand-up\u000a      comedy in general is a valuable activity for diabetes organisations, and\u000a      the benefit of Double's performance in particular: `Humour makes the\u000a      difficult possible...when you are on stage...we are free from the burden\u000a      of the challenge before us, even if just for the few minutes of your\u000a      performance' [4].\u000a    St Pancreas has also created direct financial charitable benefit\u000a      as each DVD sale generates a donation to JDRF, totalling by July 2013\u000a      &#163;541.60, and an additional &#163;286.80 of donations from ticket sales for the\u000a      live performance.\u000a    Stand-up comedy culture\u000a    The research had an impact within the stand-up comedy community in terms\u000a      of its distinctive and challenging contribution to the development of the\u000a      form. This has been evidenced by, for example, responses from significant\u000a      comedians in the field, including Arthur Smith and Mark Thomas [7, 8].\u000a      Thomas' acclaimed 2012 one-man show Bravo Figaro tackled his\u000a      experiences dealing with his father's dementia with a similar blend of\u000a      comedy and empathy.

It thereby extends in\u000a      a practical form Double's research on the issue of emotion and intense\u000a      personal experience in comedy, which was investigated in his book Getting\u000a        the Joke [1]. In this work Double draws on comic theory,\u000a      interviews and analysis of stand-up performances to investigate how the\u000a      need to elicit laughter from an audience, which defines the form of\u000a      stand-up comedy, has been conventionally perceived as a barrier for\u000a      addressing certain kinds of intense personal experience, such as that\u000a      related to illness. Such topics might provoke ostensibly non-humorous\u000a      responses from an audience, such as empathy and pathos. Contemporary\u000a      comedians Jimmy Carr and Lucy Greeves express a widespread assumption\u000a      about stand-up comedy when they suggest that `emotional pain' is one of\u000a      the `still unacceptable taboos', (Jimmy Carr &amp; Lucy Greeves, The\u000a        Naked Jape: Uncovering the Hidden World of Jokes, London: Michael\u000a      Joseph, 2006, p.188). From a theoretical perspective, certain strands\u000a      within comic theory suggest that emotion and laughter are even inherently\u000a      incompatible. Henri Bergson, for example, argues that laughing requires a\u000a      `momentary anaesthesia of the heart', (Henri Bergson, `Laughter' in Wylie\u000a      Sypher (ed.), Comedy, Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1956, pp.63-64).\u000a    Double's academic research has concentrated on influential work by a\u000a      number of stand-up comedians (such as Richard Pryor, Andre Vincent and\u000a      Mark Thomas) who deal precisely with such material deemed unsuitable, even\u000a      unspeakable, tackling traumatic, confessional or disturbing topics. Double\u000a      argued that this work both extended the emotional range of the medium and\u000a      suggested new ways of developing rapport, empathy and solidarity between\u000a      comic performers and their audiences, as well as suggesting new ways of\u000a      negotiating the risks of working with emotionally intense personal\u000a      material.\u000a    Saint Pancreas tested these arguments in the form of a stand-up\u000a      performance that drew on Double's own experience of being the parent of\u000a      two children with type 1 diabetes. St Pancreas thereby extended\u000a      the original scholarly research in the form of a practice-as-research\u000a      project, which involved analysing the performance and reception of the\u000a      performance in relation to comic theory and the work of the other comics\u000a      that had been the focus of the scholarly research. The show includes\u000a      material that deals directly with intense personal emotional experiences,\u000a      for instance with Double's younger son falling into a coma in a paediatric\u000a      intensive care unit. The central focus of this practice-based strand of\u000a      Double's research was to further investigate the effect of emotion on the\u000a      basic performance dynamics of stand-up. It explored three central issues:\u000a    i. the effect of the nature of the material on the way it was performed\u000a    ii. changes in the performer-audience relationship\u000a    iii. most importantly, the question of humour: would it actually be\u000a      funny?\u000a    In so doing, the research sought to expand and enrich the aesthetic and\u000a      imaginative possibilities of this popular performance genre, `Recalling\u000a      traumatic experiences in a way that was funny without suppressing the\u000a      horror' of them [3]. Audience members who were interviewed\u000a      directly after the show testified to the success of the experiment. One\u000a      said, `You're still aware of how horrible things are, but there's nothing\u000a      wrong with it, it doesn't detract from the terrible situation, just\u000a      because you're laughing' [2].\u000a    A central part of the investigation was the idea of sharing intense\u000a        personal experience, one of three key concepts that emerged from\u000a      Double's research; the others being emotion and empathy [4,\u000a        5]. As part of this sharing of experience, the show then also\u000a      explained various aspects of diabetes to its audience, including its\u000a      physiological causes, its treatment, and the impact it has on families. It\u000a      also tackled some of the popular misconceptions surrounding the condition.\u000a      The research was undertaken at Kent by Oliver Double: Lecturer\u000a      (1999-2006), Senior Lecturer (2006 -Present).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"979","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aThe Arbor premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival in March 2010 and was released theatrically in\u000d\u000athe UK in October 2010, following its UK premiere at the London Film Festival. The film\u000d\u000asubsequently featured in 80 festivals internationally. Within the UK, approximately 8,000 people\u000d\u000asaw the film in cinemas, 169,000 through a Film4 television broadcast and over 5,000 copies of the\u000d\u000aDVD have been sold. The Arbor also reached a large international audience through theatrical,\u000d\u000abroadcast and DVD release, and as an in-flight film showing on all Virgin Atlantic international\u000d\u000aroutes from March-May 2011 through which the film was available to some 1.5 million passengers.\u000d\u000aSocial and political impact\u000d\u000aHosted by Lord and Lady Irvine, and organised by the film's funders, Artangel, in conjunction with\u000d\u000athe pioneering charity Kids Company, the film was screened in the House in Lords in October\u000d\u000a2010. Director and founder of Kids Company, Camila Batmanghelidjh, introduced the film to MPs,\u000d\u000aMembers of the House of Lords and other policy makers. She described how the film revealed the\u000d\u000acatastrophic effects of abuse, neglect and poverty upon individuals, families and the wider\u000d\u000acommunity and how this corresponds with her charity's aim to provide practical, emotional and\u000d\u000aeducational support to vulnerable inner-city children. The Westminster screening brought these\u000d\u000aissues into the political sphere in a direct manner that allowed Batmanghelidjh to show the `visceral\u000d\u000aexperience of what chronic abuse and deprivation really feels like', and to discuss this with those in\u000d\u000agovernment `who don't have proximity to the issues' [8].\u000d\u000aEchoing Batmanghelidjh's testimony on the impact of the film, but describing a very different\u000d\u000aaudience, the nephew of Andrea Dunbar, Richard Dunbar, a youth and social worker in Bradford,\u000d\u000aexplains how The Arbor `made people affected by the issues...understand that what they had to\u000d\u000asay mattered and that people in power needed to hear what they had to say.' Furthermore, he\u000d\u000aattests that the film resulted in significant debate in Bradford around poverty, class and how\u000d\u000a`community is defined' [7].\u000d\u000aImpact on Dunbar's family, the local community and West Yorkshire\u000d\u000aResearch on the film involved personal engagement with members of Dunbar's family, associates\u000d\u000aand other members of the local community over a number of years. The film had a transformative\u000d\u000aeffect on those whose lives it depicted, with testimony from family members and residents pointing\u000d\u000ato the impact the making of the film had on their understanding of the history and social dynamics\u000d\u000aof Buttershaw (the setting of the film). `Being involved in making The Arbor was very positive for\u000d\u000ame,' wrote Ann Hamilton, foster parent to Lorraine Dunbar. `It was a chance to look back, to look at\u000d\u000ayour own life...It helped me get over it, helped me to come to terms with it. It helped me move on'\u000d\u000a[9]. Many local residents conveyed to Barnard the impact the film had on the wider community.\u000d\u000aVinette Robinson wrote that `The Arbor struck a particular chord in me because it reflects the world\u000d\u000athat I grew up in. I grew up on the Ravenscliffe estate in Bradford and my Mum lived on [Brafferton]\u000d\u000aArbor as a girl. As a mixed race child of that era I recognise many of the predjudices that Lorraine\u000d\u000afaced and I was surrounded by the same social reality. I think that the film deals with these\u000d\u000acomplex and difficult issues with commendable honesty.' Richard Dunbar further testifies to this\u000d\u000aparticular effect, explaining that the `reason for this is that Clio spent several years building positive\u000d\u000arelationships with community members, understanding the issues that they were experiencing on a\u000d\u000adaily basis and giving them a voice by communicating their words through the film' [7]. Buttershaw\u000d\u000aresident Natalie Gavin saw her life transformed by the film when she was cast, via an open session\u000d\u000aat a secondary school on the Buttershaw Estate, to play the part of Andrea Dunbar and The Girl.\u000d\u000aShe has been employed in the film and television industry since the film's release, including\u000d\u000aappearances in the BBC dramas The Syndicate and Prisoners' Wives, and has said that `The\u000d\u000aArbor meant everything to me. It gave me the opportunity to show my talent through Andrea's\u000d\u000awords. It was the start of my career' [6].\u000d\u000aThe Arbor directly employed 31 actors and 69 crew members and the services of 23 independent\u000d\u000acompanies were drawn upon, the majority from the local community. The film thereby allowed cast\u000d\u000aand crew to gain substantial experience and obtain on-going industry work, as well as generating\u000d\u000asignificant and sustainable employment in an area facing acute levels of entrenched deprivation.\u000d\u000aDavid Wilson, Director of Bradford City of Film, describes The Arbor as a key element in the\u000d\u000a`Yorkshire film landscape.' When Bradford was established as the first UNESCO City of Film &#8212; a\u000d\u000apermanent designation recognizing that the `popularity and accessibility of film [can be used] as a\u000d\u000amajor tool for regeneration, cultural development and social inclusion' &#8212; The Arbor was one of the\u000d\u000afilms cited in Sydney's bid to become the second UNESCO City of Film [4]. Barnard extended her\u000d\u000acontribution to the local cultural heritage generated through The Arbor by successfully campaigning\u000d\u000afor a Blue Plaque in commemoration of Andrea Dunbar, at her former home on Brafferton Arbor. \u000d\u000aImpact on the UK and International Film Industry\u000d\u000aThe Arbor was discussed and debated widely across the UK and US media by journalists,\u000d\u000abroadcasters and cultural commentators [1, 2]. The film was described by award-winning British\u000d\u000adirector Stephen Frears as `a game changer with intellectual, political and emotional punch...which\u000d\u000ashould inspire a new generation of British filmmakers' [5]. The Arbor won 10 national and\u000d\u000ainternational film awards, including the aforementioned Grierson (the Chair of the jurors, Mandy\u000d\u000aChung, describing the film as `a moving and original film whose courageous creative approach\u000d\u000amakes a lasting impact') and Guardian awards, alongside the Best New Documentary Filmmaker\u000d\u000aAward at the Tribeca Film Festival 2010, and the Sutherland Award and Best British Newcomer at\u000d\u000aLondon Film Festival 2010. It was also was nominated in the category of Outstanding Debut by a\u000d\u000aBritish Writer, Director or Producer for BAFTA 2010 [3].\u000d\u000aThe media and peer interest in The Arbor has benefited the UK Film Industry in a number of ways.\u000d\u000aTabitha Jackson, Commissioning Editor (Arts) at C4, noted that `the critical acclaim the film\u000d\u000agarnered made the argument for backing experimental documentary an easier one to have' [10].\u000d\u000aThe success of The Arbor, her debut feature, launched Barnard's directorial and screenwriting\u000d\u000acareer and paved the way for the making of her much-lauded The Selfish Giant (2013). Developed\u000d\u000aand backed by the BFI Film Fund and Film4 and released by the UK's leading independent\u000d\u000adistributor, Artificial Eye, the film won the Europa Cinemas' Best European Film Award at the\u000d\u000aCannes Film Festival, after playing as part of Directors' Fortnight, and is now on international\u000d\u000arelease. Barnard has explained in interviews how The Selfish Giant `grew out of The Arbor,' with\u000d\u000aboth films set and shot in Buttershaw and surrounding areas and dealing with issues around\u000d\u000aextreme socio-economic deprivation. The Selfish Giant had a budget of &#163;1.5m, with a cast of over\u000d\u000a30 listed actors, many drawn from the local community, including the two leads, and a production\u000d\u000acrew of 90 industry professionals. All of this activity and employment arose directly as a result of\u000d\u000aThe Arbor and as such the film has improved the human and capital infrastructure of the UK film\u000d\u000aindustry by creating sustainable employment and wider prospects for numerous individuals.\u000d\u000aTo conclude, the production of The Arbor had multiple impacts at individual, community and\u000d\u000aindustry level. At individual level, the film enriched the lives of those directly involved in the film. At\u000d\u000acommunity level, the film created sustainable employment and furthered community cohesion, self-esteem and self-confidence. At industry level, both national and international, the film contributed\u000d\u000ato both the level of physical and human capital investment in the industry, as well as contributing to\u000d\u000athe sustained viability of the film industry. Not least, through its impact on its audience, its\u000d\u000aoutstanding critical acclaim, and its exploration of important societal challenges, The Arbor has\u000d\u000amade a powerful and significant contribution to UK cultural life.\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aConceived, directed and edited by Clio Barnard, The Arbor (2010) explores the life, work, and\u000d\u000alegacy of the playwright Andrea Dunbar.

The film focuses on Lorraine Dunbar, one of Andrea\u000d\u000aDunbar's daughters, tracing the development of life on the Buttershaw Estate in Bradford (where\u000d\u000aAndrea Dunbar was raised and the setting for her plays) across a thirty-year period, through the\u000d\u000alives of the two women and their families. Research on the film was supported by an AHRC\u000d\u000aResearch Leave Award in 2009.\u000d\u000aBarnard's practice-as-research has a sustained focus on the relationship between the norms of\u000d\u000afictional and documentary filmmaking, a question she has pursued in video works, installations,\u000d\u000aand films. In The Arbor, one of the principal strategies pursued by Barnard involves the careful\u000d\u000acombination of audio interviews with the subjects of the film, with shots of the subjects played by\u000d\u000aactors, often situated in imaginary or remembered spaces (rather than the spaces in which the\u000d\u000ainterviews took place). The film thereby fuses, through meticulous lip-synching, a documentary\u000d\u000arecord of real persons recounting actual events with partly fictionalized visual representations. In\u000d\u000athis way The Arbor invites spectators to be more conscious of the fictional elements woven into\u000d\u000adocumentary films.\u000d\u000aDunbar's experiences on the Buttershaw Estate were articulated in her plays, including her first\u000d\u000aplay The Arbor (1980), as well as Rita, Sue and Bob Too (1982), and Shirley (1986), readings of\u000d\u000awhich, directed by Barnard, were performed at the Young Vic immediately following the release of\u000d\u000aBarnard's film [3]. Dunbar's The Arbor was performed on Brafferton Arbor [1] &#8212; the street on which\u000d\u000aDunbar's family lived, and the inspiration for the title of her play &#8212; during the filming of Barnard's\u000d\u000aThe Arbor, and parts of the performance were incorporated into the film.\u000d\u000aIn 2000, Max Stafford-Clark &#8212; the Royal Court director who had nurtured Dunbar &#8212; commissioned\u000d\u000aRobin Soans to write a new work on the Buttershaw Estate. Soans' play, A State Affair, which\u000d\u000afocussed on the effects of cheap heroin on the estate, was a work of `verbatim theatre,' harvesting\u000d\u000adramatic material from transcribed interviews with Dunbar's family and associates. Barnard's The\u000d\u000aArbor was conceived as a third work, creating an informal trilogy of representations of Buttershaw,\u000d\u000atracking community life and social change &#8212; as well as the lives of particular individuals &#8212; over a\u000d\u000athirty-year period. In adapting Soans' verbatim method to the context of filmmaking, Barnard's new\u000d\u000awork was designed to reflect on the history of Buttershaw over this period; on the impact of the\u000d\u000aearlier representations on the lives of those living on the estate; and on the manner of the estates'\u000d\u000arepresentation across the three works in the `trilogy'. Barnard's own reflections on the research\u000d\u000aoutcomes of the project were the subject of a presentation at the Slade and her MeCCSA ((Media,\u000d\u000aCommunication and Cultural Studies Association) plenary presentation in 2012 [4, 5].\u000d\u000aThe research was undertaken at Kent by Clio Barnard: Lecturer (2002-2006), Reader (2006-Present).\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"981","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    We have evidence of impact from:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      testimonials by parents and professionals\u000d\u000a      changes in the curriculum at a National Autistic Society flagship\u000d\u000a        school\u000d\u000a      invitations to present on the project regionally, nationally and\u000d\u000a        internationally\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Imagining Autism's most significant impact at this stage is upon the\u000d\u000a      individual participants (22 in all), in some cases transforming lives: `He\u000d\u000a      has gained in his imagination, he is talking more, commenting on\u000d\u000a      everything. He is identifying emotions, and naming them. He gave me a kiss\u000d\u000a      and a cuddle which is very rare. He is reasoning things out &#8212; we had a\u000d\u000a      conversation for 15 minutes for the first time.' Strikingly, some of the\u000d\u000a      testimony revealing these benefits was given before the parent was aware\u000d\u000a      of the project sessions: `He really floored X and I last night with this\u000d\u000a      communication!! He talked loads and in ways we had never heard him before!\u000d\u000a      Are you doing something new at school with him?' [7].\u000d\u000a    Change in an individual child informs and influences the thinking of\u000d\u000a      carers, teachers, families, peers and professionals. This research into\u000d\u000a      the language and culture of a minority group, moreover, has provided its\u000d\u000a      members with self-awareness and new modes of imaginative self- expression\u000d\u000a      [3]. The Assistant Educational Psychologist at The Helen Allison\u000d\u000a      School, Kent (National Autistic Society) attests to the changed\u000d\u000a        cultural values in the school and the students' enhanced capacities:\u000d\u000a      `Imagining Autism is a unique and captivating intervention that promoted\u000d\u000a      the well-being and self-confidence of participating students, all\u000d\u000a      of whom have presented noticeable improvements in their communication,\u000d\u000a      interaction and imaginative play skills.' Participants have become more\u000d\u000a      accepting of other students in their personal space, more responsive to\u000d\u000a      others in the play environments, and more attentive to the consequences of\u000d\u000a      their own gestures. The Assistant Educational Psychologist also notes how\u000d\u000a      peers have benefited: `The pretend play from the pod has transferred to\u000d\u000a      the playground... [the children] have also initiated games together and\u000d\u000a      with other peers...in regular pretend play' [5]. The Consultant\u000d\u000a      Community Paediatrician at the Children's Assessment Centre, Kent and\u000d\u000a      Canterbury Hospital, noted that some parents of the children in the study\u000d\u000a      have seen `their children do things in the environment [created by the\u000d\u000a      project] that they have never seen before,' and that `some [of the\u000d\u000a      children] have become more communicative' [8].\u000d\u000a    Parents testify to the positive impact on the family: `Thank you all so\u000d\u000a      much for what you did, I don't know how to put into words what it has done\u000d\u000a      for not only Z but for all of us' [7]. The Assistant\u000d\u000a      Educational Psychologist at The Helen Allison School similarly notes that\u000d\u000a      the `benefits experienced by the students [have] also positively\u000d\u000a      influenced their families at home, as well as their peers and educators at\u000d\u000a      Helen Allison School' [5].\u000d\u000a    Imagining Autism has changed the design and delivery of the NAS\u000d\u000a      Curriculum at Helen Allison School. The educational psychology team now\u000d\u000a      recognizes that students can `creatively lead their own narrative with\u000d\u000a      increasing freedom each week.' The team also understands the `value of\u000d\u000a      reinforcing imagination through intensive interactions between modelling\u000d\u000a      and replication, as well as providing reflective time for students to\u000d\u000a      process and instinctively choose how they wish to explore independently.'\u000d\u000a      The school is promoting personal and professional development `to learn\u000d\u000a      about the techniques used that could be incorporated into everyday\u000d\u000a      learning approaches,' stating that `we... wish to incorporate the\u000d\u000a      drama-based techniques with our approaches to learning' [5]. This\u000d\u000a      influence was extended regionally when the research team were\u000d\u000a      invited to present at an NAS consortium day (17\/10\/12) for staff training\u000d\u000a      in schools for profound, special and complex needs. 15 participants\u000d\u000a      representing schools in the South East region were trained in our\u000d\u000a      participatory and sensory approaches.\u000d\u000a    A changed understanding of `well-being' drives policy in care, education\u000d\u000a      and treatment. The reported success of the project led to an invitation to\u000d\u000a      participate in the NAS's annual professional conference (6\/3\/13). With 650\u000d\u000a      delegates this is one of the major platforms for UK policy development\u000d\u000a        and debate on autism and special needs. Richard Mills, Director of\u000d\u000a      Research at the NAS, met the project team at this conference. Subsequently\u000d\u000a      Jacqui Ashton-Smith, Executive Principal NAS has facilitated a tour of\u000d\u000a      seven NAS schools in the UK by the project team to train teaching and\u000d\u000a      caring staff in the Imagining Autism approach.\u000d\u000a    The work has reached out regionally into health settings and the NHS, via\u000d\u000a      local diagnostic services. The Consultant Community Paediatrician at the\u000d\u000a      Children's Assessment Centre, Kent and Canterbury Hospital, a member of\u000d\u000a      the Imagining Autism Advisory Board, has pioneered the Imagining Autism\u000d\u000a      approach in diagnostic services and estimates that this has already\u000d\u000a      benefited approximately 150 children per year presenting for\u000d\u000a      diagnosis at her clinic. She comments: `the project has shown that use of\u000d\u000a      these experimental environments can help autistic children to show skills\u000d\u000a      that are not apparent in clinics or classrooms.' The project enabled her\u000d\u000a      to form `a more detailed picture' of participating children's needs. The\u000d\u000a      project has `highlighted the need to consider all avenues to assess\u000d\u000a      children so that we have a really clear picture of autistic children's\u000d\u000a      abilities and...identify how they may be supported at school and at home'\u000d\u000a      [8]. She has shared these findings with between 15 and 20 medical\u000d\u000a      specialists in the East Kent region.\u000d\u000a    To summarise, Imagining Autism has resulted in significant local and\u000d\u000a      regional changes in attitudes and practice in both education and health\u000d\u000a      that are now creating national impact. These changes have already had a\u000d\u000a      significant, beneficial impact on the individual children and families\u000d\u000a      involved in the project. To conclude, in the words of the Assistant\u000d\u000a      Educational Psychologist at Helen Allison School: `we can easily envisage\u000d\u000a      Imagining Autism positively influencing the lives of many more individuals\u000d\u000a      impacted by autism across national and international services' [5].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The AHRC-funded project `Imagining Autism' has had a significant, and in\u000d\u000a      some cases life-changing, impact on the participants and their families,\u000d\u000a      as well as on educational psychologists, charities and experts working in\u000d\u000a      the fields of autism and cognitive functioning.

Witnesses to the work, including\u000d\u000a      health and education professionals, have been consistently surprised by\u000d\u000a      the children's responses to the environments. These were not based on the\u000d\u000a      principle of low arousal, but were highly sensory, stimulating and\u000d\u000a      child-centred, giving the participants creative autonomy as `co-producers'\u000d\u000a      in the performance activities. Not only were the children's tolerance\u000d\u000a      levels much higher than expected, there were significant benefits (changes\u000d\u000a      in behaviour with gains in communication and language) suggesting that\u000d\u000a      traditional pedagogical approaches might have to be rethought.\u000d\u000a    Research Findings\u000d\u000a    Evidence has emerged from the data provided by parents and teachers\u000d\u000a      (using traditional methodologies of questionnaires, diaries and\u000d\u000a      transcribed interviews) to indicate that the methods result in positive\u000d\u000a      change, ameliorating the triad of impairments through reported gains in\u000d\u000a      language, communicative intent, social interaction and imaginative play. A\u000d\u000a      fluid, child-led method of performance, giving the child an autonomy that\u000d\u000a      is rare in current practice in any sphere (education, arts or health) has\u000d\u000a      been developed [1, 3, 4]. The research has also led to new\u000d\u000a      understanding of the imagination in autism and how this is differently\u000d\u000a      inflected compared to neurotypical children. The evidence-based work\u000d\u000a      (using case studies from Imagining Autism) was strongly endorsed by peer\u000d\u000a      reviewers for the Interdisciplinary Science Reviews article [2].\u000d\u000a      Moreover this person-centred, interactive method has much wider\u000d\u000a      application beyond school settings (eg home and clinic) and beyond autism\u000d\u000a      for other conditions involving atypical cognitive functioning (eg\u000d\u000a      dementia). Finally, through the interdisciplinary team the project\u000d\u000a      challenged paradigms of knowledge through interaction between science and\u000d\u000a      art, developing new methodologies for evaluating qualitative material from\u000d\u000a      arts research.

Her work is also influential in Holocaust Studies and\u000d\u000aMoving Image Art practices. The significance of Cowie's research for curriculum design\u000d\u000ainternationally is evident in courses from Brown University, Massachusetts College of Art and\u000d\u000aDesign, New York University, Temple University, and the University of Texas (USA); York\u000d\u000aUniversity (Canada); the University of Bilkent (Turkey); and Monash University (Australia) [1].\u000d\u000aRecording Reality is currently being translated into Chinese.\u000d\u000aCuratorial practice\u000d\u000aThe reach of Cowie's research is further evident in the diverse ways that curators have used\u000d\u000aCowie's ideas to inform their understanding of documentary. Hitomi Hasegawa, a curator for the\u000d\u000aon-line project space Frame, draws on Cowie's work on documentary and spectacle to explore the\u000d\u000acomputer as peep show [2]. Rattanamol Singh Johal places his discussion of his curatorial practice\u000d\u000ain the context of Cowie's argument that `Documentary as installation in the gallery disturbs the\u000d\u000acategories of both \"art\" and \"documentary\"' [3].\u000d\u000aArtists' film and video\u000d\u000aThe cultural significance of Cowie's impact is visible in her creative dialogues with a number of\u000d\u000ainternational filmmakers and multi-media artists. Through these exchanges, Cowie's research has\u000d\u000aenabled these artists to gain new understanding about documentary art, enriching and modifying\u000d\u000atheir aesthetic and political strategies.\u000d\u000aA key theme of Cowie's work is a concern with documenting the experience of trauma and\u000d\u000aviolence. Cowie has a long-established dialogue around these themes with Serbian artist Milica\u000d\u000aTomi&amp;cacute;, who has exhibited in (among other places) New York, Sydney, London, Venice, Vienna,\u000d\u000aand Moscow. Their dialogue brings to public attention debates related to political violence, memory\u000d\u000aand trauma. Tomi&amp;cacute; states: `Elizabeth's work as a film theorist, intellectual and educator has had the\u000d\u000amost formative influence on my work. Elizabeth's work...not only break[s] new ground in my\u000d\u000aunderstanding of film and art, but...our intensive and continuing discussion [has] helped me to\u000d\u000aunderstand and revisit the complex relation[s] between art, psychoanalysis, politics, and media.'\u000d\u000aTomi&amp;cacute; further comments that Cowie `is a kind of intellectual who has no fear to go far beyond\u000d\u000aacademic understanding in relation to art practice and the role of the artist;' she also notes the\u000d\u000asignificance of Cowie's work in `stimulating...my wider artistic and intellectual community.' Tomi&amp;cacute;\u000d\u000ahas discussed in particular the `direct influence' of Cowie's theories on her 2012 piece, Four Faces\u000d\u000aof Omarska [4].\u000d\u000aViolence and memory is also taken up in Cowie's dialogue with Spanish artist Juan delGardo.\u000d\u000aThis conversation developed from her early engagement with delGardo's photographic project `The\u000d\u000aWounded Image,' and her later DVD commentary for delGardo's Who Are You Entertaining To?\u000d\u000apresented at his exhibition in Colombia (2009). delGardo writes: `I came to a deeper\u000d\u000aunderstanding of my photographic and film practice through Elizabeth's subtle articulation of what\u000d\u000awas present as performance in my work. Our discussions have enriched my work, and her\u000d\u000arecognition of what I have been seeking to achieve in my art in relation to trauma and disability, as\u000d\u000awell as to space and place, has been especially encouraging, and continues to resonate in my\u000d\u000awork' [5]. delGardo notes the continuing influence of Cowie's ideas on his works Fluctuations in\u000d\u000aTime (2011) and Sailing Out of Grain (2013).\u000d\u000aGreek filmmaker Giorgos Kravaritis verifies the influence of Cowie's thought on aesthetics and\u000d\u000apolitical documentary in his experimental documentary `essay' Dokime (2013), which invites\u000d\u000aviewers to reflect on the veracity of documentary films. Kravaritis' approach to the reliability and\u000d\u000atruthfulness of documentary filmmaking is directly inspired by Cowie's book Recording Reality, and\u000d\u000awas further shaped through detailed feedback from Cowie during the editing process. He writes\u000d\u000athat `a big part of my thinking on documentary owes much to [Cowie's] research. [Her] work was\u000d\u000avery influential for the film's chapter \"on ideology\"' [6].\u000d\u000aCowie's long-standing research into spectatorship and political engagement informed her\u000d\u000aexchanges with the internationally-exhibited multi-media artist Adam Chodzko during his AHRC\u000d\u000aCreative Arts Fellowship at Kent. Cowie's research provides an important part of the intellectual\u000d\u000aunderpinning to Chodzko's artworks. Chodzko writes that Cowie's understanding of art practice\u000d\u000aand her enthusiasm for his project, mixed with her critical challenges, was `very important to [him]\u000d\u000aduring [the] Fellowship' in helping to develop his practice and in deepening his understanding of\u000d\u000aidentification and fantasy, concepts especially relevant to Chodzko's The Pickers (2009). More\u000d\u000agenerally Chodzko notes the continuing influence on his work of Cowie's research on `art\u000d\u000adocumentary's engagement with the social and the political' [7].\u000d\u000aOf her productive dialogue with Cowie, award-winning filmmaker Clio Barnard writes that `Her\u000d\u000aideas [about Dark Mirror and Road Race] were an inspiration, encouraging me to develop further\u000d\u000amy formal interests in performance and in pushing the boundaries of documentary, as well as my\u000d\u000apersonal interest in the idea of the displaced voice through re-enactment' [8]. Addressing how\u000d\u000aCowie enriched her filmmaking, Barnard continues: `The Arbor benefited directly from [Cowie's]\u000d\u000aintellectual rigour and...generosity in imparting...theoretical ideas about documentary...guiding the\u000d\u000apractice as research...To discuss with and learn from someone with such a range of understanding\u000d\u000aabout documentary was very supportive and stimulating' [8]. Dark Mirror and Road Race were\u000d\u000aformative in the development of The Arbor (2010), an innovative film that explored re-enactments\u000d\u000aof the displaced voice [see case study c: Making Films and Changing Lives].\u000d\u000aIn summary, Cowie's considerable cultural influence is built on a substantial body of research\u000d\u000acentral to the study of documentary internationally. Its impact is evident in HE curricula on\u000d\u000adocumentary, fiction and non-fiction, Holocaust Studies, and moving image art practice, and in the\u000d\u000apractice of curators, artists and filmmakers.\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aElizabeth Cowie's scholarship centres on the intersections of art, politics and the cinema.

Consequently anxiety\u000d\u000amay arise about how real, how truthful, documentary can be, leading to a desire for the real that is\u000d\u000aalways failed by the representation [1, 4, 5].\u000d\u000a(b) The psychological relationship of the spectator &#8212; and filmmaker &#8212; to recorded sounds and\u000d\u000aimages. The spectacle of recorded actuality was a key attraction of early silent films, and Cowie's\u000d\u000aresearch shows that this continues to be central to cinematic pleasure. Documentary film engages\u000d\u000athe spectator in the everyday and the extraordinary, producing a desire to know, a curiosity about\u000d\u000athe world. As the spectator is addressed by documentary characters, the spectator learns about\u000d\u000athem and with them, empathizing and identifying with them. Cowie produces new insights into how\u000d\u000ainvestigative documentaries as well as `reality tv' shows engage viewers emotionally [1, 2, 4].\u000d\u000a(c) Actuality as art. John Grierson argued that documentary is the `creative treatment of actuality,'\u000d\u000aan aesthetic project in which showing and talking about reality engage us in a process of `coming\u000d\u000ato know' about it. Cowie complicates this perspective on documentary film. She argues that film's\u000d\u000aability to elide times and spaces transforms the documentary event into an `uncanny' experience &#8212;\u000d\u000asomething at once familiar and strange, knowable and yet elusive. `Coming to know' thus does not\u000d\u000aonly involve a simple comprehension of what is shown and heard, but a recognition of what is\u000d\u000aunseen and unheard as well. Cowie shows how documentary filmmaking evokes the uncanny,\u000d\u000acreating 'spectres of the real.' In the gallery and on film, and in the documentary project within\u000d\u000asurrealism in particular, the uncanny is apprehended in the blank spaces and silences of history\u000d\u000aand subjectivity [1, 3, 5].\u000d\u000aCowie questions how documentary reality emerges, and how we are engaged by it. She reaffirms\u000d\u000adocumentary film's central place in cinema, challenging received ideas about its form while\u000d\u000adeveloping a new understanding of the spectator's relationship to the realities that documentary\u000d\u000afilms seek to represent.\u000d\u000aThe research was undertaken at Kent by Elizabeth Cowie: Lecturer (1981-1992), Senior Lecturer\u000d\u000a(1992-1998), Reader (1998-2005), Professor (2005-Present).\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"1883","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Scientific Impact\u000d\u000a    Integra Live is the first large-scale publicly-funded open source\u000d\u000a      software environment for interactive music production developed through\u000d\u000a      rigorous testing in artistic practice. The project embedded a design-led\u000d\u000a      philosophy with a strong HCI emphasis from the outset, making Integra Live\u000d\u000a      unique in the field of academic software. This attention to user\u000d\u000a      experience generated benefits well beyond contemporary music circles,\u000d\u000a      resulting in use-cases as diverse as brainwave-based music control and \u000d\u000a        audio processing for digital DJ setups.\u000d\u000a    Integra Live has received over 12,000 downloads worldwide since its\u000d\u000a      release in July 2010. The software has been featured on Brazilian software\u000d\u000a      site Baixaki\u000d\u000a      and high profile music technology blogs including Synthtopia.\u000d\u000a      It has been presented at key music research conferences including NIME\u000d\u000a      2009, 2011; ICMC 2007, 2009, 2011; EMS 2011, and published in\u000d\u000a      peer-reviewed journals (Organised Sound 2013).

This has given them unprecedented control\u000d\u000a      over artistic results, with the Chief Producer of the BBC Symphony\u000d\u000a      Orchestra highlighting that Integra's research `vastly reduced set up\u000d\u000a      times and eliminated technical problems during rehearsals'. Impact is\u000d\u000a      further demonstrated by 16 Integra-commissioned works for ensemble and\u000d\u000a      electronics, 5 of which were 20-minute works involving additional media\u000d\u000a      such as dance or video projection.

The first attracted &#163;30,000 of additional funding from BCU's\u000d\u000a      New Generation Arts and took place in June 2008 at Birmingham\u000d\u000a      Conservatoire and other Birmingham Venues (Town Hall, CBSO Centre, Custard\u000d\u000a      Factory). It featured a 1-day symposium on live electronic music and\u000d\u000a      premieres of commissioned works performed by Bit20 Ensemble, The Bays, Ars\u000d\u000a      Nova and BCMG. The second festival, a collaboration with the Royal Danish\u000d\u000a      Academy of Music, took place in September 2011 in Copenhagen, attracting\u000d\u000a      &#8364;20,000 of additional funding from the Nordic Culture Fund and &#8364;30,000\u000d\u000a      from Kulturkontakt Nord. It was given a 5-star review in Danish broadsheet newspaper Jyllands- Posten.\u000d\u000a    Birmingham Conservatoire's project to update Harvey's works involving\u000d\u000a      DX7-based synthesis culminated in the performance of Valley of Aosta\u000d\u000a      at Birmingham's Adrian Boult Hall in March 2009, and Madonna of Winter\u000d\u000a        and Spring at London's Barbican Centre in January 2012, performed by\u000d\u000a      the BBC Symphony Orchestra and broadcast to a worldwide audience on BBC\u000d\u000a      Radio 3's `Hear and Now' programme. The performance also received critical\u000d\u000a      acclaim, with the Classical Source referring to the work as a\u000d\u000a      `welcome revival' with the digitally emulated electronics sounding `of\u000d\u000a      their time'. The Senior New Music Editor of Faber Music (Harvey's\u000d\u000a      publisher) cites the project as providing `far-reaching benefits for\u000d\u000a      publishers (and audiences) by rescuing works that cannot be performed due\u000d\u000a      to technological obsolescence and ensuring the long-term sustainability of\u000d\u000a      live electronics.'\u000d\u000a    Educational Impact\u000d\u000a    The Integra Project included two educational strands: a curriculum pilot,\u000d\u000a      intended to embed the use of Integra Live in instrumental teaching\u000d\u000a      curricula and performer training workshops, to train professional\u000d\u000a      performers in the concepts and practice of live electronic music. The\u000d\u000a      curriculum pilots were delivered by three Integra research centres (IEM,\u000d\u000a      Malm&#246; Academy of Music and Birmingham Conservatoire) in their own\u000d\u000a      institutions. They resulted in four instrumental teachers from each\u000d\u000a      institution teaching live electronics with their students over a year of\u000d\u000a      study. The Integra `performer training' workshops were delivered using\u000d\u000a      Integra Live over two sessions to members of the Integra member ensembles\u000d\u000a      (Court Circuit [Paris], Athelas Sinfonietta [Copenhagen], Ars Nova\u000d\u000a      [Malm&#246;], Grup Instrumental [Valencia], Bit 20 [Bergen]), delivered by each\u000d\u000a      of the five Integra research centres. As a result of this training,\u000d\u000a      ensemble performers are now able to work directly with Integra Live\u000d\u000a      without the need for technical support.\u000d\u000a    Integra Live is now being used as a teaching tool in music higher\u000d\u000a      education courses worldwide. For example, an Integra outreach partner and\u000d\u000a      Lecturer in electroacoustic composition at The Liszt Academy of Music,\u000d\u000a      Budapest, states: `Integra Live has enabled the creation of new works for\u000d\u000a      live electronics within our composition group [...] Students have found\u000d\u000a      the software easy to use and it has transformed their creative work by\u000d\u000a      enabling them to achieve musically satisfying results at an early stage in\u000d\u000a      the composition process.' The Co-ordinator of the Electro-Acoustic Music\u000d\u000a      Program at San Jos&#233; State University states: `Integra Live has transformed\u000d\u000a      the creative practice of our students by accelerating the process of\u000d\u000a      constructing interactive projects. Our students appreciate the simplicity,\u000d\u000a      responsiveness and cost effectiveness of Integra Live compared to existing\u000d\u000a      systems.'\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Integra was a &#8364;3.1M international research collaboration led by\u000d\u000a      Birmingham Conservatoire and funded by the Culture programme of the\u000d\u000a      European Union.

The first three-year phase\u000d\u000a      of the Integra project (Integra 1), which ran from 2005 to 2008 and was\u000d\u000a      funded by the Culture 2000 Programme of the European Union, entailed an\u000d\u000a      investigation into these issues through a series of international\u000d\u000a      scientific meetings, software prototyping and dissemination through\u000d\u000a      peer-reviewed conferences and journals. This resulted in the production of\u000d\u000a      user interface prototypes that were developed through a research study\u000d\u000a      engaging with practising musicians (Bullock and Coccioli, 2009). Integra 1\u000d\u000a      formed a strong component of BCU's 2008 RAE submission in which Birmingham\u000d\u000a      Conservatoire was ranked third out of all UK Conservatoires, and number\u000d\u000a      one outside London.\u000d\u000a    In Integra 2, the research of the project was developed into a\u000d\u000a      commercial-quality, open source and cross-platform application: Integra Live. This software\u000d\u000a      formed the basis for all of the artistic outputs of the project, including\u000d\u000a      large-scale concerts at international music festivals. In addition to\u000d\u000a      feedback gathered from Integra project musicians, a public survey of 76\u000d\u000a      users was conducted to gather user requirements, and lab-based studies\u000d\u000a      were conducted at BCU's state-of-the-art user testing facilities at\u000d\u000a      Birmingham Institute of Art and Design (BIAD). The results of these were\u000d\u000a      used for a design and user-experience modelling phase that was conducted\u000d\u000a      in collaboration with commercial design company Less Rain (http:\/\/www.lessrain.com). The software was then developed over a 12-month period by the Integra\u000d\u000a      scientific partners and released publicly in July 2010.\u000d\u000a    The second research goal of Integra was to address the urgent question of\u000d\u000a      hardware and software obsolescence in live electronic music repertoire.\u000d\u000a      This research was conducted in partnership with Malm&#246; Academy of Music at\u000d\u000a      Lund University in Sweden, and entailed an extensive study into the\u000d\u000a      preservation and sustainability of the audio processing and synthesis\u000d\u000a      components of live electronics works. The result was a set of description\u000d\u000a      standards and storage formats implemented in the Integra Live software and\u000d\u000a      enabling works to be realised in other environments supporting a base\u000d\u000a      level of functionality (Bullock and Frisk, 2009, 2011). A set of methods\u000d\u000a      was then devised for `repertoire migration' to modern systems. As a\u000d\u000a      result, over thirty works were updated by Integra research centres through\u000d\u000a      the course of the project and rescued from obscurity (http:\/\/www.integralive.org\/migrations\/).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"1916","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Influence on Creative Practice\u000d\u000a      The research findings generated by the investigations outlined above have\u000d\u000a      provided the thrust of numerous creative projects, residential artistic\u000d\u000a      programmes and training events focused on accessible technologies in the\u000d\u000a      UK and Ireland (twenty events between 2000-2012, for example in Belfast,\u000d\u000a      Holywood, Lisnaskea, Dublin and Roscommon), Sweden (five events between\u000d\u000a      2003 and 2007 in Hj&#246;, Gothenburg and Stockholm), the US (Washington, May\u000d\u000a      2007) and Japan (Tokyo, August 2010).\u000d\u000a    In the course of this work Lyons has directly influenced over five\u000d\u000a      hundred composers and performers with disabilities to reassess and revise\u000d\u000a      their creative practice with a view to more constructive use of new\u000d\u000a      technologies (see testimonial from a disabled musician in the Wired\u000d\u000a      Ensemble).\u000d\u000a    Over fifty access tutors in the UK and Ireland, including those working\u000d\u000a      with Drake Music Project, Share Music and Stravaganza, have reassessed and\u000d\u000a      revised their approach to working creatively with disabled musicians after\u000d\u000a      attending training on accessible technologies delivered by Lyons.

Historically, performances by\u000d\u000a      disabled musicians have been marginalised, often taking place at events\u000d\u000a      limited to the `arts and disability' community. The increased levels of\u000d\u000a      artistic accomplishment achieved by those musicians with disabilities who\u000d\u000a      have worked with Lyons' technology-focused methodologies has resulted in\u000d\u000a      greater visibility at mainstream music events and in wider public\u000d\u000a      acceptance and understanding of, as well as respect for, their creative\u000d\u000a      output.

Ticket sales exceeded\u000d\u000a      company expectations by &#163;11,000.\u000d\u000a    In addition to the live performances, a web-based micro-site, maintained\u000d\u000a      for three years after Knight Crew's first production, allowed\u000d\u000a      downloads of the complete opera; 600 were made.\u000d\u000a    The impact of Knight Crew after Knight\u000a          Crew\u000d\u000a    The innovative involvement of young people in the creation and\u000d\u000a      performance of Knight Crew was immediately understood as a\u000d\u000a      significant development. This was recognised by the BBC in its decision to\u000d\u000a      make the documentary already described, but also by the\u000d\u000a      composer\/researcher and his team. An event was therefore held after the Knight\u000a        Crew matin&#233;e at Glyndebourne that encouraged experts from various\u000d\u000a      institutions to reflect on the development of new opera and its\u000d\u000a      relationship to opera education work.\u000d\u000a    This event was followed in February 2011 by an international conference\u000d\u000a      on new opera development. The event, led by the composer\/researcher, used\u000d\u000a      lessons learnt through Knight Crew as its starting point. The\u000d\u000a      conference welcomed key figures from the British education sector and\u000d\u000a      representatives of leading UK and European opera companies.\u000d\u000a    The impact of Knight Crew was further enhanced by an agreement\u000d\u000a      between the BBC and Glyndebourne that the company could use additional BBC\u000d\u000a      footage to chart its own process of commissioning and developing Knight\u000a        Crew. This extends the impact of the opera, and its innovative\u000d\u000a      developmental process, to the wider international operatic community.\u000d\u000a    Another impact of Knight Crew has been the influence its creative\u000d\u000a      process has had on other projects by other teams. The composer\/researcher\u000d\u000a      has been invited to advise various groups intent on staging new work using\u000d\u000a      variants of the approaches pioneered in Knight Crew. These include\u000d\u000a      W11 Opera, Welsh National Opera, and The Opera Group. Additionally, plans\u000d\u000a      are now (2013) nearing completion for new performances of Knight Crew\u000d\u000a      in New Zealand.\u000d\u000a    Further impacts prompted by Knight Crew have included numerous\u000d\u000a      invitations the composer\/researcher has received to join bodies\u000d\u000a      responsible for commissioning new work (Sound and Music, Royal Opera\u000d\u000a      House, The Opera Group, Royal Philharmonic Society, British Association of\u000d\u000a      Songwriters, Composers and Authors) and to speak at conferences on future\u000d\u000a      directions of opera (European Network for Opera and Dance Education (March\u000d\u000a      2010), Opera for Young People (2011), Royal Musicological Association\u000d\u000a      (July 2012) New Operatic Forms for Participatory and community opera (July\u000d\u000a      2012).\u000d\u000a    The success of Knight Crew has led to the composer\/researcher\u000d\u000a      receiving further commissions for his work that builds on the practices\u000d\u000a      developed in the opera.

Soprano Claire Wild and tenor Pascal Charbonneau are\u000d\u000a      wonderfully convincing as the chief protagonists, with mezzo Yvonne Howard\u000d\u000a      doubling brilliantly as the bag- lady and Arthur's despairing mother. The\u000d\u000a      endlessly mutating set with its skilfully projected climactic scenes\u000d\u000a      recalls the glory days of English National Opera, the libretto trades\u000d\u000a      intelligently on the monosyllabic terseness of street slang, and the music\u000d\u000a      draws boldly on Bernstein and Stravinsky. Whether this new work `has legs'\u000d\u000a      is a moot point - it demands major skills and resources - but it's\u000d\u000a      certainly a major achievement.\u000d\u000a    \u000aAuthor: Susan Elkin\u000d\u000a      Title: Lots of Learning and not a hamper in sight\u000d\u000a      Year of Publication: March 8th 2010\u000d\u000a      Type of output: Blog post, The Stage Blogs\u000d\u000a      http:\/\/blogs.thestage.co.uk\/education\/2010\/03\/lots-of-learning-and-not-a-hamper-in-sig\/\u000d\u000a    \u000aIt all adds up to a gripping two hour, two act opera - a reworking of the\u000d\u000a      Arthur story set on a 21st century UK estate where knife crime is a way of\u000d\u000a      life.\u000d\u000a    I love the lyricism of it.

The principal staging posts that mark the\u000d\u000a      evolution of this research prior to Knight Crew are Followers\u000d\u000a      (2008), a site-specific, promenade opera, and The Yellow Sofa\u000d\u000a      (2009), a chamber opera for 10 singers and small ensemble. Both were\u000d\u000a      composed for, and presented by, Glyndebourne. The latter is also offered\u000d\u000a      as an REF output (output 17a).\u000d\u000a    Through these smaller operas the composer's understanding of the\u000d\u000a      potential of the research project expanded: what had been an endeavour\u000d\u000a      aimed principally at breathing oxygen into the grand operatic tradition\u000d\u000a      became one that increasingly appreciated that some of the methods through\u000d\u000a      which this could be achieved had the hugely significant advantage of\u000d\u000a      bringing a new audience to the art form. The conclusion emerged that the\u000d\u000a      engagement of young people into the creation of opera, would not only\u000d\u000a      revivify the form but also excite and engage a new generation.\u000d\u000a    Knight Crew encapsulates these research outcomes and was the\u000d\u000a      vehicle through which the impact described in this statement was achieved.\u000d\u000a    It is worth underlining that the research aim was not primarily\u000d\u000a      sociological, educational or polemical, but rather operatic. Its impact on\u000d\u000a      the quality of the opera is presented in a separate REF output (output\u000d\u000a      17b), here, the focus is Knight Crew's impact on the way opera is\u000d\u000a      made, how it is shared with audiences and how these advances are\u000d\u000a      influencing others eager that opera should continue to provoke and engage.\u000d\u000a    Knight Crew is published by Peters Edition, London.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"2011","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3865483","Name":"Argentina"},{"GeoNamesId":"597427","Name":"Lithuania"},{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"},{"GeoNamesId":"3355338","Name":"Namibia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The Working Group discussions (chaired by Moore) that formed the\u000d\u000a      starting-point for A Wider Literacy involved the full range of\u000d\u000a      stakeholders; this meant that the impact of the document was relatively\u000d\u000a      swift.

One basic change brought about has been a significant redirection\u000d\u000a      of resources into the digital space, resulting in an increase in the use\u000d\u000a      of digital platforms for governmental business (ample evidence of this can\u000d\u000a      be found at www.nidirect.gov.uk,\u000d\u000a      perhaps especially at www.nidirect.gov.uk\/department-of-agriculture-and-\u000d\u000a      rural-development, where there is now extensive online provision for the\u000d\u000a      farming community; see testimonial from Director of OfCom, Belfast).\u000d\u000a    But it is in the area of education that it has had most effect: the\u000d\u000a      implementation of the Digital Participation Plan for NI has\u000d\u000a      allowed schools more freedom to explore the benefits of digital\u000d\u000a      technologies in the classroom, as evidenced in the long-term projects\u000d\u000a      conducted by e.g. Wallace High School, Lisburn (an ethnographic study into\u000d\u000a      the impact of `disruptive' technologies on a large secondary institution),\u000d\u000a      and St Mary's Primary School, Tempo (a pedagogical study of the impact of\u000d\u000a      creative technologies; see testimonial from a teacher at St Mary's Primary\u000d\u000a      School, Tempo).\u000d\u000a    Counting What Counts has, in the short time since its publication\u000d\u000a      in February 2013, had considerable influence on the debate over big data\u000d\u000a      and the arts. It has also had impact in practical terms: the metrics tools\u000d\u000a      it examines, and whose integration it proposes (in a so-called `big-data\u000d\u000a      dashboard') are to be piloted formally by various Arts Council England\u000d\u000a      funded bodies. The sectoral impact of Moore's programme of research more\u000d\u000a      generally is evidenced in the number of invited presentations, including\u000d\u000a      keynote addresses, he has been asked to make at international policy and\u000d\u000a      industry conferences, e.g. national media literacy symposia in Greece,\u000d\u000a      South Africa and Namibia, and a national television forum in Argentina.\u000d\u000a      The research was also showcased at the Westminster Get Creative Forum in\u000d\u000a      2012, and cited by the European Commission as a key text for the EU: it\u000d\u000a      was the object of an invited keynote address at a meeting of EU culture\u000d\u000a      ministers in Lithuania (October 2013; see e-mail from Ministry of Culture\u000d\u000a      of the Republic of Lithuania).

Its wide\u000d\u000a      dissemination led to Moore being invited to apply to join the Content\u000d\u000a      Board of OfCom, and in 2008 to chair the NI Media Literacy Hub (NIMLH), an\u000d\u000a      OfCom-sponsored body that included representation from the BBC, the\u000d\u000a      Education Guidance Service for Adults (EGSA), and the permanent\u000d\u000a      secretaries of devolved government departments. Moore's work with these\u000d\u000a      two bodies led to the National Media Literacy Conference coming to the\u000d\u000a      University in 2009 and the co-opting of Moore to the Digital Economy\u000d\u000a      Working Group (2009), tasked with carrying out research and development\u000d\u000a      for the Digital Economy Act 2010. It also facilitated access to the\u000d\u000a      primary resources that would inform a second document, Moore's Digital\u000d\u000a        Participation Plan for NI, aligned with the National Plan for\u000d\u000a        Digital Participation (both in 2010). The Digital Participation\u000d\u000a        Plan for NI examined the state of digital take-up in NI and made a\u000d\u000a      number of recommendations as to how the new literacies (`infoliteracies')\u000d\u000a      could be enshrined in both formal and informal practice across the\u000d\u000a      education sector and, crucially, the arts.

As\u000a      sources cited in section 5 will corroborate, the traditional method of\u000a      influence by scholarly publication has consistently been supplemented by\u000a      other avenues - pre-concert talks on HIP issues, open practice-based\u000a      workshops, public study days, public lectures, performance and commercial\u000a      recording consultancies, concerts (some as soloist\/director and\u000a      presenter), broadcasts, contributions to professional journals (e.g. The\u000a        Strad), and programme notes for major festivals\/venues (e.g.\u000a      Edinburgh International Festival; London's South Bank).

Recovering knowledge,\u000a      enhancing understanding and providing performers with the tools to\u000a      recreate a former sound world with optimum fidelity (and the public to\u000a      understand that sound world) have required experiment with `period\u000a      instruments' and interpretation of evidence from manuscripts, printed\u000a      music, editions, treatises, historical writings, iconography, and other\u000a      archival materials.\u000a    Underpinning research since 1993\u000a    In this period Stowell focused his research on performance\u000a      practice issues in Beethoven. He investigated the text and editions of\u000a      Beethoven's Violin Concerto, publishing his initial findings in his edited\u000a      volume Performing Beethoven (1994).3.1 Further research\u000a      (1995-97) led to a monograph about the work (1998).3.2\u000a    A collaboration with Colin Lawson (then Goldsmiths) culminated in a\u000a      series of handbooks about HIP (1999-2002), guiding performers, students\u000a      and listeners in interpreting the evidence of instrumental treatises and\u000a      other sources, elucidating the aspects of style and technique that form\u000a      well-grounded HIPs and demonstrating their practical application in case\u000a      studies from the repertory. The series comprises a co-authored\u000a      introductory volume (1999)3.3 focusing on `the long eighteenth\u000a      century' and specialist volumes on individual instruments, including Stowell's\u000a      on the violin and viola (2001).3.4 A book chapter for a series\u000a      published by the ABRSM3.5 examines similar issues but is\u000a      directed towards a more specific, examination-oriented readership.\u000a    Underpinning research since 2008\u000a    Collaborations during the REF period have resulted in a continuing\u000a      acceleration of the research impact achieved. One with Clive Brown (Leeds)\u000a      led to a major AHRC research award (2008-12) to create a digitized\u000a      resource of 19th-century performing editions of string chamber music,\u000a      contextualized in a web-based catalogue raison&#233;e, together with\u000a      analysis of the material and its implications for HIP.3.6 Stowell\u000a      contributed to all aspects of the project as co-investigator, organised an\u000a      international conference (Cardiff), presented papers at both the project's\u000a      international conferences, and participated in pre-concert\u000a      discussions and other events offering public access to its research\u000a      findings and their implementation.\u000a    Stowell's contributions to the Orchestra of the Age of\u000a      Enlightenment's (OAE) outreach projects in HIP led to a collaboration with\u000a      one of its principal violinists, Claire Holden, and a consequent\u000a      successful application for an AHRC Fellowship (2010-15), hosted at Cardiff\u000a      University with Stowell as mentor.3.7 Building on Stowell's\u000a      HIP consultancy experiences (e.g. English Symphony Orchestra; Welsh\u000a      Sinfonia (workshops 2010-12)), Holden has been re-aligning period\u000a      string performance in Beethoven's symphonies and other orchestral works\u000a      with the corroborated practices of his time, promulgating scholarly\u000a      research in practice-based, contextualized instructional video\u000a      demonstrations on a dedicated website hosted by the School of Music (the\u000a      first practice-led resource in this research area), and disseminating the\u000a      relevant techniques in workshops with students and professionals,\u000a      seminars, master classes, pre-concert talks, study days and other public\u000a      fora in the UK and Europe.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3423","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    a) BBC Discovering Dutilleux Festival, 15-17 February 2008\u000d\u000a    Aware of Rae's research on Dutilleux and 20th-century\u000d\u000a      French music, Tim Thorne (Senior Producer BBC NOW) invited her to be\u000d\u000a      programming consultant and co-organiser of the BBC's first festival\u000d\u000a      dedicated to his music.5:1, 2\u000d\u000a    It comprised five BBC Radio 3 broadcast concerts, two public orchestral\u000d\u000a      concerts (St David's Hall, Cardiff); two public chamber concerts (Cardiff\u000d\u000a      University); two days of public talks; and an exhibition.

Supported by AHRB and\u000d\u000a      British Academy grants in 2004-5, the research combines archival\u000d\u000a      investigation with personal testimonies from composers and their surviving\u000d\u000a      relatives. Findings have been published in a series of articles, a book\u000d\u000a      chapter and a monograph.3:1-6 Broadening pre- existing\u000d\u000a      concepts of the French Tradition, Rae has simultaneously shown how\u000d\u000a      it has interacted with developments in the rest of Europe and in the\u000d\u000a      Americas. With particular reference to the reception of French music in\u000d\u000a      the UK, Rae has demonstrated how the exclusion of Dutilleux,\u000d\u000a      Jolivet and Ohana from Boulez's Concerts du Domaine Musical (1954-73) and,\u000d\u000a      consequently, from BBC programming during the era of Sir William Glock\u000d\u000a      (1959-73), resulted in their neglect in the UK during that period.3:2\u000d\u000a      Other findings have been:\u000d\u000a    Henri Dutilleux (1916-2013)3:2, 5\u000d\u000a    Rae's research places Dutilleux in the broader international\u000d\u000a      mainstream rather than simply pigeonholing him as `quintessentially\u000d\u000a      French'. She has shown that his music draws on influences from outside\u000d\u000a      France, connecting in particular to Berg, Bart&#243;k and Lutoslawski.\u000d\u000a      Dismantling the concept of the French tradition as being independent from\u000d\u000a      modernist influences elsewhere, she has demonstrated ways in which it has\u000d\u000a      shaped major 20th-century developments.\u000d\u000a    Andr&#233; Jolivet (1905-1974)3:3, 4, 7\u000d\u000a    Rae's work has reassessed Jolivet, often overshadowed by his\u000d\u000a      colleague and near contemporary Messiaen, overturning the view of him as a\u000d\u000a      one-time progressive turned traditionalist to reveal a continuity of\u000d\u000a      compositional innovation since 1945, and that his ideas and techniques,\u000d\u000a      particularly in the fields of rhythm and pianism, influenced Messiaen. She\u000d\u000a      has also demonstrated Jolivet's influence on Magic Realism through his\u000d\u000a      connections with the Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier. Interviewing Jolivet's\u000d\u000a      daughter and uncovering new source material (in the composer's private\u000d\u000a      archives) has revealed some of Jolivet's previously overlooked interests\u000d\u000a      and activities.\u000d\u000a    Messiaen (1908-1992) and other contemporaries3:1, 4, 6\u000d\u000a    Understanding of Messiaen's contribution has been enhanced by Rae's\u000a      research on Jolivet and others, countering the perception of him as a\u000d\u000a      wholly independent figure. Rae has shown that Messiaen drew from\u000d\u000a      his contemporaries, his distinctive techniques connecting with broader\u000d\u000a      trends in 20th-century French music. In the case of Maurice\u000d\u000a      Ohana (1913-92), she has demonstrated the interaction between his music\u000d\u000a      and that of Jolivet and Messiaen, as well as Berio, Ligeti and\u000d\u000a      Lutoslawski.5:1\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4554","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1668284","Name":"Taiwan"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aThe Danscross\/ArtsCross project has had significant impact for academics, artists, audiences and\u000d\u000afor cultural policy and diplomacy, addressing issues that inhibit understanding of the `other' in the\u000d\u000aUK\/Western relationship with East Asia. The activities undertaken publicly demonstrate the\u000d\u000acommitment of important national institutions in East Asia (such as the BDA, CNAAR, TNUA and\u000d\u000aothers) to developments such as: the freedom of the individual artist and researcher, the\u000d\u000aimportance of critical international\/intercultural dialogue in the arts, the thinking artist and the\u000d\u000aquestioning student, debating national and cultural identities in and through the arts, the\u000d\u000aengagement of policy-makers with culture and cultural exchange, the nature of, and future for\u000d\u000aregional relationships between China\/Taiwan\/Japan.\u000d\u000aThe main themes of ArtsCross 2013 include cultural expectations of the other, intercultural\u000d\u000adialogue and translation, and mutual expectations of what is dance, choreography and research.\u000d\u000aThese themes are explored through choreographic exchange that involves artists from the three\u000d\u000ainternational locations taking part in the process of dance making, rehearsals, academic\u000d\u000aobservations, blogging, discussion and debate, workshops, a conference and a performance.\u000d\u000aTwo specific areas of impact are;\u000d\u000aDance making and arts sector impact: The project develops the professional performance\u000d\u000acultures of China, Taiwan and the UK. For China and Taiwan, it develops platforms concerned with\u000d\u000aexploration and investigation. The project has allowed inclusive practice, inviting dancers with\u000d\u000adisabilities to dance in the project. It thereby extends the `licensed' arena of dance in China by\u000d\u000aproducing experimental contemporary performance works dealing with SARS, Christianity,\u000d\u000acritiques of traditional culture, disability (including the first public \/ televised performance by a\u000d\u000adisabled dancer in China), etc. In the UK, where East Asian arts and dance have been historically\u000d\u000aunder-represented, the project has been part of an awakening interest in institutions such as the\u000d\u000aBritish Council, in presenting and developing East Asian performance in the UK. This allows new\u000d\u000aplatforms for East Asian artists, and widens the UK dance audience demographic.\u000d\u000aAs such, the project has been key in developing the performance practices of artists and\u000d\u000aperforming arts students in each national context (UK see Annie Lok at\u000d\u000ahttp:\/\/www.stepoutarts.co.uk\/). These impacts are evident in the participants' observations. A\u000d\u000adancer from Beijing, who has been part of the project since 2009, says that the working methods of\u000d\u000aEuropean choreographers have opened her eyes to the possibilities of dance, where `anything is\u000d\u000apossible'. These methods have changed the way she works as a choreographer and teacher. A\u000d\u000achoreographer from the UK says that the project is unique, in that he has to come up with diverse\u000d\u000aways to communicate with dancers whose first language is not English. A young 18-year-old\u000d\u000adancer from China suggests that the challenge of working with older, more experienced dancers\u000d\u000afrom international locations makes her `step up' her practice. While a UK dancer finds it challenging\u000d\u000aand eye-opening to work with a Taiwanese choreographer who communicates ideas with lots of\u000d\u000awords and complicated back-stories.\u000d\u000aThe project has also facilitated links between UK arts organisations and East Asia, including for\u000d\u000aexample people\/organisations like Alistair Spalding, CEO and Artistic Director Sadlers' Wells\u000d\u000aTheatre, London; Eddie Nixon, Director The Place Theatre; Jih Wen Yeh Director, Step Out Arts,\u000d\u000aUK; and Dance writer Donald Hutera (e.g. see article in professional journal, Dance Europe No.\u000d\u000a169 January 2013 pp. 36-37)\u000d\u000aEducational policy and diplomacy impact: In many ways, the project's significance stems from\u000d\u000athe fact that it is participating in ongoing debates in public and Communist Party forums about the\u000d\u000afuture direction of China and its relations with the region and the wider world. Danscross\/ArtsCross\u000d\u000arepresents an intervention in these debates, promoting the cause of the modernisers in a society\u000d\u000awhere symbolic gesture is potent. The project has represented a fundamental shift in the\u000d\u000arelationship between the field of international research and professional dance practices, and\u000d\u000abetween Chinese conservatoire institutions such as the Beijing Dance Academy (BDA) and the\u000d\u000agovernmental research agency China National Academy for Arts Research (CNAAR) (as\u000d\u000aevidenced by BDA &amp; Beijing Education Department letters). In addition, involvement (supported by\u000d\u000aBritish Council Arts Officers) with Penghao Theatre, the first theatre in China that is independent of\u000d\u000athe state, supports these developments and offers the validation of international arts and HE\u000d\u000aresearch collaborations, both important indicators of achievement in China. It alters the place and\u000d\u000apurpose of dance in China, and acts as a vehicle for progressing artistic and policy exchanges\u000d\u000abetween Taiwan and China, and East Asia and the UK. To elaborate, while the Chinese\u000d\u000acontemporary visual art world has challenged social values for some years, dance has largely\u000d\u000atended to act as a carrier of culture, preserving `traditional Chinese classical and folk forms' or as a\u000d\u000avehicle for glorification of the spectacular and virtuosic technical achievement of dancers, and by\u000d\u000aimplication, China.\u000d\u000aIn contrast Dancross\/ArtsCross is participating in an initiative that, through its significant\u000d\u000acollaborations, opens Chinese society to art in a mainstream theatre context that is informed by a\u000d\u000acritical stance, not reflecting current values nor presenting governmental views, nor conserving a\u000d\u000atheatricalised version of traditional forms. Such impacts are underlined, for example, by the\u000d\u000ainvitation extended to Bannerman to attend and respond to issues and concerns prior to the 2009\u000d\u000aperformance which was viewed in advance, (in closed session), by the Communist Party Chairman\u000d\u000aof the BDA, and a committee of the Communist Party. This invitation to a foreigner was the first\u000d\u000aever extended in BDA's history. Further, Dancross\/ArtsCross presents a research-driven response\u000d\u000ato contemporary Chinese, Taiwanese and Western life and art, and did so in mainstream\u000d\u000aprofessional theatres (e.g. 2009 -1,500 seat theatre).\u000d\u000aAs an on-going face-to-face and online forum for debate regarding issues of\u000d\u000aChinese\/Taiwanese\/UK national and cultural identities and their significance and interaction\u000d\u000abetween China, Taiwan, Japan and the UK, the project establishes new channels for cultural\u000d\u000adiplomacy to strengthen dialogue which is a prerequisite for stable and positive relations in times of\u000d\u000aturbulence and change. In the UK, the project demonstrates the efficacy of Arts and Humanities\u000d\u000aresearch as an agent of change and involving arts professionals to ensure wider real world\u000d\u000arelationships and the involvement of British Council Arts Department and DCMS. In addition, Prof\u000d\u000aBannerman advised the British Council on the development of their Olympic Big Dance project and\u000d\u000aadvised BODA, Beijing Olympic Development Committee on their Beijing Wishes project which\u000d\u000aculminated in a film shown in Trafalgar Square, London as part of the Big Dance Olympiad project,\u000d\u000ahttp:\/\/www.bigdancelegacy.co.uk\/ and http:\/\/www.Vimeo.com\/58998067.\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aProfessor Christopher Bannerman conceived this large-scale project as an extension of the\u000d\u000aResCen mission to connect academia more intimately with the arts profession.

Through online forums, discussions, seminars and\u000d\u000aconferences, the project opens dialogue about encounters with, and understandings of, the other.\u000d\u000aThe project achieves reach and significance in conversation with policy-makers and producers in\u000d\u000athree sectors beyond HE: arts professional practice, cultural policy, and civil society.

The role of Middlesex as an institution\u000d\u000acommitted to an international mission with postgraduate students in, for example, Hong Kong has\u000d\u000aprovided a base from which significant debates and networks for exchange have been developed.\u000d\u000aDanscross\/ArtsCross has focused on developing understanding and knowledge of regional,\u000d\u000anational and cultural identities; intercultural dialogue; and associated policy frameworks of East\u000d\u000aAsia and the UK in and through performance practices. As such, one of the most significant\u000d\u000aresearch insights of the Dancross\/ArtsCross project to date has been the extent to which it has\u000d\u000agiven grounds for reflection on presumptions and dispositions in language, culture and practice,\u000d\u000adrawing attention to similarities or differences in experiences of the other. The project has also\u000d\u000ainvited scholarly reflection on processes of making and producing transnational performance,\u000d\u000arather than privileging the `output' or public presentation. The various styles and approaches to\u000d\u000aperformance which fall under the umbrella of 'modern' or 'contemporary' dance have been a\u000d\u000aparticularly important focus for this enquiry, raising questions about alternate, multiple and\u000d\u000acosmopolitan modernities, and the efficacy, or otherwise, of `home' languages in speaking about\u000d\u000aexperience. The range of approaches adopted by academics largely coheres around concepts of\u000d\u000aethnographic engagement and the benefits and limitations that these provide in a dynamic\u000d\u000aenvironment that often takes on the attributes of a semi-isolated community as the intensity of the\u000d\u000aart-making process becomes an immersive experience.\u000d\u000aThe larger context is framed by the political history of the two Chinas (the official name of\u000d\u000aTaiwan is Republic of China), as well as a perceived East-West divide exacerbated by Euro-centric\u000d\u000amainstream understandings in western thought and scholarship. The project addresses issues that\u000d\u000ainhibit understanding of the `other' in the UK\/Western relationship with East Asia. Such issues were\u000d\u000aidentified in 1988 by Chou Wen-chung's address at the International Symposium, `Music in the\u000d\u000aDialogue of Cultures, Traditional Music and Cultural Policy', Berlin 1988, in which he suggested\u000d\u000athat for successful intercultural creative exchange to take place, people need to understand the\u000d\u000ahistories of artistic movements and cultures within each culture, to take more than just a superficial\u000d\u000aview of the exchange, and to understand each other's artistic and political context. Other formative\u000d\u000aresearch was done by notable scholars such as Rustom Bharucha and Patrice Pavis. Project\u000d\u000aresearcher Emilyn Claid notes, Danscross\/ArtsCross takes this scholarship of cultural complexity in\u000d\u000ato the dance studio so that: `The strength of Danscross, and ArtsCross, is in the daily work of\u000d\u000ameeting, talking, moving and making, demonstrating how intercultural relations of power,\u000d\u000asubjectivities and otherness, sameness and difference, rising and falling, are m&#246;biusly-swirled,\u000d\u000aroller-coastered, and intimately interwoven' (2012: 332).\u000d\u000aNumerous researchers from a range of institutions have been involved in Danscross and\u000d\u000aArtsCross. From Middlesex, Professor Chris Bannerman has served as conceiver, co-curator and\u000d\u000aco-director with Associate Professor XuRui of the Beijing Dance Academy (BDA). ArtsCross has\u000d\u000ainvolved ResCen Artistic Associates Shobana Jeyasingh (as choreographer, 2009), and Richard\u000d\u000aLayzell as an artist mentor and workshop facilitator.

She aims at allowing students a space in\u000d\u000a        which they can explore and embody identities that reflect their lives\u000d\u000a        and the urban spaces in which they live. At Mulberry School in\u000d\u000a        Whitechapel, in 2012, Jeyasingh worked with 300 students using\u000d\u000a        Kalarippayattu workshops, and with 12 students for a site-specific\u000d\u000a        project that was attended by 120 students. She worked with 13 students\u000d\u000a        for a curtain raiser project performed at the Royal Opera House. In\u000d\u000a        2013, she undertook an artist residency there, where the company worked\u000d\u000a        with 24 students. As a girls school, with an almost exclusively Bengali\u000d\u000a        Muslim student population, the students say that they find Jeyasingh -\u000d\u000a        an Asian woman, with an independent and successful dance company, who\u000d\u000a        works with both Asian and contemporary dance styles, without feeling the\u000d\u000a        need to label components of her work - an inspiring role model. In a\u000d\u000a        three-day residency the company used contemporary choreographic and\u000d\u000a        creative methods to rehearse and perform a five-minute work in the\u000d\u000a        school's new theatre space. The head teacher finds Jeyasingh's\u000d\u000a        contribution unique, saying that in the difficult days of low arts\u000d\u000a        funding, Jeyasingh makes time and finds funds to work with young women\u000d\u000a        at the school who have a love for dancing, but who don't always find\u000d\u000a        parental support for their dance ambitions. She says that young people\u000d\u000a        are `global citizens' and face unique challenges for defining their\u000d\u000a        identities, and Jeyasingh's work has taken on this challenge and\u000d\u000a        produces globally-aware work that instinctively understands modern\u000d\u000a        identity. Jeyasingh's patience in working with the students, her ways of\u000d\u000a        empowering them, her lack of interest in labels such as Asian, British,\u000d\u000a        traditional, modern allow the girls to explore hybrid identities, and\u000d\u000a        gain confidence in their bodies. For her school work with girls,\u000d\u000a        Jeyasingh often gets students to use work with strength and power as\u000d\u000a        motifs.\u000d\u000a      Mentoring\u000d\u000a      Jeyasingh regularly undertakes facilitation and mentoring roles in\u000d\u000a        contexts that enable her to challenge artists to reconsider cultural\u000d\u000a        definitions through embodied work. Recent mentoring projects include:\u000d\u000a          Collolab workshop, East London Dance agency (2010), Choreogata,\u000d\u000a        Southbank (2011), Choreographic Collisions, Venice biennale\u000d\u000a        (2012), Back to the Lab - Breakin' Convention, Sadler's\u000d\u000a          Wells (2013).\u000d\u000a      The latter of these projects brings Jeyasingh's particular interest in\u000d\u000a        the choreography of the urban to the fore. Back to the Lab\u000d\u000a        attracts dance makers with no formal training, as is typical of street\/\u000d\u000a        hip hop based dance. In 2013, Jeyasingh mentored four emerging hip-hop\u000d\u000a        choreographers, and facilitated their translation of a street dance\u000d\u000a        style, that is made up of multiple dance\/music styles and histories, on\u000d\u000a        to a theatrical stage. Each of these choreographers worked with five\u000d\u000a        dancers and produced a ten-minute dance piece, based on the two-week\u000d\u000a        training and mentoring with Jeyasingh. 180 audience members watched\u000d\u000a        these works-in-progress, one of which was in May 2013, performed at the\u000d\u000a        Breakin' Convention and attracted 1600 audience members.\u000d\u000a      Public engagement\u000d\u000a      Besides dance work and workshops, Jeyasingh is actively involved in\u000d\u000a        public engagement activities, including forums, paper presentations, and\u000d\u000a        TV and radio talks. In 2012, Jeyasingh presented a paper `Looking for\u000d\u000a        the Invisible: The Abstract in South Asian Arts,' at Akademi. In 2011,\u000d\u000a        she delivered a key note at Trinity Laban for a symposium called\u000d\u000a        Passion, Pathways and Potential in Dance; delivered lectures to MA\u000d\u000a        students at the London School of Speech and Drama and the University of\u000d\u000a        Sheffield. In 2010, her process was filmed and broadcast on the national\u000d\u000a        TV channel in India, Doordarshan. In the same year, she presented talks\u000d\u000a        at Dansenshus, Stockholm; contributed to a post-show talk about Indian\u000d\u000a        choreographer Chandralekha at the South Bank Center; presented papers at\u000d\u000a        Max Mueller Bhavan, Delhi, at the NCA in Mumbai and The State of the\u000d\u000a        Arts conference in London, and workshops at The Bangalore School of\u000d\u000a        Music in Bangalore and Gati Festival in Delhi. Within each of these\u000d\u000a        contexts audiences\/participants reflect upon and question attitudes and\u000d\u000a        perceptions of cultural difference and tradition.\u000d\u000a      Professional dance practice\u000d\u000a      The Artistic Director of Dance Umbrella says that Jeyasingh has an\u000d\u000a        enormous impact on the dance profession, by creating new audiences, and\u000d\u000a        by experimenting with classical South Asian forms. She has produced\u000d\u000a        enormously influential work that challenges conceptions of tradition and\u000d\u000a        modernity, self and other, East and West. In addition, she was the first\u000d\u000a        choreographer to successfully make work that extended the boundaries of\u000d\u000a        a classical form. In many international projects, like an EU-funded\u000d\u000a        commission to make site-specific work, a tour of India, a collaborative\u000d\u000a        exchange between UK and China artists in Danscross 2009, Jeyasingh is\u000d\u000a        chosen to represent UK choreographers. In addition, her work often\u000d\u000a        challenges gender definitions, and produces a feminist reengagement with\u000d\u000a        historically patriarchal sites.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Shobana Jeyasingh is one of a handful of British choreographers - and\u000d\u000a      indeed, choreographers worldwide - who successfully choreograph work using\u000d\u000a      a multiplicity of cultural techniques and methods. Having trained in the\u000d\u000a      Indian classical form Bharata Natyam, Jeyasingh produces work that\u000d\u000a      utilizes a mix of classical, contemporary, popular and site-specific\u000d\u000a      techniques. Impacts are generated through her writing, mentoring, public\u000d\u000a      engagement and performance works, as she asks audiences and dancers to\u000d\u000a      re-think notions of authenticity, unchanging tradition, and binary\u000d\u000a      identities such as Asian and British. While her workshops in schools and\u000d\u000a      performance works in various British and European sites change perceptions\u000d\u000a      of gender, ethnic identity and Indian dance, in a tour supported by the\u000d\u000a      British Council and commercial sponsors, she has taken her diasporic,\u000d\u000a      hybrid sensibilities to India, to convey a postmodern, multicultural\u000d\u000a      British identity.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    Middlesex University\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Middlesex University","InstitutionName":"Middlesex University","PeerGroup":"D","Region":"London","UKPRN":10004351}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2673730","Name":"Stockholm"},{"GeoNamesId":"1277333","Name":"Bangalore"},{"GeoNamesId":"1261481","Name":"New Delhi"},{"GeoNamesId":"1261481","Name":"New Dehli"},{"GeoNamesId":"1275339","Name":"Mumbai"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    Jeyasingh received international commissions to make work.

ResCen has, since its inception in 1999, investigated artistic\u000d\u000a      processes, as well as the role of artists as citizens and representatives\u000d\u000a      of a domain of knowledge. Through public events and dialogues with\u000d\u000a      researchers, ResCen provides a context in which associate artists can\u000d\u000a      deepen their research.\u000d\u000a    Promoting culturally rich understandings of dance and the body, Jeyasingh\u000d\u000a      has made more than thirty dance works over the last 25 years. She utilizes\u000d\u000a      classical Indian movement practices as well as contemporary choreographic\u000d\u000a      methods, to produce work informed by, and located in, urban cityscapes.\u000d\u000a      Her work challenges how we perceive and construct modern identities. When\u000d\u000a      audiences ask her what is Indian or British in her work, Jeyasingh\u000d\u000a      interrogates the assumption that there is an `authentic' past to which we\u000d\u000a      are bound, and utilizing the ideas of theorists such as Homi Bhabha,\u000d\u000a      proposes that tradition is as constructed and changeable as modernity. She\u000d\u000a      educates Shobana Jeyasingh Dance Company dancers to forego easy definition\u000d\u000a      of Indian dance and tradition, and instead, question what E.J. Hobsbawm\u000d\u000a      and T.O. Ranger call the `invention of tradition'. Recent works include Classic\u000a        Cut (2012), Bruise Blood (2009), and her site-specific works\u000d\u000a      TooMortal (2011) and Counterpoint (2010). Her work has\u000d\u000a      toured in Britain, Europe, North America and Asia. Over the audit period,\u000d\u000a      regular ACE funding has enabled her to stage and tour new works and\u000d\u000a      undertake educational work (circa &#163;1,605,000, with committed ACE funding\u000d\u000a      until 2015 of a further &#163;550,000). Jeyasingh is also in regular demand as\u000d\u000a      an educator, mentor and public speaker. Besides producing site-specific\u000d\u000a      performances, Jeyasingh has led a workshop-tour in India (2010), workshops\u000d\u000a      with young people at Mulberry School (2012), training and mentoring with\u000d\u000a      emerging artists at Back to the Lab (Sadler's Wells, 2013), Collolab (East\u000d\u000a      London Dance, 2010), Choreogata (Southbank, 2011), and Choreographic\u000d\u000a      Collisions (Venice Biennale, 2012), and contributed to the GCSE dance\u000d\u000a      syllabus (2009).\u000d\u000a    Through significant texts, web pages (www.ResCen.net)\u000d\u000a      and DVDs (e.g., Animating Architecture: Foliage Chorus, 2008),\u000d\u000a      Jeyasingh enables wide access to her creative processes and research. In\u000d\u000a      the edited book Navigating the Unknown (Eds. Bannerman, Sofar and\u000d\u000a      Watt, 2006), she describes, through conversation with Susan Melrose\u000d\u000a      (Professor in Performance, Middlesex), how when dancing Bharatha Natyam in\u000d\u000a      Britain `you are immediately surrounded by the politics of cultural\u000d\u000a      diversity' (p258). Locating her research within a (post)postcolonial\u000d\u000a      choreographic discourse, she discusses the influence of her classical\u000d\u000a      Indian dance training and Rushdie's essays in a radio essay for Under\u000d\u000a        the Influence (BBC Radio 3, March 2011).\u000d\u000a    The concerns of this research found resonance with Janet O'Shea's work\u000d\u000a      (former Reader at Middlesex). O'Shea focused on the politics of\u000d\u000a      representation in contemporary South Asian dance and her outputs included\u000d\u000a      a number of essays that addressed Jeyasingh's work, including the\u000d\u000a      monograph: At Home in the World: Bharata Natyam on the Global Stage,\u000d\u000a      Wesleyan University Press (2007). Jeyasingh's work has found connections\u000d\u000a      with Alex Kolb's (Reader in Dance, 2011- current) work on dance politics\u000d\u000a      and with the discourses on international exchange in the DansCross project\u000d\u000a      (directed by Prof Chris Bannerman with Jeyasingh as co-researcher).\u000d\u000a    Her research is recognised internationally and is the subject of academic\u000d\u000a      papers\/essays, by dance scholars like Prof Valerie Briginshaw (Dance,\u000d\u000a        Space, Subjectivity, Palgrave, 2009) and Dr. Avanthi Meduri (essays\u000d\u000a      in Asian Theatre Journal, 2008, Dance Research Journal,\u000d\u000a      2011, and online). Briginshaw says that Jeyasingh, in her choreography,\u000d\u000a      explores contemporary, urban subjectivity for Indian womanhood,\u000d\u000a      `illuminated by ideas about nomadic subjectivity'. As Jeyasingh says,\u000d\u000a      making work that utilizes multiple techniques is not about `choosing this\u000d\u000a      or that, we are already in a situation where the interconnections are so\u000d\u000a      complex...'. Many of her works place women in sites normally considered to\u000d\u000a      be patriarchal, like the urban London business sector, and historical\u000d\u000a      churches, and brings in feminist sensibilities that privilege sensory\u000d\u000a      experience and inter- connectedness over ritual and tradition. Reflecting\u000d\u000a      on the responses to Jeyasingh's 2010 presentations and interviews in\u000d\u000a      Dehli, Meduri notes that there is a `diasporic aesthetic that is shot\u000d\u000a      through with historic Indian references, in a personal matrix of her own\u000d\u000a      making, this is the trace paradox that lies at the heart of Jeyasingh's\u000d\u000a      work'.

Lee fosters an environment of mindful attention and\u000a      group creativity to empower\u000a      participants to develop work on issues that are important to them.\u000a      Participants include therapeutic,\u000a      inter-generational and inclusive groups, who experience a humane approach\u000a      to dance practice,\u000a      and take the qualities of mindful listening and touch into their lives.\u000a    Nature and extent of the impact\u000a    For participant dancers:\u000a    Feedback from participants says that Lee's work significantly impacts\u000a      their lives and work, because\u000a      of her use of care and attention with inclusive and intergenerational\u000a      participants. The influence of\u000a      her work on individuals is evident in their responses and the communities\u000a      of interest built through\u000a      engagement with Lee's work. A few of her participants have gone into dance\u000a      training, some have\u000a      danced in other intergenerational dance projects, and an 84-year-old\u000a      participant has gone on to get\u000a      a gold medal in ballroom dancing. A Skinner Release Technique practitioner\u000a      says that as a young\u000a      mother at the time that she participated in Common Dance,\u000a      she felt listened to by Lee. She says\u000a      that Lee works with people from diverse races, genders, class and\u000a      nationalities, and her close\u000a      attention to people and their childhood memories, helps diverse groups\u000a      find common ground and is\u000a      a path-breaking method for community arts practice. A medical General\u000a      Practitioner finds that\u000a      Lee's `incredibly generous' work helps participants move through creative\u000a      blocks, deal with grief,\u000a      and in his work, helps him negotiate the use of touch with patients.\u000a      Participants stay in touch on\u000a      active Facebook pages and Lee says that for new pieces, she can readily\u000a      access participants from\u000a      those lists.\u000a    On arts practice:\u000a    Inclusive dance practice and site-specific work benefit from Lee's\u000a      processes through international\u000a      workshops and mentoring, and wide dissemination of work. As the\u000a      retired-director of the\u000a      Foundation for Community Dance, Ken Bartlett, says, the work differs from\u000a      the tradition of a\u000a      choreographer\/director working with trained dancers who follow\u000a      instructions for a set piece, and\u000a      uses mindful group work that empowers community participants. Resulting\u000a      DVD, papers,\u000a      symposium, workshops and performances allow other practitioners to learn\u000a      from her approach and\u000a      undertake inclusive work. Dr. Martin Whelton, a Senior Lecturer in Theatre\u000a      and Performance at\u000a      Queen Mary, says that Lee has developed a new practice-as-research\u000a      methodology that allows for\u000a      an accounting of arts work.\u000a    Lee is invited to teach workshops and courses internationally. These\u000a      invites are evidence of her\u000a      international reputation and show further routes to impact. On 24-27 July,\u000a      2012, Lee led an\u000a      International Summer School for the Foundation for Community Dance, De\u000a      Montfort University,\u000a      attended by seven artists and led a choreography session for three other\u000a      Summer School groups.\u000a      Feedback reveals that course participants found Lee's sessions inspiring,\u000a      especially her way of\u000a      working with trained and non-trained dancers, and her sharing of values\u000a      for participatory practice.\u000a      In 2012, Lee gave a talk for British Dance Edition at three venues to\u000a      international promoters, on\u000a      site-specific work for a 100 people; a talk for 20 post-graduate students\u000a      at The Place on engaging\u000a      the audience; a workshop for choreographers at The Place on working in\u000a      education; with artsadmin\u000a      she hosted a Columbian dance company with members from disadvantaged\u000a      backgrounds; a\u000a      workshop for community participants at Chisenhale Dance Space; a guest\u000a      workshop at Norfolk\u000a      Dance; a workshop at Brighton SEDAnce on working outdoors; a workshop for\u000a      young graduates at\u000a      Independent Dance; and a summer school on community arts in Tampere,\u000a      Finland for 70 people.\u000a    In 2011, Lee led a seminar on creative reflection called `Collaborate\u000a      Evaluate Create' for the\u000a      Foundation for Community Dance at Yorkshire Dance, for 20 participants. In\u000a      2010, she presented\u000a      a talk about her process to the Office of Social Inclusion and Culture,\u000a      developed works, including\u000a      one commissioned by Crossover Dance, Oxford, for 12 intergenerational\u000a      performers, and for\u000a      parents and children for Bloomsbury Festival. In 2009, she led a workshop\u000a      for the FCD conference\u000a      in Glasgow; a seminar at The Place for choreographers working with young\u000a      people; workshops\u000a      with Plymouth University dance students on participatory practice, with a\u000a      master class for local\u000a      artists; a conference presentation on intergenerational work by Bubble\u000a      Theatre; a workshop with\u000a      Suffolk artists, on sensory experience of the natural environment and the\u000a      somatic experiences of\u000a      the dancer; a sharing of her process with artists at Crossing Borders,\u000a      Independent Dance; a talk on\u000a      the process of making collaborative work to artists from Beijing at\u000a      Middlesex University; and she\u000a      worked as choreographer in residence in Limassol, Cyprus, where she\u000a      developed a site-specific\u000a      work.\u000a    On audiences:\u000a    The Artistic Director of Dance Umbrella, Betsy Gregory, says that Lee's\u000a      work has a significant\u000a      impact on people who watch it, leaving audience members incredibly moved\u000a      and often in tears.\u000a      She says that the biggest contribution that Lee makes is that even though\u000a      her work is inclusive and\u000a      participatory, and includes dancers and non-dancers from the community,\u000a      Lee never loses sight of\u000a      artistic goals and makes work of the highest artistic quality. Audiences\u000a      see work that is\u000a      participatory and inter-generational, and based on real, everyday and very\u000a      humane themes.\u000a      Feedback from audiences in comments books is overwhelmingly positive.\u000a      Audience members\u000a      comment on how moving it is to watch Lee's work, how effortlessly she\u000a      carries out inter-\u000a      generational work, how connected the participants seem, and how much care\u000a      goes into the work.\u000a      Martin Green, Head of Ceremonies at the London 2012 Olympics and\u000a      Para-Olympics said in a\u000a      comments book that he has never seen participatory and cross-generational\u000a      work that is so\u000a      effortless and powerful. Professor Theresa Buckland found the piece\u000a      `genuinely moving,' while a\u000a      researcher from Wales Louise Ritchie found it uplifting. In an evaluation\u000a      carried out for Square\u000a          Dances, participants said that the experience was enabling,\u000a      empowering, moving, memorable and\u000a      inspirational.\u000a    Collectively the commentaries present evidence of impact that is both\u000a      highly personal - evoking\u000a      change for individuals' sense of themselves and of others: and highly\u000a      influential - promoting new\u000a      forms of best professional arts practice in inclusive, inter-generational\u000a      dance.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Through community arts practice based on the principles of mindfulness,\u000a      choreographer Rosemary\u000a      Lee works with inclusive, therapeutic and inter-generational groups, as\u000a      well as artists and dancers,\u000a      using unique elements: close attention through touch and mindful\u000a      listening.

Further, in 2009, Lee\u000a      undertook a British Council-funded tour in Japan, where research questions\u000a      included how to work\u000a      in diverse cultural locations. This included artistic work, workshops,\u000a      talks and papers at the\u000a      International Video Dance Festival in Tokyo, Beppu Festival, and Kyoto\u000a      Arts Centre, reaching 200\u000a      people. These projects, as well as Banquet Dances (2011), A\u000a        Nightingale Sang (2010), and\u000a      Passage (2001) deal with intergenerational, inclusive and\u000a      site-specific concerns.\u000a    For Common Dance, in 2009, Lee worked with Coventry\u000a      University BA dance students. Research\u000a      questions explored how to translate common ground between diverse\u000a      participants into dance\u000a      motifs. A two-week lab at Siobhan Davies Studio explored how to enhance\u000a      awareness of\u000a      environmental issues. In 2010, Lee presented at a Community Dance Practice\u000a      conference in\u000a      Sweden, for 70 people, on how to work with integrated groups, and with\u000a      Candoco and Greenwich\u000a      Dance, led an inclusive workshop for 50 dancers. Lee used improvisational\u000a      tasks, and explored\u000a      how to increase mobility and utilise available resources for disabled\u000a      dancers in site-specific work.\u000a    In 2009, Dance Umbrella \/Greenwich Dance commissioned Lee to make Common\u000a          Dance, in\u000a      collaboration with composer Terry Mann. In 2011, Dance Umbrella\u000a      commissioned Lee to make\u000a      Square Dances, a large-scale outdoor performance for over\u000a      200 dancers. Common Dance has\u000a      generated scholarly articles and a ResCen symposium at Queen Mary\u000a      University, on 1 December\u000a      2012, for international artists, researchers, leaders, social workers, and\u000a      health and well-being\u000a      professionals. Dr Martin Welton's article `Listening-as-Touch: Paying\u000a      Attention to Rosemary Lee's\u000a      Common Dance' (Performance Research: A Journal of the Performing Arts,\u000a      Taylor &amp; Francis, Vol.\u000a      15, Issue 3, 2010), describes the corporeal and site-specific qualities of\u000a      the work. There were 48\u000a      participants in the piece, including eight dancers, and 51 choir members\u000a      from Finchley Children's\u000a      Music Group, ranging in age from eight to 84. Six performances took place\u000a      at Greenwich Dance\u000a      Agency in 2009, with 1085 audience members. A meet-the-artist event\u000a      attracted 50 people, and\u000a      led to a half-day seminar and exhibition developed with ResCen.\u000a    Square Dances was commissioned by Dance Umbrella, in\u000a      association with Rosemary Lee\u000a      Projects and Artsadmin, sponsored by Bloomberg, and supported by the Place\u000a      and Grants for the\u000a      Arts ACE. The work premiered in October 2011, and was performed six times\u000a      a day in four\u000a      squares. There were 96 women in Gordon, 34 men in Brunswick, 10 children\u000a      in Woburn, and 21\u000a      third year students from London Contemporary Dance School in Queens. To\u000a      mindful listening and\u000a      touch, Lee added a site-specificity, where participants paid acute\u000a      attention to the act of passing\u000a      through London. In 2012, Melt Down emerged out of Square\u000a          Dances, with 32 performers in Rio\u000a      De Janeiro, Brazil. It was reconstructed for Dance Umbrella, 2012. Lee\u000a      received &#163;115,325 from\u000a      Dance Umbrella, and corporate sponsors.\u000a    These research projects have given rise to insights by Lee into the ways\u000a      in which dance and\u000a      choreographic practice can enable, and be enabled by, mindfulness and\u000a      touch to activate\u000a      individual and group creativity while re-envisioning `community' dance\u000a      practices.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4681","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"149590","Name":"Tanzania"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"337996","Name":"Ethiopia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The UK success of Destino (in part by showcasing new work by\u000a      leading choreographers like Benjamin, Maliphant and Hofesh Schechter) led\u000a      to a similar project in Ethiopia. While the programme at Sadler's Wells\u000a      featured a large-scale intergenerational community piece including groups\u000a      of hard-to-reach young people, it did not include performers with physical\u000a      disabilities. Its counterpart in Addis Ababa, Wekt (Four Seasons)\u000a      - made as part of Destino in Ethiopia and staged alongside A\u000a        Holding Space - was performed by a mixed ability cast of 50\u000a      including the Potentials dancers (10 with post-polio paralysis and one in\u000a      a wheelchair with severe cerebral palsy). Wekt was choreographed\u000a      by Sendi and Demissie, who says that working with Benjamin and Maliphant\u000a      on A Holding Space significantly helped to refine their own skills\u000a      in co- choreography.\u000a    According to Dance United's Evaluation Report, Destino in\u000a      Ethiopia secured large enthusiastic audiences (2700 people over 2 days at\u000a      the National Theatre), gave disadvantaged individuals hope and\u000a      self-respect, enabled Sendi and Demise to become future cultural leaders,\u000a      and precipitated change for the better within Ethiopian communities. It\u000a      quoted one member of the audience as saying that \"three thousand people\u000a        ... will leave the auditorium with a completely different picture about\u000a        the role of the disabled ... Those messages will be passed on.\"\u000a    Since 2009, Sendi and Denissie have separately choreographed three\u000a      different integrated pieces that have toured to venues across Ethiopia as\u000a      well as Tanzania, Ghana, and South Africa. They say that Benjamin \"helped\u000a        in making us into experts\" and that he continues to remind them of\u000a      the importance of detail, depth and the role of improvisation, through\u000a      which one discovers \"how [a dancer's] body works... where you can give\u000a        weight\" (Sendi, 2013), in choreographing for integrated companies.\u000a    In 2010, Sendi and Demissie became co-directors of Adugna. Now also a\u000a      judge on Ethiopian Idol, Sendi says that this means \"I need to\u000a      ensure the development of contemporary dance in my country\". This is\u000a      clearly an inclusive vision; to mark the \"re-creation of the company\" he\u000a      choreographed an integrated piece called Adwa with the Potentials.\u000a      The aim is for the Potentials to consistently participate in all three\u000a      elements of Adugna's mission: contemporary dance performances \"from the\u000a        community, to the community\", outreach, and international\u000a      performances. The company website states that \"The impact of the\u000a        expanding community outreach work with other young disabled people and\u000a        [the Potentials'] performances cannot be underestimated.\"\u000a    In March 2013, building on the momentum of A Holding Space,\u000a      Benjamin returned to Ethiopia to research the second edition of Making\u000a        an Entrance and to run a choreographic lab, mentoring Sendi and\u000a      Demissie during the development of new integrated performances using\u000a      improvisatory strategies. In interviews with nine members of Adugna who\u000a      had worked with Benjamin both between 2000-2003 and in 2013, all mention\u000a      the personal motivation of changing Ethiopian attitudes toward disabled\u000a      people. For able-bodied members, this is modeled on their own experiences\u000a      of working with disabled dancers for the first time, and for those with\u000a      disabilities, it is tied to their increasing sense of self-esteem,\u000a      standard of living and professional expectations. All speak of Benjamin's\u000a      role in helping to create these personal opportunities.\u000a    Yitsadel says that, \"when I was a child, I couldn't go to school, I\u000a        couldn't find the work. I couldn't do things, I couldn't go on the\u000a        transportation so I felt like I was living other people's lives... I\u000a        want those things to change [for others].\" Andualem Kebede says that\u000a      \"when I move in the space I feel free; I feel very proud... in the\u000a        street, when people are watching me I [think it is] because they\u000a        probably saw me on TV dancing. So, I don't think they are watching me\u000a        because I'm disabled.\" Tilahun Jemaneh competed as a powerlifter in\u000a      the 2004 Paralympics and now is a sports teacher. He believes that the\u000a      only way to change negative attitudes toward disability in Ethiopia is by\u000a      showing strength and capability \"in action\". He says Adugna gave him the\u000a      confidence, strength and performance skills (including `a sense of\u000a      audience') to compete on a national and international stage and that he\u000a      earns more than his other disabled colleagues because of this experience\u000a      and expertise. Terefwork Negussie, who is unable to move or to talk, says\u000a      that she \"learned how to express what she feels inside through\u000a        movement\" and that she wants to become a choreographer. Benjamin has\u000a      put her in contact with Lisa Simpson, a profoundly disabled dancer in the\u000a      UK with whom he developed `the Simpson Board'. This allows people with no\u000a      speech and limited voluntary control over their muscles to communicate\u000a      ideas about movement in a studio.\u000a    Opportunities for funding via NGOs have been cut severely in Ethiopia;\u000a      Adugna is currently on the verge of losing its studio due to\u000a      redevelopment. The Potentials were unable to train and perform together\u000a      during 2012 because there wasn't enough money to pay allowances (to\u000a      replace other income) or transportation expenses to rehearsals. Benjamin's\u000a      choreographic lab had a galvanising effect; the company was able to work\u000a      together daily for 2 weeks to create new performances to act as `calling\u000a      cards' in their renewed fight for visibility and funding. His visit also\u000a      enabled connections to be made with Addis Ababa University for the first\u000a      time, presenting work-in-progress to a large group of postgraduate\u000a      students, and opening opportunities to use the University's resources to\u000a      help sustain the company.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Although Adam Benjamin's research has greatly influenced contemporary\u000a      dance in the UK and elsewhere through his development and advocacy of\u000a      inclusive practice, this case study focuses on his impact on contemporary\u000a      dance and disability culture in Ethiopia.

Although predating\u000a      Benjamin's employment by Plymouth University in 2008 (prior to which he\u000a      was an independent practitioner-scholar), his commitment to each,\u000a      separately and together, has continued to shape and characterise his\u000a      research. This is largely disseminated as reflexive practice-as-research\u000a      as a facilitator and choreographer within professional contexts. His\u000a      researching of integrated choreography, through productions such as Slight\u000a      (2008) and This Is (2010), aims to resist increasingly dominant\u000a      expectations of professional inclusive dance practice that revolve around\u000a      the virtuosity of `disabled' bodies. Especially when interrogating the\u000a      moves between `community' and `professional' contexts, Benjamin has thus\u000a      sought to offer alternative models of choreographic structures, both\u000a      formal and poetic, to enable dancers of very differing physicality to\u000a      co-exist as equal contributors upon the stage.\u000a    In 2000, supported by the British Council, Benjamin made a series of\u000a      research visits to Ethiopia to evaluate the possible outcomes of an arts\u000a      intervention with disadvantaged groups. As a result, he brought together a\u000a      group of young people with disabilities (later known as Adugna Potentials)\u000a      and introduced them to the Adugna, the country's first contemporary dance\u000a      company (founded in 1996). He worked with Adugna to explore how integrated\u000a      dance could be embedded within the company's ethos and how it could be\u000a      developed in an Ethiopian context. Benjamin questioned whether, and how,\u000a      this practice could offer anything of value in a region of extreme poverty\u000a      and in a culture that shuns disabled people. In Making an Entrance:\u000a        Theory and Practice for Disabled and Non-Disabled Dancers (2002), he\u000a      suggested that \"Adugna dancers might be able to use their performance\u000a      skills as a way of raising awareness and... introduce dance as a social,\u000a      artistic and remedial activity\". Reflecting on his research in Ethiopia\u000a      and elsewhere, the book presents a model of performance that takes into\u000a      account ethics, access, competition, group dynamics and training.\u000a    In 2009, Benjamin co-choreographed A Holding Space at Sadler's\u000a      Wells with Russell Maliphant for the dancers Junaid Jemal Sendi and Addisu\u000a      Demissie, as part of Dance United's Destino programme. Sendi and\u000a      Demissie are key members of Adugna, and Benjamin had worked with them when\u000a      they were children. A Holding Space researched how to choreograph\u000a      intersubjectivity and lived experience - in particular, that of the\u000a      dancers who had transitioned from street children, through community\u000a      dance, to professional artists. Benjamin's approach drew upon his on-going\u000a      investigation of improvisation in his performances as a founding member of\u000a      5 Men Dancing (2008 and 2010), as well as with Kirstie Simson, Kenzo\u000a      Kusuda, Jordi Cort&#233;s, Chieko Matsumura and Takugi Oyamada. This practice\u000a      centres on `deep listening', refined through Benjamin's experiential\u000a      modelling of integrated dance in which one must hear and respond to\u000a      unfamiliar and `other' bodies, as a springboard from which to blur art and\u000a      life.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4682","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    This project has transformed research that focuses on the therapeutic\u000d      value of music technology, by taking it out of the controlled environment\u000d      of a laboratory and applying it within in a hospital setting. It has\u000d      brought together developments in brain scanning analysis and automatic\u000d      music composition technologies, generating an effective new approach to\u000d      the creation of assistive music technology for people with severe physical\u000d      disability. The research conducted at the Royal Hospital for\u000d      Neuro-disability had a profound impact upon the patient, raising her\u000d      confidence and sense of wellbeing. The patient - who communicates to a\u000d      carer via eye movement to select letters from an alphabet table - sent the\u000d      research team a note after the first trial to say \"how much I enjoyed\u000d        the experiment yesterday. It was great to be in control again\"\u000d      (15\/05\/2010). Recalling the impact of the experience, the patient\u000d      commented on the \"freedom it gave me. There was never anyone to give\u000d        me orders, and I was able to take my own decisions. It was very easy to\u000d        follow, and although no Mozart, I soon forgot the passing of time\"\u000d      (05\/06\/2011). The technology enabled her to demonstrate skill and ability\u000d      which the able-bodied people around her did not have (e.g. control of an\u000d      eye gaze system).\u000d    By embedding innovative music technology into the hectic, busy schedule\u000d      of a hospital routine, one of the major barriers of medical research was\u000d      broken. According to Dr Wendy Magee, previously Head of Music Therapy at\u000d      the hospital, this research \"offered staff an opportunity to see\u000d        cutting edge research first hand; enabled them to see the impact of\u000d        research on patient benefit; offered opportunity for interdisciplinary\u000d        collaboration, particularly in terms of advising on the clinical\u000d        practicality of the equipment being developed and publication; brought\u000d        science into the clinic; and offers models of collaboration between\u000d        clinicians, designers and scientists which is best practice\"\u000d      (18\/07\/2012).\u000d    Hospital staff stated that \"Theoretically, we knew that the system\u000d        should be helpful for people with disability. Now we have the\u000d        demonstrable proof\" (18\/03\/2011). By working with staff throughout\u000d      the process the researchers ensured this technology was suitable for the\u000d      hospital environment. The approach helped to create a strong partnership\u000d      and encouraged medical staff to embrace academic research to benefit their\u000d      own work. The research introduced resident music therapists, nurses and\u000d      carers to a new tool for communicating with patients and a way of thinking\u000d      about using BCMI technology in their practice, by demonstrating the system\u000d      with one of their patients in situ. As a member of staff commented: \"What\u000d        the technology is enabling is to put the complex and severe disability\u000d        in the background and someone's creativity and expression in the\u000d        foreground. Beyond the obvious enjoyment that this gives to the patient,\u000d        it also enables the clinicians to interact with the patient in a new way\u000d        opening up new avenues for therapy and recreational activities\"\u000d      (06\/06\/2011).\u000d    Following the publication of this research in Music and Medicine,\u000d      it was featured in Nature, attracting the attention of the media\u000d      worldwide (18\/03\/2011) including CNN and BBC World Service. The\u000d        Independent hailed the research as \"making medical history\"\u000d      (04\/04\/2011). This exposure provided the opportunity to communicate the\u000d      research to the public on a global level and generated a great number of\u000d      requests by institutions and individuals worldwide interested in adopting\u000d      the technology. Enterprising companies (e.g., g.TEC, Austria and\u000d      Grooveshark.com, USA) have made contact to discuss forms of exploitation.\u000d      In 2013, The Plymouth Community Healthcare Trust is starting to use the\u000d      equipment trialled originally at the Royal Hospital for Neuro- disability\u000d      to support a patient with locked-in syndrome.\u000d    This research has been further developed as part of our current\u000d      EPSRC-funded project with neuroscientists at Reading University,\u000d      \"Brain-Computer Music Interface for Monitoring and Inducing Affective\u000d      States\" (2011-2016). One of its first creative outputs, Miranda's Symphony\u000d        of Minds Listening, premiered at the Peninsula Arts Contemporary\u000d      Music Festival 2013. Miranda composed this piece using the new methods he\u000d      developed to convert fMRI brain scans information into music. These\u000d      methods, also the basis for the assistive technology for music-making by\u000d      people with severe disabilities, are central to the implementation of the\u000d      new generation of brain-computer music interfaces he is developing for\u000d      inducing emotions.\u000d    Symphony of Minds Listening complemented the overarching theme of\u000d      the Contemporary Music Festival, that of memory and consciousness. It was\u000d      the best attended event of the Festival, which had a total audience of\u000d      approximately 700 (of whom 70% were members of the general public). The\u000d      work prompted debate and critical analysis in the national media, having\u000d      been featured in publications such as The New Statesman\u000d      (21\/02\/2013), The Sunday Times (19\/05\/2013) and The Telegraph\u000d      (25\/02\/2013). Professor Miranda was also interviewed on national BBC\u000d      radio. In its review, Gramophone commended: \"Such experiments can\u000d      often impress on a scientific level but disappoint aesthetically and\u000d      artistically, but Miranda's Symphony of Minds Listening achieved a\u000d      neat balance between both elements\" (26\/02\/2013).\u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    This research developed brain-computer interfacing technology, which has\u000d      enabled people with severe physical disability to interact with and create\u000d      music.

Our research provided a solution based on a\u000d      neurological phenomenon known as SSVEP (Steady State Visually Evoked\u000d      Potentials). These natural responses to visual stimulation at specific\u000d      frequencies produce signals that can be detected in the EEG. When a person\u000d      with sensors placed on the scalp looks at different flashing lights at\u000d      specific frequencies, it shows up in their EEG, and a computer can be\u000d      programmed to infer at which icon they are staring. The team created\u000d      musical algorithms that translate specific EEG signals associated with the\u000d      light frequencies of different icons into distinct musical processes.\u000d      Looking at one icon sounds a certain note or produces a certain rhythm;\u000d      staring at another changes its pitch, and so on. The technique was\u000d      developed with biomedical engineers at Essex University and therapists at\u000d      the Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability, London. Therapists were then\u000d      interviewed to assess practical needs in the field; they highlighted the\u000d      necessity for the technology to be easy to use, quick to set up, reliable\u000d      and not requiring constant input from technicians. Based on this feedback,\u000d      a proof-of-concept system was developed between January 2008 and July\u000d      2010, which realised the possibility of conducting research outside of the\u000d      laboratory setting. The system was trialled with hospital staff and a\u000d      patient, who had locked- in syndrome after suffering a severe stroke.\u000d    Essex University's contribution to the project (1 staff and 1 PhD\u000d      student) supported computer programming and implementation of the EEG\u000d      analysis algorithms. The Royal Hospital for Neuro- disability (2 staff and\u000d      nurses) provided consultancy, advice on health &amp; safety, liaison with\u000d      the patient and support during the trials.\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4899","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Oxford Opera research has contributed to a significant broadening of the\u000a      contemporary operatic\u000a      audience. Public understanding and appreciation of the genre have been\u000a      improved, and operatic\u000a      works have thus been rendered accessible to those without formal musical\u000a      education. Public\u000a      engagement with opera has been enhanced through the recreation and\u000a      promotion of historical\u000a      performance modes, and new audiences have been engaged through specially\u000a      designed target\u000a      works for children and radio listeners. The interactive space created by\u000a      NCO has equipped a\u000a      number of young opera practitioners with the knowledge, skills and\u000a      experience they require for a\u000a      successful career in operatic performance and\/or production.\u000a    Enhancing Public Understanding and Appreciation of Opera\u000a    Aspden's research on Handel has informed frequent TV and Radio features\u000a      throughout the\u000a      census period. A particular highlight was her regular contribution to the\u000a      extensive media coverage\u000a      of Handel's anniversary year in 2009, including a year-long Handel blog on\u000a      the BBC website [Section\u000a          5: i], discussion of Handel on BBC Radio 3's Opera on 3\u000a      and Composer of the Week, and on the\u000a      BBC4 TV series The Birth of British Music, Opera Italia,\u000a      and Opera's Fallen Women. The impact of\u000a      Aspden's research, communicated to a wider public in this manner, is\u000a      attested by her evident\u000a      popularity with producers: she has been asked to return for further\u000a      contributions to broadcasts and\u000a      documentaries (such as BBC4's The Symphony). An Oxford Music\u000a      graduate working on Radio 3's\u000a      The Choir observed, \"Notably, several people there asked if I knew\u000a      you [Aspden], and proceeded\u000a      to describe you as the best they've ever had and `not stuffy like most\u000a      academics'.\"[1]\u000a    The BBC Radio 3 programmes to which Cross regularly contributes achieve\u000a      significant average\u000a      listener reach of around 1.9m[ii]. He has contributed, for\u000a      example, to Opera on 3, (Birtwistle's The\u000a        Minotaur [31 May 2008] and Harvey's Wagner Dream [5 May\u000a      2012]) and Radio 3's flagship\u000a      programme Music Matters (Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress\u000a      [10 March 2012]), on which Saxton\u000a      also frequently appears. Cross's repeat invitations to discuss\u000a      contemporary opera on Radio 3 and\u000a      BBC4 Proms broadcasts (e.g., live from the 2009 performance of\u000a      Birtwistle's The Mask of\u000a        Orpheus), and at public events for orchestras and opera companies\u000a      such as Glyndebourne and\u000a      English National Opera, attest to his ability to communicate about\u000a      \"difficult\" contemporary music to\u000a      a non-specialist audience. The chief producer of the BBC Symphony\u000a      Orchestra has written:\u000a      \"Professor Cross is exceptional &amp; outstanding in his ability to\u000a      communicate clearly &amp; engagingly\u000a      about challenging contemporary classical music to a general public. He is\u000a      greatly valued by the\u000a      BBC.\"[2] His online introduction to Stravinsky's Oedipus\u000a        Rex for the Philharmonia Orchestra has so\u000a      far received over 12,000 viewings [iii]. One YouTube\u000a      viewer commented: \"Thx for this. I'm a late\u000a      starter in opera. The discussion gives me the courage to approach OR\u000a      - indeed, to listen to\u000a      Stravinsky.\" Cross gave a lecture on Stravinsky's Paris stage works as\u000a      part of The Rest is Noise\u000a      Festival, 2013, to an audience of over 200, and the SoundCloud recording\u000a      of the event has already\u000a      received over 600 \"listens\".

With its own\u000a      Baroque orchestra, The Band of Instruments, NCO has produced recordings of\u000a      Charpentier's\u000a      stage music and a collected edition of Rameau's cantatas for the ASV\u000a      label. Appearances outside\u000a      Oxford have included concerts and productions at the Tudeley and Southwark\u000a      Festivals, London's\u000a      South Bank and the National Gallery.\u000a    Williams's work brings the neglected stage music of Rameau to the\u000a      attention of a wide\u000a      audience, through well-received public performances in Oxford and London,\u000a      and associated public\u000a      events such as the interdisciplinary \"Rameau in Oxford\" study afternoon.\u000a      His collaboration with the\u000a      OAE is also proving to be of great developmental value to the\u000a      professionals with whom he is\u000a      working. The Chief Executive of the OAE writes, \"These projects have\u000a      already been ... of\u000a      enormous benefit to the musicians of the OAE, who have been given the\u000a      opportunity of developing\u000a      their existing knowledge of the performance of eighteenth-century French\u000a      Baroque music, and\u000a      equipping them with the skills to perform with greater confidence and\u000a      stylistic precision in the\u000a      future.\" [3]\u000a    Creation of New Operatic Works for Target Audiences\u000a    Harry's children's opera demonstrably reached well beyond the academic\u000a      community, and has\u000a      been particularly successful in breaking down barriers conventionally\u000a      associated with\u000a      contemporary art music [4]. \"Opera is often perceived\u000a      to be an elitist art-form [...] but if we fail to\u000a      introduce young people to opera then there will be a whole generation who\u000a      become excluded from\u000a      a potentially rich art-form. This production [of Harry's My Mother\u000a        Told Me Not To Stare] is making a\u000a      feisty, concerned effort to create an operetta that speaks to young\u000a      people's concerns yet engages\u000a      the adults accompanying them\" (www.thepublicreviews.com)\u000a      [ v]. \"[Harry's opera is] a brave\u000a      attempt to make what is essentially high art accessible to its target\u000a      audience of children over eight\"\u000a      (Cumberland News).The benefit in particular to the many children\u000a      who experienced the opera and\u000a      took part in linked school workshops has been transformative, and is\u000a      documented in the feedback\u000a      on blogs and websites. One child said: \"I'm used to listening to rock\u000a      music so this was something\u000a      very different for me and it made an immediate impression on me.\" [vi]\u000a      The opera's reach was\u000a      extensive: a critically acclaimed 7-week national tour visited such venues\u000a      as Darlington Arts\u000a      Centre, Middlesbrough Town Hall, The Unicorn Theatre (London), Ammanford\u000a      Theatre and the\u000a      Nuffield Theatre Southampton, as well as schools and community centres. A\u000a      second season\u000a      (2012) toured from Huddersfield to Bath, Runcorn to Norwich. The total\u000a      audience was 2931, with\u000a      an additional c.800 attending workshops.\u000a    The Wandering Jew was premiered on BBC Radio 3 on 9 July 2010 by\u000a      the BBC Symphony\u000a      Orchestra and BBC Singers, conducted by Andr&#233; de Ridder; a commercial\u000a      recording of the opera\u000a      was issued by NMC. It has brought opera to new audiences in spaces away\u000a      from the conventional\u000a      opera house, free of charge. \"This project blew me away [...] Saxton's\u000a      tonal (or modal) musical\u000a      language ranges from the cinematic spectacular to rapt spirituality\" (The\u000a        Times, ***** review,\u000a      11June 2011) [vii]. Unlike the majority of opera\u000a      broadcasts, which consist of recordings of staged\u000a      works, The Wandering Jew was composed specifically for radio [text\u000a      removed for publication] [viii]\u000a      and the associated recording is available to purchase. The opera's\u000a      premiere and CD release [vii]\u000a      was covered extensively in the national press and supported by composer\u000a      interviews on radio and\u000a      via the NMC website, thus reaching well beyond academic audiences.\u000a      Listeners tweeted: \"Robert\u000a      Saxton's The Wandering Jew @nmcrecordings is an accessible modern opera of\u000a      great humanity\"\u000a      (@clivepaget); \"Released on 13 June: Robert Saxton's overwhelming\u000a      choral masterpiece:\u000a      Wandering Jew, on NMC: a powerful listen...\" (@vatdaddy).\u000a    Career Training and Development for Young Practitioners\u000a    NCO has a particular commitment to the development of young singers,\u000a      accompanists and arts\u000a      administrators, through the NCO Studio, repetiteur scheme, and\u000a      administrator internship [ix]. Each\u000a      year the studio stages two student productions and a recital series of\u000a      twenty-four concerts in which\u000a      they take part, with repertoire choice and production style primarily led\u000a      by the ongoing research of\u000a      Faculty members. The repetiteur scholarship is designed for pianists\u000a      wishing to further their skills\u000a      as a repetiteur, accompanist or conductor, and involves assisting in\u000a      rehearsals, performances and\u000a      with the training of singers for NCO, and helping to organise and run\u000a      practical musical activities.\u000a      The administrative intern acts as assistant to the Company's director,\u000a      dealing with the smooth\u000a      running and marketing of the Company.

The Wandering Jew had a prolonged genesis over\u000a      more than ten years as\u000a      Saxton researched and developed the scenario and libretto from a broad\u000a      range of sources and\u000a      then rethought aspects of his compositional technique (via associated\u000a      works) in order to meet the\u000a      new challenge of composing an opera specifically for radio.

Harry's research\u000a      resulted in his composition of a chamber opera for children, My Mother\u000a        Told Me Not to Stare [2], a\u000a      collaboration with leading Australian children's author Finegan\u000a      Kruckemeyer and pioneering UK-\u000a      based drama groups Theatre Hullabaloo and Action Transport Theatre. The\u000a      principal research\u000a      challenge was in arriving at an operatic language suitable for a young\u000a      audience; plot and music\u000a      were developed during an extensive series of workshops and school events.\u000a    Oxford researchers also play a prominent role in researching\u000a      twentieth-century and\u000a      contemporary opera. Cross's research engages broadly with historical,\u000a      aesthetic, dramatic and\u000a      analytical issues in contemporary stage works, including a monograph on\u000a      Birtwistle's landmark\u000a      opera The Mask of Orpheus [3]. As a member of\u000a      the research group Dramaturgie musicale\u000a        contemporaine en Europe (lead institution Universit&#233; Paris VIII,\u000a      funded by l'Agence nationale de la\u000a      recherche), he has contributed to Europe-wide research into the creation\u000a      and practice of twentieth-\u000a      and twenty-first century opera, and in particular to the major project\u000a      (2010-13) on the theatre of\u000a      Luciano Berio. This is complemented by Burden's research interest in\u000a      English opera and music\u000a      theatre, the outcome of which has been explored on the stage with New\u000a      Chamber Opera (NCO,\u000a      which he co-founded), including works by Schoenberg, Stravinsky, Maxwell\u000a      Davies and Birtwistle.\u000a      His edition of Walton's one-act opera The Bear [4] resulted\u000a      in a new public staging. Burden's\u000a      principal area of research is in the English stage of the 18th century,\u000a      which has led to such\u000a      publications as his RMA monograph on Regina Mingotti's years at London's\u000a      King's Theatre. He\u000a      coordinates two databases on music on the London stage pre- and post-1800.\u000a      Through his role as\u000a      director of NCO, he is able to explore in practice on the stage the\u000a      results of this research.\u000a    Aspden, too, is an internationally recognised scholar of\u000a      eighteenth-century opera as well as co-\u000a      editor of the leading peer-reviewed Cambridge Opera Journal. Her\u000a      research covers a range of\u000a      issues surrounding performance and identity in opera, word and music\u000a      interrelationships in vocal\u000a      music, and particularly the career of Handel in England. Her long-standing\u000a      research into Handel on\u000a      the London stage culminated in the publication of the monograph The\u000a        Rival Sirens [5].\u000a    Jonathan Williams, as AHRC Cultural Engagement Fellow (since January\u000a      2013), directed the\u000a      first complete performance in modern times of Rameau's 1754 opera Anacr&#233;on,\u000a      given by\u000a      professional Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment (OAE) in the Sheldonian\u000a      Theatre in November\u000a      2012. The performance was the outcome of a decade's work by Williams\u000a      reconstructing the score\u000a      from diverse Parisian sources and studying French Baroque performance\u000a      practices. His edition\u000a      has been published in the complete Rameau Urtext edition [6]\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4900","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Usage of the current DIAMM web resource (which has nearly 25,000 unique\u000a      visitors a year, with nearly half of these visiting for the first time)\u000a      has demonstrated that it reaches far beyond the academic researchers in\u000a      musicology for whom it was originally designed. DIAMM is the only site\u000a      where medieval documents of immense range, quality, and quantity may be\u000a      consulted by anyone, anywhere in the world, and from any demographic\u000a      group, without charge. DIAMM provides the following benefits:\u000a    Enriching Resources for Early Music Performers.\u000a    There is high demand for early music both in recordings and in live\u000a      performance. The recent expansion in electronic media has vastly augmented\u000a      the demand from performers for new sources and repertoire of early music.\u000a      Professional ensembles such as Liber unUsualis (USA), the Brabant\u000a        Ensemble, Marian Consort, Alamire Consort, Tonus\u000a        Peregrinus [i] are already users of DIAMM for a\u000a      variety of purposes, and support from DIAMM directors has provided them\u000a      with expert assistance in editing music from digital facsimiles of the\u000a      primary sources, in order to prepare their own editions of the repertories\u000a      they perform. This has helped to overcome significant inaccuracies in\u000a      previous editions, and facilitated the performance of some previously\u000a      unheard works. Ian Hammond (musician) [1] writes,\u000a      `DIAMM is to medieval music what a library is to books: it collects the\u000a      objects and makes them generally available. I know that sounds pretty\u000a      obvious, but in fact, melody is greatly underrated as a value object to be\u000a      collected, collated, protected and published. The need for DIAMM will\u000a      never be extinguished - it can only grow as the web gradually fulfils its\u000a      role as our universal repository. DIAMM already has its foot in the door.'\u000a      In a review in Early Music, Fabrice Fitch writes, `Facsimile editions of\u000a      early polyphonic sources are usually self-recommending, but the\u000a      long-awaited Eton Choirbook, the first fruits in hard copy of the Digital\u000a      Image Archive of Medieval Music (DIAMM), is especially welcome. Magnus\u000a      Williamson's 85-page commentary, at once erudite and readable, is a mine\u000a      of valuable information' [ii].\u000a    Enhancing and Expanding Library and Archive Collections.\u000a    DIAMM has provided 80 archives worldwide with free delivery of\u000a      high-quality images of their music manuscripts (including the British\u000a      Library [iii]). For such institutions, delivery of\u000a      their own images in a congenial medium, without cost to them, is a\u000a      considerable advantage. The librarian Rijk Vriesinga of the Archiefservice\u000a      Frysl&#226;n (NL) [2] recently commented that `it is a\u000a      wonder that such a system exists'. Libraries themselves are one of the\u000a      most important user groups accessing DIAMM: their collections are enhanced\u000a      by free, online access to DIAMM manuscripts, and references to their own\u000a      collections in RISM (R&#233;pertoire International des Sources Musicales) and\u000a      CMM (Corpus Mensurabilis Musicae) can now be accessed online. DIAMM has\u000a      recently been invited to join and provide metadata for the Medieval\u000a      Electronic Scholarly Alliance [iv], a union catalogue\u000a      of partner collections including the British Library, the Courtauld\u000a      Institute and the Walters Art Museum. Academic (researchers, students,\u000a      performers and teaching staff) and non-academic library users are now able\u000a      to access a wide range of resources in electronic format, some of which\u000a      were previously not available at all.\u000a    Technical consultancy, imaging, and protocols for other projects which\u000a        themselves have a non-academic impact.\u000a    DIAMM is a world leader in digital imaging of rare and delicate\u000a      documents, and has acted as consultant in Japan and the USA to projects of\u000a      international importance, such as the digitisation of the Dead Sea Scrolls\u000a      (alongside experts from NASA) [v]. DIAMM maintains the\u000a      facility to provide images for other cultural projects - several funded by\u000a      the AHRC such as The Production and Reading of Music Sources (Manchester)\u000a      and The Experience of Worship (Bangor) - and to carry out consultancy work\u000a      on behalf of institutions in Belgium, Spain, and Germany. Robust technical\u000a      protocols (and DIAMM-trained technical staff) have been adopted by such\u000a      institutions as the Alamire Digital Lab (Alamire Foundation\/KU Leuven,\u000a      Belgium) in the digitisation of the Vatican Library music collections[vi]:\u000a      this was described as `laying the groundwork for new developments in\u000a      international academic thought on the musical and art-historical patrimony\u000a      of the Low Countries', in the words of Bart Demuyt, director of the\u000a      Alamire Foundation [3]. Wolodymyr Smishkewych cites\u000a      pioneering work of DIAMM as a key influence, and states his intention to\u000a      draw on their expertise in his production of the online digital\u000a      photographic facsimile of the Lugo Codex [vii]. DIAMM has\u000a      therefore created new possibilities for the digitization and provision of\u000a      resources in myriad disciplines beyond musicology, and has encouraged new\u000a      approaches to the study of digital materials in the Humanities [viii].\u000a    Teaching and learning outside Oxford.\u000a    The DIAMM database and resources are increasingly used in a wide variety\u000a      of educational settings worldwide, particularly where users would not\u000a      otherwise have access to large manuscript collections. In addition to its\u000a      use in the music curriculum, teachers have used DIAMM to communicate an\u000a      understanding of the culture of the Middle Ages. As Alice Clark [4]\u000a      of Loyola University writes, `Our students are much more likely to be\u000a      unfamiliar with medieval culture, and this resource can help the Middle\u000a      Ages come alive for them.' This may be the most crucial impact area for\u000a      DIAMM, since students attracted by the beauty, intricacy, and rarity of\u000a      these sources become more engaged with historical studies, enabling them\u000a      to appreciate more fully the achievements of their own and other cultures\u000a      - both historical and contemporary. In this way DIAMM has fostered new\u000a      projects [ix], encouraged interdisciplinary study, and\u000a      reinforced the importance of understanding the multi-faceted nature of\u000a      cultural and historical research.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Digital Image Archive of Medieval Music (DIAMM) is an online digital\u000a      archive of European medieval polyphonic music, captured direct from the\u000a      original sources. DIAMM's database (c. 15,000 images) and its\u000a      award-winning publishing activities make an unparalleled number of\u000a      medieval manuscripts widely accessible beyond academia, enriching a corpus\u000a      of music-cultural resources for the benefit of performers, students,\u000a      libraries, and all those interested in manuscripts and the art and music\u000a      they contain.

Their pioneering collaboration\u000a      on Guillaume de Machaut and the Roman du Fauvel [1] epitomizes\u000a      DIAMM's interdisciplinary research initiatives. Bent's groundbreaking work\u000a      on the grammar and theory of medieval music [2],\u000a      historiographical issues surrounding its translation and transcription,\u000a      and particularly the Italian Bologna Q15 repertory is complemented by\u000a      Wathey's research on fourteenth and fifteenth-century musical sources and\u000a      their social and cultural contexts [3].\u000a    Research is now led by the project's directors: Prof. Elizabeth Eva\u000a      Leach, University Lecturer and Fellow of St Hugh's; Dr Julia\u000a      Craig-McFeely, project director and Research Fellow in the Faculty of\u000a      Music; and Prof. Thomas Schmidt of Manchester University.

DIAMM has been supported by a number of\u000a      competitively won grants and awards from international funding bodies\u000a      including the Mellon Foundation and the AHRC.\u000a    The individual research of DIAMM contributors has helped to shape its\u000a      current form, and the availability of images has in turn opened up further\u000a      avenues for research. Leach works on Guillaume de Machaut [4],\u000a      investigating music, poetry, and cultural transfer in medieval France and\u000a      England. Craig-McFeely has published on English lute manuscripts and\u000a      scribes in the late medieval period, and both she and Leach have more\u000a      recently written on the role of new technologies within musicology and\u000a      music historiography [5]. Rees works on Iberian medieval\u000a      motets [6], and Salisbury researches English medieval and\u000a      Renaissance liturgical music and historiographical issues associated with\u000a      source preservation and interpretation in this repertory [7].\u000a    Sources archived in the DIAMM database include all currently known\u000a      fragmentary sources of polyphony up to 1550 in the UK; all the `complete'\u000a      manuscripts in the UK; a small number of important representative\u000a      manuscripts from continental Europe; and a significant portion of\u000a      fragments from 1300-1450 from Belgium, France, Italy, Switzerland, and\u000a      Spain. The database was designed to include metadata about each listed\u000a      manuscript, from physical descriptions to contents to full-text\u000a      transcriptions. Researchers have created, collated, and improved metadata,\u000a      requiring continual specialist work (i.e. identifying provenance of\u000a      manuscripts and undertaking specialist description of script, notation,\u000a      mise-en-page; identification and\/or analysis of music and text). The image\u000a      capture protocols required for the photography were developed by DIAMM, as\u000a      were the techniques for digital restoration of previously inaccessible\u000a      sources, illegible through damage or age. DIAMM has concentrated on\u000a      developing a carefully tested image capture and metadata standard that is\u000a      proving extremely robust. The licences employed by DIAMM have been used as\u000a      models for other institutions wishing to embark on digitisation. Licences\u000a      and technical protocols, as well as training on specialist camera hardware\u000a      and digital restoration of images (first published 2006), have been shared\u000a      with similar projects.\u000a    Research outputs include the online database itself, and a growing\u000a      selection of editions and early music resources, openly accessible through\u000a      the project website. Since 2009, DIAMM has been preparing traditional\u000a      facsimile editions and introductions to important manuscripts. Two such\u000a      publications have won the American Musicological Society's annual award\u000a      for best edition. The website itself has been praised in peer-review\u000a      papers and conference presentations (Oswell 2011, Gutierrez 2011).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4901","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2960313","Name":"Luxembourg"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Dreyfus' and Higginbottom's early performance research - particularly the\u000a      restoration of lost\u000a      works and parts of works, the recreation of historical performance\u000a      techniques, and the\u000a      communication of early music to a contemporary audience - has contributed\u000a      to the increased\u000a      accessibility of the early music repertoire, and thus to an enhanced\u000a      public understanding of this\u000a      important part of English and European musical heritage. Their research\u000a      has brought previously\u000a      inaccessible works back into the public realm, interpreting them for\u000a      modern audiences, and\u000a      generating cultural capital to benefit current and future generations.\u000a    Research outputs achieve impact through live performances, radio and\u000a      television appearances,\u000a      specialist CD recordings, and online webcasts. Since 2008, Phantasm have\u000a      released three\u000a      recordings of rarely performed consort music by William Lawes, William\u000a      Byrd, and John Ward, and\u000a      have given live performances of these and other select repertories across\u000a      the UK and Europe, and\u000a      additionally in Hong Kong. Amazon UK reviews are overwhelmingly positive [i].\u000a      Stephen Churley\u000a      (27 June 2012) gave the William Lawes CD 5 out of 5 stars and wrote, \"This\u000a      CD contains\u000a      essentially Lawes's greatest works and the performances are stunning.\u000a      Phantasm handle the\u000a      complex textures of the 5 and 6 part consorts, which can sound muddy in\u000a      the wrong hands,\u000a      brilliantly [...] In his sleeve notes Laurence Dreyfus gives an insightful\u000a      personal commentary on\u000a      each piece which enhances the listening pleasure of the music. The\u000a      recording is also excellent [...]\u000a      This is a real corker of a disc that ought to win awards. Buy it!\" Another\u000a      reviewer commented,\u000a      \"Phantasm is a great ensemble and this is a remarkable disc. Hitherto\u000a      unfamiliar with William\u000a      Lawes, I found this a persuasive introduction. The copious `notes for the\u000a      perplexed' in the booklet\u000a      explain things very clearly\". Concerts and recitals by Phantasm often\u000a      include a pre-performance or\u000a      interval talk by Dreyfus designed to increase the audience's appreciation\u000a      of the programme and\u000a      their understanding of the works being performed. A Phantasm performance\u000a      of Dowland and\u000a      Lawes (with organist Daniel Hyde and lutenist Elizabeth Kenny) at London's\u000a      Wigmore Hall on 6\u000a      June 2012 was broadcast live on BBC Radio 3 with commentary by BBC\u000a      presenter Catherine Bott.\u000a      It was simultaneously broadcast by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU)\u000a      to 1.7 million listeners\u000a      [ii]. The broadcast included a pre-recorded interview with Dreyfus\u000a      heard during the interval and was\u000a      very well received [see &#167;5.1].\u000a    The New College Choir has released 13 CDs since 2008 and broadcasts\u000a      regularly to large\u000a      audiences on BBC Radio 3 (e.g. the programme of sacred French music for\u000a      the Baroque Spring\u000a      series in March 2013) and Classic FM (e.g. appearing in the their Hall of\u000a      Fame Favourites, The Full\u000a      Works Concert - Wednesday 3 April 2013 [iii]),\u000a      enhancing and enriching public understanding of\u000a      early music. The Choir recently featured in Oxford in Voice, a web\u000a      series examining the city and\u000a      university's choral tradition, which included interviews with Edward\u000a      Higginbottom, footage of the\u000a      Choir, and accompanying music taken from recent Evensongs [iv].\u000a      New College Choir was the first\u000a      in Oxford to launch regular webcasts of choral services [v].\u000a      Each week, one service is selected for\u000a      webcasting, and is available shortly after the service takes place. With\u000a      an average of 30,000 hits\u000a      per annum, the webcasts have successfully extended audiences beyond the\u000a      chapel walls, to\u000a      musicians and enthusiastic listeners internationally. Webcast listeners\u000a      take part in a `live' service:\u000a      not a studio recording of a concert, but the daily liturgy offered as part\u000a      of the chapel's tradition of\u000a      Christian worship. Post-production editing means that the listener is\u000a      presented not only with the\u000a      appropriate sound, but the details of the music and readings for each\u000a      service: when the choir is\u000a      singing full tilt the sound engineers are able to raise the microphones\u000a      higher within the roof space,\u000a      to descend again for the more intimate polyphonic repertoire. The webcasts\u000a      page of the New\u000a      College Choir website has been shared on Facebook 652 times, on Twitter 64\u000a      times and 164\u000a      times[v] via other social media platforms, further\u000a      demonstrating the popularity of these\u000a      performances with the general public. Twitter comments reveal the impact\u000a      of performances:\u000a      @etnobofin (7\/6\/09, Paris) tweeted \"New College Choir nailed Wesley's\u000a      \"Ascribe unto the Lord\"\u000a      tonight at evensong. Beautiful and magnificent as usual.\"\u000a    The creation of New College Choir's record label, Novum, in 2010,\u000a      has permitted greater\u000a      freedom in the choice of recorded repertory, focusing on research-led\u000a      projects with substantial\u000a      accompanying materials (essay booklets and web pages). This venture has\u000a      also represented an\u000a      innovative social enterprise, entailing a vigorous search for funds to\u000a      support the recordings, none\u000a      of which would otherwise be commercially viable. Since inauguration, over\u000a      &#163;100,000 has been\u000a      raised, resulting in 11 releases, including a world premiere of Motets\u000a        choisis composed by\u000a      Fran&#231;ois Couperin. BBC Music Magazine wrote of the Ludford disc that\u000a      `Scrupulous scholarship,\u000a      masterful conducting and committed singing merge to restore the legacy of\u000a      one of England's most\u000a      inventive 16th-century composers' [vi]. The commercial\u000a      impact of such projects has sustained the\u000a      first-ever recording of repertoire reconstructed from manuscript sources\u000a      by Higginbottom, with\u000a      ongoing benefits to listeners and professional practitioners. One listener\u000a      tweeted \"Might have\u000a      blown out my car speakers listening to new college choir CD a little too\u000a      loud. Totally worth it.\"\u000a      (@ajwms 21\/6\/10, Knoxville, TN).\u000a    New College Choir performances also positively impact on different groups\u000a      in the local\u000a      community. Webcasts of evensong are now being played to patients in the\u000a      Oxford hospitals. \"Choir\u000a        revives 16th century custom\" http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/od7dp6\" (@oxon):\u000a      this tweet refers to a tradition of\u000a      performance at Bartlemas chapel in Cowley, a socially-mixed area of east\u000a      Oxford, that New\u000a      College Choir reinstated after a 400 year gap, demonstrating one of the\u000a      ways they engage local\u000a      communities and people from different social settings with early choral\u000a      music. Jane Harrison,\u000a      Project Officer for the East Oxford Archaeological Project, said: \"It is\u000a      very exciting that New\u000a      College is experimenting with bringing back this wonderful historical\u000a      tradition. The closure of\u000a      Magdalen bridge on May Day means those living in east Oxford feel excluded\u000a      from the city's\u000a      celebrations. This is something special for our community.\" [2]\u000a    The tourism industry makes a huge contribution to economic prosperity in\u000a      the city of Oxford\u000a      (tourism-related expenditure in 2011 was &#163;1,7bn, with 11% spent on\u000a      entertainment\/attractions).\u000a      Visitors to the University play no small part in this: 'Oxford University\u000a      estimates that the university\u000a      alone attracts more than nine million tourists to the city, resulting in a\u000a      combined spend of &#163;589m\u000a      and supporting 13,700 local jobs.' [vii] Both Phantasm\u000a      and New College Choir have made\u000a      significant contributions to generating tourism income for the city.\u000a      Tourists and other visitors are\u000a      welcome to attend evensong services, and New College is among the most\u000a      popular, attracting over\u000a      60,000 visitors a year to the 150 public services (average weekly\u000a      attendance is 400-500 people\u000a      with substantially larger numbers at Advent, Christmas, and Easter). The\u000a      central focus of these\u000a      services is liturgical worship, but the research component of the\u000a      performance is no less significant:\u000a      the services provide the audiences with participatory experience of\u000a      working with historical texts and\u000a      materials in a ritual context that engages and benefits a community of\u000a      listeners well beyond the\u000a      academic environment. Phantasm performs regularly to public audiences in\u000a      Oxford, e.g. in the\u000a      Holywell Music Room, Magdalen, Brasenose and All Souls' Colleges. `The\u000a      Divine Office' brought\u000a      200 tourists to Oxford for an intensive week of concerts and lectures held\u000a      at Oxford University (26\u000a      Sept. 2012), with each tourist paying up to &#163;3000 to Martin Randall Travel\u000a      (commercial travel\u000a      company who specialise in expert-led cultural tours) to hear cutting-edge\u000a      groups in various intimate\u000a      Oxford College Chapel settings, including performances by Phantasm in\u000a      Magdalen and by New\u000a      College Choir. Feedback points to the transformative impact of the\u000a      performances upon listeners\u000a      and the promotion of a high-quality tourist experience within the cultural\u000a      sphere. A Canadian tourist\u000a      wrote: `an incomparable musical experience that exceeded all\u000a      expectations.' Another testimonial\u000a      from the UK states: `I doubt I will ever again have such an educational\u000a      and aesthetic experience.\u000a      To say \"I was there\" at the Divine Office is something I shall treasure.'\u000a          [viii].\u000a    Another important impact from Dreyfus and Higginbottom's Early\u000a      Performance research is the\u000a      ongoing practical and theoretical education for international\u000a      instrumentalists and singers. In\u000a      February 2013, Phantasm participated in the Hong Kong International Arts\u000a      Festival [ix], giving two\u000a      performances, an outreach lecture-recital on English Consort Music\u000a      delivered to c. 600 Hong Kong\u000a      teenagers, a master class on viol and consort technique delivered to music\u000a      students and staff at\u000a      the Hong Kong Academy for the Performing Arts (HKAPA), and a lecture by\u000a      Laurence Dreyfus\u000a      (entitled `Beyond the Interpretation of Music') on the musicological\u000a      research underpinning both the\u000a      historical and engaged subjectivity of Phantasm's performance work. One\u000a      striking indication of the\u000a      impact of Phantasm's performances was the receptivity of audiences - young\u000a      and old - to the\u000a      clarity of texture and `democratic' distribution of the part-writing. By\u000a      gaining a keener sense of the\u000a      rhythmic and metric independence of parts, through Phantasm's master\u000a      classes at HKAPA,\u000a      players learnt that they needed to approach their own lines with greater\u000a      vigour and commitment.\u000a      The combination of the outreach event and the teaching worked well in this\u000a      key Asian location with\u000a      teachers reporting this as the first time students had heard period\u000a      instruments live [3]. The HKAPA\u000a      lecture was delivered to invited students and staff from neighbouring\u000a      institutions, Chinese Baptist\u000a      University and the University of Hong Kong, and resulting questions\u000a      productively explored aspects\u000a      of Phantasm's approach by interrogating the relation between programme\u000a      notes and performance\u000a      style at the Festival concerts. New College Choir also benefits\u000a      international groups and individual\u000a      choral directors, who come to observe the group's research-led work.\u000a      During 2011-2, visitors came\u000a      from Alsace-Lorraine, Luxembourg, France, and the USA.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Practice-led performance research at Oxford fosters dynamic, interactive\u000a      relationships between\u000a      academics and professional ensembles that are of huge cultural and\u000a      economic impact to a wide\u000a      variety of beneficiary groups.

Both have a strong interest in performance practice and\u000a      research in this area.\u000a    Prior to arriving at Oxford, Dreyfus' research considered the close\u000a      interrelationship between\u000a      theory, compositional practice and performance in early music, e.g.\u000a      Dreyfus, Bach and the\u000a        Patterns of Invention (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press,\u000a      1996) and Dreyfus, `Idiomatic\u000a      Betrayals: Fran&#231;ois Couperin as composer for the viol', Fran&#231;ois\u000a        Couperin: Nouveaux Regards.\u000a        Actes des Rencontres de Villecroze 4 au 7 octobre 1995, III: 3.\u000a      pp205-221 (Paris: &#201;ditions\u000a      Klincksieck, 1998). He has continued along these research lines during his\u000a      time at Oxford, feeding\u000a      directly into his creative work with 17th-century consort music,\u000a      reassessing the relationship\u000a      between instrumental parts and contrapuntal voice-leading in ways that\u000a      have had important\u000a      repercussions for interpretation, performance, and recording [1].\u000a      Higginbottom's research has\u000a      been directed toward the restoration of lost or historically neglected\u000a      repertoire (e.g. Couperin\u000a      motets), locating primary documentary research concerning performance\u000a      forces, realisation and\u000a      interpretation within the contexts of ritual service, commercial\u000a      recording, and practical training [2,\u000a        3].\u000a    The contemporary performance of music from 300-500 years ago presents\u000a      thorny problems of\u000a      analysis and interpretation. A key problem is grounding a rendition in\u000a      historically appropriate\u000a      evidence while projecting a persuasive voice that speaks to contemporary\u000a      audiences. Dreyfus and\u000a      Higginbottom each lead a professional ensemble that provides a dynamic,\u000a      interactive dimension to\u000a      their early music performance research. Founded in 1994, Phantasm has\u000a      focused on performing\u000a      English consort music from the 16th and 17th centuries and is led by\u000a      Dreyfus. It has been in\u000a      residence both at the Faculty of Music and at Magdalen College (from\u000a      2010). One of Dreyfus' key\u000a      research findings relates to unusual metrical conflicts between equally\u000a      disposed instrumental parts:\u000a      intentional metrical conflicts in instrumental Fantasies formed an\u000a      integral part of musical\u000a      composition, and a newly expressive performance style resulted from\u000a      rendering these conflicts\u000a      meaningful within a harmonious whole. To accomplish this, the group\u000a      learned to play without\u000a      barlines in Dreyfus' own editions, resembling the original conditions of\u000a      performance. Phantasm's\u000a      recorded research outputs during the census period have focussed on the\u000a      English composers\u000a      Byrd, Ward, and Lawes [1, 4, 5]. For the Lawes disc, Dreyfus\u000a      collaborated with organist Daniel\u000a      Hyde (University Lecturer, Oxford). He unearthed primary sources for their\u000a      repertory not only in\u000a      University of Oxford libraries, but also in reconstructions and\u000a      restoration of works with lacunae as a\u000a      result of collaborations with John Milsom (Christ Church Library, Oxford),\u000a      Oliver Neighbour (British\u000a      Library) and Warwick Edwards (Glasgow University). Dreyfus undertook his\u000a      own analysis of\u000a      primary sources and prepared editions for performance in modern times.\u000a      There are two other\u000a      professional viol consorts in the UK at present (Fretwork and the Rose\u000a      Consort), but neither\u000a      engages in the degree of practice-led research nor has the same level of\u000a      acclaim as Phantasm.\u000a    Edward Higginbottom's leadership of New College Choir facilitates the\u000a      vital practice-based real-\u000a      time analysis work at the centre of his research. Through rehearsals and\u000a      performances,\u000a      Higginbottom is able to apply key insights from his theoretical research,\u000a      such as experimentation\u000a      with tempo, timing, and word setting, which (complemented by his deep\u000a      knowledge of historical\u000a      contexts and familiarity with relevant local genres and their stylistic\u000a      properties) often lead to\u000a      substantial new conclusions. Some of his most significant recent research\u000a      involved reconstituting\u000a      lost parts in the works of leading French Baroque composer Fran&#231;ois\u000a      Couperin [6]. Reconstructing\u000a      a musical work with crucial lines missing involves in-depth knowledge of\u000a      the composer's style as\u000a      well as an experimental thrust that can only be tested in live\u000a      performance. Further research has\u000a      required a similarly close attention to instrumentation in Monteverdi's Vespers,\u000a      avoiding the\u000a      instrumental doubling of choral parts adopted in many modern performances:\u000a      singing without such\u000a      support is a challenging but fruitful experiment in recreating early\u000a      seventeenth-century\u000a      performance practice [7].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6396","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    IMPACT 1: On a digital arts SME\u000a    Historical context of impact:\u000a    Prior to 2004, KMA Ltd's primary income stream was web-based design and\u000a      digital projections for large-scale popular music shows. In 2004, KMA\u000a      approached Popat and Palmer for advice on a new commission to\u000a      create digital scenography for Phoenix Dance Theatre's production, Eng-er-\u000a        land (2005), against the company's broader strategic plan to\u000a      diversify their work-base into theatre and the creative industries. Popat,\u000a      Palmer and KMA engaged in experimental research workshops to develop new\u000a      visual\/kinetic ideas for the Phoenix production. Popat and Palmer\u000a      were credited for their contribution in Phoenix's international programme.\u000a    In 2005, KMA was commissioned by York City Council to create an\u000a      interactive public art installation. KMA returned to Popat and\u000a      Palmer and employed them as research consultants on the project to develop\u000a      the experimental workshop approaches further. The resulting installation,\u000a      Dancing in the Streets, was KMA's first interactive kinetic light\u000a      installation. The work came to life through the actions and reactions of\u000a      its audience. Abstract, organic patterns appeared on the pavement after\u000a      dark, inviting passers-by to come closer. As they did, their own movements\u000a      began to influence what they saw as the projected light linked them to\u000a      others and pulled them into a relationship with the artwork that invited\u000a      playfulness, creativity and improvisation. The installation was due to run\u000a      for three weeks but the City Council extended its run to four months.\u000a    Following this, Popat and Palmer wrote a peer-reviewed research\u000a      article about their experimental work with KMA [4] and\u000a      successfully applied for an Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council (AHRC)\u000a      Large Grant for Projecting Performance (2006-8) to pursue the work\u000a      further in partnership with KMA [5]. The research question\u000a      outlined earlier (in the second paragraph of section two) was central to\u000a      this project.\u000a    Impact in REF2014 Period:\u000a    KMA have continued to employ the processes developed with Popat\u000a      and Palmer in the experimental workshops (and in the subsequent\u000a      AHRC-funded project) within their commissioned work. Examples include Congregation\u000a      (2010: Shanghai Expo, China; Tate Britain, London), an ambitious kinetic\u000a      light art installation that that aims to push the possibilities of large\u000a      scale interactive work into new emotional and narrative territory, and\u000a      most recently their design for the feature film The Knife that Killed\u000a        Me (Autumn 2013, Universal Pictures). KMA Director, Kit Monkman,\u000a      testifies that the film \"owes its ground-breaking visual style\" to their\u000a      work with Popat and Palmer. [A]\u000a    Lloyd Newson, Artistic Director of internationally acclaimed DV8 Physical\u000a      Theatre, heard about Projecting Performance at the Theatre and\u000a      Performance Research Association conference in 2006 and asked Popat\u000a      if he could observe the experimental workshops. As a result, Newson ran\u000a      his own research and development workshops with the Projecting\u000a        Performance research team (led by Popat and Palmer).\u000a      Following the workshops, Newson commissioned KMA to design the digital\u000a      projections for DV8's internationally touring production To Be\u000a        Straight With You (2007, toured 2008-9). KMA's design for DV8\u000a      significantly raised their international profile in the arts world in\u000a      2008-9; an opportunity that only arose because of the research they\u000a      conducted with Popat and Palmer.\u000a    KMA have now developed and diversified their work-base to be almost\u000a      exclusively within digital light projection and film in theatre and the\u000a      cultural industries. Monkman's testimonial states, \"I cannot overstate our\u000a      gratitude to Sita (Popat), Scott (Palmer) and the University of Leeds for\u000a      encouraging and aiding our creative (and therefore economic) development.\"\u000a      [A]\u000a    The experimental processes developed in the research partnership with KMA\u000a      were selected for dissemination as good practice in interactive digital\u000a      design in two international industry publications. [B]\u000a    IMPACT 2: On an international theatre company and its audiences\u000a    As explained above, Lloyd Newson asked Popat, Palmer and KMA to\u000a      host two days of workshops for him and a DV8 performer in order to\u000a      experiment with ideas for his upcoming production, To Be Straight With\u000a        You. Newson's testimonial explains that the ideas for many of the\u000a      final projection designs were developed in these workshops [C]. Popat\u000a      and Palmer are credited in the production's tour programme and website. To\u000a        Be Straight With You toured internationally in 2008-9, including\u000a      Australia, Germany, USA, UK and Canada.\u000a    International reviews of To Be Straight With You indicate the\u000a      critical nature of the digital projection design in communicating to\u000a      audiences the political content of the piece which examined religion,\u000a      sexuality and tolerance. Most frequently highlighted for the effectiveness\u000a      of its visual emphasis was the projection of a large globe, which a dancer\u000a      appears to spin around himself (e.g. reviews in The Guardian, UK; The\u000a      Independent, UK; The Stage, UK; Irish Theatre Magazine, Ireland; The\u000a      Village Voice, New York; Dance View Times, San Francisco) [D].\u000a      Countries turn different colours at his touch as he describes their rules\u000a      on homosexual relationships. This `globe' design element was one of those\u000a      conceived in the R&amp;D workshops with the Projecting Performance\u000a      research team, as were the other elements mentioned in the review excerpts\u000a      below. (These elements can also be seen in video examples on YouTube via\u000a      the links listed in source [E] in Section 5.)\u000a    \"In a devastating bit of theatrical magic, Hannes Langolf, one of nine\u000a      powerful performers, appears to rotate a transparent projected globe of\u000a      the world.

Work that\u000a      directly integrates performance and technologist in both process and\u000a      performance is still rare. Collaborative methods that facilitate such\u000a      integration deserve further exploration for the combined benefit of both\u000a      academic and professional communities.\u000a    Popat (Professor of Performance &amp; Technology 2011-14, Senior\u000a      Lecturer in Dance 2007-11), University of Leeds) and Scott Palmer\u000a      (Lecturer in Scenography, University of Leeds throughout the REF period)\u000a      formed a research collaboration between 2004 and 2008 with industry\u000a      partners (Kit Monkman and Tom Wexler, co-directors of KMA Ltd), focussing\u000a      on the choreographic and scenographic exchange between dancers and\u000a      projected digital images. They addressed these issues through the\u000a      following research question: What defines relationships between performer-\u000a      dancer, projected image and performer-operator?\u000a    Through the use of experimental workshops conducted both in theatres and\u000a      in site-specific environments, the research investigated a new set of\u000a      interrelationships between performer, projection and technical operator,\u000a      where the operator became a `performer' controlling and being\u000a      spontaneously present in a digital representation.\u000a    In the theatre-based research, the stage-performer dances with the\u000a      off-stage operator, who simultaneously sees, controls and performs via a\u000a      projected digital representation (a star, a line, or another shape,\u000a      programmed using principles of Newtonian physics to create organic-looking\u000a      motion). The expressive nature of the digital image concentrates the\u000a      qualities of the operator's movement through innovative use of a simple\u000a      technical interface (graphics tablet and pen). The operator performs\u000a      through his\/her abstract digital form, dancing as an equal partner with\u000a      the stage performer. The research investigated how the operator's role as\u000a      performer unlocks significant potential for the creative process. It also\u000a      addressed the role of kinesic engagement in digital extensions of the\u000a      human body.\u000a    In the site-specific research, members of the public visiting the kinetic\u000a      light installations became both operator and performer in a mixed reality\u000a      environment.

Scott's\u000a      presentation of the popular music of the period as an international\u000a      phenomenon (rather than just a Victorian one) [1], [2],\u000a      and recognition as the leading expert on nineteenth-century popular music,\u000a      has allowed him to promote understanding of musics that were truly\u000a      `popular' before `pop music'. In 2010 Scott was invited to speak\u000a      at the Bard Music Festival, to develop understanding of the history of\u000a      music amongst contemporary audiences. Scott's findings on Viennese\u000a      popular music and operetta [1] enabled him to show the influence\u000a      of these on Alban Berg, the featured composer at Bard that year.\u000a      Similarly, in 2012 he delivered public introductions to performances of Die\u000a        Fledermaus for the Canadian Opera Company&#8212;the largest opera company\u000a      in Canada and the third largest producer of opera in North America&#8212;as well\u000a      as discussing the intersection of `high' and `low' art for performances by\u000a      the Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Opera Company at Buxton Opera House in the UK [3].\u000a    Scott's work on the representation of national identity embedded\u000a      in musical styles, as exemplified in the Eurovision Song Contest [5],\u000a      has drawn a wide audience. In 2011 Scott appeared on (and was\u000a      tweeted about by) Today (BBC Radio 4) [D], Breakfast\u000a      (BBC One) [E], and BBC News Online [F]. Breakfast's\u000a      viewing figures were approximately 1.6 million a day, while Today\u000a      had a daily audience of over 7 million at this time according to BARB and\u000a      RAJAR (Radio Audience Research). With retweets, Today's tweet\u000a      about Scott's research reached a total audience via Twitter alone of\u000a      240,000. The research reached international audiences, garnering interest\u000a      in Russian-speaking countries in the wake of Azerbaijan's win [G]\u000a      (the report notes his identification of \"serious political and moral\u000a      ideas\" in Eurovision successes).\u000a    Such conceptions of representation and nationhood provide a broader\u000a      context for Scott to inform and influence the reception of music through\u000a      the media, speaking about notions of orientalism in music [5] for\u000a      Chopsticks at Dawn (first broadcast: BBC Radio 4, 8 June 2010), the\u000a      meaning and function of national anthems and international `identity' [6]\u000a      for Something Understood (first broadcast: BBC Radio 4, 20 January\u000a      2013), a feature of Scott's research that had previously interested The\u000a        Guardian [H], and in interview with Time Out Delhi [I],\u000a      discussing John Pridham's 1857 `The Battle March of Delhi' in the context\u000a      of the Indian uprising, with Scott referencing the\u000a      nineteenth-century rift between `high art' and entertainment [2].\u000a      The same feature linked to Scott's performance of the piece on The\u000a        Victorian Web, claiming that \"whenever Scott performs the piece\u000a      live, people fall about laughing, and usually don't stop until it's over.'\u000a      [I]\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Scott's research impacts upon the portrayal and representation of\u000a      a broad range of popular musics in the media, TV, and radio programmes, as\u000a      well as at international music festivals and concerts.

This\u000a      research has provided a new lens for the understanding of popular music,\u000a      influencing and informing the portrayal and representation of genres\u000a      previously marginalised in conceptions of what popular music `is',\u000a      particularly bringing operetta and music hall to the fore in the\u000a      socio-cultural and historical context of their nineteenth-century origins.\u000a    His central claim is that the `popular music revolution' occurred in the\u000a      nineteenth century, rather than, as was previously commonly supposed, with\u000a      twentieth-century movements such as jazz or rock'n'roll [1], thus\u000a      making \"a major contribution to a major aspect of music history\" (William\u000a      Weber, Journal of Interdisciplinary History, vol. 40, no. 1, 83).\u000a      Supported by AHRC funding [R1], Scott argues that popular\u000a      music in the nineteenth century (and thereafter) should be conceived as a\u000a      `third type' of music, emerging as a product of social change with its own\u000a      characteristics and features, and distinct from classical or traditional\u000a      musics. This argument, expressed as `The Popular Music Revolution in the\u000a      Nineteenth Century: A Third Type of Music Arises' in De-Canonizing\u000a        Music History, was rapidly translated into French for the refereed\u000a      journal Musurgia: analyse et pratique musicales, signalling\u000a      further international interest [2]. Precisely the distinctions\u000a      which enable such a comparison between `high' and `low' art in the\u000a      nineteenth century are foregrounded in his work on parody in Arthur\u000a      Sullivan's music for The Sorcerer [3] (the quality of this\u000a      research is indicated by its contribution to the case Scott made\u000a      for a major European Research Council project to pursue more work on\u000a      operetta in London and New York, for which he was awarded &#8364;1 million in\u000a      August 2013). Scott's ongoing contribution to research on music of\u000a      this period can be seen through his contributions to The Victorian Web\u000a      [4], a peer-reviewed, public-domain website for which he is also\u000a      Music Editor. It includes recordings of his own performances of Victorian\u000a      popular songs, several of which do not exist elsewhere in recorded form.\u000a      In 2012 the third (web) edition of his The Singing Bourgeois: Songs of\u000a        the Victorian Drawing Room and Parlour (2nd edition, 2001) appeared\u000a      on the same site [4], bringing hypertext links and some images\u000a      with additional information (The Victorian Web draws most of its\u000a      contributions from professional scholars, has won numerous awards, and is\u000a      archived daily by the Library of Congress).\u000a    Though his commitment to musics marginalised by conceptions of `high art'\u000a      or `good taste' is central, Scott's work moves beyond the popular\u000a      music of the Victorian and Edwardian eras. He has developed methodologies\u000a      and theoretical models for the critical investigation of representation\u000a      embedded within musical style (principally representations of ideology,\u000a      national identity and `orientalism'). His examination of styles and\u000a      socio-cultural contexts spans from operetta and musical hall through to\u000a      jazz, national anthems, and Eurovision entries [5]. Here Scott\u000a      considers the ways in which ideas of nationhood and identity are\u000a      intertwined with music, simultaneously revealing and critiquing a `recipe\u000a      for success' established through analysis of musical and lyrical\u000a      characteristics of former winning songs. The same sense of interplay\u000a      between ideology and music is central to his work on concepts of\u000a      `orientalism' in music. This is part of a continuing set of reflections on\u000a      the impact and relevance of the work of Edward Said to musicologists (as\u000a      well as what musicology might have to say to Said), the latest\u000a      contribution to which forms part of a volume which was reviewed as 5* by Choice:\u000a        Current Reviews for Academic Libraries in 2010, and Columbia\u000a      University rated it one of the best books on Said [6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6398","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    UNESCO's Institute for Statistics is the world's only inter-governmental\u000d\u000a      body dedicated to culture,\u000d\u000a      serving 195 member states and 8 associate members, as well as a range of\u000d\u000a      intergovernmental and\u000d\u000a      non-governmental organizations, research institutes and universities.

Moving from the\u000d\u000a      national to the international\u000d\u000a      sphere represents considerable challenge in securing the support and\u000d\u000a      agreement of a wide range\u000d\u000a      of organisations (e.g. national ministries of culture, international\u000d\u000a      multilateral agencies).\u000d\u000a    Research demanded that any new Framework needed to address the changes in\u000d\u000a      the way people\u000d\u000a      create and consume culture, to include digital technologies and the\u000d\u000a      development of `interrelated\u000d\u000a      notions of \"creative\" industries' (E\/CN.3\/2010\/21) [A]. The new\u000d\u000a      fit-for-purpose Framework would\u000d\u000a      then provide modern policy-relevant data to members states so they could\u000d\u000a      better measure the\u000d\u000a      impact and relevance of cultural policies and initiatives.\u000d\u000a    Taylor and collaborators therefore offered a new comparative lens\u000d\u000a      to view culture, through revising\u000d\u000a      the intellectual framework and existing indicators used by member states.\u000d\u000a      The process of\u000d\u000a      developing the recommendations included analytical comparisons of all\u000d\u000a      existing frameworks\u000d\u000a      (approximately twenty); synthesizing and aggregating the findings from the\u000d\u000a      team's own prior\u000d\u000a      research projects, and designing new classifications and indicators and\u000d\u000a      testing their viability\u000d\u000a      against existing sources of cultural data. The Expert Scoping Study [1]\u000d\u000a      summarised the findings\u000d\u000a      from this work in the form of recommendations to UNESCO for the revision\u000d\u000a      of the Global\u000d\u000a      Framework.\u000d\u000a    Following the submission of the Expert Scoping Study, UNESCO managed an\u000d\u000a      extensive global\u000d\u000a      consultation on the recommendations made with UNESCO Member States, with\u000d\u000a      International\u000d\u000a      organisations including EUROSTAT, the UN Conference on Trade and\u000d\u000a      Development and the\u000d\u000a      Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. A total of 203\u000d\u000a      countries were consulted\u000d\u000a      on the recommendations and 104 responded, with the final draft overseen by\u000d\u000a      a Steering Group\u000d\u000a      which included Professor David Throsby, the world's leading cultural\u000d\u000a      statistician. Where the\u000d\u000a      response rate to the original consultation call was lower, further\u000d\u000a      workshop-based consultation on\u000d\u000a      the recommendations of the Expert Scoping Study occurred in 2008-9 to\u000d\u000a      elicit responses from\u000d\u000a      African, Arab, Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions, testing the\u000d\u000a      report's findings in 14 regional\u000d\u000a      workshops attended by academics, practitioners and policy-makers. No\u000d\u000a      significant changes to the\u000d\u000a      Study's recommendations were made during this consultation process. The\u000d\u000a      contribution of the\u000d\u000a      Expert Scoping Study is acknowledged in the published Framework, ratified\u000d\u000a      in 2009, which makes\u000d\u000a      this relationship clear, naming the authors of the report and describing\u000d\u000a      the Framework as being\u000d\u000a      `based on an initial report' by the team (p.iv) [A]. The Framework\u000d\u000a      is now set to guide the\u000d\u000a      comparisons, assessments and evaluations of globally significant cultural\u000d\u000a      developments for the\u000d\u000a      next two decades should the previous revision timetable be echoed again.\u000d\u000a    To demonstrate the relevance and application of the Framework, there is\u000d\u000a      clear evidence of its use\u000d\u000a      within the global community of cultural agencies, such as the\u000d\u000a      International Federation of Arts\u000d\u000a      Councils and Culture Agencies [B] and the data and analysis it\u000d\u000a      produces forms an important\u000d\u000a      source of evidence for both UNESCO and member state policy making. There\u000d\u000a      is also a current\u000d\u000a      programme aimed at integrating the UNESCO Framework into the European\u000d\u000a      statistical standard\u000d\u000a      [C].\u000d\u000a    Even in its first review in 2011, Usero and Brio identify three\u000d\u000a      `significant contributions' of the new\u000d\u000a      Framework: `which', `how' and `how much': 1) the delimiting of cultural\u000d\u000a      activity (what is and what is\u000d\u000a      not included within a cultural domain) and 2) how to make these\u000d\u000a      definitions and 3) how to measure\u000d\u000a      culture's social and economic impact. (2011: 194). It concludes that the\u000d\u000a      new 2009 Framework\u000d\u000a      makes \"a substantial contribution\" to the achievement of its goals by\u000d\u000a      clearly delimiting the cultural\u000d\u000a      sector (2011: 197) [D].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research by Taylor, Pratt and Burns Owen Partnership formed the\u000d\u000a      basis of a new Framework for\u000d\u000a        Cultural Statistics, published in 2009 by UNESCO.

She notes Brown's impact on her and the canon\u000d\u000aof romantic violin concerti, thanking him for reviving Clement, stating, \"It's so wonderful all the\u000d\u000acontributions you've made [...] you've unleashed a wonderful treasure on the world, the Clement\u000d\u000aViolin Concerto\" [G].

Brown spearheaded contextualisation and research into the editions, leading a team\u000d\u000aincluding Robin Stowell as Co-I, David Milsom, Duncan Druce, and George Kennaway. He\u000d\u000adiscovered a significant quantity of music owned and extensively annotated by Ferdinand David (a\u000d\u000aleading 19th-century interpreter), recapturing a contemporary perspective lost or over-written in\u000d\u000alater editions. The project saw both text-based and practice-led investigation of the material, and its\u000d\u000aimplications for performers. The CHASE website [2] places extensive commentaries and research\u000d\u000aarticles (most authored or co-authored by Brown) alongside digitised copies of sources.\u000d\u000aBrown's edition of Franz Clement's Violin Concerto [3] brought to attention a major \"lost\"\u000d\u000awork for the instrument, hugely influential on Beethoven's Violin Concerto (Brown's scholarly\u000d\u000aedition of which followed in 2012, published by Breitkopf und H&#228;rtel and submitted in REF2, joining\u000d\u000ahis edition with preface and critical commentary for the Brahms Violin Concerto, 2006).

The breadth and authority of Brown's work\u000d\u000aon solo violin and chamber music performance is further indicated by important book chapters\u000d\u000afocusing on repertoire by Mendelssohn [4] and Mozart (`Reading between the lines: the notation\u000d\u000aand performance of Mozart's chamber music with keyboard', in Mozart's Chamber Music with\u000d\u000aKeyboard, ed.

In 2009 a\u000d\u000aGerman translation of his seminal biography (first published 1984) incorporated a range of new\u000d\u000aand revised materials [5]. Together with a new `Spohr' entry in Grove Music Online (2001) and a\u000d\u000aperforming edition of Pietro von Abano (2009), this critical examination provided fresh stylistic and\u000d\u000aaesthetic assessments of Spohr.

As a result\u000a      of the research and the documentary films, Gundle was invited to join the\u000a      Scientific Committee for an EU-funded project exploring the future uses of\u000a      the built heritage of fascism and communism in South Eastern Europe. It\u000a      has successfully established a European cultural route to promote tourism\u000a      in the region and preserve the physical symbols of this turbulent period\u000a      in European history. The final meeting of this project was held in Forli\u000a      in June 2013 and consisted of a symposium chaired by Gundle.\u000a    The project team created materials to support teaching and learning in\u000a      HE, FE and secondary schools around the world. The 3 documentary films\u000a      (made in English and Italian versions) combine archival footage with\u000a      original material, including interviews, oral history and location\u000a      filming, each covering a different subject: 1. Mussolini and Fascism; 2.\u000a      The Town of Predappio, Mussolini's birthplace; 3. Mussolini in Postwar\u000a      Italy. These films were distributed to 250 academics and teachers (by\u000a      request) in over 15 countries around the world, including the UK, USA,\u000a      Canada, Italy, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Germany, Poland and South\u000a      Africa. While primarily used to support the teaching of Fascism, the films\u000a      have also been used in courses on Italian History and Culture, Film,\u000a      Religion, Modern Art, Architecture and Gender Studies. In a survey of\u000a      those who used the DVDs in their teaching, 60% did so to encourage a\u000a      greater understanding of the social and cultural trends underpinning\u000a      fascism and to teach historical facts about the ideology and practices of\u000a      fascism. 94% of users reported that the films encouraged an increased\u000a      engagement with the topic among their students. Teachers reported that\u000a      students `now demonstrate a far greater interest in exploring aspects of\u000a      fascism in their research papers than they did prior to utilising the\u000a      DVD.' 82% routinely use the films in their teaching, several respondents\u000a      replying that `the 3 DVDs put together constitute an unprecedented tool\u000a      for teaching and research in any language' and that they are `certainly\u000a      the best AV teaching materials on Fascism available in English.'\u000a    The documentary films were first screened at a public event at UCL in\u000a      London, February 2011, which attracted an audience of approximately 200\u000a      people, including members of the general public, artists, filmmakers and\u000a      historians. The second film about Predappio has had particular impact for\u000a      the region. It was screened in a local cinema owned by the municipality on\u000a      25 February 2011 to an audience of 250 residents, which was followed by a\u000a      round table discussion involving the city's mayor and 3 historians about\u000a      the appropriate contemporary uses of the Fascist past. As a result of his\u000a      research, Gundle was proposed by the municipality of Forli to sit on the\u000a      Scientific Committee of the ATRIUM Project (Architecture of Totalitarian\u000a      Regimes of the 20th Century in Urban Management), an EU-funded\u000a      initiative involving 18 partners from 11 countries in South Eastern\u000a      Europe. Running from 2011 until June 2013, the ATRIUM project has\u000a      generated a survey of surviving Fascist built heritage (monuments,\u000a      buildings, town planning) in the region to support the formation of an\u000a      EU-accredited European cultural route which will both preserve the\u000a      region's built heritage and promote cultural tourism. As the committee's\u000a      only historian, Gundle attended 4 transnational meetings of the project\u000a      partners and provided the historical context for the project which has\u000a      been published in its survey and brochures. By the end of July 2013, the\u000a      partner countries established an association to manage the cultural route\u000a      and published a report on how partner countries can develop visions and\u000a      structures for managing the sites identified for their historical and\u000a      cultural significance.\u000a    To increase public awareness about the important role of visual imagery\u000a      in the cults of twentieth century dictators, the research was used to\u000a      curate an exhibition of artwork produced in Fascist Italy at the Estorick\u000a      Collection of Modern Italian Art in London. The exhibition `Against\u000a      Mussolini: Art and the Fall of a Dictator' ran from 22 September to 19\u000a      December 2010, attracting 4,850 visitors. It was co-curated with the\u000a      Director and staff at the Estorick and Gundle, Pieri and Storchi, who\u000a      provided contacts for collectors who lent works for the exhibition, wrote\u000a      the accompanying labels, wrote the exhibition catalogue (260 sold), and\u000a      gave gallery talks. The exhibition brought to London art works produced in\u000a      Italy and abroad during the Fascist era with a particular emphasis on the\u000a      decline of the cult and the years immediately following Mussolini's\u000a      initial fall from power (1943), during which time there was widespread\u000a      destruction of Fascist symbols and images of Mussolini.

Gundle, Pieri, Duggan and Storchi\u000a      each gave a public talk on 4 Saturday afternoons during the exhibition on\u000a      the historical and political context of the art work and its aesthetic\u000a      qualities to audiences of 20-30 people. The talks were recorded and\u000a      feature on the project website (see below).

Various factors contributed to its emergence, including the\u000a      ideological eclecticism of Fascism, centrifugal impulses within the\u000a      Fascist Party, the idea of Fascism as a form of `religion', contemporary\u000a      celebrity templates, and state control of the media. As the main common\u000a      denominator within the Fascist regime, the cult served several purposes.\u000a      It offered a solution to the limitations of parliament and the monarchy as\u000a      national symbols; it mapped closely on to existing patterns of religious\u000a      and nationalist political belief; it served to establish the sense of an\u000a      intimate bond between masses and leader, and, especially in the early\u000a      1940s, helped short-circuit disaffection generated by economic hardship\u000a      and anger at the corruption and inefficiency of the party and the state.\u000a    Evidence from unpublished diaries and letters in various Italian archives\u000a      examined by Duggan has indicated that the cult was internalised by both\u000a      the well-educated and the less educated. Belief in the genius and\u000a      beneficence of the Duce was often underpinned by religious or\u000a      sexual feelings and was frequently intensified in times of hardship or\u000a      crisis. Distance and class were important: the study of secret police and\u000a      other reports that monitored opinion has shown high levels of adhesion to\u000a      the cult among the peasantry and rather more critical perspectives in the\u000a      towns and cities (among the middle classes especially, but also among\u000a      workers). Mussolini travelled more than any previous Italian prime\u000a      minister and Gundle's research demonstrated that his appearances were\u000a      meticulously prepared and were promoted as magical moments of communion\u000a      between the national leader and the local inhabitants.\u000a    The research underlined a complex interplay between, on the one hand, the\u000a      propaganda machinery of the Fascist party and the state and, on the other,\u000a      spontaneous adhesion to the cult. An important focus of our research was\u000a      on the cult as visual culture (portraits, sculptures, posters, photographs\u000a      and posters) and theatre &#8212; Gundle analysed Mussolini's repertoire of\u000a      theatrical poses and attitudes which were captured and amplified in\u000a      domestic and international press. A wealth of material in private\u000a      collections and archives provided evidence of the peculiar visual strategy\u000a      of the cult which was based on a principle of unity within difference: a\u000a      number of seemingly contrasting iconographic references encompassing\u000a      Classical, Renaissance, Modernist and avant-garde models were shown to\u000a      coexist and to be used to highlight different facets of Mussolini's public\u000a      persona. Images of Mussolini, whether in propaganda or works by the most\u000a      prominent artists, embraced the principle of organised confusion &#8212; an\u000a      approach which gave a misleading sense of stylistic freedom in the\u000a      aesthetic expressions of Fascist Italy.\u000a    Gundle examined the aftermath of the cult and found that it persisted\u000a      among loyalists in the decades after the war which was manifested for\u000a      example through ritual visits to the Mussolini's birthplace, Predappio in\u000a      the province of Forli where he was finally buried in 1957. Memoirs of\u000a      family members and lieutenants published in the press contributed to a\u000a      counter-campaign against the demonisation of Mussolini in the form of\u000a      humanising the late dictator as the embodiment of the flaws of the Italian\u000a      people. Postwar Italian cinema avoided representations of Mussolini at the\u000a      height of his power, while television screened documentaries and then\u000a      depicted him in drama from the 1960s.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"7373","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research has mapped an unwritten history of women's television making\u000a      and viewing in Britain, 1947-1989, showing how assumptions about gender\u000a      preferences affected what is produced, broadcast and archived.

Through discussions with\u000a      archive curators, the research uncovered whole episodes and several\u000a      extracts in the BBC archive, as well as over 30 surviving production\u000a      files. The discovery of this overlooked programme led the BFI's Television\u000a      curator to acquire extracts of the series for the national collection and\u000a      for a viewing copy to be produced which is now available to researchers.\u000a      Such a discovery has raised the question as to why Wednesday Magazine,\u000a      produced with a female audience in mind, has disappeared from television\u000a      history, while it's near contemporary, the arts documentary Monitor\u000a      (1958-64) considered to be `masculine' or `neutral' has left a\u000a      distinguished legacy. The project research directly impacted upon the\u000a      preservation and availability of archival holdings of women's television\u000a      and illuminated previously neglected areas of broadcasting history.\u000a      Further, by highlighting the impact of gender categories on archival\u000a      decisions the research has encouraged archivists to think about what sort\u000a      of television we choose to preserve for future historians and audiences.\u000a      (Item 1, Section 5)\u000a    Wheatley and Wood presented initial findings about professional women in\u000a      early television production and their struggles to produce good\u000a      `television for women' to c.25 senior women in film and television at a\u000a      seminar hosted by Women in Film and Television (WFT) UK, an organisation\u000a      for women working in the creative industries (21.09.11). The discussion\u000a      provided WFT members with a fuller understanding of gendered television\u000a      history, and about the experiences of their predecessors in the industry.\u000a      The organisation's Chief Executive has said that `learning about the work\u000a      of women like Doreen Stephens in television in the early years of the\u000a      medium, and her struggle to produce good television for women at the BBC\u000a      in this period, connected with the experiences of our members working in\u000a      the industry both in the past and today in a variety of ways.' As a direct\u000a      result of this meeting, Irwin's interview with women's television pioneer,\u000a      Hazel Adair was lodged in the Broadcasting Entertainment Cinematograph and\u000a      Theatre Union (BECTU) archive as an important resource for learning about\u000a      women in early television. (Item 2, section 5)\u000a    Public Impact (Impacts 3 &amp; 4)\u000a      As television viewing is an important social and cultural activity with\u000a      significant impact on the identity formation of young adults, the\u000a      researchers sought to re-connect female audiences with their memories of\u000a      early television viewing. This involved sharing the research with the\u000a      broader public through screenings of archival television footage, talks\u000a      and discussions, and a free exhibition.\u000a    Events\u000a      The research revealed that issues relevant to female viewers, such as\u000a      finding a balance between relationships, family and work, were explored in\u000a      television produced in the 1950s and 1960s, well before contemporary shows\u000a      such as Sex and the City and Mad Men. Based on this\u000a      finding, the project team organised `Career Girls on the Small Screen' a\u000a      public event at the Phoenix Arts Centre, Leicester (8.10.2011). The event\u000a      consisted of short talks, a screening of Irwin's interview with Hazel\u000a      Adair, creator of British soap operas Compact (1962-5) and Crossroads\u000a      (1969-85), and screenings of episodes of archive television from the 1960s\u000a      featuring working women: Compact, Rag Trade and The\u000a        Liver Birds. By presenting the research findings which show that the\u000a      roots of much contemporary television content and format (such as audience\u000a      engagement) lay in the 1950s and 1960s rather than the 1980s as commonly\u000a      assumed, the event raised awareness about how early programming designed\u000a      for women dealt with what are often considered to be modern concerns\u000a      (Items 4 and 6, section 5).\u000a    A second public event was held at the BFI Southbank (20.6.2012) featuring\u000a      a presentation by Moseley and Wheatley about representations of women in\u000a      the workplace since the 1960s and a panel discussion involving prominent\u000a      women in the media - Abi Morgan, writer of The Hour, BBC Executive\u000a      drama producer Hilary Salmon and actor Amanda Redman - and chaired by Kate\u000a      Kinninmont, Chief Executive of Women in Film and TV. Attracting an\u000a      audience of 112 (exceeding the BFI's expectations of an audience of c.85),\u000a      the event encouraged participants and the audience to think about the\u000a      history of women's television and its relationship with present-day\u000a      programming in new ways (for example, the importance of costume in\u000a      representation, the question of ethnicity in representations of working\u000a      women, and the limited stories told about working women) and to relate it\u000a      to their own life experiences (Items 4 and 6, section 5). The BFI's TV\u000a      programmer (who attended the event) reported that it provided `a greater\u000a      understanding of the way women have been represented historically at work\u000a      on TV' and that Moseley and Wheatley offered `new critical tools of\u000a      analysis to better understand patterns across television history'. The\u000a      media industry participants also expressed that the event had made them\u000a      think differently about the ways in which television represented working\u000a      women (Item 5, section 5). The event was featured in `The Cultural\u000a      Highlights you have to see' section of the `I' newspaper (20.6.2012).\u000a    Exhibition\u000a      As a further means for engaging broad audiences with the research, the\u000a      team set up a `pop-up' exhibition in an empty shop in Coventry City centre\u000a      in collaboration with ArtSpace and Coventry City Council. The exhibition,\u000a      open May 2012, consisted of archival publicity material (such as posters),\u000a      television related pop memorabilia and archival footage of pop music\u000a      shows. Open to the public 3 days a week and staffed by the research team\u000a      and student volunteers from Warwick and DMU, the exhibition offered\u000a      visitors the opportunity to explore the important role television pop\u000a      music programming played in the developing identity of teenagers and young\u000a      women in the period. Admission was free and attracted 158 visitors. The\u000a      window display, decorated to look like a 1960s living room, including a\u000a      television playing 1960s pop programmes, was visible for the entire month,\u000a      making the research accessible to passers-by the whole time.\u000a    The exhibition allowed members of the public to share their memories of\u000a      early television viewing and to discuss with the researchers the\u000a      programmes they felt were `for them'. Feedback via postcards and a\u000a      visitors' book showed that visitors gained a better understanding of\u000a      British television history and also valued the opportunity to revisit\u000a      their own memories of television. The `pop-up shop' attracted media\u000a      coverage locally being featured in the Coventry Evening Telegraph\u000a      (27.4.2012; daily circulation 31,000) and on BBC Coventry and Warwickshire\u000a      radio (30.4.2012, average 86,000 weekly listeners, BBC figures). As\u000a      further evidence of the exhibition's significance Moseley and Wheatley\u000a      were awarded the Warwick Arts Impact Award (2012) for commitment to\u000a      engaging the public with research.\u000a    Media\u000a      Wheatley was consulted for the second series of the BBC drama on early\u000a      television The Hour by a programme researcher in November 2011.\u000a      Based on the project research, she informed the production team about the\u000a      kinds of cookery programmes the character Marnie Madden would have made\u000a      for commercial television in the period. Information supplied by Wheatley\u000a      fed into the production design and directly influenced the setup of these\u000a      scenes. The fact that Wheatley was contacted by the production team\u000a      resulted from the public profile of the research (on the strength of\u000a      Wheatley and Moseley's interview in the Guardian) (Item 3, section\u000a      5). Further indications of the impact's reach and significance are shown\u000a      by national media interest: Moseley appeared on BBC Radio 4's `Woman's\u000a      Hour' (19.8.11; average 4 million listeners, BBC figures) to discuss the\u000a      research findings and the project was featured in the Guardian\u000a      (6.9.2011; daily circulation 232,566, Sep 2011). The project's social\u000a      media pages include Facebook (150 likes and 61 friends) and Twitter (138\u000a      followers) have enabled participants to share their memories of and\u000a      thoughts about women's television programming (Item 8, section 5).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The research has mapped an unwritten history of women's television making\u000a      and viewing in Britain, 1947-1989. By showing how assumptions about gender\u000a      preferences and the presumed inferior quality of women's programming\u000a      affected what is produced, broadcast and archived, the research has\u000a      preserved and made accessible important programmes from Britain's\u000a      television history. The research has re-presented women's television\u000a      history by showing that genres not typically considered to be `women's'\u000a      (e.g. music programmes, sport) were just as important to the identity\u000a      formation of young women as were dramatic programmes (e.g. Compact)\u000a      which dealt with working women in the 1960s. The research has brought an\u000a      increased awareness of a new history of women's television in Britain to\u000a      media professionals, archivists and the general public, especially women\u000a      viewers from the period 1947-89.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Warwick\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Warwick (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Warwick","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"West Midlands","UKPRN":10007163}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a&#8226; Mary Irwin, `What Women Want on Television: Doreen Stephens and BBC\u000a      Television Programmes for Women, 1953-64', `Media for and by Women: A\u000a      Historical Perspective', special edition Westminster Papers in\u000a        Communication and Culture 8:3 (Dec., 2011), 99-122.

Available glimpses of\u000a      programming from the period have suggested interesting shifts in content,\u000a      modes of address and representations of gender. However, the ways in which\u000a      the British television industry conceptualised the female audience, or\u000a      how, when and why programmes were made specifically for women has been\u000a      largely absent from key histories of television (Briggs (1985) The\u000a        BBC: The first fifty years), and in broader histories of British\u000a      broadcasting (e.g. Crisell (1997) and Hilmes (2003)). Further, there has\u000a      been little exploration of women's memories of television viewing despite\u000a      prevailing assumptions about the feminisation of the medium. This project\u000a      has filled in some of the gaps in the history of British television,\u000a      outlining significant moments in the period, specific programme types,\u000a      genres and scheduling slots which have become significantly marked as\u000a      feminine, emphasising the connection between industry, programme and\u000a      audience histories.\u000a    Research conducted at Warwick explored the production culture, policies\u000a      and decision making which produced television programming for women in\u000a      Britain using the BBC Written Archive at Caversham and the Incorporated\u000a      Television Company (ITC) collection held at the British Film Institute\u000a      (BFI). Work by Irwin on the BBC's early period revealed that the\u000a      contribution of high-level women working in production, such as Doreen\u000a      Stephens, has been excluded from previous histories of British television.\u000a      Irwin also documented the factual and dramatic programming that was\u000a      addressed to a female viewer, and surveyed the programmes surviving in the\u000a      archives, producing an analysis of key archival texts. Wheatley's research\u000a      has examined how the display of television at expos such as the Ideal Home\u000a      Exhibition figured television as an object of domestic modernity.\u000a      Moseley's work has examined how romantic television dramas of Cornwall\u000a      (e.g. Poldark, The Camomile Lawn, Coming Home) from the 1970s to\u000a      the 1990s addressed and were received by a female audience.\u000a    A parallel strand of research conducted by DMU was based on interviews\u000a      with female audience members, exploring their memories of television in\u000a      the context of their personal narratives and how the programmes made\u000a      `especially for them' resonated with their lives. While drama has been a\u000a      common theme, the research also revealed that female audiences viewed less\u000a      typically `feminine' genres such as sport, music programming and natural\u000a      history as being `for them'. It has also demonstrated the embedded-ness of\u000a      television for women in their relationships with and in the home, for\u000a      example through their discussion of television in relation to their roles\u000a      as wives and mothers, and their interactions with the television set and\u000a      its associated objects (chairs, remote controls, listings magazines). By\u000a      revealing an unwritten history of women's television production and\u000a      consumption, this project has contributed to a fuller understanding of the\u000a      production, texts and reception of women's media culture in late\u000a      twentieth-century Britain.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"7374","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Haedicke's scholarly work on the aesthetics and politics of street arts\u000d\u000a      has established her as an acknowledged expert in the field among\u000d\u000a      professional and scholarly colleagues.

She\u000d\u000a      has used her research to support the development of new forms of artistic\u000d\u000a      expression, and to contribute to the professional development of street\u000d\u000a      artists.\u000d\u000a    That her beneficiaries - creative practitioners, festival directors,\u000d\u000a      independent researchers, and educators in professional training programmes\u000d\u000a      for early career street artists - value the input of Haedicke's work is\u000d\u000a      evidenced by the number of invitations she receives to judge and comment\u000d\u000a      on new work at street theatre festivals and professional training\u000d\u000a      programmes; to advise on challenges and opportunities faced by street\u000d\u000a      artists for government-sponsored research projects; and to speak to\u000d\u000a      general public audiences who are interested in the arts. Invitations to\u000d\u000a      critique new work (MiramirO Street Theatre Festival, Ghent,\u000d\u000a      Belgium, 2009 and 2010, and at FiraT&#224;rrega, street theatre\u000d\u000a      festival in T&#224;rrega, Spain, 2010) testify to Haedicke's positive impact on\u000d\u000a      helping early career artists improve their work. In 2009, FAI AR (Formation\u000a        Avanc&#233;e et Itinerante des Arts de la Rue), the only professional\u000d\u000a      street arts training institute in Europe, invited Haedicke to work with\u000d\u000a      five young artists in the programme over several days, commenting on and\u000d\u000a      evaluating various aspects of their work as part of Panorama des\u000d\u000a        Chantiers, the five-day capstone event. Haedicke was invited back to\u000d\u000a      Panorama des Chantiers in 2013 as one of three observateurs\u000d\u000a      to examine and comment on the artistic creations of all the young artists\u000d\u000a      in the programme. After her public presentation on the work before an\u000d\u000a      audience including professional artists, journalists, festival programmers\u000d\u000a      and students, one of the pioneering street artists from G&#233;n&#233;rik Vapeur\u000d\u000a      commented that she finally understood the shift from resistant work of the\u000d\u000a      1960s and 1970s to the more collaborative work of today. Artists in\u000d\u000a      several street theatre companies, for example, Friches Th&#233;&#226;tre Urbain,\u000d\u000a      Op&#233;ra Paga&#239;, Jeanne Simone, Osmosis, Etxea and others, have\u000d\u000a      acknowledged the impact of Haedicke's critical analyses of their\u000d\u000a      productions on their creative processes. Sarah Harper, Artistic Director\u000d\u000a      of Friches Th&#233;&#226;tre Urbain, uses Haedicke's critiques of the\u000d\u000a      company's productions to augment grant applications and in promotional\u000d\u000a      materials. She has said that these analyses `enable her to understand\u000d\u000a      intellectually what she has created intuitively' and that, in turn, helps\u000d\u000a      her develop the work further. Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Etcheverry of the artistic duo\u000d\u000a      Etxea has asked for a continuing dialogue with Haedicke as he and his\u000d\u000a      partner develop their new community-oriented piece, Transversales 13,\u000d\u000a      as part of 2r2c's `Territoires et Questions' over the next three years.\u000d\u000a      And choreographer and dancer Ali Salmi of Osmosis and Cyril Jaubert,\u000d\u000a      Director of Op&#233;ra Paga&#239;, have expressed an interest in having\u000d\u000a      Haedicke advise on productions as they are being developed.\u000d\u000a    Haedicke's engagement with street arts professionals, cultural policy\u000d\u000a      makers and funding bodies has focused on improving the professionalisation\u000d\u000a      of the craft through better educational provision and training programmes.\u000d\u000a      She has long been an advocate for increasing collaboration between\u000d\u000a      universities and professional street artists as a means for achieving\u000d\u000a      these goals. She has been asked to consult on educational policy for\u000d\u000a      determining pedagogy in professional street arts training programmes, in\u000d\u000a      university\/professional institutions partnership programmes, and within\u000d\u000a      university programmes training students for professional street arts in\u000d\u000a      the UK and Europe. She was invited to participate in the first Nomadic\u000d\u000a      University for the Street Arts in Aurillac, France in 2008 where she\u000d\u000a      addressed the role that Higher Education can play in training and\u000d\u000a      legitimating street arts, two key concerns of practitioners. Funded by the\u000d\u000a      European Commission's Cultural Programme, this initiative developed into\u000d\u000a      the annual Street Arts Winter Academy, a symposium of street theatre\u000d\u000a      practitioners, university educators and cultural policy makers reviewing\u000d\u000a      the present state of street theatre education in Europe. Haedicke has been\u000d\u000a      an invited participant since its inception in 2011. The theme of the\u000d\u000a      symposium that year was to promote structured education in street theatre\u000d\u000a      by identifying and developing specific pedagogical tools and curricula to\u000d\u000a      help improve existing training programmes and to improve the integration\u000d\u000a      of street arts into university-based training. These symposia have\u000d\u000a      resulted in proposals to inform national bodies and government\u000d\u000a      organisations in the development of educational policies for street arts\u000d\u000a      throughout Europe, for example, the `Definitive Document' on street arts\u000d\u000a      training in 2013 (following the guidelines of ELIA, European League of the\u000d\u000a      Institutes of the Arts) to be published and circulated in 2014. And, in\u000d\u000a      2009, the Independent Street Arts Network (ISAN, UK) invited Haedicke to\u000d\u000a      contribute to policy development related to street arts education and\u000d\u000a      training. ISAN, an independent group of artists and promoters of street\u000d\u000a      arts working to develop the art form, was commissioned by Arts Council\u000d\u000a      England to map existing and proposed provision in both Higher and Further\u000d\u000a      Education, as well as to identify gaps in training and professional\u000d\u000a      development in the UK.\u000d\u000a    Haedicke has advised on partnerships between universities and street arts\u000d\u000a      companies as well as creating modules to bring this into practice. In\u000d\u000a      2009, she was invited to develop `The Tocil Wood Project' and two units of\u000d\u000a      `Ambienti' teaching module (an online e-learning platform for the\u000d\u000a      community) in `Esperienze Culturali' for Facolt&#224; di Architettura\u000d\u000a      in Alghero, Italy. From 2010-12, Haedicke gave advice to the\u000d\u000a      administrative director of FAI AR on educational models for\u000d\u000a      professional training programmes in street arts and on partnerships\u000d\u000a      between universities and professional training schools. FAI AR has\u000d\u000a      developed a partnership with Aix-Marseille Universit&#233; (starting in autumn\u000d\u000a      2013) so that the graduates receive a university degree and a professional\u000d\u000a      diploma. This model has also been established for an MA degree (MA in\u000d\u000a      Street Arts Creation) between FiraT&#224;rrega, a professional street theatre\u000d\u000a      festival, and the University of Lleida (both in Catalonia).\u000d\u000a    While Haedicke has done most of her work with organisations in Europe,\u000d\u000a      and especially in France, where street arts are better developed, she has\u000d\u000a      also worked to improve street arts in the UK. She advised on the\u000d\u000a      challenges and opportunities faced by street artists in the West Midlands\u000d\u000a      for `Making More of Outdoor Arts', a research project commissioned by ACE\u000d\u000a      West Midlands and undertaken by an arts consultancy and an independent\u000d\u000a      artistic director. It ran from Sep 2012 - Mar 2013 and was designed to set\u000d\u000a      the future direction for outdoor arts development. Haedicke advised on the\u000d\u000a      potential for linkages between HEIs and the professional street arts\u000d\u000a      community and on the need for the development of a critical discourse\u000d\u000a      which can play a role in advocacy and profile- raising.\u000d\u000a    Additional invitations to participate in popular festivals and\u000d\u000a      professional conferences serve as further evidence of the influence of\u000d\u000a      Haedicke's work in the practical field. Haedicke was invited to give\u000d\u000a      public lectures to non-academic audiences, notably `Op&#233;ra Paga&#239;'s Entreprise\u000a        de D&#233;tournement: Performance Interventions and Community Engagement'\u000d\u000a      at Coventry Mysteries Week (2012); `Can Performances in Public Spaces Find\u000d\u000a      a Place in University Courses?'

Associate\u000d\u000a      Professor at Warwick since 2007, Haedicke has participated actively in the\u000d\u000a      practice of street arts for over a decade: as dramaturg of several\u000d\u000a      professional shows; as director of a summer study abroad programme where\u000d\u000a      professional street artists trained undergraduate students in various\u000d\u000a      performance techniques for street performance; as a judge of new street\u000d\u000a      arts work at festivals and professional training programs; and as a\u000d\u000a      participant\/speaker in professional symposia and street arts network\u000d\u000a      meetings.\u000d\u000a    This hands-on practice has informed her scholarly work that is unique in\u000d\u000a      the English-speaking world. Her research has developed a critical language\u000d\u000a      for examining what she calls an embodied aesthetics of public space,\u000d\u000a      an aesthetics that thrives on the interplay of the occasion of\u000d\u000a      performance, the social participation of the public, and the intervention\u000d\u000a      into a public space. Her research looks at how artists appropriate public\u000d\u000a      spaces, architecture and objects to alter their meanings, blur their\u000d\u000a      boundaries, and invent new ways of using them. It investigates the ways in\u000d\u000a      which street performances engage with and intervene into official and\u000d\u000a      popular discourses on significant socio-political issues, such as\u000d\u000a      immigration, discrimination and otherness (particularly in `The Outsider\u000d\u000a      Outside: Performing Immigration in French Street Theatre', 2010), use of\u000d\u000a      public space and urban renewal, community regeneration, and participatory\u000d\u000a      citizenship. The research interrogates how the work can reinvigorate\u000d\u000a      public spaces, transform public perceptions of the urban landscape and the\u000d\u000a      activities taking place and encourage democratic activities and creative\u000d\u000a      practices by providing the setting in which audiences can `rehearse' these\u000d\u000a      civic acts. It explores how street arts can function as a form of activism\u000d\u000a      that can change, even temporarily, how onlookers see public spaces and\u000d\u000a      what they do there, and thus it questions street arts' potential impact on\u000d\u000a      engaged citizenship and participatory democracy.\u000d\u000a    These ideas are explored in the chapters cited, but the research is\u000d\u000a      developed most extensively in Contemporary Street Arts: Aesthetics and\u000d\u000a        Politics (2013) in which Haedicke claims that fiction does\u000d\u000a      not work in opposition to reality; rather the imaginary\u000d\u000a      re-frames, re-interprets, confuses, subverts or challenges notions of the\u000d\u000a      real. The book questions whether street arts acquire a practical\u000d\u000a      and social significance as they offer the public the opportunity to view\u000d\u000a      everyday life and familiar locations through a lens of art and thus\u000d\u000a      potentially to re-evaluate the meaning and function of quotidian\u000d\u000a      activities and urban spaces that, in turn, enables the public to rehearse\u000d\u000a      democratic practices. It seeks to develop a critical language to\u000d\u000a      interrogate the \"rehearsal\" of citizen activism and democratic action,\u000d\u000a      whether recognised as a form of activism by the spectator or not, and it\u000d\u000a      looks at how participation in the event constitutes a rehearsal of civic\u000d\u000a      acts that can reinvigorate and re-form public spaces.

Belfiore's and Bennett's 2007 and 2010\u000d\u000a      articles were identified as\u000d\u000a      `particularly influential in reframing questions about the impacts of the\u000d\u000a      arts' in the literature review\u000d\u000a      prepared to inform the design of the strategy (2). The review highlighted\u000d\u000a      two of their main\u000d\u000a      messages &#8212; that the debate about intrinsic v. instrumental value of the\u000d\u000a      arts has a long history and\u000d\u000a      that recent research has become conflated with advocacy. The then Director\u000d\u000a      of Research has\u000d\u000a      confirmed that:\u000d\u000a    `The most useful aspect of The Social Impact of the Arts was not\u000d\u000a      a specific output but rather\u000d\u000a      the contribution of an in-depth, historical, critical analysis to\u000d\u000a      contemporary debates about the\u000d\u000a      role and value of the arts. It was helpful for the Arts Council to see its\u000d\u000a      current dilemmas in the\u000d\u000a      context of thousands of years of debate and to acknowledge a rich and\u000d\u000a      well-established\u000d\u000a      discourse about the potential negative impacts of the arts as well as the\u000d\u000a      positive. More\u000d\u000a      specifically, the classification of impacts has been a useful starting\u000d\u000a      point for other research\u000d\u000a      exercises and the work on determinants of impact has helped the Arts\u000d\u000a      Council to understand\u000d\u000a      the challenges and complexities of evaluating an individual's artistic\u000d\u000a      experience.\u000d\u000a    The research was an important part of the background literature that the\u000d\u000a      Arts Council\u000d\u000a      reviewed to inform its ten-year strategic framework. As part of this\u000d\u000a      process the Arts Council\u000d\u000a      debated whether its long-term goals should include a focus on economic and\u000d\u000a      social impact\u000d\u000a      and eventually decided against this, choosing instead to focus on core\u000d\u000a      areas such as\u000d\u000a      participation and the sustainability of arts organisations where the Arts\u000d\u000a      Council can have\u000d\u000a      more direct influence. The research by Belfiore and Bennett was part of\u000d\u000a      the wider discourse\u000d\u000a      that informed and gave weight to this decision.' (3)\u000d\u000a    That the research influenced the thinking of the most senior officers at\u000d\u000a      ACE is illustrated by Sir\u000d\u000a      Christopher Frayling, former Chairman of ACE, who used The Social\u000d\u000a        Impact of the Arts in his\u000d\u000a      valedictory lecture (29 Jan 2009) to argue that recent criticisms of the\u000d\u000a      council's work deflected from\u000d\u000a      the real debates in the arts. In particular, Frayling drew out two of the\u000d\u000a      research's key messages &#8212;\u000d\u000a      that the current debate about the value of the arts should be situated in\u000d\u000a      a long-standing discussion\u000d\u000a      going back to the origins of Western intellectual thought (chapters 2, 6\u000d\u000a      and 9, esp. pp. 178-83) and\u000d\u000a      that the move towards evidence-based policy marginalises the subjective\u000d\u000a      aesthetic experience\u000d\u000a      provided by the arts (Introduction, esp. pp. 5-9). So important did\u000d\u000a      Frayling consider this work (the\u000d\u000a      only academic work referenced in his speech) that he said, `I can\u000d\u000a      recommend Eleonora Belfiore\u000d\u000a      and Oliver Bennett's The Social Impact of the Arts published last\u000d\u000a      year as a real nourishment to\u000d\u000a      public debate.' (1) This aspect of Frayling's speech, referring to the\u000d\u000a      historical tradition of debate\u000d\u000a      about the arts going back to Plato, was cited in The Guardian (29\u000d\u000a      Jan 2009).\u000d\u000a    The research has also provided evidence-based arguments to charities and\u000d\u000a      arts organisations who\u000d\u000a      advocate policy makers to acknowledge the value spectrum of the arts and\u000d\u000a      culture. Belfiore was\u000d\u000a      consulted by telephone by cultural consultant John Knell, co-author of the\u000d\u000a      Royal Society for the\u000d\u000a      Arts, Manufactures and Commerce's pamphlet `Arts Funding, Austerity and\u000d\u000a      the Big Society' to give\u000d\u000a      advice and feedback on early drafts. It was distributed to culture\u000d\u000a      professionals, practitioners and\u000d\u000a      policymakers at the State of the Arts Conference, February 2011, and is\u000d\u000a      available online (4,082\u000d\u000a      unique page views and 583 views on Scribd). The authors drew on\u000d\u000a      Belfiore's and Bennett's\u000d\u000a      research (published in 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010) to claim that the sector\u000d\u000a      needs to re-invent the\u000d\u000a      instrumental case to argue more convincingly for the value of the arts.\u000d\u000a      The publications were\u000d\u000a      referenced 6 times; the 2004 and 2010 articles were quoted over several\u000d\u000a      lines.

It features a curated blog (with contributions\u000d\u000a      from the sector in the UK\u000d\u000a      and abroad) and resources. Three consultation events in 2013 have\u000d\u000a      connected the artistic\u000d\u000a      community with the research: `Dangerous Ground: reframing cultural value',\u000d\u000a      in collaboration with\u000d\u000a      Mission, Models, Money, the cultural professional network, and a-n The\u000d\u000a      Artists Information\u000d\u000a      Company comprised events with invited creative practitioners in Manchester\u000d\u000a      (30 artists; visual\u000d\u000a      arts), London (20 artists; performing arts) and Edinburgh (12 artists;\u000d\u000a      crafts). Organisations\u000d\u000a      representing artists who participated in `Dangerous Ground' have said that\u000d\u000a      they think differently\u000d\u000a      about the issues surrounding cultural value after collaborating with\u000d\u000a      Belfiore, `She has created a\u000d\u000a      language and a way of framing the issue that expresses the reality and\u000d\u000a      importance of the debate\u000d\u000a      for front line practitioners that enables them to engage.' Susan Jones,\u000d\u000a      Director of A-N, has\u000d\u000a      confirmed that Belfiore `has been instrumental in raising issues about how\u000d\u000a      to value creative\u000d\u000a      practitioners that I and others can draw on to ensure that there is some\u000d\u000a      kind of support for artists in\u000d\u000a      the next phase of funding.'

In addition to the consultation Belfiore held with craft makers in\u000d\u000a      Edinburgh as part of\u000d\u000a      `Dangerous Ground', she was an invited keynote speaker at the conference\u000d\u000a      `Culturing our\u000d\u000a      Creativity' organised by Creative Scotland, Arts &amp; Business Scotland,\u000d\u000a      and the Cultural Enterprise\u000d\u000a      Office, and involved arts charities and advocacy groups to identify the\u000d\u000a      conditions needed for arts\u000d\u000a      and culture to flourish in Scotland and to begin developing a strategic\u000d\u000a      narrative for future support.\u000d\u000a    Belfiore has used her research to provide advice directly to UK\u000d\u000a      policymakers. In 2011, she was\u000d\u000a      invited to participate in two roundtable discussions (18 May and 11 July)\u000d\u000a      on protecting cultural\u000d\u000a      education with the then shadow Secretary of State for Culture, Media and\u000d\u000a      Sport and the then\u000d\u000a      shadow Secretary of State for Education. Based on her research into the\u000d\u000a      reasons underlying\u000d\u000a      cultural policies, Belfiore argued that the Labour party needs to develop\u000d\u000a      a political argument\u000d\u000a      against cuts to cultural education in addition to economic and social\u000d\u000a      justifications. In November\u000d\u000a      2011, Belfiore was invited to Portcullis House to advise the team for Dan\u000d\u000a      Jarvis, the new shadow\u000d\u000a      culture minister, about reforming Labour's Arts policies.

Dr Eleonora\u000d\u000a      Belfiore has critically examined policy discourse, bringing into focus the\u000d\u000a      underlying yet often\u000d\u000a      unacknowledged assumptions of the `arts are good for you' rhetoric that\u000d\u000a      underpins much of post\u000d\u000a      war British and European cultural policy.

The research also demonstrated that arguments articulating\u000d\u000a      the negative effects of\u000d\u000a      the arts have been as strong historically as those advocating its\u000d\u000a      benefits, but have been obscured\u000d\u000a      in policy discourse because they did not fit the dominant rhetoric.\u000d\u000a    Later phases of the research analyse the value and impact discourse as it\u000d\u000a      relates to arts and\u000d\u000a      humanities research. This led to a mapping of the `impact discourse' in\u000d\u000a      Higher Education, and the\u000d\u000a      identification of two strands of thinking and writing: a `doom and gloom'\u000d\u000a      strand that sees arts and\u000d\u000a      humanities in perpetual crisis and a second strand composed of ambitious\u000d\u000a      and unrealistic\u000d\u000a      declarations about the social, economic and cultural impacts of the\u000d\u000a      humanities.

Powerplant is a multimedia performance trio featuring\u000a      Joby Burgess\u000a      (percussion\/electronics), Matthew Fairclough (sound design\/electronics)\u000a      and Kathy Hinde (visuals).\u000a      The ITEM-funded research involved the development of a touring and\u000a      performance system, and\u000a      was dependent on Fairclough's practice-based research in composing and\u000a      developing\u000a      performance methods for percussion and electronics. The research has\u000a      benefited Burgess' career\u000a      in the following ways:\u000a    a) Initially, the research involved designing and developing a new system\u000a      centred on the\u000a      Xylosynth linked to a laptop computer, facilitating live sampling, looping\u000a      and sound\u000a      processing. The system enabled Burgess to tour without the need for a\u000a      dedicated and\u000a      expensive sound engineer. As a result, Burgess has secured more solo\u000a      concert\u000a      opportunities, including tours in America and the UK.\u000a    b) Fairclough trained Burgess to use this system, introducing him to\u000a      skills that enhanced his\u000a      profile as a unique and innovative performer with a new and distinctive\u000a      repertoire.\u000a    c) The success of the Powerplant collaboration led to awards in excess of\u000a      &#163;10K from the ACE\u000a      and the Performing Rights Society (PRS) Foundation, providing funds for\u000a      touring,\u000a      marketing, recording and the commissioning of new works.\u000a    The ACE and PRS grants enabled Powerplant to commission other composers,\u000a      further broadening\u000a      the repertoire for Burgess. For example, composer Graham Fitkin worked\u000a      with Powerplant in the\u000a      University of Liverpool (UoL) recording studios, where new looping and\u000a      sampling techniques were\u000a      demonstrated using Fairclough's Audiotechonics III. Consequently,\u000a      Fitkin composed Chain of\u000a        Command, which was recorded on CD (SIGCD143) and featured in many UK\u000a      and international\u000a      performances, making direct use of Fairclough's system. Other subsequent\u000a      commissions have\u000a      utilised the Powerplant system including Gabriel Prokofiev's Import\u000a      Export, which has been\u000a      recorded on CD (NONCLSS007) and performed many times, both nationally and\u000a      internationally.\u000a    Additionally, Powerplant has benefited the career of video artist Kathy\u000a        Hinde. Hinde has created\u000a      visuals for Fairclough's compositions since 2002, as well as live video\u000a      projections for Powerplant's\u000a      repertoire. The collaboration on Fairclough's compositions has helped to\u000a      raise Hinde's public\u000a      profile as an artist and provide her with financial income. The Powerplant\u000a      releases are hybrid CDs\u000a      that include additional video content, which has raised Hinde's profile\u000a      even further. Viewing figures\u000a      for Powerplant videos on Youtube have exceeded 200,000. Throughout their\u000a      collaboration on\u000a      Fairclough's compositions, Fairclough has been able to share his research\u000a      methods and practice\u000a      with Hinde, and in her written accompanying statement (Section 5 below)\u000a      Hinde describes how this\u000a      has enhanced her knowledge, skills and creative output. In 2008, following\u000a      preparatory work at the\u000a      University of Liverpool (UoL) recording studios, Fairclough and Hinde\u000a      performed as a duo at FACT\u000a      and Bath International Music Festival, and Hinde created live video\u000a      projections for Fairclough's\u000a      own performance in which he used his live electronics system.\u000a    Powerplant's performances have had a positive cultural and inspirational\u000a      impact on audiences. For\u000a      example, Devonshire A-level student Jessica Clarke contacted Fairclough\u000a      after attending a\u000a      Powerplant concert. Impressed by the music and performance, she purchased\u000a      a Xylosynth but\u000a      experienced difficulties trying to achieve the kind of effects and style\u000a      of playing that Powerplant had\u000a      demonstrated. Consequently, Clarke visited the UoL studios and received\u000a      training from Fairclough\u000a      on the use of her computer system and Xylosynth. Notably, based on his\u000a      previous research,\u000a      Fairclough was able to create a software patch that solved a problem in\u000a      Clarke's performance set-\u000a      up.\u000a    Further impact has been achieved in the secondary education sector.\u000a      Financial support from the\u000a      University of Liverpool's Research Development Fund facilitated a series\u000a      of 10 workshops at\u000a      schools and Arts Centres during 2012\/2013, reaching over 400 school\u000a      children studying music.\u000a      Fairclough and Burgess demonstrated Fairclough's compositions and\u000a      performance system, giving\u000a      the pupils an insight into performance practice and New Music repertoire\u000a      with electronics. There\u000a      was much positive feedback from the workshops including statements such as\u000a      \"The students\u000a      haven't stopped talking about the event. For younger students who\u000a      attended, they have become\u000a      more brave and creative in their composition work, this is only less than\u000a      a week after the\u000a      performance!\" (Music Teacher at St Lawrence School, Bradford Upon-Avon\u000a      19.6.2013).\u000a    In addition to this, Powerplant's recordings, concerts and workshops have\u000a      enabled public\u000a      audiences locally, nationally and internationally to access and engage\u000a      with Contemporary Art\u000a      Music featuring percussion and live electronics. Fairclough's compositions\u000a      have added to this\u000a      sparse repertoire, a repertoire that was previously rarely encountered\u000a      outside of a Higher\u000a      Education setting. Three of Fairclough's compositions are recorded on two\u000a      CD releases and have\u000a      been performed in international concerts. One of these compositions, Audiotectonics\u000a        III, was\u000a      selected for a special New Year's Day edition of Radio 4's `Late Junction'\u000a      in 2008, with subsequent\u000a      broadcasts in Ireland and Australia. Furthermore, Audiotectonics III,\u000a      Carbon Copy and The Boom\u000a        and the Bap are all available for download via commercial websites,\u000a      including iTunes, and all have\u000a      received positive reviews.\u000a    Finally, the manufacturer Wernick Instruments has benefited from the\u000a      Xylosynth being used in the\u000a      unexpected context of Contemporary Art Music concerts and public\u000a      workshops, which has led to\u000a      an increase in sales, such as the purchase by Jessica Clarke (above).\u000a      Furthermore, early on in the\u000a      Powerplant collaboration, feedback from Fairclough and Burgess enabled\u000a      Wernick Instruments to\u000a      modify the internal software of subsequent models, improving the\u000a      compatibility with computer\u000a      music software in live performance.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study describes the impact of the on-going practice-based\u000a      research undertaken by\u000a      Matthew Fairclough, started in 2003, into new ways of working with\u000a      percussion and electronics.

Contributed to tourism growth, economy and experience\u000a    The Beat Goes On (TBGO) attracted 478,188 visitors. Using\u000a      data on the profile of visitors to the museum, together with visitor spend\u000a      figures supplied by the Mersey Partnership Digest of Merseyside Tourism,\u000a      NML calculates that these visitors contributed &#163;22,255,060 to the\u000a        local economy (corroborating source a). The extensive research at\u000a      Phase 1 enabled a richly layered exhibition allowing visitors to access\u000a      different levels of detail and depth, and information on a broad range of\u000a      music styles and histories. Indicators of the quality of the\u000a        exhibition included favourable press reviews and radio coverage,\u000a      recommendations by national newspapers such as the Independent on\u000a        Sunday and Daily Telegraph, and a short film for The\u000a        Guardian website (corroborating source b). The exhibition was\u000a      shortlisted for the `Tourism Experience of the Year' award in the\u000a      Mersey Partnership Annual Tourism Awards 2010; and was voted by the public\u000a      as their favourite NML exhibition of 2008 (corroborating source c), and by\u000a      Daily Post readers as their favourite large venue exhibition of\u000a      2009 (corroborating source d).\u000a    ii. Enriched public understanding, engagement and experience\u000a    Dissemination of the underpinning research (through object displays, text\u000a      panels, images, commissioned films, gallery puzzles, computer\u000a      interactives, and audio recordings) stimulated public engagement with\u000a        music heritage. For example, the Mapping the Beat\u000a      installation based on Phase 2 research enabled visitors to explore music's\u000a      contribution to local character by clicking on and through sites featured\u000a      on digital maps of the city to reveal layers of related materials (written\u000a      narratives, archival images, and excerpts from interviews, songs and live\u000a      performance). The exhibition content, design and approach attracted\u000a        new visitors to the museum, particularly teenagers (often a lost\u000a      audience to museums). The NML Annual Report 2009-2010 notes, `Visitors\u000a      learnt about the remarkable achievements of Merseyside artists from across\u000a      the years ...The exhibition proved to be very popular, especially with 13\u000a      -18 year olds' (corroborating source e). The Beat Goes Online, a\u000a      resource designed to support the exhibition and produce a lasting legacy,\u000a      extended possibilities for learning beyond museum visitors and has\u000a      had 130,700 page views since its launch in August 2008.\u000a    The research underpinning TBGO enhanced the cultural experience of\u000a        museum visitors by stimulating memories, providing an educational\u000a      and enjoyable experience, and encouraging awareness of and pride in local\u000a      cultural heritage. A 2009 NML exhibition evaluation report (corroborating\u000a      source f) based on interviews with 203 museum visitors, revealed that for\u000a      70% of them the exhibition brought back memories, 98% found the exhibition\u000a      text engaging and easy to understand, and 83% felt they had learnt\u000a        something new. This is also evidenced by remarks on comment cards\u000a      (corroborating source g), such as: `This exhibition is fantastic I could\u000a      spend hours reliving my childhood &amp; teenage years here' (58 year-old\u000a      woman from Sleaford, Lincolnshire); `Today I learned just how much\u000a      influence Liverpool has on musical history' (15 year-old girl from\u000a      Liverpool); `This has been an educational experience' (21 year-old man\u000a      from London). Subsequent (Phase 3) research by Leonard and Knifton\u000a      underpinned additional public engagement events. They included the Mixcase\u000a      exhibition (VG&amp;M, 2011; 23,417 visitors); and workshops\u000a      organised in partnership with NML (April 2011): one on popular music\u000a      objects and memory; and one at Merseyside Maritime Museum involving guest\u000a      speakers, theatrical performance and the handling of museum objects. A 72\u000a      year-old woman participating in the latter wrote on a comment card,\u000a      `Liverpool has a great \"track record\" of music which should keep our\u000a      heritage alive. Music enriches our lives'.\u000a    iii. Influenced how museums preserve, conserve and present popular music\u000a      heritage\u000a    Cohen and Leonard influenced NML's decision to depart from initial plans\u000a      for a chronological approach to TBGO and develop an alternative approach\u000a      underpinned by a substantial body of (Phase 1) IPM research, and based\u000a      around various themes, including musicianship, sounds of the city, and\u000a      music sites and scenes. Leonard's research on gender provides just one\u000a      example of how that research informed museum practice, enabling\u000a      NML to exhibit material related to local female performers, and present\u000a      new histories of women's experience in the music industry, histories\u000a      included in the TBGO book produced in association with NML. Meanwhile\u000a      (Phase 2) research undertaken for the exhibition resulted in the accessioning\u000a        of objects and oral histories into NML's permanent collection. It\u000a      also enabled NML to explore and test innovative approaches to display,\u000a      including the museum's first use of digital cultural mapping and an online\u000a      resource as a public interface. Moreover, NML used TBGO as a pilot for\u000a        the new Museum of Liverpool being built on Liverpool's waterfront.\u000a      Most of the TBGO curatorial team were simultaneously developing displays\u000a      for that museum and the content and approaches of TBGO were adapted\u000a        and adopted for one of its central galleries. Since opening in July\u000a      2011 the museum has won numerous awards and attracted over two million\u000a      visits (corroborating source h).\u000a    iv. Expanded knowledge of museum collections and approaches to popular\u000a      music\u000a    Subsequent (Phase 3) research by Leonard and Knifton involved working\u000a      directly with museum- practitioners to expand awareness and influence\u000a        approaches to the collection, care and curation of popular music and\u000a      related materials. They presented and discussed this research with museum\u000a      professionals from Malaga and NML; with UK artists and curators at the\u000a      National Conservation Centre seminar `Music in Action' (13\/8\/10); with\u000a      curators and a museum director at the Museum Association conference\u000a      (6\/10\/10); and through a front-page and feature article in Museums\u000a        Journal (1\/03\/11). They also organised a British Library\u000a      symposium (5\/7\/11) for museum directors, curators, librarians, archivists,\u000a      collectors and scholars, which generated exchange of information about\u000a        current practice, and established a network of professionals\u000a      engaged in collecting and curating popular music materials. Feedback from\u000a      the event was overwhelmingly positive, with practitioners welcoming the\u000a      opportunity to connect with and learn from others (corroborating source\u000a      i). One curator stated that he would work `on incorporating music in\u000a      future book and exhibition projects', while another wrote that the event\u000a      provided an 'invaluable look at issues surrounding music and museums' and\u000a      he intended to apply what he had learned.\u000a    v. Developed the Practice of Museum Professionals\u000a    Research (Phase 2) led by Leonard during her secondment to NML\u000a      (2006-2008) contributed to the personal and professional development\u000a        of museum staff. As head of the TBGO curatorial team she provided\u000a      expert knowledge based on IPM (Phase 1) research which informed the\u000a      exhibition approach, content and interpretation of materials. An Assistant\u000a      Curator who Leonard mentored states that `as a direct result of this\u000a      experience' she secured the role of Curator of Special Exhibitions at\u000a      another museum, and was `provided with the theoretical and practical\u000a      framework essential for delivering quality projects and success in the\u000a      role' (corroborating source j). Leonard and Knifton's subsequent (Phase 3)\u000a      research (2010-11) influenced curatorial practice. Developed in\u000a      partnership with the V&amp;A and NML and with support from the British\u000a      Library and the British Music Experience, it informed the practice of\u000a      V&amp;A curators at a time when they were revising the museum's rock and\u000a      pop collecting policy. Leonard and Knifton also advised on the development\u000a      of popular music exhibitions, including the major Home of Metal\u000a      exhibition at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery (2011) where one of the\u000a      curators commented that their advice had `informed the approach and\u000a        development of the exhibition' (corroborating source k). Leonard and\u000a      Knifton co-organised a study day for gallery and museum studies\u000a      postgraduates from north-west England (Merseyside Maritime Museum, June\u000a      2011), and their research also informed Leonard's teaching of cultural\u000a      management students in Kufstein, Austria (July 2011). Thus our research is\u000a      also now contributing to the professional development of the next\u000a        generation of curators by increasing their knowledge and capacity\u000a      for working with popular culture materials.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study describes how collaboration with museums enabled research\u000a      conducted and directed by Sara Cohen and Marion Leonard of the Institute\u000a      of Popular Music (IPM) to:\u000a    \u000a      Stimulate tourism and the regional economy and enhance the quality of\u000a        the tourist experience\u000a      Enrich public understanding of, and engagement with, popular music\u000a        history and heritage, and the experience of museum visitors\u000a      Influence how popular music is preserved, conserved and presented\u000a        within museums\u000a      Expand knowledge of museum collections and curatorial approaches to\u000a        popular music\u000a      Develop the practice of museum professionals\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    University of Liverpool\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Liverpool (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Liverpool","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"North West","UKPRN":10006842}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2773300","Name":"Kufstein"}],"References":"\u000a    Websites: The\u000a          Beat Goes On and The\u000a          Beat Goes Online\u000a    Publications (*indicates items submitted for REF or RAE2008):\u000a    \u000a&#8226; *Cohen, S. 2012. `Live Music and Urban Landscape: Mapping the Beat in\u000a      Liverpool', Social Semiotics, 22 (5), pp. 587-603.

Research undertaken and led by Cohen (then Research Fellow)\u000a      on popular music in 20th-century Liverpool life (1991-94) produced a\u000a      deeper understanding of the city's popular music past that went beyond the\u000a      conventional and narrow focus on the Beatles, showing how music was\u000a      related to a broad range of music genres and diverse cultures and\u000a      identities, histories and heritages, including ethnic identity and\u000a      histories of immigration. Cohen's subsequent research (as Lecturer) used\u000a      Liverpool as a case study to enhance understanding of how music influences\u000a      and is influenced by urban decline and renewal (2007). It was carried out\u000a      over a ten year period through a series of projects, including those on\u000a      tourism and the music industries. Meanwhile Leonard (then\u000a      Lecturer) undertook research on Irish traditional music in Liverpool and\u000a      Coventry (2005), and research on gender and the music industry (2007) that\u000a      highlighted the under-representation of women within music histories.\u000a    This research provided a basis for three exhibitions developed in\u000a      partnership with National Museums Liverpool (NML), and without such a\u000a      strong research foundation the historical depth and critical insights of\u000a      these exhibitions would have been significantly reduced. The first, Harmonious\u000a        Relations (co-curated by Cohen), explored music and family life on\u000a      Merseyside (Merseyside Museum of Labour History, 1994). The second, Talking\u000a        Traditions (curated by Leonard) explored Irish music and dance in\u000a      Liverpool and Coventry (Herbert Art Gallery and Museum, Coventry, 2000;\u000a      Museum of Liverpool Life, 2002). The third, TBGO, was a major exhibition\u000a      exploring the popular music history of Merseyside. Staged as part of\u000a      Liverpool's 2008 Capital of Culture programme it ran for 15 months at the\u000a      World Museum Liverpool (12\/8\/08-1\/11\/09).\u000a    Phase 2: Involved substantial new research undertaken specifically for\u000a      TBGO. Cohen (then Senior Lecturer and IPM Director) and Leonard played a\u000a      central role in the initial planning stages and joined the NML steering\u000a      committee in 2005. From 2006-2008 Leonard was seconded full-time to NML as\u000a      Lead Curator, directing not only the development of the exhibition and its\u000a      content but also new, impact-driven research conducted with the NML\u000a      curatorial team. This research involved establishing the key exhibition\u000a      `messages'; undertaking oral histories; identifying materials within\u000a      museum, record company and library collections; shaping how the materials\u000a      were presented to the public; and sourcing, selecting, and interpreting\u000a      over 900 loaned objects and a further 400 objects from NML collections.\u000a      The research provided new perspectives on creative practice and\u000a      production, identified hidden music histories, critiqued dominant\u000a      historical narratives and deepened understanding of the relationship\u000a      between music and place. Cohen directed research informing two specific\u000a      exhibition outputs that took 12 months to complete. One was The Beat\u000a        Goes Online, a 250-page online resource designed to accompany the\u000a      exhibition and produced by a team of IPM staff, students and fellows.\u000a      Edited by Cohen and Leonard, the resource is permanently hosted on the NML\u000a      website. The other was Mapping the Beat, an interactive\u000a      touch-screen installation enabling users to access six digital maps\u000a      featuring contemporary and historical sites of music- making in Liverpool\u000a      and Merseyside. The maps were created by Cohen and Lashua\u000a      (Research Assistant) as part of a project on music and urban landscape\u000a      funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC, 2007-9), and\u000a      based on research that revealed music's contribution to the character of\u000a      place within a context of urban change. Research undertaken for the\u000a      exhibition by Cohen, Lashua, Leonard and Strachan (Lecturer)\u000a      provided a basis for six chapters of an edited book produced in\u000a      association with NML (Leonard and Strachan, 2010) and additional\u000a      publications (e.g. Cohen, 2012; Leonard, 2007, 2010).\u000a    Phase 3: Involved subsequent research on museum practice that TBGO\u000a      inspired. The exhibition provided a platform for further regional and\u000a      international projects on popular music heritage, place and identity\u000a      directed by Cohen and referred to in REF5, but it was Leonard's\u000a      AHRC-funded project Collecting and Curating Popular Music Histories\u000a      (CCPMH, 2010-11) that continued the museums collaboration. Assisted by Knifton,\u000a      Leonard produced the first detailed research on popular music collections\u000a      and exhibitions within UK museums, exploring collecting practices and\u000a      policies, museum interpretation and curatorship, and the communication of\u000a      music histories. Outputs included articles on music, museums and material\u000a      culture (e.g. Leonard, 2013), and an exhibition, Mixcase: Music Memory\u000a        Traces, focusing on the value of material popular music culture and\u000a      staged at Liverpool's Victoria Gallery and Museum (VG&amp;M,\u000a      22\/8\/11-15\/2\/12).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"8072","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"1835841","Name":"South Korea"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3077311","Name":"Czech Republic"},{"GeoNamesId":"2562770","Name":"Malta"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Prior to the paradigm-shifting publications that were the result of\u000a      Benedetti's scholarship, readers\u000a      and students had to contend with inaccurate, misleading and\u000a      difficult-to-read English-language\u000a      versions based on early drafts of Stanislavski's writings, first published\u000a      in 1938. Some of the\u000a      mistranslations had resulted in profound distortions in the way his system\u000a      has been interpreted and\u000a      taught. Benedetti succeeded in translating Stanislavski's huge manual into\u000a      a lively, fascinating and\u000a      accurate text in English. For the first time, the two books previously\u000a      known as An Actor\u000a        Prepares and Building A Character were restored to a single\u000a      volume, as had been Stanislavki's\u000a      original intentions. This work has precipitated a major reconsideration of\u000a      the Stanislavski's theories\u000a      and `system'. Professor Merlin's work has built on Benedetti's, creating\u000a      two manuals for actors that\u000a      distil Stanislavskian precepts into easily accessible instructions and\u000a      exercises: The Complete\u000a        Stanislavski Toolkit (Nick Hern Books 2007 amzn.to\/1fNkohv) and Acting:\u000a        The Basics (Routledge\u000a      2010 amzn.to\/1gn6LDa).\u000a    From its inception in 2007, the Centre has worked in the UK and abroad\u000a      with a range of\u000a      professional partners, in the performance industries and in Higher\u000a      Education to develop a portfolio\u000a      of outreach activities that cater for the needs of a wide international\u000a      public audience, from school-age\u000a      students to experienced professional practitioners. It has been the\u000a      Centre's intention to ensure\u000a      that access to and knowledge of Stanislavski's work and legacy is as\u000a      widely disseminated as\u000a      possible. Every event that the Centre produces or supports is open to a\u000a      public audience.\u000a    Whenever possible the events are offered either free of charge or at a\u000a      significantly reduced cost,\u000a      subsidised by the Centre.

In 2008,\u000a      the exhibition was\u000a      funded by a personal donation from Yevgeny Lebedev (publisher of the\u000a      Evening Standard and the\u000a      Independent) and was located in the foyer to the Olivier Theatre, exposing\u000a      it to some 15,000\u000a      general public audience members. In 2013, the exhibition expanded its\u000a      reach to a Russian-speaking\u000a      audience, through its presence at Pushkin House, which provided access to\u000a      approximately 1440 day-time visitors and 200 evening guests across the\u000a      four lecture\u000a      presentations.

Delivering understanding and best practice in public bodies\u000a    GI offers both community resources and training sessions and workshops,\u000a      based on the research, for institutions seeking to develop more inclusive\u000a      policies and practices. More than 69 organizations have commissioned\u000a      sessions. GI also works with influential forums including The Gender\u000a      Recognition Panel User Group, Stonewall Education Coalition, the\u000a      Anti-Bullying Alliance, the Parliamentary Forum (source D).\u000a    In Bristol the NHS, City Council, LGB Forum and Bristol Primary Care\u000a      Trust have used GI's specialist knowledge. Other clients include\u000a      universities (UC Falmouth, East Anglia, Anglia Ruskin) and charities\u000a      (Action for Children, Brook London, Antidote, Camden Sexual Health and\u000a      Education Team) alongside Southwark Council, Lambeth Council, Metropolitan\u000a      Police, City YMCA (London) and Equal Opportunities Flanders (source B).\u000a      Positive evaluations throughout indicate that the training changes\u000a        what people actually do (source B).\u000a    Graham Reed, of Brook London:\u000a    As a result of the training that GI delivered, Brook staff\u000a          feel more confident in delivering services to young Trans\u000a        people. (source A2)\u000a    Ali Godfrey, of Generation Arts:\u000a    When setting up my own new organisation, I have been mindful of what I\u000a        have learnt from GI.

Their work helped to inform and shape the\u000a        trans action plan; and reinforced our commitment to ensure that the\u000a        needs of trans youth [were] reflected in the plan. (source A5)\u000a    C. Training teachers and changing attitudes\u000a    Since 2009, GI has worked with 2090 students in 32 schools, colleges and\u000a      youth groups, challenging ideas that produce discrimination. Over 70%\u000a      found these workshops useful.\u000a    Kirsty Yeoman, director of studies, Hereford Sixth Form College:\u000a    GI is different from other organisations as it provided detailed\u000a        insights into the experiences of the needs of young transgendered people.\u000a      (source A7)\u000a    GI has developed training for new teachers to equip them to discourage\u000a      bullying of queer and trans students. Katherine Nissen, of the University\u000a      of St Mark &amp; St John, Plymouth, has taken over 400 trainee teachers to\u000a      GI's training conferences:\u000a    The conference day is the most rewarding day of my working life each\u000a        year... I know how much of an impact the GI sessions will have on these\u000a        students and the hundreds of children they will teach during their\u000a        careers. (source A8)\u000a    These workshops were observed by the Department for Education's\u000a      Anti-Bullying Team. While policy prohibits civil servants from endorsing\u000a      the work of companies such as GI, the value that the Team put on GI's work\u000a      led to its being praised in July 2011 in a speech by Nick Gibb MP, the\u000a      Minister of State for Schools (source C).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The impacts of the research include: a) promotion of self-esteem in\u000a        transgendered youth; b) changing attitudes among school and\u000a        college students and training teachers; c) modelling best\u000a      practice in support organisations; d) shaping opinion in influential\u000a        forums up to Parliamentary level.

Triangulating between medical discourses, arts practices and\u000a      daily lived experience, her research has formulated ways of\u000a        articulating a trans identity that feel appropriate to the subjects\u000a      and comprehensible by others. It was highly innovative in proposing that\u000a      specific focus on transgendered youth and their modes of community\u000a      interaction can produce new understanding of how transgenderism `performs'\u000a      its social place and gender identity. In doing this the research has\u000a      questioned previous notions, from medical science or post-structuralist\u000a      theory, of transgenderism's `disorderly' identity.\u000a    The first phase of the research (2004-6) enquired into how\u000a      transgender masculinities were constituted in the specific context\u000a      of performance. This ranged across settings with different sorts of\u000a      performance protocols and contracts, from theatres, clubs and bars,\u000a      through applied theatre projects to performance in everyday life. While\u000a      one aspect of the research analysed already existing performances (outputs\u000a      1 and 2), a parallel strand used methods of applied theatre to facilitate\u000a      creative activity within frameworks that could reflect on it critically.\u000a      The emphasis was on participatory process and shared enlightenment, seen\u000a      in the project on the function of voice and vocal performance in\u000a      transgendered men (output 3).\u000a    While the work on performance continued, a new phase (2006-10)\u000a      focussed on the issues of trans youth identity in everyday life. This was\u000a      taken forward as the Sci:dentity project, funded by\u000a      a Wellcome Trust Pulse Award (&#163;50k), with McNamara as Principal\u000a      Investigator. The project's interdisciplinary remit was unusual in the\u000a      applied theatre field and formally innovative, placing endocrinology (Prof\u000a      Andrew Levy, Bristol) and sociology (Dr Allison Rooke, Goldsmiths)\u000a      alongside performance. It worked with a group of trans youth to\u000a      investigate the role of scientific discourse in constructing their\u000a      self-image and their modes of self-presentation in society. A Wellcome\u000a      Trust Small Arts Award (&#163;12.2k) in 2010 funded consolidation of the\u000a      findings (outputs 4 and 5). These led to modellings of best practice and\u000a      case studies of their efficacy, with funding from such bodies as the\u000a      Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) and the Equality and Human\u000a      Rights Commission (output 6). They have directly informed the training of\u000a      new and experienced teachers, senior management teams in schools and care\u000a      professionals.\u000a    The research has been recognized in and beyond the theatre\u000a      discipline for its scholarly significance. In 2012 the Applied and Social\u000a      Theatre Working Group of the Theatre and Performance Research Association\u000a      nominated McNamara's work for the New Career Research in\u000a      Theatre\/Performance Prize, as `an important new area of discourse in\u000a      applied and social theatre, adding considerably to our understanding of\u000a      the complexity of youth identities, and, methodologically, providing an\u000a      excellent model of research impacting in both academic areas and public\u000a      life.' RiDE: The Journal of Applied Theatre and Performance\u000a      invited McNamara to co-edit a special themed issue of the journal in 2013.\u000a      Most recently McNamara has been invited to address an ESRC-funded seminar\u000a      series entitled 'Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Trans Ageing &#8212; Minding the\u000a      Knowledge Gap' at Oxford University.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"8327","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Brown's research has generated new ways of thinking and speaking about\u000a      theatre sound and changed its status as a professional creative practice.\u000a      Its impact may be seen in the practices of sound designers, their\u000a      professional organisation, the approaches of directors and\u000a      equipment manufacturers, training within industry and the\u000a      emergence of a specialist academic discipline. Evidence comes from\u000a      institutions across the world.\u000a    The steps towards these impacts began with creating formal opportunities\u000a      for industry discourse. These laid the foundation for establishing the\u000a      professional status of theatre sound. Crucially, Brown's early research\u000a      was embedded in creative practice in professional settings. This gave him\u000a      authority within the profession (a review of one show pinned over the\u000a      sound desk at the National Theatre studio). Building on his standing as\u000a      practitioner Brown convened a sound design colloquium in 2002 (sponsored\u000a      by Central, the National Theatre and the International Organization of\u000a      Scenographers, Theatre Architects and Technicians (OISTAT)), at which sound\u000a        designers and academics from 13 countries heard Brown\u000a      present his idea of `dramaturgy of sound' (source A). Inspired by the\u000a      implications of the research two designers, Steve Brown and Rick Thomas,\u000a      invited Brown to help set up a Sound Working Group (SWG) of OISTAT, as a\u000a      vehicle for promoting the new thinking about sound. They strategically\u000a      located SWG within OISTAT's Scenography Commission as `artistic' rather\u000a      than `technical' practice, achieving the first inclusion of sound design\u000a      in a scenography exhibition (Prague Quadrennial 2003), leading to\u000a      significantly increased profile at Prague 2007. The 2002 colloquium also\u000a      drew equipment manufacturers into the project of elevating sound:\u000a      d&amp;b audiotechnik describe how they became involved in the planning of\u000a      sound design exhibits (source C1). In 2013 a second colloquium, at the\u000a      Lyttleton Theatre, was curated by emerging designer Donato Wharton, who\u000a      learnt his trade within Brown's conceptual framework.\u000a    This research has helped change the ideas and practice of five\u000a      groups of people. Among professional sound designers leading\u000a      designer Paul Arditti notes that `Ross's academic research can be\u000a      provocative' (source C2), which Finnish designer Kristian Ekholm expands\u000a      on: `The contexts in which sound designers have to work [are] rapidly\u000a        changing... This means sound designers have to ... be able to think\u000a        laterally and in an innovative way, and not be constrained by orthodox\u000a        approaches. Brown's book provides ... strategies for thinking outside\u000a        the box. There is very little other published theory ... on the\u000a        aesthetics and the ways in which sound works in relation to dramaturgy\u000a        and the specific live contexts of conceptual theatre sound design, and\u000a        his holistic view of theatre sound has made a huge impact on me'\u000a      (source C3).\u000a    Among directors Nancy Meckler and Jonathan Holloway both learnt\u000a      new approaches to sound. Holloway says: `This research undoubtedly\u000a        changed the ways in which I worked with sound and music, and was of\u000a        influence to sound designers and composers with whom I have subsequently\u000a        worked' (source C4). Most recently the artists' group Platform-7\u000a      took inspiration from Brown's work in staging their remembrance event, Silent\u000a        Cacophony, on London's Underground network (source B).\u000a    Equipment manufacturers d&amp;b audiotechnik state that their own\u000a      practice was taken forward by Brown's research: `dialogue with ... Brown,\u000a      as a researcher in the field, in relation to our research and development\u000a      agenda ... provides us with useful stimulus.' This then had impact on\u000a      relations of industry and HE: `Our subsequent involvement on many industry\u000a      projects together bears testament to the advantage of academic and\u000a      industry co-operation' (source C1).\u000a    Among industry trainers the Royal Court's Head of Sound, David\u000a      McSeveney, uses Brown's book in training all his new staff. One such is\u000a      Helen Skiera: `chapters and subjects were revealed that began informing\u000a        my practice. [I]n reading the work, I became aware of other sound\u000a        designers and theatre practitioners describing their own work in\u000a        conceptual terms, rather than purely practical; and really for me, this\u000a        is the first time that I was aware that this really existed' (source\u000a      C5).\u000a    Finally, sound design teachers and students across the world are\u000a      being influenced by Brown. Sound is a standard text on dramaturgy\u000a      of sound in UK universities and used heavily outside the UK: `almost every\u000a      MA-thesis in our department contains at least one citation from your book'\u000a      (Jari Kauppinen, Theatre Academy of Finland, source C6). Professor Rick\u000a      Thomas, Purdue University, says: `I consider ... Sound to be one\u000a        of the most significant contributions to the field of theatre sound\u000a        design and composition.... It is required reading in the Graduate MFA\u000a        program in theatre sound at Purdue University, as it is at several other\u000a        prominent theatre sound programs in the United States' (source C7).\u000a      At Carnegie Mellon academic and professional designer Joe Pino says Sound's\u000a      impact on him was equal to that of Cage's Silence: it `has been\u000a        pivotal in providing a much needed matrix with which to analyze,\u000a        evaluate and understand the Art of sound design' (source C8).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Ross Brown's research has been instrumental in shaping theatre sound into\u000a      a specialist discipline in its own right.

Constructing\u000a      a dialogue with a potentially hostile theatre industry over two decades,\u000a      Brown's central formulation of a `dramaturgy of sound' has changed\u000a      the ways in which theatre professionals, independent artists, academics\u000a      and specialist students think about and work with sound.

Phase 1, 1998-2001, saw research\u000a      done as creative practice in professional settings. Noting the impact of\u000a      emerging technologies in the early 90s it explored the potential erasure\u000a      of category distinctions between music and sound effect. Conceiving of\u000a      theatre sound as composition, Brown sought to establish the terms on which\u000a      the auditory experience of theatre may be modelled as a coherent designed\u000a      whole, as in scenography. This was noted in Susannah Clapp's Observer\u000a      review of an early piece of his creative practice as research: `One of the\u000a      distinctive features of I Am Yours [at the Royal Court Upstairs]\u000a      ... is the creation of a scenery of noise' (output 1). This led to\u000a      the formulation of the concept of a `dramaturgy of sound'. In order for\u000a      this to make a difference to industry practice it had to be comprehensible\u000a      by that industry, so it was initially tested in specifically\u000a      industry-based contexts and publications: presentations for\u000a      Tonmeister Association conference (Germany 1998), professional sound\u000a      seminar at the Theatre Academy of Finland (Helsinki and Stockholm 1998)\u000a      and publications in trade journals. This testing in industry settings was\u000a      to continue.\u000a    Phase 2, 2001-2006, began with a colloquium which drew industry\u000a      professionals together with academics. It saw a concentration on the\u000a      research's theoretical implications, with more dissemination in\u000a      specifically academic contexts. Drawing on discourses from dramaturgy,\u000a      musicology and aural phenomenology (outputs 1 and 2), the concept of\u000a      `dramaturgy of sound' questioned both the dominance of visuality in design\u000a      and the compartmentalising of sound as purely `technical' practice. At the\u000a      same time there was focus on shaping the appropriate mode of articulating\u000a      and documenting the concept. Brown was one of the earliest academics to\u000a      develop new forms of artefact-based reflective documentation. These were\u000a      described by the RAE 2001 report as `a model for practice for the unit of\u000a      assessment'. From here research experiments in documentation of\u000a        process were aligned with the industry's interest in presenting\u000a      artefacts of sound design within the format of the design exhibition. The\u000a      results were offered for commentary in 2005 at the academic PARIP\u000a      conference (Leeds) (output 3) and the industry-run World Stage Design\u000a      Exhibition (Toronto), where Brown's documentary artefact won a bronze\u000a      medal. This work of documentation was collected by the British Library's\u000a      Sheffield Theatre Archive project and paved the way for sound's arrival as\u000a      a scenographic element on equal terms with the visual, a moment formally\u000a      marked when Brown was invited to contribute to the Reader in\u000a        Scenography (2010) (output 4).\u000a    In Phase 3, 2006-2013, Brown applied his insights to wider areas\u000a      of social practice, offering sonic operations of theatre as models for\u000a        analysis, with an AHRC-funded research project on silence and\u000a      aurality in public life (output 5). From this widening of focus\u000a      emerged his historically-grounded large-scale modelling of theatrical\u000a      sound in the 2009 monograph Sound (output 6). The book is the\u000a      first and, to date, only work to attempt this. In doing so it has enhanced\u000a      understandings in theatre studies while also establishing links to study\u000a      of sensory culture and social science-based sound studies. And it has\u000a      changed industry practice.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"8328","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Mothers offered an exemplary model for focusing on the family and\u000d\u000a      thereby enabling both families and carers to gain greater\u000a        understanding of sexual abuse trauma. This then produced new\u000d\u000a        ways of training carers.\u000d\u000a    A. New understanding\u000d\u000a    The problem faced by Mosac was that the silence and taboo around familial\u000d\u000a      child sexual abuse hinder therapeutic support of families,\u000d\u000a      delaying appropriate social, health and legal interventions. Mothers\u000d\u000a      established the first step towards impact by enabling the voice of the\u000d\u000a      families to be heard by social and health workers, teachers and policy\u000d\u000a      makers. Victims and carers learnt how to break the silence. As one\u000d\u000a      of the participating mothers said:\u000d\u000a    Doing the play, seeing it, it was like a funny way of counseling to\u000d\u000a        me.... It's made me look at things in a different way. Whereas before\u000d\u000a        I'd have avoided looking at these issues, now I'd find a way of\u000d\u000a        addressing them. It was a good way of dealing with it. Seeing it acted\u000d\u000a        out like that. (source B1)\u000d\u000a    Breaking the silence was a definable impact of Mothers, as Denise\u000d\u000a      Hubble, Mosac's Clinical Services Manager, explains:\u000d\u000a    The idea of addressing that which seems to `lie beyond words' is\u000d\u000a        something that is often discussed by my clients, and Mothers is\u000d\u000a        a direct aid in doing that. We do not have another means of addressing\u000d\u000a        the `lies beyond words' as effective and sensitive as the play. In that,\u000d\u000a        it is the most useful tool for communication we have .... This play has\u000d\u000a      helped professionals and facilities gain a deeper insight into\u000a        how sexual abusers operate in our society .... Most children do not\u000d\u000a        disclose ... that makes the need of finding a way to narrate the\u000d\u000a        experience all the more acute for social workers, caring professionals,\u000d\u000a        and policymakers as well. We have found Mothers to be a helpful\u000d\u000a        tool with all these groups. (source A1)\u000d\u000a    Piloted at Central with a Mosac audience (July 2007), Mothers was\u000d\u000a      performed in September 2007 at the Mosac AGM, a training forum for social\u000d\u000a      workers:\u000d\u000a    It gave me good insight into the experiences of these women, and other\u000d\u000a        women and children who are in similar circumstances....I think this play\u000d\u000a        would benefit anyone working with non abusing parents of sexually abused\u000d\u000a        children. (source B2)\u000d\u000a    In May 2013 Mothers was the centrepiece (at the Pleasance,\u000d\u000a      Islington) of Mosac's awareness-raising week. 79% of the 491 who saw it\u000d\u000a      said it altered their thinking about the families affected\u000d\u000a      (sources B3 and B4). A health care worker said:\u000d\u000a    It informed [her] further in [her] understanding of the mother's point\u000d\u000a        of view'. Another said: `A valuable.... play\/life story &#8212; I\u000d\u000a        believe that this is essential in being able to increase belief and\u000d\u000a        awareness of abuse'. A teacher said `[It] makes you more aware\u000d\u000a        of a child's needs and signs. It will make me work with caution and\u000d\u000a        compassion if I come across a family\/child who has been affected by\u000d\u000a        sexual abuse (source B4).\u000d\u000a    Published for this event, the script remains in use by Mosac (source B5).\u000d\u000a    B. New training\u000d\u000a    Following specialist recognition of the efficacy of witnessbased drama,\u000d\u000a      the research insights were next used to develop training regimes for\u000d\u000a        nurses and social workers. When Stuart Fisher discovered\u000d\u000a      that carers neglected their own experience she initiated\u000d\u000a      collaboration with the Florence Nightingale School of Nursing (KCL) to\u000d\u000a      develop and test (May 2011) a new form of nurse training, involving both\u000d\u000a      trainees and their tutors. A subsequent workshop (January 2012) assembled\u000d\u000a      specialists from Barnardos, Camden Carers, Mosac, RHUL, UEL, Queen Mary,\u000d\u000a      and the Nightingale School. For over 60% this training changed their\u000d\u000a        thinking about and approach to the practice of care (source B6). Ian\u000d\u000a      Noonan, Programme Leader in Mental Health Nursing, said:\u000d\u000a    [the KCL workshop] gave the students the opportunity to see their\u000d\u000a        practice ... in a new way. They were quite simply bowled over by the\u000d\u000a        process. One student wrote ... \"I realised for the first time\u000d\u000a        that I was struggling with competing feelings of compassion and\u000d\u000a        apprehension\". (source A2)\u000d\u000a    Building on the work with nurses, Stuart Fisher collaborated with the\u000d\u000a      Department of Social Work, RHUL, to create a new training programme\u000d\u000a      (delivered May 2012 and 2013). Social workers who participated said it changed\u000a        their approach to child sexual abuse issues, with the effect that\u000d\u000a      they `think more about the persecutory nature in which we question or work\u000d\u000a      with non-abusing parents', `try to do more of what I know is important &#8212;\u000d\u000a      open mind &#8212; empathy' (source B7). Anna Gupta, Head of Social Work, RHUL,\u000d\u000a      said:\u000d\u000a    The workshop has encouraged us to think differently about the way we\u000d\u000a        train social workers to support families affected by child sexual abuse\u000d\u000a        and the evaluations from students ... [suggest] that they too have\u000d\u000a        changed their perception towards support in child sexual abuse\u000d\u000a        situations.....a highly useful learning tool ... and one we could not\u000d\u000a        get from any other source (source A3).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    New techniques developed from research into verbatim theatre have (1)\u000d\u000a      helped families affected by child sexual abuse by a) giving them\u000d\u000a      new ways of `working through' the trauma of their experiences and b)\u000d\u000a      improving communication and dialogue with the relevant agencies of care;\u000d\u000a      (2) developed in social work professionals, through new training\u000d\u000a      methods, a greater understanding of a) sexual abuse and its impact on\u000d\u000a      families and b) how to train social workers in this field; (3) been\u000d\u000a      extended and adapted for student nurses, to facilitate new\u000d\u000a      approaches to training, empathic engagement and reflective approaches to\u000d\u000a      practice.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    The Royal Central School of Speech and Drama, University of London\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Royal Central School of Speech and Drama","InstitutionName":"Royal Central School of Speech & Drama","PeerGroup":"G","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007816}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    Unless otherwise specified, materials are available either electronically\u000d\u000a      or on paper on request.\u000d\u000a    \u000a[1] Stuart Fisher, A. 2004 `The Playwright in Residence: A community's\u000d\u000a      storyteller', The Drama Review 48(3): 135-149.

From this emerged the challenge of dealing\u000d\u000a      theatrically with trauma, a condition which is seemingly `unspeakable':\u000d\u000a      resisting articulation, unable to be assimilated to cognition and\u000d\u000a      functioning as a postponed or `belated experience' (Lacan 1994, Caruth\u000d\u000a      1996). A series of ensuing research inquiries explored whether theatre can\u000d\u000a      enable individuals to `work through' traumatic events of the past. These\u000d\u000a      insights were tested in the production of a verbatim theatre play about\u000d\u000a      child sexual abuse, which in turn became a vehicle for impact.\u000d\u000a    The first phase of the research (2004-2010) explored the\u000d\u000a      methodological problems inherent in theatrical attempts to bear witness to\u000d\u000a      lived experience and trauma. Stuart Fisher's applied-theatre work with\u000d\u000a      Camden Young People's and Clean Break Theatres proposed a modelling of the\u000d\u000a      playwright as `community storyteller' (output 1). An analysis of Yael\u000d\u000a      Farber's South African testimonial theatre methodology confirmed that\u000d\u000a      while story-telling might facilitate social cohesion, some events of\u000d\u000a      historico-political trauma resist direct narration (output 2). The role of\u000d\u000a      empathy and the relationship between testifier and listener\/playwright led\u000d\u000a      to an exploration of the dangers of identification and possible\u000d\u000a      appropriation. Practically, the research sought to shape a theatrical mode\u000d\u000a      of `empathic unsettlement' (LaCapra 2001). This research was argued both\u000d\u000a      philosophically and aesthetically, as seen in outputs from this phase\u000d\u000a      that engage with Badiou's ethics of the event (output 3), the theatremaker\u000d\u000a      as a form of community witness (output 4), and the limits of verbatim\u000d\u000a      theatre (output 5). These publications have been cited widely (Kuppers, P.\u000d\u000a      (2007) Community Performance; Neelands, J. (2007) `Taming the\u000d\u000a      Political' RiDE 12(3); Bharucha, R. (2011) `Problematising Applied\u000d\u000a      Theatre' RiDE 16(3); and Prendergast, M. &amp; Saxton, J. (2013) Applied\u000a        Drama: A facilitator's handbook for working in a community).\u000d\u000a    Building on these insights, the second phase (2010-2013) modelled\u000d\u000a      a practice to remedy the problems Stuart Fisher had explored. Her method\u000d\u000a      was to write a verbatim play challenging the taboos around the issue of\u000d\u000a      familial child sexual abuse. To test her process and its viability she\u000d\u000a      worked with a partner closely engaged with trauma management in families:\u000d\u000a      Mosac, the leading support organisation for non-abusing parents and carers\u000d\u000a      of sexually abused children. Mosac's particular problem related closely to\u000d\u000a      Stuart Fisher's research inquiry, in that it needed to resolve the\u000d\u000a      difficulty of discussing sexual abuse of one's own children and\/or where\u000d\u000a      the perpetrator is known to the victim and\/or is a family member. As a\u000d\u000a      model of potential practice, the play, From the Mouths of Mothers,\u000d\u000a      used witnessing techniques to negotiate the relationship between taboo and\u000d\u000a      ownership in encountering childhood sexual abuse. Performed initially for\u000d\u000a      Mosac's clientele and stakeholders, the project's challenges, its\u000d\u000a      therapeutic value and the questions it poses to dominant understandings of\u000d\u000a      verbatim theatre are analysed in Stuart Fisher's 2011 article in Studies\u000a        in Theatre and Performance (output 6).\u000d\u000a    The quality and significance of this research have been recognised in the\u000d\u000a      invitation to Stuart Fisher to co-edit (with Alison Forsyth, Aberystwyth)\u000d\u000a      a special issue of the journal Performing Ethos: `Acting Out\u000d\u000a      Trauma' (2013).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"8332","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"146669","Name":"Cyprus"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Although an academic text, Wilson's monograph has reached a non-academic\u000a      readership. It has been reviewed in publications for general readers,\u000a      including Opera and The Musical Times, whose critic called\u000a      it `As accessible as Puccini's music itself...a book that can engage both\u000a      scholars and the opera-going public' (Source 2). The COJ review\u000a      also indicated its wide appeal: `it is a compelling book not only for\u000a      musicologists and music critics, but for anyone interested in the history\u000a      and culture of modern Italy in its European context' (Source 3).\u000a    Wilson subsequently reworked research from the monograph in many\u000a      high-profile non-academic contexts. In particular, Wilson has developed a\u000a      sustained engagement with the audience of the Royal Opera House. The\u000a      Commissioning Editor (ROH), has commissioned from Wilson a contextual\u000a      essay drawing upon her research for the programme of each of the Puccini\u000a      operas currently in the ROH's repertoire. Eight different Puccini operas\u000a      have been performed during the census period, some with multiple revivals.\u000a      Wilson's essays have appeared in all programmes for all Puccini\u000a      productions during this period: no other contributor has written as\u000a      regularly for the Puccini programmes.\u000a    The Commissioning Editor, Royal Opera House, (Source 4) writes that\u000a      Wilson's essays are more authoritative than previous programme essays for\u000a      this repertory and confront stereotypes about Puccini. He argues that her\u000a      essays on the historical contexts for the operas help audiences to\u000a      understand them and their production styles better, noting that Wilson's\u000a      research makes her uniquely placed to provide such context. In particular,\u000a      the Commissioning Editor notes the role Wilson has played in introducing\u000a      audiences to less familiar Puccini operas. This in turn, he argues, has a\u000a      knock-on effect, encouraging the public to explore other unfamiliar works.\u000a      The Commissioning Editor argues that Wilson's essays both deepen\u000a      audiences' engagement with the opera in question and encourage a\u000a      heightened sense of participation in operatic culture more broadly. He\u000a      writes: `All this makes for a more involved audience who are able to get\u000a      greater benefit from opera in performance: when they learn more, they\u000a      enjoy and value the experience and the culture more'. The essays reach an\u000a      audience of mixed age, income bracket and nationality and the\u000a      Commissioning Editor explains that Wilson's essays speak equally\u000a      effectively to new and long- standing opera-goers. He emphasises the\u000a      engaging nature of Wilson's writing, explaining that readers value its\u000a      clarity and the way it communicates in a `direct and non-technical way',\u000a      while stressing that the essays also appeal to experienced opera-goers who\u000a      value its `informed and thorough approach'. Finally, the Commissioning\u000a      Editor observes that the essays influence the way in which journalists\u000a      write in the mainstream press, thus disseminating Wilson's research to an\u000a      even larger audience.\u000a    Wilson's work has reached a very large number of readers. 71,674\u000a      programmes featuring her work were sold during the period 01\/01\/08 to\u000a      31\/07\/13 (many will have been read by multiple readers). The figures break\u000a      down as follows (Source 5):\u000a    \u000a      \u000aLa boh&#232;me programme (featuring Wilson's essay `Making the\u000a        Rounds'): 25,342 sold.\u000a      \u000aTosca (featuring Wilson's `Praise and Hostility'): 20,620.\u000a      \u000aMadama Butterfly (featuring Wilson's `Heartfelt and Sincere'):\u000a        3,860.\u000a      \u000aLa Fanciulla del West (featuring Wilson's `Fanciulla's\u000a        Transatlantic Trials'): 3,599.\u000a      \u000aLa rondine (featuring Wilson's `Puccini the Internationalist'):\u000a        4,219.\u000a      \u000aGianni Schicchi (featuring Wilson's `Gianni Schicchi in\u000a        Context'): approx. 2,600.\u000a      \u000aIl trittico (featuring Wilson's `Il trittico in\u000a        Performance'): 4,315.\u000a      \u000aTurandot (featuring Wilson's `An Appropriate Ending?'): 7,119.\u000a    \u000a    Wilson's research has had an international reach. One of the ROH essays\u000a      was reprinted in the programme for the Pafos Aphrodite Festival, Cyprus\u000a      (1,700 sold: Source 6). Wilson was also commissioned directly to write\u000a      essays for other European opera houses. Greek National Opera (Source 1)\u000a      specified precise sections of Wilson's monograph to be adapted for a\u000a      general audience in an essay on Turandot. A commission on La\u000a        boh&#232;me by the Gran Teatre del Liceu, Barcelona (Source 7)\u000a      demonstrates that Wilson had been selected for her ability to engage\u000a      non-specialist readers.\u000a    In 2008 Wilson's work featured prominently in BBC celebrations to mark\u000a      Puccini's 150th anniversary (see Source 8). Wilson drew upon\u000a      her research in order to confront widespread misconceptions about Puccini\u000a      on `Music Matters' and Radio 4's `Puccini: Touched by the Little Finger of\u000a      the Almighty', providing audiences with a nuanced understanding of the\u000a      composer's cultural significance during his lifetime. She introduced\u000a      audiences to unfamiliar Puccini operas and their staging in a Radio 3\u000a      interview about the ROH production of La fanciulla del West and a\u000a      Proms pre-performance talk about Il tabarro at the RCM,\u000a      subsequently broadcast on Radio 3.\u000a    Further activities included a contribution to a Glyndebourne La\u000a        boh&#232;me podcast (2012), downloaded by 1,300+ listeners (Source 9) and\u000a      a pre-performance talk at ENO on Turandot (2009), attended by 45\u000a      people (Source 10). Wilson reworked material from her monograph in a book\u000a      aimed at students and a general audience, Opera: A Beginner's Guide\u000a      (Oneworld, 2010), which is held in over 115 non-academic libraries\u000a      worldwide (Source 11) and has been recorded as an audiobook.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Dr Alexandra Wilson's research on the reception of Puccini's operas was\u000a      disseminated to a large non-specialist, international audience,\u000a      principally via numerous opera house programme essays, but also via radio\u000a      broadcasts, pre-performance talks, a podcast and a book for general\u000a      readers.

Through her detailed\u000a      analysis of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century historical\u000a      documents, Dr Alexandra Wilson has overturned the view of Puccini as an\u000a      apolitical composer of limited historical significance, demonstrating that\u000a      the Puccini reception offers a vital key to understanding a crisis of\u000a      national identity that gripped Italy between the 1880s and the 1920s.\u000a      Penetrating the conflicts that surrounded Puccini's works not only informs\u000a      us about how public reputations were constructed, sustained and\u000a      challenged, but reveals much about the aspirations of a nation. Debates\u000a      about music became closely bound up with discussions about the state and\u000a      future of the Italian nation and Puccini &#8212; as the leading exponent of the\u000a      Italian art form most closely linked with the national image &#8212; inevitably\u000a      became embroiled in political, social and aesthetic controversy. Critics\u000a      of all political persuasions shared similar anxieties that Italy was\u000a      entering a period of political and musical decadence. Where they diverged\u000a      was in their response to such problems and in the contradictory solutions\u000a      that they proposed. Puccini's music was simultaneously held up as a symbol\u000a      of cultural strength and derided as a manifestation of artistic and\u000a      societal decline. Cultural historians have recently demonstrated that the\u000a      arts are central to nation-building processes, and that artists have a key\u000a      role to play in the creation of myths of kinship. Wilson has demonstrated\u000a      Puccini to be a profoundly important political figure, through his\u000a      politicisation at the hands of supporters and detractors alike, an area\u000a      which has to date been neglected by scholarship. Furthermore, by revealing\u000a      Puccini's prominent place in pan-European aesthetic debates of his day,\u000a      Wilson makes a nuanced case for a reconsideration of Puccini's cultural\u000a      significance, challenging modernist-inspired academic disdain for the\u000a      composer on the one hand and popular hagiography on the other.\u000a    The Puccini reception documents include newspaper, magazine and journal\u000a      reviews, books, correspondence and iconographical sources. Much of the\u000a      research was based on Italian-language primary sources, which are\u000a      available only in Italian research libraries and inaccessible to the\u000a      general public or to an Anglophone readership.\u000a    The research, all single-authored, was carried out by Wilson between the\u000a      commencement of her doctoral studies in February 1998 and the publication\u000a      of the article `Defining Italianness' in 2008. She began work on this\u000a      project as a PhD student at Royal Holloway, University of London (1998-\u000a      2002), developed it as a Junior Research Fellow (Worcester College,\u000a      Oxford, 2001-04; St Hilda's College, Oxford, 2004-05) and completed it as\u000a      a Lecturer (2005-07) and Senior Lecturer (2007-11) at Oxford Brookes\u000a      University, where she is now a Reader. The outputs from this project\u000a      written and published during Wilson's time at Brookes were a monograph, The\u000a        Puccini Problem: Opera, Nationalism, and Modernity (Item 1 below),\u000a      which concentrated upon the operas from La boh&#232;me to Turandot,\u000a      and an article on the reception of the earlier Manon Lescaut\u000a      published in The Opera Quarterly (Item 2). The monograph appeared\u000a      to enthusiastic reviews from scholars across several disciplines and has\u000a      become both the definitive study of Puccini reception and a model for\u000a      richly-textured studies of composers within their historical contexts.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11855","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The creation of a new compositional method has made a distinct\u000d\u000a      contribution to two separate users and beneficiaries: (a) cultural\u000d\u000a      enrichment through concert performances and CD sales and (b)\u000d\u000a      pedagogy\/education.\u000d\u000a    (a) Cultural enrichment &#8212; impact and reach: Beneficiaries include\u000d\u000a      concertgoers, music-listening public and public buying discs.

The research yielded a viable and\u000d\u000a      flexible tool for teaching electroacoustic music composition to those new\u000d\u000a      and uninitiated with this genre. The research provided three methods of\u000d\u000a      engaging with the tool: [i] pairing visual shapes with sounds worksheet,\u000d\u000a      [ii] building structures based on starts, middles and ends in text and\u000d\u000a      video format and [iii] a Pro Tools (a industry standard digital audio\u000d\u000a      sequencer) template designed to initiate compositional activity with\u000d\u000a      starts, middles and ends, all freely available from\u000d\u000a      http:\/\/www.hope.ac.uk\/music\/interactingwithsoundshapes\/ website, designed\u000d\u000a      to widen access and engagement. The available methods (i, ii and iii) were\u000d\u000a      publicised on the CEC (Canadian Electroacoustic Music Community) forum and\u000d\u000a      Electroacoustic music composers Facebook group, which both reach\u000d\u000a      international audiences, educators and practitioners.\u000d\u000a    The compositional tool was delivered initially as a workshop as proof of\u000d\u000a      concept, involving all three aspects described above given by Dr Blackburn\u000d\u000a      and Dr Carman (post-doctoral teaching fellow) in 2012. These schools\u000d\u000a      include Sir John Deans Sixth Form College, Northwich and Hartford High\u000d\u000a      School, Cheshire. A post-workshop survey indicated the benefit of\u000d\u000a      accessible visual tools for composition in the classroom. A statement from\u000d\u000a      the Head of performance at Sir John Deanes Sixth Form College outlined\u000d\u000a      that \"within the sessions, students studied sound recording and\u000d\u000a      manipulation, and also how sounds can be represented visually in graphic\u000d\u000a      score.\"\u000d\u000a    Further educators within schools, colleges and HEIs have integrated this\u000d\u000a      tool into their teaching of electroacoustic music and music technology\u000d\u000a      autonomously. The pairing exercise [i] has been integrated into the EARS\u000d\u000a      II project as a listening task, which will be launched in 2014. The\u000d\u000a      starts, middles and ends construction method [ii] was taken up by\u000d\u000a      Professor Leigh Landy in his textbook for children aged 11-14, Making\u000d\u000a        Music With Sounds, (Routledge, 2012), where Chapter 4 is devoted to\u000d\u000a      outlining the tool in a visual format, and the tool and visual shapes\u000d\u000a      appears in a university e-textbook (awaiting publication by Routledge) Sonic\u000a        Recipes and Reasonings (given to all first year students on the BMus\u000d\u000a      degree in The University of Sheffield). Other institutions including Edge\u000d\u000a      Hill University, Manchester Metropolitan University, University of\u000d\u000a      Manchester, Coventry University and McGill University (Montreal) have all\u000d\u000a      implemented the tool (in formats i, ii, and iii) as resources for teaching\u000d\u000a      electroacoustic music for first year students and have provided positive\u000d\u000a      feedback for the use and success of the methodology within the classroom.\u000d\u000a      For example, Edge Hill University stated that the tool is \"a fantastic\u000d\u000a      exercise that is not age bound and provides focussed learning, developing\u000d\u000a      skills in aural training and improving the ways in which individuals might\u000d\u000a      conceive of gesture as compositional tool\". A composition course lecturer\u000d\u000a      at McGill University, Montreal stated that the \"prescriptive compositional\u000d\u000a      aid has enriched students' understanding of these concepts, and benefitted\u000d\u000a      them in the compositional thinking. I believe they may also have broader\u000d\u000a      applications for experienced composers in linking their compositional\u000d\u000a      processes to these ideas.\" These statements were collected via feedback\u000d\u000a      forms after the compositional resources had been utilized in teaching.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The development of a new compositional tool for electroacoustic music\u000d\u000a      (using technology to explore, create and perform sounds not limited to\u000d\u000a      traditional instrumental sources) based on visual shapes has generated new\u000d\u000a      ways of thinking that influence creative practice, and has inspired and\u000d\u000a      supported new forms of artistic expression.

Blackburn's new approach\u000d\u000a      reversed Smalley's descriptive language, used for discussing\u000d\u000a      electroacoustic music, so that the vocabulary preceded the composition,\u000d\u000a      directing the path the composer takes within a piece. After her\u000d\u000a      appointment at Liverpool Hope University (2010), Blackburn went onto\u000d\u000a      develop the methodology more formally into a set of visual compositional\u000d\u000a      tools (outlined in an Organised Sound journal article).\u000d\u000a      Visualisations were used to illustrate the techniques of sound creation\u000d\u000a      and assemblage, and the documentation stated that visual sound-shapes\u000d\u000a      \"have the most influential power upon compositional activity.\" A key\u000d\u000a      component of the research was the proposal of `sound unit' construction,\u000d\u000a      viewed as the primary building block of acousmatic music and founded on\u000d\u000a      the premise that every sound\/event has a `start, middle and end.' Video\u000d\u000a      demonstrations of sound unit assemblage (eg. images of emergence,\u000d\u000a      transition and release) were developed as miniature compositional\u000d\u000a      templates and starting points for composers. Sound and shape pairing\u000d\u000a      worksheets based on the new methodology were development and piloted with\u000d\u000a      school children as a means of introducing electroacoustic music at an\u000d\u000a      early stage (ages 11-17) in 2012. This pilot study suggested that when\u000d\u000a      presented with sounds of an abstract nature, children (secondary and\u000d\u000a      sixth-form level) preferred to give visual (drawn) shapes rather than\u000d\u000a      textual descriptions when asked to react to what they heard, suggesting\u000d\u000a      the immediacy of visual shape formation over textual descriptors in the\u000d\u000a      mind of the listener. Blackburn's PhD portfolio of electroacoustic music\u000d\u000a      compositions (University of Manchester) consisting of seven original\u000d\u000a      acousmatic works (between 2006-2009) was instrumental in testing and\u000d\u000a      refining the methodology leading to the conclusions made in the Organised\u000a        Sound article. A CD publication of this portfolio was released in\u000d\u000a      June 2012 on the empreintes DIGITAL label, which also included more recent\u000d\u000a      compositional work from 2011 (Liverpool Hope University) utilizing the\u000d\u000a      compositional tool.\u000d\u000a    An outline of the underpinning research produced: The initial\u000d\u000a      concept was proposed in theory in Buenos Aires at the Electronic Music\u000d\u000a      Studies Network International conference in 2008 (in Blackburn, `Composing\u000d\u000a      from Spectromorphological Vocabulary, Proposed Application, Pedagogy and\u000d\u000a      Metadata,' (conference paper) and later documented more formally in a\u000d\u000a      journal article within Organised Sound, 2011 [1]. A conference\u000d\u000a      paper [2] outlining how the workshops for children\/young learners can be\u000d\u000a      delivered based on sound and image pairings was given at the Tape to\u000d\u000a      Typedef conference in Sheffield, January 2013. A description of the\u000d\u000a      compositional methodology along with the visual representations of the\u000d\u000a      tool in action now appear within the educational textbook for 11-14 years,\u000d\u000a      Composing Music with Sounds [3].

Dibben's research also added\u000d\u000a      creative value through the inclusion of essays within the Bj&#246;rk\u000d\u000a        Biophilia app album (2011), and physical album releases (Biophilia\u000a        Ultimate Edition, 2011; Biophilia Manual, 2011). Notably,\u000d\u000a      this was the first time Bj&#246;rk integrated academic research into her\u000d\u000a      creative artefacts, and a rare (perhaps only) instance of a collaboration\u000d\u000a      between an academic and internationally-renowned pop musician on an album\u000d\u000a      project. In addition, Dibben's research had a creative and cultural impact\u000d\u000a      on audiences of Bj&#246;rk's music through its presentation as interpretive\u000d\u000a      material within the apps (\"a stunning analytical essay put together by\u000d\u000a      Nikki Dibben\", 2020k, 2011; \"fascinating essays\" The\u000d\u000a        Telegraph, 2011), a 7000 word programme (Biophilia Live\u000d\u000a      2011), and as the exhibition text accompanying the world tour of live\u000d\u000a      performances, where it was incorporated both as subtitles accompanying\u000d\u000a      documentary films, and stand-alone text displayed on plasma screens (e.g.\u000d\u000a      Harpa concert hall, Reykjavik, October-November 2011). Based on an\u000d\u000a      estimated 5,000 attendees during the Reykjavik residency, the exhibition\u000d\u000a      could reach a total 40,000 people by the end of the tour in 2014.\u000d\u000a    2. Quality of life and understanding.\u000d\u000a    Dibben's research had cultural and societal impact on the international\u000d\u000a      reception of Bj&#246;rk's music and of the new app-album format. For example,\u000d\u000a      she was one of three members of the creative team who represented Biophilia\u000d\u000a      at the press launch in June 2011; she collaborated with Bj&#246;rk's manager\u000d\u000a      and personal assistant to write press releases for Biophilia; and\u000d\u000a      wrote the app descriptions for the iTunes store which guide purchasers'\u000d\u000a      decisions. Phrases from her press releases appear in international press\u000d\u000a      coverage of the release of Biophilia showing a direct impact of\u000d\u000a      her words on journalists' understanding of Bj&#246;rk's work, and potentially\u000d\u000a      on public reception of Biophilia. Dibben's exhibition materials\u000d\u000a      were also used by critics to inform their reviews: \"According to an\u000d\u000a        essay on display in the lobby, along with half a dozen video screens\u000d\u000a        showing graphics and film clips associated with the album, biophilia is\u000d\u000a        an ancient philosophical notion...\" (review by David Fricke in Rolling\u000d\u000a        Stone, 2011). The Biophilia project continues to receive\u000d\u000a      world-wide press coverage from hundreds of media outlets: a google search\u000d\u000a      with the terms \"Bj&#246;rk Biophilia\" reveals in excess of 1,260,000 hits. In\u000d\u000a      the UK alone there were 176 stories listed in the NewsBank newspaper\u000d\u000a      database, and BBC News featured Biophilia 15 times. Dibben also\u000d\u000a      used her knowledge of the connections between music and nature to justify\u000d\u000a      the conceptual appropriateness of the Biophilia live show for the\u000d\u000a      New York Hall of Science as part of a bid to use the museum as a venue,\u000d\u000a      thereby influencing the connections audiences would draw between music and\u000d\u000a      science.\u000d\u000a    Dibben's research reached audiences through a variety of artefacts and\u000d\u000a      activities. Dibben's most visible contributions to the Biophilia\u000d\u000a      app are the ten essays that accompany the album's ten songs. These texts\u000d\u000a      inform audiences of the conceptual underpinnings of the project: in the\u000d\u000a      words of Bj&#246;rk's manager, \"I think that to realise the aims of\u000d\u000a        including an education and learning aspect to the project &#8212; your writing\u000d\u000a        on each song would be a very important aspect of the project\" (email\u000d\u000a      to Dibben from Manager of One Little Indian, 2010). Two aspects of\u000d\u000a      Dibben's research impacted on Bj&#246;rk during the process, and then on\u000d\u000a      subsequent audiences: first, Bj&#246;rk wanted to communicate her ideas about\u000d\u000a      musical structure to a mass audience &#8212; a principle Dibben had advocated in\u000d\u000a      her monograph Bj&#246;rk; and second, Dibben applied her understanding\u000d\u000a      of the relationship between Bj&#246;rk's compositional strategies and ideas of\u000d\u000a      nature and technology to interpret, and promote understanding of the Biophilia\u000d\u000a      project for a global audience (e.g. \"you really get the full experience\u000d\u000a        of the music and the rationale behind its conception and creation\",\u000d\u000a      Scientific American, 2011). Dibben was also commissioned by Bj&#246;rk\u000d\u000a      to interview her and others in order to document the creative process,\u000d\u000a      extracting interview material for the record company to use in promotional\u000d\u000a      features on the artist website, and advising on the script for a Channel 4\u000d\u000a      documentary (When Bj&#246;rk Met Attenborough, Pulse films, 2013).\u000d\u000a      Dibben's research has therefore influenced the understanding of Bj&#246;rk's\u000d\u000a      music, and of how music might `be about' human relationships with nature\u000d\u000a      and technology, either directly through her own writings, interviews, and\u000d\u000a      editing choices, or indirectly, through other intermediaries.\u000d\u000a    At a more individual level, Dibben's research informed the pop-up music\u000d\u000a      school curriculum which runs alongside the Biophilia world tour.\u000d\u000a      She briefed and taught on the first of these (Manchester International\u000d\u000a      Festival, 2011), advised on later incarnations (e.g. Reykjavik, 2011), and\u000d\u000a      her work is part of the online educational materials at\u000d\u000a      http:\/\/biophiliaeducational.org\/. For example, the one-week Biophilia\u000d\u000a      music school in Manchester comprised science and music classes for 25\u000d\u000a      school children from under-privileged homes and some of their teachers: \"I\u000d\u000a        have personally become interested in how apps and music programmes can\u000d\u000a        be used to inspire music making rather than be just a tool to record\u000d\u000a        compositions.\" (Teacher, Manchester); \"It's taught me that any\u000d\u000a        sound can make music, and how much science and music is related\"\u000d\u000a      (Student, Manchester); \"The educational part of Biophilia is a\u000d\u000a        spectacular and groundbreaking project. Inspiring teachers to work in an\u000d\u000a        interdisciplinary manner with mixed age groups and using creativity as a\u000d\u000a        learning tool works remarkably well. This kind of fusion in teaching can\u000d\u000a        play a part in shaping curriculums in the future.\" (Teacher,\u000d\u000a      Reykjavik).

Economic impact.\u000d\u000a    Dibben's research had three types of economic impact: i) the small but\u000d\u000a      direct economic impact of the original publication &#8212; Bj&#246;rk\u000d\u000a      (Equinox, 2009); ii) added value to Bj&#246;rk's Biophilia artefacts\u000d\u000a      (2011), and iii) added value to the Biophilia touring show\u000d\u000a      (2011-13).\u000d\u000a    i) There is a small direct economic benefit of the monograph (c.2700\u000d\u000a      copies sold @ &#163;11.99) to the British publishing industry.\u000d\u000a    ii) The other types of economic impact are potentially larger but are\u000d\u000a      harder to separate from the significant economic impact made by Bj&#246;rk's Biophilia\u000d\u000a      project as a whole (e.g. the iPad app alone was the top selling music app\u000d\u000a      in 41 countries). The presence of Dibben's research added creative and\u000d\u000a      economic value to four artefacts (Bj&#246;rk: Biophilia app album, 2011;\u000d\u000a      Biophilia Ultimate Edition, 2011; Biophilia Manual, 2011;\u000d\u000a      and Biophilia Live programme, 2011) and this benefitted\u000d\u000a      the record companies One Little Indian, Wellhart and Nonesuch. In evidence\u000d\u000a      of this, products including Dibben's work were sold at a higher price\u000d\u000a      point than those without: the Biophilia Manual Edition retails at\u000d\u000a      &#163;35, and Ultimate Edition was &#163;500 (both containing Dibben's\u000d\u000a      essays), whereas the Biophilia CD in jewel case (without Dibben's\u000d\u000a      essays) retails at &#163;9.99.\u000d\u000a    iii) Dibben was commissioned to write exhibition material displayed in\u000d\u000a      the show's performance venues (e.g. Manchester International Festival\u000d\u000a      2011, Reykjavik Harpa Concert Hall 2011, New York Hall of Science 2012,\u000d\u000a      Alexandra Palace, 2013), enhancing the events by creating a clearer\u000d\u000a      understanding\/augmented experience, and therefore adding value.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Nicola Dibben's research into the music of international pop icon Bj&#246;rk\u000d\u000a      led to her creative role in Bj&#246;rk's ambitious multi-media project Biophilia.\u000d\u000a      The Biophilia app is the first of a new format, a touchstone for\u000d\u000a      developments in artist apps, sold in 200 countries, and described by the New\u000d\u000a        York Times as \"among the most creative, innovative and important\u000d\u000a        new projects in popular culture\" (2011).

It is one of few academic\u000d\u000a      works which presents detailed musicological analysis of the work of a\u000d\u000a      popular music artist, previous studies of which tend to emphasise the\u000d\u000a      historical or sociological aspects of an artist's work. Dibben conducted\u000d\u000a      this research between 2006 and 2008, with Arts and Humanities Research\u000d\u000a      Council Research Leave funding (Sept 2006 to Jan 2007), which resulted in\u000d\u000a      a monograph and peer review article [R1, R2].\u000d\u000a    Dibben's research provides a detailed musicological analysis of Bj&#246;rk's\u000d\u000a      musical processes and products (audio and video tracks, live performances\u000d\u000a      and recorded sound), examined in the light of the videos, artwork,\u000d\u000a      critical reception, and fanzines that surround the music, supplemented by\u000d\u000a      original interview material. The analysis draws on the discourse\u000d\u000a      surrounding her music to reveal and explore recurrent cultural themes\u000d\u000a      brought into focus by her music: constructions of nature and identity, the\u000d\u000a      relationship between humans and technology, song as a vehicle for\u000d\u000a      emotional expression, and female autonomy and authorship. This includes an\u000d\u000a      assessment of her reception by the media, which focused largely upon her\u000d\u000a      role as mother, girlfriend, and as an 'eccentric'. Dibben argued that this\u000d\u000a      is part of a broader reception ideology of (female) popular musicians,\u000d\u000a      which functions to devalue the contribution made by popular musicians and\u000d\u000a      their music to cultural life.\u000d\u000a    This detailed study provided new insights into studio-based compositional\u000d\u000a      processes and products. The focus on specific cultural themes furthered\u000d\u000a      understanding of how contemporary music participates in larger discourses,\u000d\u000a      and how these discourses are drawn upon to make meaning of musical\u000d\u000a      experiences. This is particularly relevant to the subsequent impacts of\u000d\u000a      Dibben's research as part of the Biophilia project, which centered\u000d\u000a      on her ability to articulate the way in which Bj&#246;rk's musical processes\u000d\u000a      communicated ideas about the human relationship with nature and\u000d\u000a      technology. As well as addressing a scholarly audience the monograph aimed\u000d\u000a      to allow a more general interest audience to engage with in-depth analysis\u000d\u000a      of music by showing how Bj&#246;rk's artistic vision of \"unity\" is manifested\u000d\u000a      across sonic and visual properties of her work.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"12081","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Peter Hill's research has had three main types of impact: first, the\u000a      research informed Hill's creation\u000a      of cultural artefacts (his performances, recordings, writings and\u000a      broadcasts) and helped preserve &#8212;\u000a      and in one case discover &#8212; musical heritage, all of which enriched the\u000a      cultural life of the general\u000a      music-loving public; second, shaping musical education and performance\u000a      interpretation of\u000a      Messiaen's music beyond the University of Sheffield, through piano\u000a      masterclasses, lectures,\u000a      writings and recordings; and, third, economic impact from performances and\u000a      recordings.\u000a    As described above, Hill's research into Messiaen's music led to new ways\u000a      of interpreting the\u000a      composer's work in relation to intra-musical processes (goal direction\u000a      versus stasis) and their\u000a      relationship with extramusical ideas and inspirations (the relationship\u000a      between the natural world\u000a      and its portraiture in Messiaen's music). These new ways of thinking\u000a      impacted on Hill's creative\u000a      practice as a performer, both in terms of creating cultural capital &#8212;\u000a      specifically the performances\u000a      and reissued recordings that resulted from the research &#8212; and in terms of\u000a      the particular musical\u000a      expression that those performances take. The manifestation of this\u000a      research in the form of Hill's\u000a      recordings and performances is particularly significant because neither\u000a      Messiaen nor his wife, and\u000a      primary interpreter, Yvonne Loriod, are alive anymore. While there is a\u000a      `school' of followers\u000a      influenced by studying with Loriod, Hill was influenced by studying with\u000a      Messiaen rather than his\u000a      interpreter. Hill's exhaustive studies with, and subsequent to, Messiaen\u000a      now means he has a\u000a      different but equally respected and highly acclaimed interpretation.\u000a      Hence, Hill's distinctive\u000a      contribution to cultural life comes from the way his research enabled him\u000a      to create distinctive\u000a      interpretations of Messiaen's music that are received as culture- and\u000a      life-enhancing.\u000a    Hill's performances and recordings are widely regarded as authoritative\u000a      interpretations and the\u000a      touchstone for future performers, as noted by reviewers: `Few pianists\u000a        have more authority in\u000a        [Messiaen's] music than Hill, who studied the Catalogue with the\u000a        composer ... He plays it with a\u000a        fluency that extends far beyond mere technical accuracy and rhythmic\u000a        precision. The pieces are\u000a        thus immediately far more than abstract technical exercises, but become\u000a        the richly coloured\u000a        portraits from nature that Messiaen intended ...' (Guardian,\u000a      2011). In further evidence of this\u000a      cultural impact, his Messiaen recordings were first re-issued by Regis\u000a      Records as a 7CD set in\u000a      2002 (original recordings 1985-1994, Unicorn-Kanchana) and then in 2008\u000a      reissued again by\u000a      Brilliant Classics who chose Hill's version of the piano music for their\u000a      complete edition of\u000a      Messiaen's music. Moreover, Hill has the distinction of three listings in\u000a      1001 Classical Recordings\u000a        You Must Hear Before You Die (Universe Publishing, 2008), including\u000a      one for Messiaen's\u000a      Catalogue d'oiseaux (original recording, 1988-90; reissued 2002 and\u000a      2008). In addition his\u000a      recording of Catalogue d'oiseaux was named in The Times'\u000a      \"The Classical Collection\" (2008) as\u000a      the best recording of this work. Hill's recordings and performances are\u000a      also a means by which this\u000a      musical heritage is preserved. An extreme example of this is Hill's\u000a      discovery and interpretation of\u000a      Messiaen's previously unknown piano piece, La Fauvette Passerinette\u000a      (Subalpine Warbler), which\u000a      emerged during Hill's work in the Messiaen archive 2002-4 (reported in Gramophone,\u000a      31 July\u000a      2013), and was premiered by Hill in Sheffield, on 2 November 2013, with a\u000a      broadcast by BBC\u000a      Radio 3.\u000a    The impact of Hill's work on the wider public also comes through his huge\u000a      number and range of\u000a      public engagement activities which include masterclasses, lectures,\u000a      broadcast talks, discussions\u000a      and documentaries, journalism, and pre-concert talks. The range and number\u000a      of events is\u000a      illustrated by Hill's schedule in Messiaen's centenary year (2008), which\u000a      included 12 broadcasts\u000a      (including a recital at the Messiaen Festival at La Grave, broadcast by\u000a      Radio France), 23 public\u000a      lectures (including Carnegie Hall, the Library of Congress, the British\u000a      Library and the Proms),\u000a      broadcast interviews and documentaries (including, `Debussy's year in\u000a      1912', `Messiaen as\u000a      teacher', and `The Golden Oriole' for BBC Radio 3, and others for CBC,\u000a      Radio France and Radio\u000a      New Zealand), 12 masterclasses, in addition to 10 solo and 4 duo recitals\u000a      in Europe, North\u000a      America and Australia. Solo recitals to non-academic audiences include: in\u000a      2008 &#8212; Boston\u000a      University, Buxton Festival, Cardiff University Messiaen Day, La Grave\u000a      Messiaen Festival, Leeds\u000a      University Messiaen Day, Norwich Messiaen Weekend, Queen's Hall Edinburgh,\u000a      RNCM Messiaen\u000a      Weekend, MITO Festival Milan and Turin; in 2011 &#8212; Boston Conservatory; Le\u000a      Poisson Rouge, New\u000a      York; Bristol Earth Music Festival (Radio 3); in 2012 &#8212; Festival Louise\u000a      Besette, Montreal, for which\u000a      he received the award for Best Contemporary Recital and Best Overall\u000a      Recital, Synaesthesia\u000a      Festival at MONA, Hobart; in 2013 &#8212; Norwegian Academy of Music, Brisbane\u000a      Conservatorium. In\u000a      addition, since 2008 he has given 15 performances as piano duo (with\u000a      Benjamin Frith) and as\u000a      pianist with numerous ensembles in performances of Messiaen's Quatuor\u000a        pour la fin du Temps.\u000a    Unsolicited individual testimonies and reviews attest to the highly\u000a      prized experiences that these\u000a      performances arouse in audiences [S3]. For example, the reviewer of a\u000a      performance in Glasgow\u000a      described the performance as \"lyrical and poetic..., intimate...,\u000a        meticulously expressive in its\u000a        dynamic layering and achingly tender in the ecstatic calm of the love\u000a        music\" (The Herald, 2008).\u000a      The Director of the SoundsNew Contemporary Music Festival remarked \"...your\u000a        recordings of\u000a        Messiaen literally changed my life &#8212; and I sincerely mean that. The\u000a        recording of Books 1, 2 and 3\u000a        of Catalogue...inspired me more than words can say. No one else plays\u000a        Messiaen like you\" (email\u000a      to Hill, 2008). As another reviewer put it: `Peter Hill does not just\u000a        give concerts, he also enriches\u000a        one's life with perceptive introductions that illuminate the music,\u000a        however well you may think you\u000a        know it ...' (Yorkshire Post).\u000a    Hill's many public lectures include those for general audiences and\u000a      trainee music educators,\u000a      totalling approximately 1800 people (2008-13). In 2008 alone his public\u000a      lectures included:\u000a      `Messiaen's use of birdsong recordings', British Library Saul lecture;\u000a      `Messiaen', Carnegie Hall (to\u000a      an audience of 300 people and where his co-lecturer was Pierre Boulez);\u000a      `Messiaen's Blackbird',\u000a      Chicago Humanities Festival; `Messiaen in War and Peace', Library of\u000a      Congress; `Introducing\u000a      Messiaen', MITO Festival Milan; `The composer in an age of change',\u000a      `Messiaen and birdsong' and\u000a      `Why music education matters', New Zealand Music Teacher's Conference;\u000a      `Messiaen, Birdsong\u000a      and Oiseaux Exotiques', Philharmonia Orchestra, Royal Festival\u000a      Hall; `Messiaen's Saint Fran&#231;ois\u000a        d'Assise' (broadcast discussion), BBC Promenade Concerts, Radio 3;\u000a      `The Crystal Liturgy', BBC\u000a      Promenade Concerts; `Messiaen's Quartet', Queen's Hall Edinburgh. In\u000a      illustration of the value\u000a      placed on these activities by audience members, the organiser of the New\u000a      Zealand Music\u000a      Teacher's Conference remarked afterwards: \"Everyone is unanimous in\u000a        their praise for you and the\u000a        time you spent with us. With your `wonderful communication skills with\u000a        voice and piano' you\u000a        convinced, converted, and indeed `motivated, encouraged and inspired'\u000a        people to explore new\u000a        horizons.\" (email to Hill, 2008).\u000a    He has also made a conscious effort to communicate his research findings\u000a      in an accessible way\u000a      through written material for general audiences, such as programme notes\u000a      and essays for the South\u000a      Bank Messiaen Festival, February-December 2008, and booklet notes for a\u000a      Messiaen chamber\u000a      music CD by the Gould Trio (Hyperion), 2008. The way in which Hill's\u000a      research influences the\u000a      general public's understanding [S4] is illustrated by the example of the\u000a      Saul Lecture at the British\u000a      Library (2008), which examined Messiaen's transcriptions from birdsong\u000a      recordings, copies of\u000a      which are held in the British Library's sound archive, and their\u000a      subsequent use in his music. As well\u000a      as making connections between ornithology and music this work resulted in\u000a      interdisciplinary\u000a      connections between the curators of the ornithology and music recordings.\u000a    Hill's research has also influenced later performers and interpreters of\u000a      Messiaen's music through\u000a      the numerous public lectures and masterclasses [S1, S2] to audiences of up\u000a      to a hundred people\u000a      each time at universities and conservatoires throughout Europe, North\u000a      America and Australia.\u000a      Some of these comprised week-long residencies in which Hill worked\u000a      intensively with up to 20\u000a      students at a time as well as giving public lectures and recitals. For\u000a      instance, at the Australian\u000a      National Academy of Music (in 2012) he coached advanced pianists in\u000a      Messiaen's Visions de\u000a        l'Amen (taking the second piano part himself) before giving\u000a      performances at the Hobart\u000a      Synaesthesia Festival, Tasmania. Participants attest to the value and\u000a      influence of his educational\u000a      work, one host remarking: `thank you for all your many contributions to\u000a        the Conservatorium last\u000a        week. For Colin the experience was priceless but for many others\u000a        [pianists named] and all those\u000a        who witnessed your infectious enthusiasm and boundless expertise in your\u000a        lectures\/classes\/concerts, we shall remember your visit for a long time.'\u000a      (Queensland\u000a      Conservatorium, email to Hill, 2013) [S1].\u000a    Hill's numerous recordings and performances also create economic\u000a      benefits. Sales of recordings\u000a      and tickets directly benefit record companies, and the regions and\u000a      organisations hosting the many\u000a      festivals at which he performs. For example, Hill provided four events to\u000a      an audience of 400 within\u000a      the Synaesthesia weekend festival at the Museum of Old and New Art,\u000a      Hobart, Tasmania &#8212;\u000a      Tasmania's primary tourist attraction and part of its emerging\u000a      `neo-economy'. More locally, Hill has\u000a      contributed to the University of Sheffield's identity as a `Civic\u000a      University' through his contribution to\u000a      the success of the Sheffield Chamber Festival `Music in the Round',\u000a      resulting in expansion of the\u000a      Crucible Theatre studio \"to accommodate a much larger audience due to\u000a        the following built up by\u000a        the Lindsays [String Quartet] ...placing Sheffield squarely on the\u000a        musical map... He has truly\u000a        enriched all who have heard him and thereby the reputation of Sheffield\u000a        as a cultural centre.\"\u000a      (Master Cutler, Sheffield)[S5].\u000a    The constant stream of invitations to perform, coach and speak all over\u000a      the world attest to the\u000a      value placed on Hill's work and his reputation as someone who can\u000a      communicate with the general\u000a      public. Moreover it underlines Hill's commitment to communicate ideas,\u000a      insights and knowledge\u000a      about music to the widest audience and indicates the enrichment to quality\u000a      of life this brings.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Peter Hill is an internationally-acclaimed scholar and pianist, and one\u000a      of the leading authorities on\u000a      the French 20th Century composer Messiaen.

Studies with\u000a      Messiaen himself\u000a      (1986-91), while recording the solo piano music, led to countless\u000a      insights, but in particular a\u000a      scepticism about the prevailing view of Messiaen as the composer of static\u000a      or non-propulsive\u000a      music (see, for example, the biography by Paul Griffiths). This\u000a      alternative view was presented in\u000a      three chapters in [R1] The Messiaen Companion (1995), later in\u000a      [R2] Olivier Messiaen: Oiseaux\u000a        Exotiques (with Nigel Simeone, 2007), and most recently in work for\u000a      a forthcoming book on\u000a      Messiaen's Catalogue d'Oiseaux [R4] and [R5]. This involves\u000a      viewing Messiaen's music\u000a      (especially post-1950) as a mosaic composed of structures that operate on\u000a      different levels, and at\u000a      the same time recognising the tonal centres established in the music that\u000a      enable a sense of goal-direction.\u000a      These ideas are key to Hill's own recordings [R6] and performances of\u000a      Messiaen, and\u000a      form the basis of his impact on other performers and the music-loving\u000a      public.\u000a    At the same time, Hill's views on the music were enhanced by unique\u000a      access to the private\u000a      Messiaen papers, beginning with four years researching in the composer's\u000a      apartment in Paris\u000a      (2001-4), followed by work on the manuscripts at the Bibilioth&#232;que\u000a      nationale de France (BnF). The\u000a      result was [R3] Messiaen (with Nigel Simeone, 2005), the first\u000a      biography of the composer to relate\u000a      in detail the circumstances of Messiaen's life to the evolution of his\u000a      music. The holdings at the BnF\u000a      include one of the birdsong notebooks, which contain his transcriptions,\u000a      ideas, projects and\u000a      sketches of all types. Hill is the first scholar to have subjected these\u000a      manuscripts to detailed\u000a      scrutiny, and an inventory of their contents is nearing completion. Hill's\u000a      work on the birdsong\u000a      notebooks was the principal source for the book on Oiseaux Exotiques\u000a      (2007), which was the first\u000a      study to trace in detail the genesis of a work by this notoriously\u000a      secretive composer. In addition,\u000a      Hill's research led to his discovery and reconstruction of a previously\u000a      unknown work, La Fauvette\u000a        Passerinette (Subalpine Warbler), which is a substantial 15-minute\u000a      piece for piano in the\u000a      composer's birdsong style, dating from 1961. The piece was discovered by\u000a      Hill among Messiaen's\u000a      sketches, the music clearly in an advanced state of completion, with\u000a      several pages marked \"page &#224;\u000a      copier\". Passages that were still in the composer's shorthand were\u000a      reconstructed by cross-referencing\u000a      to the notations in Messiaen's birdsong notebooks. Hill's research shed\u000a      light on the\u000a      origins and context of this work and its relationship to Messiaen's other\u000a      compositions at this time\u000a      and provides a richer understanding of Messiaen's compositional\u000a      development.\u000a    Understanding the sources, inspirations and evolution of Messiaen's music\u000a      has immeasurable\u000a      significance for performers, and &#8212; like the ideas on `time' discussed\u000a      earlier &#8212; are central to Hill's\u000a      performances and masterclasses. An illustrative example of this is the way\u000a      understanding\u000a      Messiaen's ornithological inspirations, including Hill's discovery of the\u000a      recordings of birdsong used\u000a      by Messiaen, and the evolution of birdsong into musical material in\u000a      Messiaen's notebooks, made it\u000a      possible to get closer to Messiaen's ideas of timbre, and to what Messiaen\u000a      heard within the\u000a      birdsong. Ultimately these discoveries provided insights impossible to\u000a      obtain from the score alone.\u000a      These findings resonate with a wider public and have played a major part\u000a      in Hill's public lectures\u000a      and talks (together with broadcasts) on Messiaen.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"12521","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1835841","Name":"South Korea"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Between 2008 and 2013 EAR ON ARM and ARTICULATED HEAD\u000a      have led to the introduction of new approaches to the integration of\u000a      biotechnologies and cognitive science in the arts community, the promotion\u000a      of a broader acknowledgement of, and engagement with, interdisciplinary\u000a      work in the field of science and art by the general public (non-specialist\u000a      audiences), and a medical case study in state-of-the-art biotechnologies\u000a      offering a point of departure for new developments in Human Computer\u000a      Interaction (HCI).\u000a    The impact of the projects in these areas is reflected in the following\u000a      ways:\u000a    (1) EAR ON ARM was awarded the Golden Nica award in the category\u000a      Hybrid Art at the Ars Electronica Festival 2010, one of the most important\u000a      prizes for innovation in art and technology.\u000a    (2) ARTICULATED HEAD was featured in the Powerhouse Museum in\u000a      Sydney, the leading science museum in Australia.

His artistic research explores alternate operational architectures,\u000a      either virtual or bodily couplings with machine systems. His projects are\u000a      about strategies for generating unexpected capabilities by combining\u000a      biology and electronic media and, more generally, about issues of agency,\u000a      embodiment and materiality.\u000a    ARTICULATED HEAD is part of a wider 'Thinking\u000a        Head Project', one of three Thinking Systems Special Initiatives\u000a      grants jointly funded by the Australian Research Council (ARC) and the\u000a      Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NH&amp;MRC)\u000a      between 2006 and 2011. The ARTICULATED HEAD system consists of an\u000a      industrial robot arm (Fanuc LR Mate 200ic) with a 17 inch LCD mounted on\u000a      the end effecter. The LCD screen displays a 3D rendering of a head\u000a      (Prosthetic Head) that resembles Stelarc. Damith Herath, Christian Kroos\u000a      and Zhengzhi Zhang of MARCS Labs, University of Western Sydney, were the\u000a      robot and programming team. The system also contains an array of sensors\u000a      including auditory localisation, stereo vision and monocular vision that\u000a      provide situational awareness for the robotic 'agent'. The complete system\u000a      is driven by a novel 'attention model', an algorithmic implementation that\u000a      emulates simple brain functions. Articulated Head is no longer a virtual\u000a      entity, as was the Prosthetic Head that it was based on but is now an\u000a      actual physical presence. The ARTICULATED HEAD is, therefore, a\u000a      significant step towards the evaluation of more complex human-robot\u000a      interactions and affords a multiplicity of methods to research these\u000a      various interactions.\u000a    The EAR ON ARM project constitutes a pioneering innovation in the\u000a      field of performance art and bio-technology. Instead of applying standard\u000a      cosmetic surgery procedures in response to cultural norms of beauty (cf.\u000a      ORLAN's Surgery Performances, 1990-93), EAR ON ARM is\u000a      concerned with the construction of a functional anatomical structure,\u000a      using innovative applications of surgical procedures. Initially visualised\u000a      on the side of the artist's head (Extra Ear, 1996), it was not\u000a      until 2006 that the first surgical procedures were funded and carried out.\u000a      The EAR ON ARM has required 2 surgeries thus far, performed by\u000a      Malcom A. Lesavoy (F.A.C.S. Board Certified Plastic &amp; Reconstructive\u000a      Surgery, Los Angeles), J. William Futrell (Professor in Plastic Surgery in\u000a      Pittsburgh\/Chairman and co-founder of The GID Group, Inc), Sean Bidic\u000a      (plastic and ear and hand reconstructive surgeon practising in New\u000a      Jersey), and Wayne Morrison (senior staff of plastic surgeons at St.\u000a      Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne). The research project has also involved\u000a      collaboration between Stelarc and Jeremy Taylor (October Films, London).\u000a    An extra ear has been constructed on Stelarc's forearm: a left ear on a\u000a      left arm. A facial feature has been replicated, relocated and will now be\u000a      rewired for alternate capabilities, not only to hear but to transmit.\u000a      Excess skin was created with an implanted skin expander in the forearm. By\u000a      injecting saline solution into a subcutaneous port, the kidney-shaped\u000a      silicone implant stretched the skin, forming a pocket of excess skin that\u000a      could be used in surgically constructing the ear. A second surgery\u000a      inserted a Medpor scaffold with the skin being suctioned over it. The\u000a      Medpor implant is a porous, biocompatible polyethylene material, with pore\u000a      sizes ranging from 100-250 micrometers. This can be shaped into several\u000a      parts and sutured together to form the ear shape. Because it has a pore\u000a      structure that is interconnected and omnidirectional it encourages\u000a      fibrovascular ingrowth, becoming integrated with Stelarc's arm at the\u000a      inserted site, not allowing any shifting of the scaffold.\u000a    The EAR ON ARM remains a work in progress. Further surgical\u000a      procedures are needed to lift the helix, creating a conch and growing a\u000a      soft ear lobe with the artist's extracted adult stem cells. A small\u000a      microphone will then be embedded in the ear which, connected to a wireless\u000a      transmitter and server, will internet-enable the ear, allowing people in\u000a      other places to listen to what it is hearing. The EAR ON ARM\u000a      becomes a kind of internet organ for other bodies in other places to\u000a      access and listen through.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"12522","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Arts and Humanities Research Council","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of this project lies not only in the musical works which have\u000a      been produced during the research but also in the new understandings which\u000a      have been developed as the project has progressed about the ways in which\u000a      listeners respond to and understand multiple streams of auditory\u000a      information in these musical works and, by extension, in texted vocal\u000a      music in general.

They\u000a      were involved in presentations of the research at the 2011 Cambridge\u000a      Festival of Ideas and further interest in the project was reflected in its\u000a      discussion on BBC Radio 3's Music Matters programme and public\u000a      performances in Cambridge and Huddersfield, The performances of Roger\u000a        go to yellow three drew a further positive response from the\u000a      Wellcome Trust, who were impressed not only by the work's impact in\u000a      developing public understanding of the phenomenon of auditory streaming\u000a      but also by the way that the auditory tests embedded in the work enabled\u000a      the project's scientific advisers to undertake new scientific research.\u000a      The data collected in the Roger go to yellow three performances\u000a      was extensively analysed and yielded findings which offer new insights\u000a      into the phenomenon of masking. Dr Antje Heinrich presented an initial\u000a      survey of these findings, under the title `Stream segregation of speech in\u000a      live concert-hall performances of a 6-voice choir', at the British Society\u000a      of Audiology's 2012 conference.\u000a    The success of Roger go to yellow three, as a project which not\u000a      only encouraged public engagement in science but also enabled scientists\u000a      to gather new experimental data, led to the Wellcome Trust inviting The\u000a      Clerks to submit an application for a Large Arts Award to develop further\u000a      the work begun in Roger go to yellow three. Confirmation of the\u000a      impact of the research and the Wellcome Trust's commitment to the project\u000a      came in summer 2012 when this application was approved and the impact of\u000a      the project was further demonstrated by the widespread interest of\u000a      festivals and concert promoters in presenting the new work, Tales from\u000a        Babel. A fourth scientist, Dr Sarah Knight, joined the team to\u000a      oversee data collection and public presentations of the scientific aspects\u000a      of the project. Scenes from Tales from Babel were presented on 5th\u000a      April 2013 during the Second International Conference of the AHRC Research\u000a      Centre for Musical Performance as Creative Practice, at the British\u000a      Neuroscience Association's biennial meeting at the Barbican, London on 8\u000a      April 2013 and at Addenbroke's Hospital; the premiere of the complete work\u000a      was given as part of the Cheltenham Festival of Music on 7 July 2013, the\u000a      first date in a concert tour which extended into the autumn of 2013. In\u000a      the wake of the Cheltenham Festival there has been extensive media\u000a      coverage including BBC Radios 3 (In Tune and The Choir) and\u000a      5 Live, and articles in the Independent, NME, Times, London Evening\u000a        Standard and Guardian.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Since 2006 Professor Christopher Fox has been engaged in a series of\u000a      linked projects which explore ways in which the engagement of performers\u000a      and listeners in texted music for vocal ensemble can be enhanced.

This\u000a      relationship is the subject of a number of longstanding assumptions held\u000a      by musicians particularly about the extent to which sung texts are\u000a      intelligible.\u000a    Fox's initial study, 20 Ways To Improve Your Life, focused on\u000a      predominantly syllabic settings of short contemporary texts whose banality\u000a      (they were drawn from small ads in free-sheet newspapers) might be\u000a      expected to make them readily intelligible. As these settings could also\u000a      be heard as a 21st century version of `City Cries', a genre of the 15th\u000a      and 16th centuries (cf. Jannequin, Gibbons, Weelkes, etc), the work was\u000a      taken up by The Clerks (director, Edward Wickham), a group which\u000a      specialises in Renaissance vocal music.\u000a    A second pilot study, Sing a new song, juxtaposed different\u000a      elements of a text, using the classically-trained voices of The Clerks as\u000a      counterpoints to a unison line sung by children. This phase of the project\u000a      was funded by Faber Music as part of their work for Sing Up, the\u000a      government initiative to encourage singing in schools. Government-funding\u000a      for Sing Up was withdrawn in 2011 but its on-line resources remain\u000a      available and Sing a new song continues to be used in schools.\u000a    A third, more substantial phase grew out of the evaluation of these\u000a      initial studies. It was realised that a more systematic investigation was\u000a      needed into the degree of intelligibility achieved by each musical\u000a      setting. Edward Wickham proposed the Brungart test, an auditory streaming\u000a      test devised by the US Air Force to train air-traffic controllers, as a\u000a      model and a new work was devised in which voices within a Brungart test\u000a      gradually turn into characters in a domestic drama scripted by Wickham. A\u000a      successful grant application was made to the Wellcome Trust's `Public\u000a      Engagement' funding stream and three scientific advisers &#8212; experts in\u000a      linguistics and acoustics &#8212; were added to the project team. The resultant\u000a      work, Roger go to yellow three, is a 25 minute-long performance\u000a      within which a number of tests are embedded for listeners to complete as\u000a      it progresses.\u000a    The data from performances of Roger go to yellow three yielded a\u000a      range of new findings about the effects of masking between auditory\u000a      streams, summarised in a conference poster by Heinrich, Cross and Hawkins\u000a      &#8212; `Stream segregation of speech in live concert-hall performances of a\u000a      6-voice choir' &#8212; and a second, more substantial funding application was\u000a      made to the Wellcome Trust for the creation of a work within which further\u000a      tests are embedded to investigate these masking phenomena and the role of\u000a      harmonic and melodic dissonance in determining listeners' focus. The\u000a      application was approved in summer 2012 and the new work, Tales from\u000a        Babel, again with a libretto by Wickham, was premiered at the\u000a      Cheltenham Festival in July 2013 and toured in the UK in autumn 2013.\u000a    The composition of new music is a key element underpinning the research\u000a      produced by the Centre for Contemporary Music Practice (CCMP), the Music\u000a      Research Centre at Brunel University, and Fox's work is complemented by\u000a      similar work being undertaken on new techniques for vocal music by other\u000a      members of the CCMP, particularly Harald Muenz and Jennifer Walshe. Fox's\u000a      former PhD student, Dr Simon Katan, is also involved in related research\u000a      and during the latter stages of the project he built the web-site which\u000a      enables on-line participation in the project (see section 5 for URL).\u000a      Specific support for this project was provided when The Clerks were\u000a      invited to perform an early version of Roger go to yellow three at\u000a      the School of Arts' `Researching the Arts' conference in May 2011 so that\u000a      the data collection method used in gathering listener feedback could be\u000a      tested. Further support was provided through a period of study leave\u000a      (academic year 2012-13) for Fox to enable him to compose the music for Tales\u000a        from Babel.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"12523","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"99237","Name":"Iraq"},{"GeoNamesId":"2215636","Name":"Libya"},{"GeoNamesId":"102358","Name":"Saudi Arabia"},{"GeoNamesId":"286963","Name":"Oman"},{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"},{"GeoNamesId":"272103","Name":"Lebanon"},{"GeoNamesId":"289688","Name":"Qatar"},{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2542007","Name":"Morocco"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"290291","Name":"Bahrain"},{"GeoNamesId":"248816","Name":"Jordan"},{"GeoNamesId":"6254930","Name":"Palestinian Territory"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"285570","Name":"Kuwait"},{"GeoNamesId":"163843","Name":"Syria"},{"GeoNamesId":"357994","Name":"Egypt"},{"GeoNamesId":"366755","Name":"Sudan"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact arises from three types of activity: the establishment of the\u000a      first ever archive of\u000a      contemporary Middle Eastern compositions; advocacy and promotion; and the\u000a      direct curation of\u000a      events.\u000a    Archive.

Houtaf Khoury, Lebanese composer\u000a      after London concert\u000a      November 2012\u000a    ..but about one melancholy fact, all are agreed: serious contemporary\u000a        Egyptian composers are\u000a        now being cruelly marginalised by the media, and starved of the chance\u000a        to hear their works played\u000a        by first-class ensembles. Hence the value of this project, and of the\u000a        parallel projects which Peter\u000a        Wiegold and Brunel Institute's director Oliver Butterworth are staging\u000a        with composers from Jordan,\u000a        Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, and Syria.\u000a    `I feel powerful,' says Professor Mahmoud Bayoumi with a smile. Before\u000a        the revolution, he says,\u000a        the post of dean would have been filled by a government place-man, but\u000a        he has been elected to it\u000a        by his fellow professors. To spread a little musical democracy, he has\u000a        invited flautist Rowland\u000a        Sutherland and composer-conductor Peter Wiegold to lead an improvisation\u000a        class for his students.\u000a        And what transpires there is astonishing, as Bayoumi's teenage wind and\u000a        string players take to\u000a        Wiegold's unfamiliar challenge like ducks to water, improvising as\u000a        though they'd been doing it all\u000a        their lives.\u000a    This is just one facet of why these British musicians, plus four other\u000a        members of the Composers\u000a        Ensemble, are in Cairo. Their tour has been organised by the Brunel\u000a        institute for Contemporary\u000a        Middle Eastern music, supported by the British Council and the fledgling\u000a        British University in Egypt.\u000a    Their primary purpose has been to link up with some young Egyptian\u000a        composers for a concert in\u000a        which avant-garde Egyptian works blending oriental and occidental\u000a        elements are to be given a top-class public airing.\u000a    All this is happening at a pivotal moment in Egyptian history: there is\u000a      now a real danger that the\u000a      army and the Muslim Brotherhood will together take control, leading to new\u000a      constraints on the\u000a      country's musicians. The final part in this inspirational jigsaw comes\u000a      when Wiegold and Sutherland\u000a      meet up with a bunch of traditional musicians at the Makan arts centre,\u000a      and jam with them into the\u000a      small hours.\u000a    As Wiegold observes, the key is neither to attempt `fusion', nor for\u000a        one side to submerge their style\u000a        in the style of the other, but for both to keep a respectful distance:\u000a        `That way the vital spark may\u000a        jump across the divide.'

Three\u000a      questions underpin this research: the efficaciousness and appropriateness\u000a      of particular kinds of\u000a      musical language and method; the maintenance of integrity and\u000a      distinctiveness when working\u000a      collaboratively across borders; and the discovery of new forms of creative\u000a      leadership.\u000a    In the 1980s Wiegold undertook significant periods of research during\u000a      which he studied Gamelan\u000a      in Java, performed with Ravi Shankar's senior pupil Dipak Choudhory and\u000a      worked with African\u000a      musicians. Between 1984 and 1993 he also worked in education, especially\u000a      as Artistic Director of\u000a      the `Performance and Communication Skills Department' at the Guildhall\u000a      School of Music and\u000a      Dance, enabling the examination and dissemination of new forms of\u000a      inclusive creative practice. At\u000a      a time when the predominant focus was on the centricity of the European\u000a      classical canon, Wiegold\u000a      argued strongly for an inclusive approach in which cross-cultural and\u000a      cross-genre collaboration\u000a      would be increasingly significant. In the 1990s Wiegold went on to pioneer\u000a      the training of\u000a      orchestras and ensembles in compositional, improvisational and leadership\u000a      techniques for cross-\u000a      genre and cross-ability exchange, including the London Symphony and Royal\u000a      Philharmonic\u000a      Orchestras, the City of London Sinfonia, the Birmingham Contemporary Music\u000a      Group and the\u000a      Orchestras Canada.\u000a    Wiegold has given many keynotes and conference presentations on creative\u000a      leadership in a cross-\u000a      cultural context, including Cairo (British Council), Dublin, LaSalle\u000a      College Singapore, Toronto\u000a      University, UC Santa Barbara, UC San Diego, Wilfrid Laurier University\u000a      Canada, and Vienna. In\u000a      2013 Wiegold led an ensemble in Singapore and Hong Kong combining\u000a      classical, jazz and\u000a      traditional Chinese musicians. He has also worked with the Sidney Nolan\u000a      Trust and the\u000a      distinguished Chinese pipa player Yang Jing and was a jury member of\u000a      Classical Next Vienna\u000a      2013 where, as part of a meeting of 800 international delegates, he led\u000a      debate on the re-imagining\u000a      of cultural change at the heart of traditional classical music.\u000a    Through this research it became clear that there was an important\u000a      emerging new music community\u000a      in the Middle East, strongly grounded both in the cultures of the region\u000a      and in those cultures'\u000a      interest in western classical music. It was also apparent that this\u000a      community was institutionally\u000a      fragile with little organised national support, few publishers and\u000a      insufficient opportunities for quality\u000a      performances. Wiegold invited Oliver Butterworth, an experienced promoter\u000a      of new Middle Eastern\u000a      composition with an extensive network of contacts across the region, to\u000a      work with him on the\u000a      creation of BICMEM, the first institute in the world to devote itself to\u000a      Middle Eastern contemporary\u000a      music. BICMEM is based both on Wiegold's previous research into\u000a      cross-cultural collaboration and\u000a      on Butterworth's deep knowledge of the music, the composers and the\u000a      complex cultural and\u000a      political structures of the Middle East. Together they work on a range of\u000a      activities: strategic\u000a      support, archiving, performance of important new work and acting as\u000a      `critical friends' on issues\u000a      around new music in the region.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"13781","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research on dance screening has produced resource papers for\u000a      teachers such as the International Association for Dance Medicine and\u000a      Science Teacher's Bulletin.

The screening programme is also now endorsed\u000a      by Dance UK, the national body for independent dance in the UK [1].\u000a      The underpinning research is accessible to approximately 1600 registered\u000a      individual performers and dance companies, such as Boston Ballet and New\u000a      York City Ballet, via the US-based Dancer Wellness Project [2]\u000a      The dance specific fitness tests created by Trinity Laban have been\u000a      purchased by educational organisations such as: Royal Academy of Dance,\u000a      London; Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing, London; governmental\u000a      organisations such as Department of Education and Communities, New South\u000a      Wales, Australia [3] The tests are currently being used to assess\u000a      dancers' physiological capacities in 17 different countries including\u000a      Australia, United States and China. Trinity Laban's research on dance\u000a      screening was a major influencing factor behind the formation of the\u000a      National Institute for Dance Medicine and Science (NIDMS), which was\u000a      launched in April 2012, and comprises a partnership between HEIs\u000a      and non-academic dance and health organisations, and comprises: Trinity\u000a      Laban; Dance UK; Birmingham Royal Ballet's Jerwood Centre for the\u000a      Prevention and Treatment of Dance Injuries; University of Wolverhampton;\u000a      University of Birmingham; Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital. The aim of\u000a      NIDMS is to provide specialist healthcare for dancers in the UK, lead\u000a      collaborative research and further develop educational and continual\u000a      professional development needs for dance practitioners [4]. An\u000a      additional impact has been the creation of a Safe and Effective Dance\u000a        Practice certificate authored by Trinity Laban researchers and\u000a      currently awarded by the examination body Trinity College London [5].\u000a      This qualification has been awarded to hundreds of teachers within the UK\u000a      and overseas, allowing them to gain knowledge and understanding of the\u000a      biomechanics of the body, health and safety, and the nutritional and\u000a      physiological demands of dance.\u000a    The impact of the talent development research is demonstrable in\u000a      terms of the mechanisms whereby young performers are identified, trained\u000a      and supported through UK Government funded dance talent schemes [6].\u000a      In addition to the underpinning research, two resource factsheets\u000a      specifically tailored towards young dancers, musicians and their educators\u000a      were also produced from the research and are accessible through the\u000a      Department for Education's Music and Dance Scheme's Foundations for\u000a        Excellence website [7]. Importantly, the research also led\u000a      directly to the development of the Policy for the Prevention,\u000a        Identification and Action on Disordered Eating now implemented\u000a      across all government funded Centres for Advanced Training in the UK and\u000a      available through the national website [8]. Furthermore, a series\u000a      of Continual Professional Development events were produced by Trinity\u000a      Laban and offered to all Centres for Advanced Training during the period\u000a      of research [9]. In October 2011, over one hundred\u000a      primarily non-academic delegates from the UK and overseas attended the end\u000a      of project symposium, Passion, Pathways and Potential at Trinity\u000a      Laban. The final report which proposes recommendations for dance talent\u000a      identification and development is accessed by all Centres for Advanced\u000a      Training [10] as well as cited on the individual Centre for\u000a      Advanced Training websites such as that of the Northern Ballet School [11].\u000a      Subsequent to this research project, Emma Redding and colleagues have been\u000a      regularly invited to comment in national newspapers regarding the extent\u000a      to which dance talent is innate versus trainable; these appearances have\u000a      raised awareness within the dance sector of the implications of the\u000a      research [12]. There have also been some secondary impacts, namely\u000a      the further commissioning of the Trinity Laban performance science\u000a      research grouping to undertake a further study into dance talent\u000a      development among young people with disabilities, with funding from the\u000a      Department for Education [13].\u000a    The research into musicians' health and well-being has led\u000a      directly to modified training practices within the National Youth\u000a      Orchestra of Great Britain including: instrument specific warm-up and\u000a      conditioning classes; injury monitoring; compulsory workshops for young\u000a      people on topics such as performance anxiety; staff development workshops\u000a      for the support team and movement classes for composers [14]. The\u000a      findings of this study were further utilised as a basis of an application\u000a      to the AHRC to undertake a collaborative four-year study into the topic of\u000a      musician's health, with beneficiaries beyond HE.

Emma Redding, the leader of\u000a      this research grouping, has an established international reputation,\u000a      particularly in the new discipline of dance science, and has a substantial\u000a      peer-reviewed publications profile. She is regularly invited to comment on\u000a      behalf of the field in the national press and is the current President of\u000a      the US-based International Association for Dance Medicine and Science\u000a      (IADMS), a membership organisation with over a thousand members, which is\u000a      now in its twenty-third year. Dance and performance science has emerged as\u000a      a new and rapidly growing area of research and study. The discipline\u000a      developed out of a need to apply scientific rigour to the analysis of\u000a      artist training, with a methodological affinity with some areas of sports\u000a      science. Much idiomatic dance and music teaching has been based upon\u000a      tradition, and the evolution of this new discipline, in which Trinity\u000a      Laban has played a leading role, has allowed for a progression in\u000a      pedagogical practice via the utilization of scientific and evidence-based\u000a      information. Research at Trinity Laban has resulted in the development of\u000a      multi-disciplinary injury and health risk screening for student and\u000a      professional dancers, new methods of measuring and training dancers'\u000a      physiological capabilities and it has instigated new methods of\u000a      identifying and developing talent. This Case Study focused on three\u000a      studies that provide evidence of this work.\u000a    Screening Research and Fitness for Dancers (2005-2013). The aims\u000a      of this study were twofold. Firstly, it contained a scientific\u000a      investigation into appropriate dance screening techniques, which are vital\u000a      in injury prevention. Secondly, it categorized specific fitness training\u000a      regimens for the enhancement of both pedagogic practice and dance\u000a      performance. The screening model developed by Trinity Laban was the first\u000a      multi-disciplinary programme to assess the injury risks of dancers. It\u000a      comprised biomechanical, physiological and psychological assessment and\u000a      was analysed and interpreted by a multidisciplinary team of dance science\u000a      researchers and therapists. Developed using internal prototypes tested on\u000a      Trinity Laban dance students, it led to the first standardised\u000a      dance-specific fitness tests that measure the physiological capabilities\u000a      of dancers using idiomatic dance movement(s). Both these tests and the\u000a      screening model are now the de facto method used by many dance\u000a      schools and dance companies around the world (see section 4).\u000a    Talent Development Research (2008-11). This study was a\u000a      longitudinal three-year project looking at dance talent identification and\u000a      development, and was funded by the Department for Education and The\u000a      Leverhulme Trust. The project involved 800 young dancers who were observed\u000a      at specific intervals through their training at the national Centres for\u000a      Advanced Training (CAT). This project was the first such study that\u000a      examined talented young dancers from an interdisciplinary scientific\u000a      perspective, and aimed to categorize both the key characteristics of dance\u000a      talent, and the interrelationships and potential implications for training\u000a      and education. Principal Investigator, Emma Redding led the investigation\u000a      with Trinity Laban Research Fellow, Sanna Nordin-Bates. In addition to the\u000a      core research team, the project personnel also included a funded PhD\u000a      student, thirty research assistants, several physical therapists and CAT\u000a      Managers. Findings provided evidence for the view that talent is\u000a      multi-dimensional, transitory and that many aspects of talent, which were\u000a      once perceived to be innate, are in fact trainable. The findings also\u000a      supported previous research concerning the prevalence of disordered eating\u000a      in dance, and highlighted the high-risk nature of dance training\u000a      environments for individuals with other predisposing characteristics.\u000a    Music and Dance Science: Optimising Performance Potential (2009-11).\u000a      This two-year research project was an interdisciplinary investigation of\u000a      the physiological, biomechanical and psychological characteristics of both\u000a      training and performance. Emma Redding led the project as Principal\u000a      Investigator; Terry Clark was the project Research Fellow. The project was\u000a      descriptive and longitudinal in design, involving approximately 180 dance\u000a      and music students. Validated and standardised tests were used, and the\u000a      research findings led to the creation of new methods of assessing\u000a      performance determinants.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"13784","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Trinity Laban's performance science research has provided the most robust\u000a      evidence of the impact of dance on the health and wellbeing of young\u000a      people, and hence that dance is a viable alternative to sport in its\u000a      ability to enhance physical fitness. In this section, we trace a\u000a      trajectory of impact that commenced with the underpinning research that\u000a      comprised project reports, research in peer-reviewed academic journals and\u000a      presentations at international conferences. Subsequent to this, and\u000a      crucially, the research was cited by several Governmental sources,\u000a      received national awards, and contributed to the securing of secondary\u000a      impacts, through the subsequent funding provided by several schemes to\u000a      undertake further studies into dance and health, and with similar\u000a      non-academic beneficiaries. Trinity Laban also carried out a wide-ranging\u000a      programme of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) using the\u000a      underpinning research as a resource guide for dance practitioners and\u000a      teachers in community and other settings. The end result has been that the\u000a      underpinning research can claim a key role in a multi-factor process that\u000a      has led to an increased participation in many forms of dance and an\u000a      enhanced public awareness of its health benefits. The combination of a\u000a      number of factors, including no doubt the increase in popularity of\u000a      television dance shows, has made dance more popular than ever. As some\u000a      background to this, a recent survey for the Dance Proms estimated\u000a      that 1 in 5 British adults (21%) currently participate in some form of\u000a      dance and just over 1 in 8 adults (13%) have taken part in a dance class\u000a      in the last five years [1].\u000a    Initial Governmental interest in the underpinning research dates back to\u000a      2006, and subsequent policy shifts aimed at widening participation in\u000a      dance nationally can be traced back to this interest. The then Minister\u000a      for Public Health, Caroline Flint, MP and the Minister for the Arts, David\u000a      Lammy, MP gave keynote addresses at the launch event for the NRG Dance and\u000a      Health project in 2006, endorsing the relevance of the work to improving\u000a      public health and cultural education policy. Margaret Hillier, MP for\u000a      Hackney South and Shoreditch, referenced Trinity Laban's research in the\u000a      introduction of a House of Commons debate on teacher qualifications [2].\u000a      Further Governmental citations of the underpinning research included Tony\u000a      Hall, then Chief Executive of The Royal Opera House, who was commissioned\u000a      in 2006 to author The Dance Review: A Report to Government on Dance\u000a        Education and Youth Dance in England [3]. In 2007, David\u000a      Lammy launched the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Dance\u000a      Forum Group and extended an invitation during that year to Trinity Laban's\u000a      performance science researchers to present findings. The NRG Dance for\u000a      Health underpinning research also received a certificate of commendation\u000a      through the Royal Society of Public Health Awards in 2010 and was\u000a      shortlisted for the Times Higher Award for Excellence and Innovation\u000a        in the Arts in 2007. Subsequent to the initial studies, Emma\u000a      Redding and colleagues have been regularly invited to comment in the\u000a      media, including for: BBC Radio London; in national newspapers; The\u000a      Dancing Times; Dance Dynamic; Dance Australia; Dance UK News [4].\u000a    In terms of demonstrable impacts during the REF assessment period, an\u000a      important step was the publication in 2008 of the Government Response to\u000a      the Tony Hall review. Hall had recommended the development of a strategy,\u000a      in partnership with key agencies, to enable dancers to become teachers,\u000a      via CPD at all levels, and the setting-up of nationally agreed\u000a      qualifications. In response, the government again referenced Trinity\u000a      Laban's activities and underpinning research as a key factor in the\u000a      resulting formation of several national agencies that answered to this\u000a      recommendation, such as Youth Dance England. This is reinforced by\u000a      evidence from its Director, Linda Jasper [5]. Secondary impacts on\u000a      other researchers working in a community arts context was that public\u000a      awareness generated from this first study led directly to the securing of\u000a      funding for the two subsequent projects aimed at non-academic\u000a      beneficiaries: the VitaliSE Step Change and the Go Dance\u000a        Report which was commissioned by a consortium of dance organisations\u000a      and providers throughout the Eastern region of England [6]. The\u000a      underpinning research was also crucial evidence that led to the award of\u000a      an Arts Council England grant to the London Thames Gateway Dance\u000a      Partnership Organisations (2008-2010), and including Trinity Laban,\u000a      entitled `Healthy Communities', which resulted in three large scale\u000a      community arts intervention projects, including with the elderly, that\u000a      aimed at the enhancement of health and wellbeing in several London\u000a      boroughs, including Hackney, Bexley, Lewisham and Tower Hamlets. The\u000a      underpinning research has also influenced policy for a large private\u000a      health provider, via a citation in a BUPA Health Report of 2011 [7].\u000a      This research has also led directly to an increased awareness of the\u000a      health benefits of dance through a programme of CPD led by Trinity Laban's\u000a      Learning and Participation staff, which has included briefings and\u000a      presentations aimed at dance artists, teachers and young people at: NESTA\u000a      Dance Science Day (2011); NDTA conference (2011), the Youth Dance England\u000a      residential U Dance event (2011); Pulse project (Lewisham\u000a      Borough Council funded dance training days for teachers 2013).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Trinity Laban's research into the effect of dance on health and wellbeing\u000a      has generated interest and citation at UK Government level, enhanced the\u000a      public consciousness of the benefits of dance and has had secondary\u000a      impacts in terms of providing a model for other studies. It has enhanced\u000a      the professional practice of dance artists and teachers beyond the\u000a      academy. Participation in dance is now perceived as a viable method of\u000a      enhancing physical and psychological health, in part due to Trinity\u000a      Laban's research in this area.

Dance can also be a vital\u000a      way of engaging young people, especially girls, into physical activity.\u000a      Trinity Laban is known internationally for its research in dance and\u000a      performance science, and a significant historical strand of this research\u000a      has been conducted in the relationship between arts participation and\u000a      health and wellbeing. Besides academic avenues of dissemination, Trinity\u000a      Laban's research has raised awareness of the value of dance as a means of\u000a      improving physical and psychological health. Trinity Laban has led five\u000a      research projects to investigate the impact of creative and contemporary\u000a      dance on specific areas of physical fitness and psychological wellbeing\u000a      among secondary school aged young people. All led by Emma Redding, these\u000a      projects were formed through groups of Trinity Laban performance science\u000a      researchers, post-docs, and PhD students. Through a series of experimental\u000a      studies, 715 young people have participated in creative and contemporary\u000a      dance programmes and were measured before and after the dance\u000a      intervention, as well as during periods of follow-up.\u000a    The first study, the NRG Dance and Health Project was undertaken\u000a      in 2005\/6 in collaboration with Hampshire Dance (a regional dance\u000a      organisation), and was funded by the Joint Investment Fund for the Arts [R1].\u000a      The study took place in the SHIPS region of the county. The effect of\u000a      creative dance on specific areas of physical fitness and psychological\u000a      wellbeing of 11-14 year old school children was measured. Findings\u000a      demonstrated that creative dance has an overall positive impact on both\u000a      these measures, and in both male and female participants.\u000a    The second study, which took place in 2009, was funded by the North\u000a        Kent Local Authorities Arts Partnership (NKLAAP), and was entitled dance\u000a          4 your life [R2] The study examined the physical and\u000a      psychological effect of dance on young women aged 14 yrs and was situated\u000a      in secondary schools across the North Kent region. Findings showed a\u000a      statistically significant improvement in levels of self-esteem among\u000a      students who had taken part in dance classes and clear benefits of dance\u000a      on physical health, with statistically significant improvements in aerobic\u000a      capacity and upper body strength among participants. The study\u000a      demonstrated that teenage girls are receptive and positive towards dance\u000a      as a physical activity, even at an age when statistics show many begin to\u000a      drop out of physical activities.\u000a    The third research study was entitled NRG2 Dance and Health Project,\u000a      and took place in 2010 [R3]. This study extended previous research\u000a      undertaken by Trinity Laban in that it explored the physical and\u000a      psychological impact of creative dance comparatively versus more\u000a      traditional school-based physical education. The study took place amongst\u000a      a cohort of young people in under-resourced areas of West Sussex, looking\u000a      specifically at gender differences. The physical areas assessed were\u000a      aerobic capacity, flexibility, and upper body strength. In terms of\u000a      psychological wellbeing, attitudes towards both dance and general physical\u000a      activity were examined. Findings showed that the physical and\u000a      psychological wellbeing of the girls in both comparative groups improved\u000a      after the intervention, while no change was found in the boys in either\u000a      group. Girls who participated in the dance classes greatly improved their\u000a      aerobic capacity and flexibility and also felt significantly more\u000a      competent and intersubjectively empathetic to their peers. The\u000a      significance of all of these studies is that they utilised a scientific\u000a      methodology to measure the benefits of dance making on certain cohorts,\u000a      and as such were the first of their kind in the field.\u000a    All three studies studied young people, but the methodology proved\u000a      readily transferable and subsequently led to commissioning by the Thames\u000a        Gateway Dance Partnerships in order to undertake a fourth study of\u000a      the effects of dance on the health and well-being of older adults [R4].\u000a      Similarly, the fifth and final study, entitled Changing Perceptions,\u000a      examined the provision and progression routes for young disabled dancers,\u000a      and was funded through Dance 4 by the Department for Education\u000a        [R5]. The project addressed various calls from Government for a\u000a      clearer signposting of dance provision and opportunities for young people\u000a      with disabilities. A significant outcome of the research was the most\u000a      comprehensive directory of provision across the UK, which is now\u000a      accessible online. The two-year project culminated in a Continuing\u000a      Professional Development programme launched in March 2013.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"13829","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Tourism in Liverpool:\u000d\u000a      The Beatles Story heritage tourist attraction uses the Bibliography as an\u000d\u000a      important staff reference\u000d\u000a      tool for historiographical accuracy concerning exhibitions; several\u000d\u000a      independent tour guides in\u000d\u000a      Liverpool use the work as a reference for veracity.

This research has created an important\u000d\u000a      publication in its own right [1]\u000d\u000a      and has also further enhanced on-going research into popular music\u000d\u000a      redaction historiography,\u000d\u000a      spurring on a relatively new and popular discourse. Beatles scholar\u000d\u000a      Professor Ian Inglis (University\u000d\u000a      of Northumbria) has stated that the bibliography: \"is a long overdue and\u000d\u000a      welcome guide to the\u000d\u000a      flourishing &#8212; sometimes overwhelming &#8212; body of literature that continues\u000d\u000a      to surround the Beatles.\u000d\u000a      [...] Students and scholars of the group and its music will benefit hugely\u000d\u000a      from the completion of\u000d\u000a      Brocken and Davis's comprehensive project to present a logical and\u000d\u000a      coherent catalogue of relevant\u000d\u000a      texts. The annotations are objective and informative, the cross-references\u000d\u000a      helpful, and the\u000d\u000a      bibliography itself easy to use. [...] The Beatles Bibliography: A New\u000d\u000a        Guide to the Literature will\u000d\u000a      allow contemporary scholars and future historians to approach that\u000d\u000a      landscape with confidence.\" Dr\u000d\u000a      Simon Warner (Leeds University) states \"This is going to be a very useful\u000d\u000a      supporting text to\u000d\u000a      Beatles Studies around the world. A great effort.\" Celebrated researcher\u000d\u000a      (for Albert Goldman),\u000d\u000a      novelist and Merseybeat Historian Ron Ellis states: \"The Beatles were the\u000d\u000a      catalyst to the social\u000d\u000a      revolution of the 1960's and, as such, will be studied for generations to\u000d\u000a      come as Shakespeare and\u000d\u000a      the Brontes are today. This book by Michael Brocken and Melissa Davis is\u000d\u000a      the signpost that every\u000d\u000a      student, or indeed fan, of the group and Merseybeat has been waiting for.\u000d\u000a      It will guide them around\u000d\u000a      the minefield of information that is available, all of which has been\u000d\u000a      evaluated by the authors. With\u000d\u000a      regular supplements promised to keep abreast of the latest publications, The\u000d\u000a        Beatles Bibliography:\u000d\u000a        A New Guide to the Literature will be an indispensible research tool\u000d\u000a      to guide readers through the\u000d\u000a      thousands of articles, books and journals available worldwide.\"\u000d\u000a      Liverpool's cultural ambassador\u000d\u000a      Joe Flannery also endorses the text: \"There is so much rumour and\u000d\u000a      conjecture about the Beatles,\u000d\u000a      now, the whole affair seems to me to be turning into a legend &#8212; in some\u000d\u000a      cases I don't recognise\u000d\u000a      myself anymore! This annotated bibliography will show how legends develop\u000d\u000a      and hopefully will\u000d\u000a      introduce the researcher to the methods we need to bring back history.\" Dr\u000d\u000a      Ron Moy (Liverpool\u000d\u000a      John Moores University) welcomed the text, stating \"at last we now have a\u000d\u000a      reference text that can\u000d\u000a      actually be used by all. This will be a great addition to the popular\u000d\u000a      music texts\". Renowned\u000d\u000a      publisher, academic, and writer Liz Thomson states that the work is: \"A\u000d\u000a      real labour of love and a\u000d\u000a      monumental piece of research.\"\u000d\u000a    Nature of the research insights which relate to the impact claimed in\u000d\u000a        the case study:\u000d\u000a      Brocken's developing research, which consisted of direct close reading,\u000d\u000a      literary criticism, and\u000d\u000a      extensive bibliographical compilation, was entirely unique, as before this\u000d\u000a      research, an annotated\u000d\u000a      bibliography did not exist. This unique annotated bibliography was\u000d\u000a      therefore compiled not only with\u000d\u000a      the historian's demand for accuracy, but also because there existed, a\u000d\u000a      need for such a work within\u000d\u000a      both the academic discipline of popular music studies and the broader\u000d\u000a      fan-based contexts of\u000d\u000a      Beatles historiography. The approach naturally revealed that texts\u000d\u000a      concerning the group held\u000d\u000a      certain historical and contextual significance in their own right (making\u000d\u000a      texts unique or generic,\u000d\u000a      desirable or highly collectable &#8212; or not as the case may be). Each\u000d\u000a      annotation continues to place\u000d\u000a      the production of all Beatles literature within social, political, and\u000d\u000a      economic frames, each of which\u000d\u000a      can provide important insights into authorial purpose and\/or further\u000d\u000a      contextual research.\u000d\u000a    This redaction-based methodology was first presented to others via\u000d\u000a      previous publications such as\u000d\u000a      Other Voices (2010) [2] and [3] `Was It Really Like That? `Rock\u000d\u000a      Island Line' and the instabilities of\u000d\u000a      causational popular music histories' (2006). A conference paper given at\u000d\u000a      University of Liverpool\u000d\u000a      (2007) [4] and visiting lectures such as in 2009 at University of\u000d\u000a      Wolverhampton Musicology\u000d\u000a      Research Seminars [5] first introduced the concept of the need for an\u000d\u000a      annotated Beatles\u000d\u000a      bibliography. Several broadcasts with BBC Radio Merseyside between 2009\u000d\u000a      and 2012 further\u000d\u000a      disseminated the concepts. Such papers and presentations were of vital\u000d\u000a      importance as a means to\u000d\u000a      sustain and question the on-going research, broaden the public impact of\u000d\u000a      the text, and further\u000d\u000a      refine Brocken's Beatles literary knowledge of the past 20 years.\u000d\u000a    A supplement to The Beatles Bibliography will be published in\u000d\u000a      both paper and ebook format during\u000d\u000a      2013\/14. The first run of the bibliography has now sold-out in the US and\u000d\u000a      the editorial board is also\u000d\u000a      considering new technologies in the dissemination of the work. Further\u000d\u000a      research by Dr Brocken\u000d\u000a      has been integrated into the forthcoming bibliography supplement, which\u000d\u000a      includes an extended\u000d\u000a      essay based upon a colloquium paper delivered at the Open University\u000d\u000a      London (2013), and a case\u000d\u000a      study written with the Education Officer at The Beatles Story [6].\u000d\u000a      Brocken's research is to be further\u000d\u000a      expanded into an ethnographic project and a music tourism conference at\u000d\u000a      The Beatles Story\u000d\u000a      (2014) and his new work Beatles People, Beatles Places (concerning\u000d\u000a      the popular music heritage\u000d\u000a      industry in Liverpool) is to be published by Ashgate in 2014.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"13959","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The results of Burrows's research have been brought to musical performers\u000d\u000a      and to the wider public through his influence on performances and through\u000d\u000a      direct contact with a range of audiences.\u000d\u000a    Impact on musical practice and the programmes of cultural institutions\u000d\u000a    The principal agent for this has been through published music editions\u000d\u000a      which, in addition to their scholarly quality based on a thorough\u000d\u000a      re-examination of the sources, present the scores in a manner that\u000d\u000a      provides practical texts for modern performers. Older editions of Handel's\u000d\u000a      major works either gave all the variant movements in an unsorted manner or\u000d\u000a      arranged movements in a combination that was only relevant to the\u000d\u000a      circumstances of a particular modern revival.\u000d\u000a    Burrows's volumes of two Handel operas, Imeneo (HHA II\/40,\u000d\u000a      2002) and Ariodante (HHA II\/32, 2007), in the new collected\u000d\u000a      music edition (Hallische H&#228;ndel-Ausgabe [HHA], published by\u000d\u000a      B&#228;renreiter) established a model for presenting the music according\u000d\u000a      to Handel's successive `performing versions'. This model has been followed\u000d\u000a      by editors of subsequent volumes of the HHA, including Ottone\u000d\u000a      (2008), Alcina (2009), Samson (2011) and Arianna in\u000d\u000a        Creta (2012).\u000d\u000a    Editions in the Novello series present authoritative musical texts, with\u000d\u000a      vocal scores as the first point of contact, in which the Prefaces include\u000d\u000a      didactic sections directly addressed to performers. These include five\u000d\u000a      works, including Te Deum in A major and Let God Arise HWV\u000d\u000a      256b (Novello, 2011), to which performers had previously had no access\u000d\u000a      except through the scores of the nineteenth-century collected edition,\u000d\u000a      which follow outdated conventions (e.g. in the clefs for the vocal parts).\u000d\u000a    Burrows's editions of Handel's operas have been taken up by festivals and\u000d\u000a      opera companies throughout the world; the editions of the oratorios and\u000d\u000a      church music have a broader dissemination through amateur as well as\u000d\u000a      professional performing groups. The 2008 Halle H&#228;ndelfestpiele\u000d\u000a      programme included three major works in Burrows's editions. In the Handel\u000d\u000a      anniversary year 2009, Belshazzar saw two performances in the UK,\u000d\u000a      one in Denmark, three in the USA, two concert performances in France and\u000d\u000a      four staged performances, five concert performances in Germany and eight\u000d\u000a      staged performances (including a production by the Berlin Staatsoper).\u000d\u000a    Since 2008 Burrows's edition of Imeneo has seen performances by\u000d\u000a      McGill Baroque (Montreal, 2011) and The Academy of Ancient Music (London,\u000d\u000a      2013); that for Ariodante has been performed in Vienna (2008),\u000d\u000a      Helsinki (2009), Beaune (2009), Tokyo (2009), London, Malvern, Exeter,\u000d\u000a      Snape and Cambridge (English Touring Opera, 2009), Karlsruhe (2010),\u000d\u000a      Princeton (2010), Ulm (2012) and Basel (2012). Burrows's editions of Imeneo\u000d\u000a      and L'Allegro were performed as the major works in the 2013 London\u000d\u000a      Handel Festival, and since 2010 Burrows has acted as a consultant for the\u000d\u000a      planning of the Festival programmes and performances.\u000d\u000a    Impact on public awareness and enjoyment of Handel's music\u000d\u000a    The main impact has been on audiences who have the opportunity to hear\u000d\u000a      Handel's music in (to them) new ways. Impact is also achieved through\u000d\u000a      media contributions, and public talks associated with concerts and opera\u000d\u000a      productions. Since 2004 Burrows has participated in 11 radio programmes\u000d\u000a      (five of them for BBC Radio 4) and two TV programmes (including an\u000d\u000a      extended sequence on Handel's Water Music for The One Show,\u000d\u000a      which has been broadcast at least twice). He also made a major\u000d\u000a      contribution to Baroque Star, which was broadcast on principal TV\u000d\u000a      networks in France and Germany as a one hour programme and subsequently\u000d\u000a      released in a longer version as a DVD from Arthaus Musik.\u000d\u000a    Pre-performance talks and similar events have been associated with\u000d\u000a      high-profile organisations (Royal Opera House, English National Opera, BBC\u000d\u000a      Proms, English Touring Opera, The Sixteen), and with provincial amateur\u000d\u000a      societies in (for example) Derby, Portsmouth, York and Wantage. In\u000d\u000a      addition to being joint curator of the exhibition `Mr Handel's Friends' at\u000d\u000a      the Handel House Museum in 2009, Burrows has participated in four other\u000d\u000a      events there aimed at a non-specialist public.\u000d\u000a    Publications that have had an impact beyond the scholarly community\u000d\u000a      include Burrows's biography of Handel in the series `Master\u000d\u000a      Musicians', and a group of contributions to the Handel anniversary year in\u000d\u000a      2009: the facsimile editions of Handel's Will (Burrows 2009a) and of Messiah\u000d\u000a      (Burrows 2009b). The Japanese edition of The Cambridge Companion to\u000d\u000a        Handel (Burrows 1997, Japanese edition 2009) was awarded `Book of\u000d\u000a      the Year' by the 22nd Music Pen Club Awards, Classical Music Division,\u000d\u000a      Japan.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Extensive research conducted by Donald Burrows on the music and biography\u000d\u000a      of Handel has had a significant impact on the way Handel's music is\u000d\u000a      performed and heard.

In addition, the research programme has\u000d\u000a      resulted in publications that provide essential resources for future\u000d\u000a      studies of Handel and his music that will work though to performers and\u000d\u000a      the general public: A Catalogue of Handel's Musical Autographs\u000d\u000a      (Burrows and Ronish 1994) has provided the standard reference source for\u000d\u000a      future work on Handel's musical scores, and George Frideric Handel:\u000d\u000a        Collected Documents (Burrows, Coffey, Greenacombe and Hicks, 2013&#8212;,\u000d\u000a      five volumes) will have a similar role for documentary material.\u000d\u000a    The breadth of reference that is inherent in the research programme has\u000d\u000a      provided the authority for substantial literary publications, such as the\u000d\u000a      biography of Handel in the `Master Musicians' series (Burrows 1994, 2nd\u000d\u000a      edition 2012) and The Cambridge Companion to Handel (Burrows\u000d\u000a      1997), which have reached a wider readership than the specialised\u000d\u000a      materials of scholarly articles and book chapters. Similarly, the\u000d\u000a      accumulated research experience has provided the basis for participation\u000d\u000a      in public events such as pre-performance talks, exhibitions and\u000d\u000a      broadcasts.\u000d\u000a    Evidence for the quality of the underpinning research can be found in the\u000d\u000a      outputs that have appeared in major refereed publications, in the presence\u000d\u000a      of five publications among the open-shelf reference books at The British\u000d\u000a      Library, and in the support that the programme has received from public\u000d\u000a      research grants, all rigorously refereed at the point of application and\u000d\u000a      conclusion.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14049","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The beneficiaries of Ramsay Burt's research, outside of academia, are\u000a      international communities of dancers, choreographers, dance companies,\u000a      teachers, dance programmers and administrators, and those involved in\u000a      funding and cultural policies, as well as those who have a general\u000a      interest in dance and regularly attend dance performances and\u000a      dance-related events. Through enabling a deeper and more informed\u000a      historical understanding of the context of progressive contemporary dance\u000a      works, this research has benefited these communities within the cultural\u000a      industries and helped facilitate the cultural enrichment that they enable.\u000a      Furthermore, as a result of invitations to talk about dance history both\u000a      for broadcasts and at public lectures during dance and performance\u000a      festivals, this research has enabled the promotion of cultural debate. His\u000a      researches into African American dance in the 1920s and 30s (Burt 1998,\u000a      2004) led to his being interviewed for an episode about Josephine Baker of\u000a      the BBC World Service television series Extraordinary Women (2011-12),\u000a      while his research into the reception in London of performances of\u000a      Nijinsky's controversial ballet Le Sacre du printemps (Burt 2011)\u000a      led to an invitation to participate in the Radio 3 production Twenty\u000a        Minutes (Stravinsky and the King's Horse) broadcast during an\u000a      interval of the Promenade Concerts 19 July 2011, an extract from which was\u000a      subsequent included in Radio 4 Pick of the Week 24 July and the\u000a      whole programme broadcast again in 2012. This research also led to\u000a      invitations to talk during a dance festival in Bruges in May 2013 on the\u000a      centenary of the ballet. The BBC have sold the rights to the Extraordinary\u000a      Women series to World Media Rights who sell the series on to the public.\u000a    Members of the dance profession, particularly those based in continental\u000a      Europe, have read Burt's work (2006 in particular), and interest in it has\u000a      led to invitations to take part in dance platforms and major international\u000a      dance festivals and in training events for professional dancers, generally\u000a      to audiences of between 30 and 60 people, but occasionally over 100. These\u000a      audiences have included members of the general public and young dancers.\u000a      For the Dance Umbrella 2010 festival, he was invited to contribute\u000a      to a panel of choreographers showing work in the festival which led to a\u000a      series of events co-curated by Ramsay Burt and choreographer Jonathan\u000a      Burrows in 2012 at Siobhan Davies Studios, Sadler's Wells Theatre, and\u000a      Chisenhale Dance Space. These were attended by young and older generations\u000a      of dance artists, and podcasts of them are available on the website of the\u000a      Siobhan Davies Studios. A slide show developed from these was installed at\u000a      the 2012 Dance Umbrella Festival. His theoretical discussions of the\u000a      relation between aesthetics and ethics in dance (Burt 2006, 2009) led to\u000a      an invitation in April 2011 to contribute to a week-long event organised\u000a      by Tanzquartier in Vienna, Scores No 3: Uneasy Going, which\u000a      focused on the theme of responsibility. His published research on the\u000a      topic of reenactments led to an invitation to present a paper in Ljubljana\u000a      during Soking Gala Sov, 21-28th October 2009. This was a festival\u000a      of reenactments and reconstructions curated by the Slovenian artists'\u000a      agency Maska. He talked to Norwegian dance artists during the Oktoberdans\u000a      festival organised by the Bit-Teatergarasjen in Bergen, and was twice\u000a      invited to present papers during the Baltic Dance Conference as part of\u000a      the 2010 and 2012 Gdansk Dance Festival. He contributed there to a round\u000a      table discussion that brought together speakers, dancers, promoters and\u000a      members of the Polish Ministry of Culture who wanted to know about the\u000a      relation between contemporary dance in Poland and elsewhere in Europe.\u000a      This led to an invitation to write an introduction to a forthcoming book\u000a      published by the Ministry.\u000a    Dance artists and those involved in the dance sector attending these\u000a      events have benefited from a more informed knowledge and appreciation of\u000a      the histories and genealogies in which their work is situated, and a\u000a      better understanding of the breadth and diversity of their practices\u000a      because of the way this has informed the context in which dancers are\u000a      currently working. Those who make decisions about cultural policies within\u000a      the dance sector have found it useful to have a better understanding of\u000a      the breadth and diversity of the practices within contemporary dance, all\u000a      of this contributing to greater cultural enrichment. As part of his\u000a      AHRC-funded research project British Dance and the African Diaspora Ramsay\u000a      Burt and Christy Adair have been running events aimed at British-based\u000a      dancers who are black that have opened up discussions about the problems\u000a      in terminology (surrounding the term `Black Dance') and to meetings\u000a      initiated by Burt and Adair between dancers, Arts Council representatives,\u000a      producers and the chair of ADAD (the national organisation supporting\u000a      black dancers) to discuss strategies for developing the sector.\u000a    As one of the first scholars to discuss the phenomenon of re-enactments\u000a      by contemporary dancers of historical avant-garde works, through these\u000a      dialogues and collaborations, Burt has made a significant impact on the\u000a      way such work is developing. With an AHRC (peer reviewed) grant from the\u000a      Changing Places scheme, he was attached to the Cholmondeleys dance company\u000a      working with choreographer Lea Anderson with whom Burt worked (with AHRC\u000a      support) during the research period for her 2005 work Double Take.\u000a      The Brussels-based choreographer Fabi&#225;n Barba invited Burt to collaborate\u000a      with him on his (October 2011) new solo show A Personal Yet Collective\u000a        History. This included presenting a workshop and talks in 2011\u000a      during the Workspace Brussels platform, the Amperdans Festival at Monty\u000a      Theatre, Antwerp, and during a residency at Pact Zolverein arts centre in\u000a      Essen. Another dancer who has engaged in extended dialogues with Burt\u000a      during research for dance pieces on history and memory, or reenactments is\u000a      Karen Lambaek with whom he made a joint presentation during the\u000a      Tanzwerkstatt Europa festival in Munich August 2012, and participated in\u000a      an artist's residency at WP Zimmer Antwerp in March 2013. A video\u000a      interview with Burt evaluating the social and political significance of Tanz\u000a        Aller, Ligna's re-invention of early twentieth century German\u000a      movement choirs has been made and put on line by its commissioners,\u000a      Tanzfonds.de, a project funded by the German Ministry of Culture as part\u000a      of Tanzplan Deutschland.\u000a    In summary, Ramsay Burt's work on dance and the avant-garde (1995, 1998,\u000a      2006) has impacted on the international community of dance artists,\u000a      administrators and policy makers through his talks and participation\u000a      during panel discussions at festivals and related events in the UK and\u000a      Europe. His work on issues concerning dance and `race' (1998, 2004) has\u000a      had similar impacts on British-based dancers who are black and those in\u000a      the UK involved in this sector. Lastly, through events organised as part\u000a      of the British Dance and the African Diaspora project, Burt's work on\u000a      history, memory, and re-enactment (2006, 2009) has been important for\u000a      dance artists working in this area and has impacted on their creative\u000a      processes.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Ramsay Burt's research into histories of avant-garde and experimental\u000a      dance performances during the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries has\u000a      facilitated cultural enrichment through its impact on choreographers,\u000a      dancers, dance audiences, administrators and policy makers. His\u000a      publications have advanced understanding both of the general public and\u000a      members of the dance industry into the ways in which dance is affected by\u000a      and influenced socially and historically specific concerns or anxieties\u000a      about changing notions of embodiment.

Looking\u000a      both at early modern dance and ballet (1995, 1998, 2004, 2011) and more\u000a      recently at so-called postmodern (2006) and conceptual dance (2009), he\u000a      has identified, within contemporary reception of some of the most\u000a      challenging dance works, evidence of socially and historically specific\u000a      concerns or anxieties about the changing nature of corporealities. This\u000a      has been supported by grants from the British Academy (2005, 2008). Such\u000a      dance works, he has shown, can challenge normative ideologies &#8212; of gender,\u000a      `race', and other components of identities (1995, 1998) &#8212; as the body\u000a      becomes a site of resistance against ideologies and of the persistence of\u000a      alternative modes of thinking, feeling and being. This research as a whole\u000a      has pioneered methodologies for contextualising and analysing the social\u000a      and political meanings of theatre dance.\u000a    Burt's work on dance and masculinity (1995, 2nd edn. 2007) is recognised\u000a      as the standard work on the subject. His work on modernism in African\u000a      American dance of the first half of the twentieth century has also been\u000a      influential because of its pioneering application of ideas from critical\u000a      race theory to dance studies. His research into Katherine Dunham,\u000a      including interviews with her, was supported by AHRC funding (2002). He\u000a      has also published research applying post-colonial theory to contemporary\u000a      choreography from the last twenty years and is currently engaged in an\u000a      AHRC funded research project on British Dance and the African Diaspora.\u000a      With AHRC funding in 2003, he participated in Lea Anderson's re-invention\u000a      with female dancers of choreography created for male dancers around 1990.\u000a      He was one of the first scholars to discuss the phenomenon of\u000a      re-enactments by contemporary dancers of historical avant-garde works and,\u000a      through collaborations with dance artists, has had a significant impact on\u000a      the way such work developed. He has also published research on\u000a      re-enactment, reconstruction and reinvention by dance artists and on\u000a      related discussions about the problematic of canonical accounts of dance\u000a      history.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14713","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The initial impetus for the project, and a requirement governed by the\u000d\u000a      funding criteria of HEIF, was to utilize an existing knowledge-base by\u000d\u000a      interacting with the wider world to result in economic and social benefit\u000d\u000a      to the UK. Identifying the Conservatoire Historical Instrument Collection\u000d\u000a      and Music Technology Department as such knowledge-bases and assets had\u000d\u000a      three major advantages: (i) following on from the AHRC cataloguing\u000d\u000a      project, the Collection was still relatively unknown, and it was\u000d\u000a      considered to be of great benefit to the Collection and to the organology\u000d\u000a      community to use it as the focus of the HEIF project; (ii) during the\u000d\u000a      initial research phase of the HEIF application, a significant need was\u000d\u000a      identified for a collection of sampled historical musical instruments.\u000d\u000a      Until recently, musical instrument sample libraries were restricted to\u000d\u000a      modern classical instruments (e.g. Vienna\u000d\u000a        Symphonic Library, established 2005,). The growth of the market has\u000d\u000a      been primarily led by end-users in the music production, home music-making\u000d\u000a      and media industries demanding higher- quality and more realistic samples\u000d\u000a      of acoustic musical instruments. Demand from this sector has also led to\u000d\u000a      less usual instruments being sampled and produced for commercial markets\u000d\u000a      (e.g. Soniccouture's Rare\u000a        and Experimental collections, including libraries of Glass\u000d\u000a      Harmonica, Extended Piano and Extended Guitar; (iii) sampled historical\u000d\u000a      instruments occupy a different position from that of modern classical\u000d\u000a      samples and less usual samples, in that they appeal not only to those\u000d\u000a      wanting to explore music using `new' sounds, but also to those engaged in\u000d\u000a      the study of historical instruments, period instrument performance and\u000d\u000a      organology. During the initial phase of the HEIF project, extensive\u000d\u000a      research was undertaken into the potential users of a commercial sample\u000d\u000a      library of this kind. Questionnaires answered by UK-based composers and\u000d\u000a      music technologists indicated that 50% used sample libraries in their\u000d\u000a      work, and 81% were interested in sample libraries containing baroque and\u000d\u000a      renaissance instruments. Among the first sample libraries dedicated to\u000d\u000a      historical instruments were those produced by Organ\u000a        Art, a German company that samples historic organs in continental\u000d\u000a      Europe.\u000d\u000a    In recent years a number of sample libraries dedicated to historical\u000d\u000a      keyboard instruments have been produced, giving a greater choice to the\u000d\u000a      market. However, The Conservatoire Collection remains the only\u000d\u000a      product to contain samples of other historical instruments: Theorbo,\u000d\u000a      English Theorbo, Baroque Guitar, Psaltery, Renaissance Side Drums, Nakers\u000d\u000a      and Hurdy Gurdy. The sample-rate used in the recordings - 96kHz\/24bit,\u000d\u000a      compared to standard CD 44.1kHz\/16bit - represents a significant\u000d\u000a      improvement over many of the competing sample libraries (e.g. Spitfire\u000a        Audio, or Precision\u000d\u000a        Sound). A noteworthy feature of The Conservatoire Collection\u000d\u000a      is its use of multiple `round robin'. During the recording process,\u000d\u000a      multiple recordings are made of the same note using the same parameters\u000d\u000a      (velocity, timbre, etc.), which are then selected at random by the sample\u000d\u000a      player so that the playback does not sound computer-generated.\u000d\u000a    Since commercial release, The Conservatoire Collection has gained\u000d\u000a      significant traction within the music industry, achieving a direct\u000d\u000a      artistic impact, notably with producers of commercial and media- driven\u000d\u000a      music. It is recognized as the best example of these particular\u000d\u000a      instruments available at present. The library, now in general use with\u000d\u000a      many music producers, has been extremely favourably reviewed (4.5\/5) in\u000d\u000a      trade journal Sound on Sound (December 2011), the writer (himself\u000d\u000a      a composer) stating that the 17th- and 18th-century harpsichords are `both\u000d\u000a      beautifully deeply sampled and sounding handsome, well-balanced and\u000d\u000a      tonally satisfying. It would be worth buying the collection for these fine\u000d\u000a      instruments alone ... I also loved the exquisitely pure, delicate plucked\u000d\u000a      twang of the Psaltery, an old English zither played with quills.' A\u000d\u000a      high-profile Australian film score composer, whose credits include Strictly\u000a        Ballroom (1992), Sliding Doors (1998), Elizabeth\u000d\u000a      (1998), Peaches (2004), Australia (2008), and Sanctum\u000d\u000a      (2011), has stated (21 November 2011): `I like the fact that Soniccouture\u000d\u000a      products provide alternative, off beat, non-standard instruments and\u000d\u000a      brilliant reconstructions of classic rare instruments, like ... the\u000d\u000a      Conservatoire library, which is worth having just for the stunning\u000d\u000a      Harpsichords alone, as well as the Baroque Guitar and the Hurdy Gurdy, an\u000d\u000a      instrument I have wanted to have on tap in a sample library, but couldn't\u000d\u000a      find one until now.' A music producer whose credits include Madonna,\u000d\u000a      Bj&#246;rk, Britney Spears and Imogen Heap featured the French Harpsichord\u000d\u000a      library from the Collection on the track `Apple Kisses' from Alison\u000d\u000a      Moyet's album The Minutes (2013), and has commented (17 May 2013):\u000d\u000a      `I studied the harpsichord before I became a pop producer. I've purchased\u000d\u000a      other harpsichord libraries ... [but] The thing is, I really respect James\u000d\u000a      and Dan's work [at Soniccouture]. So I knew this would be a great\u000d\u000a      library.... It's really good. I have [other] sample sets ... The only\u000d\u000a      problem is, they're all presented at their original pitch standard and\u000d\u000a      temperament. This causes a lot of problems.' Again, an American music\u000d\u000a      producer, composer and sound designer at Red Noise, La Grange, Illinois\u000d\u000a      has used the Conservatoire Collection in his music for large-scale outdoor\u000d\u000a      spectacles. He has commented: `I just wanted to write to let you know that\u000d\u000a      the Conservatoire Collection has brought significant benefit for me in my\u000d\u000a      work as a music producer\/composer and sound designer. My favourite thing\u000d\u000a      about this collection is quite simply the range of instruments, and the\u000d\u000a      fact that the sample banks were obviously put together by people who knew\u000d\u000a      the instruments well, and could anticipate how they would be used in a\u000d\u000a      composition. I also appreciate the fact that the sound quality is perfect\u000d\u000a      for an intimate arrangement, which these instruments lend themselves to.\u000d\u000a      Layering virtual instruments from the Conservatoire Collection with real\u000d\u000a      instruments makes it possible for me to change the arrangements and\u000d\u000a      compositions very quickly when the Director decides to change a scene,\u000d\u000a      without having to re-record an entire ensemble. This means we are able to\u000d\u000a      deliver a high-quality theatrical production without becoming trapped into\u000d\u000a      simply repeating the same show every time; we can easily make changes the\u000d\u000a      afternoon before a performance without compromising quality. I've used the\u000d\u000a      Conservatoire Collection quite extensively in large-scale spectacles\u000d\u000a      requiring period music ... Earlier this year [March 2013] I used the\u000d\u000a      Conservatoire Collection alongside traditional Maori instruments for a\u000d\u000a      work commissioned by the Auckland International Festival (which drew about\u000d\u000a      50,000 people for 3 nights), and the neutral quality of the recordings in\u000d\u000a      the Conservatoire Collection enabled me to mix the results together very\u000d\u000a      easily and convincingly. That project drew record crowds to the Festival,\u000d\u000a      from all demographics. Thanks for delivering such a powerful, versatile,\u000d\u000a      and high quality creation!'\u000d\u000a    A film composer and sound designer working at Kwarszi Music, Copenhagen\u000d\u000a      has emphasized that the Collection has functioned not only directly as a\u000d\u000a      software library, but also as an imaginative source of inspiration: `The\u000d\u000a      Conservatoire Collection stands out for its range of specific instruments,\u000d\u000a      new available sounds, quality of sample and the usability\/implementation\u000d\u000a      in Kontact.

A logical progression from the\u000d\u000a      cataloguing project, this had as objectives: (i) to facilitate direct user\u000d\u000a      musical interactivity with the historical instruments of the Collection;\u000d\u000a      (ii) to create a library to allow these historical instruments to be\u000d\u000a      accessed by the historical instrument community independent of the\u000d\u000a      originals; (iii) to facilitate implementation of these instruments by\u000d\u000a      composers into DAW-based compositions, with a particular emphasis on media\u000d\u000a      (e.g. film and television) composition and commercial music production;\u000d\u000a      (iv) to license the sampler library in order to take it to market as a\u000d\u000a      commercial product.\u000d\u000a    Ten instruments were selected to be taken forward: French Harpsichord,\u000d\u000a      Flemish Harpsichord, Theorbo, English Theorbo, Baroque Guitar, Psaltery,\u000d\u000a      Baroque Timpani, Renaissance Side Drums, Nakers and Hurdy Gurdy. These ten\u000d\u000a      instruments were then meticulously recorded, sampled in Birmingham\u000d\u000a      Conservatoire's studios at 96kHz\/24bit. Performances were executed by\u000d\u000a      historically informed expert performers on each instrument. The recording\u000d\u000a      process itself involved collaborative research between performers and\u000d\u000a      sound engineer (Hall), encompassing (i) analysis of articulation\u000d\u000a      methods, dynamics, pitch regions; (ii) design and development of new\u000d\u000a      technical solutions for the appropriate capture of individual audio\u000d\u000a      characteristics. The individual samples were then edited and implemented\u000d\u000a      into the Kontakt Sampler environment using full round robin sample\u000d\u000a      allocation together with (where appropriate) key off samples, switchable\u000d\u000a      key sets, full tuning control and user selectable scales, selectable\u000d\u000a      articulations, fret hand position control, and multiple additional user\u000d\u000a      features. Recording the keyboard instruments in equal temperament ensured\u000d\u000a      that The Conservatoire Collection would be as flexible as possible\u000d\u000a      to the end user, who could use Kontakt Sampler's built-in temperament\u000d\u000a      scripts to use the samples with historical and other non-equally tempered\u000d\u000a      tunings. (By contrast, some recent harpsichord sample libraries (e.g.\u000d\u000a      Wavesfactory, Sonic State and Edition Beurmann [www.realsamples.net\/]) do\u000d\u000a      not have such capability built in.)

Cutler and Bennett draw on\u000d\u000a      Dutch post-minimalism and\u000d\u000a      Irish experimentalism; Wolters uses post-dramatic theatre (having studied\u000d\u000a      with Heiner Goebbels);\u000d\u000a      and Hall is experienced in experimental music technology.\u000d\u000a    Skempton's example, historically through the Scratch Orchestra, of\u000d\u000a      artistic self-determination has\u000d\u000a      been particularly important. Wolters established the New Guide to Opera in\u000d\u000a      1996, Cutler founded\u000d\u000a      his trio Noszferatu in 2000, and Bennett formed the ten-piece ensemble\u000d\u000a      Decibel in 2003, each as\u000d\u000a      vehicles for their own work and those of like-minded composers.

His\u000d\u000a      work for young\u000d\u000a      audiences has also been similarly inventive and slyly witty, as with the\u000d\u000a      kaleidoscopic funfair of\u000d\u000a      Pulpable Music (BCMG 2011) and Chanticleer and the Opera Fox\u000d\u000a      (2011), written as the Roald\u000d\u000a      Dahl Museum's first composer-in-residence.

Victoria\u000a      Hlenschi, current Vice\u000a      President of EDAR, notes that \"the benefits of drama in an educational\u000a      system still marred by the\u000a      traditional methods of the communist legacy were immediately obvious. As a\u000a      participant since the\u000a      very beginning of this national project I have felt its positive impact\u000a      both personally and\u000a      professionally, which has naturally reflected in my teaching and my\u000a      students' performances\".\u000a    Harrop and Loudon have disseminated a theoretically informed model of\u000a      practice developed in a\u000a      range of cultural settings which has led to the foundation of the\u000a      Educational Drama Association of\u000a      Romania which now has a membership of approximately 150 teachers, spread\u000a      across the country.\u000a      The organisation exists for `promoting drama in education both as an\u000a      elective and as an extra-\u000a      curricular activity... to develop...critical thinking'. The organisation\u000a      held its inaugural conference at\u000a      the University of Resita in 2007 and is now an independent, sustainable\u000a      and locally governed\u000a      organisation whose aim is being achieved in schools across Romania. In\u000a      addition to working with\u000a      150 Romanian teachers, Loudon, her students and the department's graduate\u000a      student company\u000a      have visited teachers in more than 50 schools across the country, and some\u000a      four thousand pupils\u000a      have taken part in workshops. Their work has impacted on teaching and\u000a      learning methods in\u000a      Romanian high schools. This has attracted the attention of the Romanian\u000a      Ministry of Education and\u000a      the Romanian media; the work has been reported in three television news\u000a      interviews (reaching\u000a      some 60,000 viewers in total), and in two articles in regional newspapers\u000a      (reaching some 8000\u000a      readers in total).\u000a    Harrop and Loudon delivered joint summer schools in Romania in 2001\u000a      (Calimanesti), 2002\u000a      (Novadari) and 2003 (Brasov). The first of these, in Calimanesti, led\u000a      directly to the establishment of\u000a      the Educational Drama Association of Romania. The second (Novadari) won\u000a      the European Union\u000a      award for best language project. The third attracted teachers from\u000a      Estonia, Macedonia, Russia,\u000a      Slovakia and Slovenia. In 2004, the British Council devoted, for the first\u000a      time, an international\u000a      Hornby Summer School to Educational Drama and located it in Mercuria Ciuc,\u000a      Romania, inviting\u000a      Harrop to undertake the role of Director. In 2005, Loudon was invited to\u000a      speak at a joint conference\u000a      of the Romanian Association of Teachers of English and the Romanian\u000a      Association of Teacher\u000a      Educators at the University of Cluj. In 2007, EDAR organised its inaugural\u000a      independent conference\u000a      with the Romanian School Inspectorate and University of Resita. Loudon was\u000a      invited to give the\u000a      opening address and conduct a workshop for the participants.\u000a    In 2008, Loudon was asked to address officials of the University of\u000a      Resita and participants in a\u000a      non-UK Erasmus arrangement to give an overview of the University of\u000a      Chester\/EDAR project.\u000a      Meanwhile, \"the association [EDAR] managed to create a network of teachers\u000a      of English ready to\u000a      implement and sustain educational drama in Romania\". [Hlenschi, V. EDAR\u000a      Vice President, 2013.]\u000a      From 2004 to 2009 Loudon travelled with groups of Drama students from the\u000a      University of Chester\u000a      to conduct drama workshops jointly with EDAR members in Romanian schools,\u000a      offering supported\u000a      experience in the drama classroom. Loudon's work mentoring a University of\u000a      Chester graduate\u000a      applied theatre company, 2engage, allowed her to step back from\u000a      direct involvement and pass the\u000a      mantle of the work to the company, who were then supported by the\u000a      increased resource and\u000a      organisational capacity of EDAR. From 2009 onward the company (with the\u000a      active support of the\u000a      department) has continued to work with teachers and pupils in Romanian\u000a      schools with further\u000a      planned visits for 2014. The project has reached more than 50 schools\u000a      across the country, and\u000a      some four thousand pupils have taken part in workshops. This work has\u000a      attracted attention from\u000a      the Romanian Ministry of Education and media, including television news\u000a      reports and interviews,\u000a      both regional and national.\u000a    In less than a decade (from 2004 to 2013) the project has moved from a\u000a      British Council supported\u000a      initiative to a sustainable national project. As the Vice President of\u000a      EDAR put it this year, \"Drama\u000a      helps both teachers and students develop their communication, problem\u000a      solving and social skills,\u000a      their emotional intelligence, creativity, cooperation and collaboration,\u000a      self-esteem and self-\u000a      confidence.\" [Hlenschi, V. EDAR Pice President, 2013.]. The work of Harrop\u000a      and Loudon has\u000a      played a crucial, determining role in bringing this valuable approach to\u000a      Drama to the Romanian\u000a      education system.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Teaching and learning in Romanian schools is being transformed by the\u000a      idea that the arts can\u000a      have a cultural impact on learning and that drama can enhance everyday\u000a      performativity.\u000a      Thousands of students have been involved in this research, which has led\u000a      to the foundation of the\u000a      Educational Drama Association of Romania, an independent, sustainable and\u000a      locally governed\u000a      organisation whose aim is being achieved in schools across Romania.

Harrop and Loudon have gained experience in a\u000a      number of cultural\u000a      settings in Ethiopia, India, Macedonia, Malawi, Romania, South Africa and\u000a      the UK. In the\u000a      Romanian case, both speed and spread in the achievement of impact reflects\u000a      research\u000a      significance and is itself deserving of further documentation and\u000a      dissemination.\u000a    Harrop engages with the anthropological and ethnographic dimension of the\u000a      emergent\u000a      Performance Studies and its debt to social scientific notions of\u000a      performativity, while Loudon\u000a      focuses on the intercultural application of the notion of `dialogic\u000a      performance'. Both have\u000a      experience of the introduction of these ideas in different cultural\u000a      contexts and have developed\u000a      mechanisms for a culturally neutral approach which is nevertheless\u000a      cognizant of the culture in\u000a      which it operates. They use the term performativity to refer to the\u000a      performance of everyday social\u000a      interaction and observe that, though performativity encompasses most of\u000a      the ways in which we\u000a      learn and teach, it is rarely foregrounded in educational curricula.\u000a    Their research shows human performativity can be harnessed through\u000a      dramatic frameworks of\u000a      experiential learning in order to enliven teaching and learning. This can\u000a      be applied to selected\u000a      bodies of content, and particularly lends itself to educational subtexts\u000a      of `self', `difference' and\u000a      `change'. This interplay of ideas and practice has been summarised in Performance\u000a        Research\u000a      (Harrop 2004); Research in Drama Education (Loudon 2005); and in a\u000a      joint paper presented at\u000a      Research in Drama Education International, University of Exeter (2005).

He remains unusual in pursuing and\u000a      influencing an agenda across theory and practice that enhances an\u000a      understanding of performance at the highest level. His own playing\u000a      activity focuses upon new ways of communicating with audiences and on new\u000a      ways of training musicians. In particular, he has influenced creative\u000a      practice by his practical investigations into the relationship of\u000a      musicians, repertory and audiences. He connects with a wide public not\u000a      only through recordings, broadcasts and publications, but through\u000a      interaction with institutions such as the Association of British\u000a      Orchestras, Conservatoires UK Research Forum (as chair), individual\u000a      orchestras, museums and cultural and community venues. He achieves a broad\u000a      educational impact through ABRSM publications and inclusion on HEI reading\u000a      lists worldwide. He consistently reaches an international audience not\u000a      only through performances and recordings but through his contributions to\u000a      the International Symposia on Performance Science (Auckland 2009,\u000a      Toronto 2011, Vienna 2013) which, as the proceedings indicate, include\u000a      many professional practitioners in their delegate lists. While most\u000a      innovations in performance practice have been largely driven from outside\u000a      academe, Lawson has been in a distinctive position to articulate the\u000a      realities of the marketplace and their relationship with scholarship and\u000a      research. For example, his article `\"Attractively packaged but unripe\u000a      fruit\": The UK's commercialization of musical history in the 1980s' was\u000a      published in the peer-reviewed Performance Practice Review (2008,\u000a      vol.13). This journal aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice\u000a      and has a wide reach across the executant community, especially in the\u000a      USA.\u000a    Lawson's research publications may be found on the syllabus of music\u000a      courses in various parts of the world. His work reaches important markets\u000a      through the ABRSM Performer's Guide to the Classical Period (sales\u000a      c10,000) and through his ABRSM editions of Grades 5-7 Clarinet Pieces\u000a      (initial domestic and international sales of over 6,000 from their June\u000a      2013 publication to 31 July [S1]). His Cambridge books (including The\u000a        Cambridge History of Musical Performance) continue to appear on the\u000a      reading lists of UK universities including Manchester [S2], St Andrews and\u000a      Goldsmiths and are recommended as essential reading for LRSM and FRSM\u000a      candidates. Internationally they are used by Singapore Examinations Board\u000a      and the Universities of Indiana, Tasmania, New South Wales, Melbourne,\u000a      Rioja (in a 2005 Spanish translation) and Mexico. They are also\u000a      represented on the select reading list of the website Early Music\u000a        America. The Cambridge Companion to the Clarinet (ed.\u000a      Lawson) appeared in a Chinese edition in 2010.\u000a    The Lef&#232;vre discs (2007, 2011) have circulated in the UK, America,\u000a      Canada, Japan, France, Germany, Belgium and Italy on the Naxos\u000a      distribution network, attracting global acclaim [S3]. International\u000a        Record Review (December 2011) emphasised their didactic value as\u000a      follows: the Lef&#232;vre Sonatas \"still frequently feature in syllabus lists\u000a      (Nos. 3 and 5 are currently Grade V and VI pieces in the ABRSM\u000a      syllabus).... Lawson, well-known as a period instrumentalist, brings these\u000a      academic works to artistic life with subtle use of ornamentation and\u000a      sensitive variation in dynamics which are omitted from Lef&#232;vre's original\u000a      scores. This disc...is invaluable to pupils studying these works. Their\u000a      pedagogical nature is reinforced by the welcome initiative that scores can\u000a      be downloaded from the...website.\" The American journal Fanfare\u000a      wrote of \"impressive technical command\" and \"superb clarinetistry\". The\u000a        Gramophone wrote of Lawson's Mozart disc: \"an interpretation of\u000a      distinction...a recreative process that spreads beyond the printed page.\"\u000a      The Cambridge History of Musical Performance (2012) has been widely\u000a      reviewed, in The Wall Street Journal, Early Music Today\u000a      and BBC Music Magazine, inter alia. It was described in Early\u000a        Music as \"a magisterial survey that will surely remain a standard\u000a      reference work for a generation\" [S4] and praised by The New York\u000a        Review of Books as having invested a genre largely associated with\u000a      specialized scholarship with \"the reliability of a trusted friend.\" Its\u000a      international impact is enhanced by belonging to a prestigious Cambridge\u000a      series, with consequent global reach and influence.\u000a    Lawson's research leadership as RCM Chair of Historical Performance has\u000a      repositioned the College work across theory and practice; his influence\u000a      has achieved wider reach, impact and significance for the RCM's historical\u000a      resources. The Museum of Music has been reconfigured, with radically\u000a      enhanced opening hours. Incorporating special exhibitions related to the\u000a      RCM performance programme, it offers tours for schools and for higher\u000a      education institutions, general tours and discovery sessions. From 2008 to\u000a      June 2013, it has hosted over 18,000 visitors from over 70 countries, and\u000a      between the 2008\/09 and 2011\/12 academic years saw annual visitor numbers\u000a      increase by nearly 50%. The RCM's 1692 bass viol by Barak Norman was lent\u000a      to The National Gallery's Vermeer and Music: The Art of Love and\u000a        Leisure (2013). The National Museums of Scotland's Mary Queen of\u000a        Scots exhibition displayed the guitar (c1650) attributed to Rene\u000a      Voboam. Closely associated with the Museum's unique collection of viols,\u000a      the RCM's International Festival of Viols has since 2007 promoted\u000a      a series of concerts, masterclasses and lectures, as well as exhibitions\u000a      of instruments and bows; these promoted understanding and appreciation of\u000a      a little known period. Twenty-two events were hosted between 2008 and\u000a      2013, with a combined 1500 in attendance. The RCM Library's external\u000a      profile has been developed by publication in 2005 of a series of 30\u000a      postcards portraying major autograph holdings, as well as facsimiles of\u000a      Elgar's Cello Concerto and works by Parry, Howells and Beethoven. The\u000a      Library loaned its Mozart K491 autograph to the Albertina in Vienna for an\u000a      exhibition in 2006. The facsimiles have found an international readership\u000a      among the RCM's partners, and Parry's Jerusalem was distributed at\u000a      the 2009 BBC Proms launch. A further scholarly BBC connection was the\u000a      publication of The Proms: A New History (Thames &amp; Hudson,\u000a      2007), co-edited by David Wright.\u000a    Among specific projects during Lawson's tenure, The Listening Gallery\u000a      (2008-10) was an AHRC knowledge transfer collaboration between the RCM and\u000a      the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum [G1]. Stemming from research in music,\u000a      art and design, the project connected objects in the V&amp;A's collections\u000a      with 50 new downloadable recordings of period music that share their rich\u000a      and distinctive pasts. A summative evaluation of the Medieval and\u000a      Renaissance Galleries from 2011 showed that a high percentage of users\u000a      engage with the audio-points, a strong indication that they are valued by\u000a      visitors [S5]. The project also made significant contributions towards\u000a      enriching curatorial knowledge of objects in the collection, establishing\u000a      a model for use internationally.\u000a    In another distinctive project, Ashley Solomon (RCM professor from 1994,\u000a      Head of Historical Performance from 2006) has investigated and recorded\u000a      the 10,000 manuscripts amassed by the Jesuit missions in Bolivia in the\u000a      100 years after 1670, blending European baroque and local culture and\u000a      powerfully illustrating the fusion of two rich civilizations. Florilegium,\u000a      RCM Ensemble in Association, has performed this music in over 30 concerts\u000a      in the Bolivian jungle, at the Wigmore Hall, the RCM and internationally,\u000a      to a combined audience of more than 18,500 [S6]. The Arakaendar Bolivia\u000a      Choir of native singers was founded in 2005, sponsored by the Prince Claus\u000a      fund. Three discs were recorded in Amsterdam and Bolivia. A Guardian\u000a      reviewer wrote \"the Arakaendars have developed in little over five years\u000a      into one of the most remarkable choirs in the world\" [S7]. The Association\u000a      Pro Art y Culture awarded Solomon the Hans Roth Prize (2008) in\u000a      recognition of his assistance to the indigenous people [S8], and the\u000a      Florilegium `Bolivian' London concert and other UK performances raised\u000a      &#163;10,000 to buy instruments for children in Bolivia [S9].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Learning from the Past is a priority in the RCM's research\u000a      strategy, building on the College's reputation for bringing music's\u000a      context to life, whether through concerts, recordings or text-based\u000a      outputs. The rich RCM Collections provide a stimulating environment for\u000a      advancing dialogue across the theory and practice of music.

His multifaceted research and his leadership\u000a      across the institution and beyond have radically advanced the\u000a      understanding of music across a wide range of national and international\u000a      beneficiaries, including the general public, the business community and\u000a      the public sector.

His\u000a      outputs range across published books and articles, editions, innovative\u000a      professional practice, recordings, broadcasts, programming, knowledge\u000a      exchange and curriculum design. Since the 1980s he has been addressing the\u000a      question of how primary source material can influence the art and craft of\u000a      music making; in particular, he has brought influential insights to the\u000a      under-investigated relationship of historical accuracy and practical\u000a      efficacy. During his Directorship, the RCM's Collections and research\u000a      activities have acquired a radically enhanced public profile.\u000a    Lawson produced some important scholarly outputs during his earlier\u000a      association with the RCM as consultant and external examiner. For example,\u000a      he was co-editor with Robin Stowell (Cardiff University) of The\u000a        Historical Performance of Music (Cambridge, 1999). As a specialist\u000a      in performance practice on wind instruments, Lawson was a contributor to\u000a      the ABRSM series of Performer's Guides, together with RCM staff\u000a      Roy Howat (Research Fellow to 2003), Stephen Preston (baroque flute\u000a      professor to 2010) and David Ward (fortepiano professor to 2011). This\u000a      series represented the latest thinking on stylish performance for a market\u000a      of AS\/A2 pupils and tertiary students, together with amateur performers\u000a      and their teachers. The RCM's scholarly connection with the global\u000a      marketplace of ABRSM has been further cemented with the publication of the\u000a      monograph by David Wright (Honorary Research Fellow), The Associated\u000a        Board of the Royal Schools of Music: A Social and Cultural History\u000a      (Boydell, 2013).\u000a    Since his appointment as RCM Director in 2005, Lawson has continued\u000a      vigorously to pursue an agenda across theory and practice in both generic\u000a      and subject-specific arenas, thus bringing reach and significance to an\u000a      important aspect of the College's research agenda. In the Dutch\u000a        Journal of Music Theory (2007), Lawson articulated his broad\u000a      manifesto `Practising research: Researching practice' to a European\u000a      readership, and he has also undertaken projects to bring the realities of\u000a      historical performance to a scholarly environment, an issue of which the\u000a      general public remains generally unaware [1]. At the 2005 CHARM conference\u000a      The Art of Record Production, he presented a paper `The most\u000a      original Beethoven yet recorded: Fantasies, realities and the microphone'\u000a      [2]; this was followed by a personal take, `Recording history: A\u000a      clarinettist's retrospective' in The Cambridge Companion to Recorded\u000a        Music (2009) [3]. Both articles drew upon the author's experience of\u000a      period ensembles in the studio and concert hall, offering insights behind\u000a      the scenes for both general audiences and specialists and probing\u000a      underpinning musical philosophies and their relationship to market\u000a      realities.\u000a    Lawson has consistently achieved practical demonstrations of his\u000a      scholarly work. While RCM Director, he has undertaken a major project to\u000a      record all twelve of the Sonatas contained in the M&#233;thode de\u000a        Clarinette (1802) by J.X. Lef&#232;vre, professor at the Paris\u000a      Conservatoire from its inception [4]. These take into account historical\u000a      information contained in relevant primary sources (with due attention to\u000a      national styles) and the commissioning of appropriate period instruments.\u000a      He applied this research in preparing editions for the ABRSM clarinet\u000a      syllabus Grades 5-7 (2013), which include works by Lef&#232;vre and his\u000a      colleague Devienne. Lawson's most recent practical project comprises a\u000a      recording of Mozart's Clarinet Quintet and its associated fragments with\u000a      the period ensemble The Revolutionary Drawing Room (leader, RCM\u000a      professor Adrian Butterfield) [5]. This reflects the contextual approach\u000a      in his chapter `A winning strike: The miracle of Mozart's Kegelstatt'\u000a      in Martin Harlow (ed.), Mozart's Chamber Music with Keyboard\u000a      (Cambridge, 2012).\u000a    With Stowell, Lawson is co-editor of The Cambridge History of Musical\u000a        Performance (2012), a radical project tracing the development of\u000a      musical history from the perspective of the performer rather than the\u000a      composer, the first time such an approach has been promoted [6]. Its\u000a      international authorship includes William Mival (RCM Head of Composition),\u000a      Natasha Loges (Assistant Head of Programmes), David Wright and Anthony\u000a      Payne (Research Fellow in Creative Practice 2007-09).\u000a\u0009  The impact detailed\u000a      below also extends to examples of ways in which Lawson's leadership has\u000a      influenced the institutional research profile (e.g. see [G1] and Section\u000a      4).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17022","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Wishart's Encounters achieves impact in several diverse ways.

The period of material collection provided\u000d\u000a      valuable opportunities for\u000d\u000a      children and adults to engage with the process of creating Encounters.\u000d\u000a      While collecting recordings\u000d\u000a      of voices in schools in Co. Durham, Wishart also ran composition workshops\u000d\u000a      for groups of\u000d\u000a      schoolchildren at which, under his guidance, they composed their own\u000d\u000a      pieces based on speech\u000d\u000a      rhythms. This had various benefits: the schoolchildren gained confidence\u000d\u000a      in the use of music\u000d\u000a      technology and an appreciation of its creative possibilities; and they\u000d\u000a      were introduced to\u000d\u000a      composition while at the same time becoming aware of the potential\u000d\u000a      musicality of their own\u000d\u000a      speech. Shortly after the completion of the composition (but before its\u000d\u000a      premiere) in spring 2011,\u000d\u000a      Wishart took an 8-channel sound-system to local community venues and\u000d\u000a      schools, and presented a\u000d\u000a      talk and demonstration about the work to groups of children and adults\u000d\u000a      whose voices had been\u000d\u000a      used in the composition [3]. This was supported by &#163;5k of funding from\u000d\u000a      Musicon, the University's\u000d\u000a      professional concert series, and facilitated by the Department's\u000d\u000a      technicians.

The digital transformation of the material\u000d\u000a      required the development of new\u000d\u000a      tools within CDP\/SoundLoom, which led to another form of impact.\u000d\u000a      Wishart produced new software\u000d\u000a      tools for the composition of Encounters, benefitting subscribers\u000d\u000a      to the program. The number of\u000d\u000a      individual subscriptions to CDP was 543 as of July 2013: they include\u000d\u000a      several well-known\u000d\u000a      composers [5, 6] [text removed for publication]. Over a hundred\u000d\u000a      institutions use the program,\u000d\u000a      including Columbia University's Computer Music Center, some with site\u000d\u000a      licences of up to 30\u000d\u000a      workstations.

Wishart then took the work,\u000d\u000a      alongside public lecture\u000d\u000a      presentations about the research, on a tour of international venues. At\u000d\u000a      Auditorio Blas Galindo,\u000d\u000a      Mexico City's premier concert venue, an audience of 200 attended the\u000d\u000a      event.

A\u000d\u000a      sound installation based on parts of the Encounters material was\u000d\u000a      created at the Botanic Gardens,\u000d\u000a      Durham, in June 2012. The Cockermouth performance was particularly\u000d\u000a      significant because it had\u000d\u000a      valuable consequences for the festival. A representative of the festival\u000d\u000a      writes: 'The fact that\u000d\u000a      Encounters was coming to Cockermouth encouraged the Festivals Group\u000d\u000a      to apply to Grants for the\u000d\u000a      Arts to commission new works which would also use electro-acoustic\u000d\u000a      technology and local\u000d\u000a      material. The application [for funding of &#163;10k] was successful, and for\u000d\u000a      2012... [a] local composer\u000d\u000a      and community musician [composed] a piece of live music, using recordings\u000d\u000a      of local voices and\u000d\u000a      sections for traditional musicians and local choirs. Placing Encounters in\u000d\u000a      the festival provided an\u000d\u000a      audience of people who would not otherwise have been exposed to this kind\u000d\u000a      of work, who\u000d\u000a      responded positively to the experience.' [1]\u000d\u000a    The First Act of Encounters has also been performed in\u000d\u000a      Birmingham, Berlin, K&#337;ln, Freiburg,\u000d\u000a      Bergen, Paris, and Wroclaw (Musica Electronica Nova Festival), and various\u000d\u000a      acts presented in\u000d\u000a      Barcelona in June 2012. Interviews and broadcasts of extracts from the\u000d\u000a      work have also been aired\u000d\u000a      on Radio UNAM Mexico City and on Swedish Radio. Given the typically small\u000d\u000a      audience for\u000d\u000a      electroacoustic music, Wishart's unusually high number of performance\u000d\u000a      commissions is a measure\u000d\u000a      of the research's extensive reach, and of its perceived significance\u000d\u000a      amongst programmers and\u000d\u000a      audiences.\u000d\u000a    Typical of the reaction of audiences and critics to Encounters, a\u000d\u000a      reviewer of the presentation at\u000d\u000a      Sound-Scotland writes: `What really generated the fascination and\u000d\u000a      excitement in this amazing\u000d\u000a      musical journey were the transformations created from the voices by Trevor\u000d\u000a      Wishart, alchemist in\u000d\u000a      sound.

This was\u000d\u000a      an amazing journey for the ears, for the mind and even at times for the\u000d\u000a      emotions.

The project relied on\u000d\u000a      extensive engagement with\u000d\u000a      local communities, a process which benefited not only the composer but\u000d\u000a      also the people who\u000d\u000a      provided the material for the composition, through public talks and\u000d\u000a      composition workshops.

Encounters\u000d\u000a        in the\u000d\u000a        Republic of Heaven is an 80-minute 8-channel electroacoustic\u000d\u000a      composition he created at Durham,\u000d\u000a      initiated after he took up employment here in 2006, and completed and\u000d\u000a      premiered in 2011. Wishart\u000d\u000a      was initially appointed as a Composition Fellow, jointly funded by the\u000d\u000a      Arts Council of England\u000d\u000a      (ACE) and Durham University, and his contract was extended by the\u000d\u000a      University in 2009. The\u000d\u000a      composer was attracted to Durham by the Music Department's long-standing\u000d\u000a      reputation in the field,\u000d\u000a      and its extensive specialist facilities, which have been used by several\u000d\u000a      noted electroacoustic\u000d\u000a      composers in addition to the current staff members, Peter Manning and Sam\u000d\u000a      Hayden.\u000d\u000a    Encounters is an exploration of the music inherent in everyday\u000d\u000a      speech. It brings together stories\u000d\u000a      told by adults and children, and reveals their melodies, rhythms and\u000d\u000a      sonorities in an 8-channel\u000d\u000a      surround-sound presentation. The composition subjects recorded speech to\u000d\u000a      cutting-edge\u000d\u000a      compositional techniques in electronic music, resulting not only in a\u000d\u000a      musical work of unusually\u000d\u000a      large scale but in a wider project of great complexity. The project had\u000d\u000a      three chronological stages:\u000d\u000a      (a) collection of material for the composition, (b) software development\u000d\u000a      to enable new forms of\u000d\u000a      digital processing of the collected material and the composition itself,\u000d\u000a      and (c) performance and\u000d\u000a      recording productions of the work.\u000d\u000a    (a) Wishart began by collecting speech recordings from a cross-section\u000d\u000a      (by gender, age and\u000d\u000a      vocal characteristics) of the speech community in the region &#8212; from homes,\u000d\u000a      schools and\u000d\u000a      meeting-places in north-east England. These recordings (many more than\u000d\u000a      were used in the\u000d\u000a      final composition) have been deposited at the The Newcastle Diachronic\u000d\u000a      Electronic Corpus\u000d\u000a      of Tyneside English (DECTE), where they are available to students of\u000d\u000a      speech and dialect\u000d\u000a      [7].\u000d\u000a    (b) In order to extract and transform musical features of this speech he\u000d\u000a      developed new tools for\u000d\u000a      the software suite Composers Desktop Project (CDP) and its user\u000d\u000a      interface SoundLoom.\u000d\u000a      Wishart has been one of the major contributors to CDP since its inception,\u000d\u000a      and is solely\u000d\u000a      responsible for creating SoundLoom. In particular, for Encounters\u000d\u000a      he implemented new\u000d\u000a      software functions to facilitate the manipulations for the human voice\u000d\u000a      used in this\u000d\u000a      composition (the conversion of speech to song by `FOF extraction'), and to\u000d\u000a      enable the\u000d\u000a      animation of 8-channel surround sound (`Multi-channel'). These new\u000d\u000a      elements created by\u000d\u000a      Wishart have been part of CDP\/SoundLoom since Release 6 in 2010,\u000d\u000a      having first been\u000d\u000a      made available to users between 2008 and 2010 as updates\u000d\u000a       (www.composersdesktop.com).\u000d\u000a    (c) Wishart has supervised over 30 performances of Encounters in\u000d\u000a      whole or part. This has\u000d\u000a      involved his visiting venues, assessing performance equipment, and\u000d\u000a      configuring the use of\u000d\u000a      space in advance of each event. Wishart worked with Durham technicians and\u000d\u000a      equipment\u000d\u000a      for UK performances. He has also published a stereo remix of Encounters\u000d\u000a      with an\u000d\u000a      accompanying booklet in 2011, as well as a 5.1 surround sound version on\u000d\u000a      DVD, the\u000d\u000a      production of which was commissioned by Edition RZ, the German new music\u000d\u000a      recording\u000d\u000a      company (2012).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17023","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Dibble's extensive dissemination activities, which have reached a wide\u000a      audience through public lectures, TV and radio broadcasts, commercial CD\u000a      recordings, the national and local press, and music publishers, as well as\u000a      by collaboration with professional and amateur performers, have ensured\u000a      its profound impact. Both his research and its subsequent dissemination\u000a      have aimed (a) to make the music of these composers known to the wider\u000a      public, (b) to explain its significance, and (c) to provide performing\u000a      materials for professional and amateur live performances, and for\u000a      commercial recordings. He has also supervised over 20 PhD students in this\u000a      area of research since 1993 (5 completed since 2008), many of whom have\u000a      contributed further to the dissemination of this repertoire as academics,\u000a      producers and performers. Dibble's work also led to the donation of\u000a        the Stainer family archive to Durham University library in 2010,\u000a      making material publicly available for the first time: the catalogue of\u000a      this collection was consulted no fewer than 1,138 times in the 12 months\u000a      to March 2013 [7].\u000a    The principal impact of Dibble's research has been increased\u000a        performance and programming of this repertoire. Before Dibble\u000a      embarked on his research, most of the music of Parry, Stanford and Stainer\u000a      was unavailable in print or as commercial recordings, and was rarely\u000a      broadcast. An indication of the neglect of these composers can be found in\u000a      the archives of the BBC Proms, Britain's best-known classical music\u000a      festival (www.bbc.co.uk\/proms\/archive).\u000a      A handful of Parry's pieces was featured heavily in the Proms in the\u000a      inter-war years, but by the 1950s this had been effectively reduced to an\u000a      annual rendition of `Jerusalem' on the Last Night. Between 1954 and his\u000a      sesquicentenary in 1998 only two performances of other works were given.\u000a      As a direct result of a consultancy with Dibble, the BBC made Parry a\u000a      featured composer in 2010 and presented four major works: Symphonic\u000a      Fantasia in B minor '1912' (23 July 2010), the still unpublished Elegy\u000a        for Brahms (8 August 2010), Symphonic Variations in E minor (5\u000a      September 2010), and Blest Pair of Sirens (11 September 2010).\u000a      Thus, as a result of Dibble's research, publications and advocacy, the\u000a      composer was featured more in 2010 than in any year since 1930.\u000a    The Proms are just one example of the way in which Dibble's research has\u000a      facilitated and inspired much more extensive programming, performance,\u000a      recording and broadcasting of works by these composers, and the exposure\u000a      of a broad audience to previously unavailable music. As shown below,\u000a      Dibble has had both a direct influence on the programming of particular\u000a      events, and a longer-term effect on the programming strategy of several\u000a      arts organisations. In many cases it was the positive public response to\u000a      performances and broadcasts dependent on Dibble's research which\u000a      encouraged promoters and media organisations to programme more of this\u000a      music.\u000a    Dibble's research has allowed others to programme the music as part of\u000a      major festivals, to record the music for commercial CD releases (and\u000a      digital downloads), and to feature the music in radio and television\u000a      programmes. A professional conductor writes of the impact of Dibble's\u000a      research in leading to `often unjustly neglected works being brought to\u000a      public attention by way of professional performances and CD recordings.\u000a      [Dibble] has also brilliantly edited, and even orchestrated [incomplete]\u000a      works, once again, directly influencing the accessibility of works for the\u000a      public.' [4] High profile performances and broadcasts as well as numerous\u000a      CD releases [9] are evidence of the effect this work has had on public and\u000a      commercial institutions, and on key individuals within them. The very fact\u000a      that Dibble has been in regular demand as a consultant &#8212; including\u000a      numerous unsolicited requests for advice from broadcasters, recording\u000a      companies and performing groups &#8212; is testimony to the impact of his\u000a      tireless advocacy, which itself was the focus of a Gramophone\u000a      article on 22 October 2012 [8]. As a BBC producer writes, `[Dibble's]\u000a      enthusiasm for these relatively unfamiliar composers is infectious and I\u000a      know of no other more energetic protagonist nor imaginative communicator\u000a      of their music' [10].\u000a    Dibble was contractually engaged as consultant for a 90-minute TV\u000a        documentary on Parry, `The Prince and the Composer', commissioned\u000a      for the BBC, and played a prominent role throughout its production. The\u000a      director comments that `I consulted [Dibble] right at the beginning of the\u000a      project, before anything else had got under way, and his book was by my\u000a      side throughout. He played a very important part: it would have been\u000a      difficult to have done the film without him.' [1] The film was premiered\u000a      in May 2010 on BBC 4 and was reshown on BBC 2 on Christmas Day 2011,\u000a      introduced by the Prince of Wales to an audience of 1.16 million people,\u000a      and released on DVD in May 2012. A movement from Parry's Magnificat\u000a      (1897), 'Et Misericordia', was featured in the film on Dibble's advice\u000a      (and is also included in full as an extra on the DVD): this resulted in\u000a      the whole work being programmed at the St Endellion Festival (April 2012)\u000a      from materials prepared by Dibble, and recorded by Chandos with Neeme\u000a      J&#228;rvi and the BBC National Orchestra and Chorus of Wales. Dibble has also\u000a      orchestrated excerpts of Parry's unfinished opera Guenever, which\u000a      was recorded by the BBC Concert Orchestra and released on CD in 2009.\u000a    Guenever is one of a number of Dibble's projects to have reached a\u000a      broadcast audience. Parry featured on Composer of the Week\u000a      three times in the census period (May 2011, February 2012, June 2013), the\u000a      second of which included this work. In other broadcasting projects, BBC\u000a      Radio 3 aired a series of performances recorded in Belfast in February\u000a      2011, featuring the Ulster Orchestra, Ulster Youth Choir and Howard\u000a      Shelley. These included the world premiere of Stanford's Overture in\u000a        the Style of a Tragedy and the first performance in a century of his\u000a      Fairy Day, both pieces existing only in manuscript until edited by\u000a      Dibble. Parry's choral ballet Prosperine was edited and\u000a      reconstructed from manuscripts by Dibble and performed for the first time\u000a      since 1912. Broadcasts such as BBC 1's Songs of Praise (24\u000a      February 2008, and 19 December 2010), featuring works made available\u000a      through Dibble's research on Parry and Christmas carols, further extend\u000a      the reach of this work. The rate of the BBC's production of this emerging\u000a      repertoire is evidence that it now considers both Parry and Stanford as\u000a      mainstream composers.\u000a    Dibble's work has led to consultancies for several other music\u000a        festivals, notably the annual Three Choirs Festival, where his\u000a      research &#8212; both in text and music editing &#8212; provides an important strand\u000a      of their performance repertoire. A festival administrator writes that\u000a      Dibble's `published work and personal advice have often proved invaluable\u000a      to programme planners seeking guidance on suitable works to include in the\u000a      Festival programmes.' [2] Apart from the choirs featured in this festival,\u000a      the BBC National Chorus of Wales, Guildford Choral Society and London Bach\u000a      Choir are examples of groups to have benefited from Dibble's research and\u000a      consultancy, while the use of his edition of Parry's `Welcome, Yule!'\u000a      (OUP) in the Nine Lessons and Carols at King's College Cambridge in 2010\u000a      is just one example of the extensive use of Dibble's editions in Anglican\u000a      churches, cathedrals and chapels. Apart from orchestras cited elsewhere in\u000a      this document, the English Symphony Orchestra, RTE Symphony, Ulster\u000a      Orchestra, and BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra have all benefitted from\u000a      Dibble's consultancy. Another example of Dibble's influence in\u000a      contributing to the concert repertory is his completion of Stanford's\u000a      Second Violin Concerto, which was premiered in Durham Cathedral on 2 March\u000a      2012 to an audience of about 500 people. The success of this event led to\u000a      a London premiere by Rupert Marshall-Luck with the Orchestra of St Paul's\u000a      at St John's, Smith Square on 28 February 2013.\u000a    CD recordings drawing directly on Dibble's research amount to more\u000a      than 20 from 2008 to 2013, including premiere recordings of Stanford's\u000a      Piano Quartet No. 2, Parry's Coronation Te Deum and other items in\u000a      their oeuvre [9]. Dibble's contribution has consisted of the provision of\u000a      newly-edited performing materials and booklet notes, and consultation and\u000a      design of the repertoire with leading recording companies such as Hyperion\u000a      and Chandos. His contribution to the new Vivat label's recording of choral\u000a      music by Parry and Stanford included the edition of the Coronation Te\u000a        Deum and an essay of 4,000 words; the recording reached number one\u000a      in the UK's specialist classical music chart in its first week of release\u000a      and was nominated as one of three for the award of 'choral recording of\u000a      the year' in the Gramophone. The reach of this research is\u000a      evidenced by the sales figures of the recordings. [text removed for publication]. These sales evidence not only the considerable\u000a      generated by the companies and a significant amount of work provided for\u000a      professional orchestras &#8212; a profound impact overall on Britain's musical\u000a      culture.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Dibble's research on Britain and Ireland's neglected Victorian and\u000a      Edwardian composers, particularly Hubert Parry (1848-1918), Charles\u000a      Villiers Stanford (1852-1924) and John Stainer (1840-1901), together with\u000a      his public engagement and media work, has had a considerable influence on\u000a      British musical culture. As a result of Dibble's research there has been a\u000a      substantial increase in the performance, programming and recording of\u000a      works by these composers, leading to enhanced awareness, enjoyment and\u000a      understanding of this repertory and its importance to the nation's musical\u000a      heritage.

His book,\u000a      C. Hubert H. Parry: His Life and Music (1992) was revised to\u000a      coincide with the composer's sesquicentenary in 1998; this was followed by\u000a      a brand new biographical entry in Grove, including new material (2000).\u000a      This book &#8212; the first biography of Parry since 1926 &#8212; was the first of\u000a      three major biographical and analytical studies on Victorian musical\u000a      figures, followed by Charles Villiers Stanford: Man and Musician\u000a      (2002, his first biography since 1935) and John Stainer: A Life in\u000a        Music (2007). Alongside detailed biographical narratives, these\u000a      works provide, largely for the first time, thorough evaluations of these\u000a      composers' musical and literary works.\u000a    Together, these publications offer a comprehensive reassessment of the\u000a      music of these composers and their place in British and European music\u000a      history. Dibble demonstrates their role in building on influential German\u000a      models, particularly those of Brahms and Wagner, while paving the way for\u000a      the later development of British music, including the hitherto more\u000a      celebrated following generation (Elgar, Vaughan Williams, Holst, Bridge,\u000a      Howells et al). This research demonstrated these composers' development of\u000a      a new, national voice, notably in church music, choral music and song &#8212;\u000a      where the influence of the English language was paramount &#8212; but also in\u000a      traditionally continental areas such as symphony, chamber music and, in\u000a      Stanford's case, opera. By so doing it demonstrates their historical\u000a      significance and makes a strong case that the music merits both closer\u000a      scrutiny and the prominent place in the repertory which it once possessed.\u000a    Dibble has also edited a substantial amount of previously unpublished\u000a      music by these composers: several works have been published in the form of\u000a      scholarly editions for Musica Britannica (Parry Violin Sonatas,\u000a      2003), Oxford University Press (A Stanford Anthology, 2004) and the\u000a      Royal School of Church Music Press. Numerous other editions, such as\u000a      Parry's Piano Concerto, Coronation Te Deum, Magnificat and orchestrations\u000a      of his unfinished opera Guenever, and Stanford's anthems, Piano\u000a      Quartet No. 2, Horn Quintet, Piano Concerto No. 1 and several church\u000a      anthems have been prepared directly for recording companies and performing\u000a      groups. Much of Dibble's work, therefore, enters the public domain in the\u000a      form of CD recordings released by companies such as Chandos, Hyperion and\u000a      Naxos, which are made from his editions and feature his detailed and\u000a      extensive sleeve notes.\u000a    Dibble's principal research contributions have therefore taken several\u000a      forms. In addition to the vital contextual backdrop of his critical\u000a      biographies, his retrieval and close contact with the musical sources &#8212;\u000a      many of them unpublished and found in a wide range of locations, both\u000a      public and private &#8212; has led to the production of scholarly and performing\u000a      editions, often allowing performers and the wider public access to a body\u000a      of work for the first time. Dibble's exploration and use of sources\u000a      relating to Stainer, which led to the consolidation of his archive and its\u000a      donation to Durham University in 2010 [7], is an example of the extensive\u000a      engagement with previously unstudied primary sources, both musical and\u000a      textual, on which his research, dissemination activities and their impact\u000a      are based.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17237","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"453733","Name":"Estonia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2264397","Name":"Portugal"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The continued development of Vending machines of the British Isles;\u000d\u000a        SOUND BANK; Sonic Time\u000d\u000a        Capsule (2011); and H&#251;rd (2011-2012) through Sound\u000d\u000a        Diaries has generated opportunities for\u000d\u000a      public engagement through social media, popular conferences and events,\u000d\u000a      exhibitions, and\u000d\u000a      podcast and media appearances.\u000d\u000a    Vending Machines of the British Isles (2010-2011) was featured at\u000d\u000a      \"Boring 2011\", a popular\u000d\u000a      conference11a, b, and subsequently in episode 60 of the cult\u000d\u000a      technology podcast `shiftrunstop'11c An\u000d\u000a      installed version of the work also featured in the audio architecture\u000d\u000a      exhibition in Beijing and London\u000d\u000a      11d.\u000d\u000a    When Ford devised SOUND BANK she was volunteering on BBC Oxford's\u000d\u000a      cultural magazine\u000d\u000a      show, \"The Hub\"12a where she publicised the project in a short\u000d\u000a      entitled \"Sounds from Life\".\u000d\u000a      Additionally, a special edition of SOUND BANK was produced for a\u000d\u000a      public gallery show in Reading\u000d\u000a      called \"Love is Awesome\", and in 2009, Ford published records from\u000d\u000a      December 2008 daily on her\u000d\u000a      own website12b as an advent calendar blog-post series.

The Impact Template (REF 3a section d) notes that these\u000a      articulate all three of the\u000a      more generally-worded aims for institution-wide impact described in the\u000a      Impact Template (REF 3a.\u000a      context).\u000a    Impact 1 &#8212; Improving abilities\u000a    The research was encapsulated in the production of the score of Fantasias.\u000a      This score, for\u000a      reasons set out above, is of necessity extremely challenging to its\u000a      performers. The impact claimed\u000a      here is that the study of Fantasias provided a learning\u000a      opportunity not only for the NYO but also for\u000a      the professional orchestras that have played the work. This position of Fantasias\u000a      within the\u000a      evolution of orchestral technique was confirmed at a conference Getting\u000a        it Right? held at LSO\u000a      St.Luke's in April 2010 and February 2013 at which artists (including\u000a      Helmut Lachenmann (keynote\u000a      speaker), Michael Finnissy, Jane Manning, Diego Masson, Rolf Hind, David\u000a      Alberman, Richard\u000a      Baker and Julian Philips) discussed the development of technique from the\u000a      early 20th Century to\u000a      the present day. Other evidence includes the NYO participant's blog in\u000a      which the performers\u000a      exchange views on the challenges of the work (see section 5. below).\u000a    Impact 2 &#8212; Widening audiences\u000a    Fantasias was first performed in the US to full houses at\u000a      Severance Hall, Cleveland\u000a      (capacity: 1,844) on 19th and 20th December 2009.\u000a      Other performances include, so far, the NYO's\u000a      tour of the UK held in August 2010 to sell-out houses that culminated in\u000a      the orchestra's Prom\u000a      concert of that year with an Albert Hall audience of about 2,000 and a BBC\u000a      radio broadcast. It\u000a      subsequently received a BBC2 TV screening with an estimated audience of\u000a      over 700,000 plus\u000a      those who later viewed it on i-player.\u000a    The work was performed by the LPO in December 2011 in the Royal Festival\u000a      Hall with an\u000a      audience of approximately 2,500. A commercially available CD recording\u000a      made by the LPO was\u000a      released on 4th November 2013.\u000a    Fantasias won first prize for Best New Large Scale Work in the\u000a      BASCA British Music\u000a      Awards of 2011.\u000a    It is of course impossible to estimate &#8212; especially in quantitative terms\u000a      &#8212; the impact this\u000a      degree of dissemination might have had so far on Fantasias'\u000a      listeners. But one proxy measure\u000a      might be to contrast this performance history with the fate of the vast\u000a      majority of new works that\u000a      rapidly find a first performance but search in vain for a second. Fantasias,\u000a      to put it mildly, is being\u000a      unusually successful in impacting a widened audience.\u000a    A second proxy measure of impact in this sphere of audience development\u000a      has been the\u000a      increased number of commissions the researcher has received since the\u000a      first performances of\u000a      Fantasias. These works include The Discovery of Heaven of\u000a      2012 and a concerto for violin and\u000a      orchestra to be premiered in 2015, both commissioned indirectly on the\u000a      basis of Fantasias'\u000a      success. Part of the explanation for this is the breadth of audience that\u000a      the earlier work\u000a      commanded, a quality subsequent commissioning bodies wished to see again,\u000a      and that was\u000a      important, for example, in securing &#8212; in 2010 &#8212; Anderson's on-going\u000a      position as Composer in\u000a      Residence at the LPO.\u000a    Impact 3 &#8212; Supporting young composers\u000a    Until the NYO's performance of Fantasias the orchestra played new\u000a      work at its Prom\u000a      concerts only intermittently, since Fantasias a new work has been\u000a      performed every year.\u000a    The impact of the research continues to affect positively the development\u000a      of new music.\u000a      Since the success of Fantasias the composer has been invited to\u000a      join official bodies at, for\u000a      example, Wigmore Hall (composer in residence until 2016), LPO Young\u000a      Composers (12\u000a      composers commissioned since 2010) as well as various judging panels\u000a      including Tactus Young\u000a      Composers' Forum and the Conseil Musical &#8212; Fondation Prince Pierre de\u000a        Monaco.

Using a large orchestra,\u000a      including an eight-person\u000a      timpani-less percussion section (which never seems over-used), Anderson\u000a      goes on to challenge\u000a      any orchestra with much brilliant and subtly intertwined writing, not\u000a      least the polyphony of `Fantasia\u000a      2', a propulsive scherzo, further distinguished by long string lines. Much\u000a      of the music is active,\u000a      there is much surface incident, and one is aware of linking features that\u000a      are below the beguiling\u000a      top-soil, such as in the relatively lengthy `Fantasia 3' that seems to be\u000a      in three sections, or at least\u000a      has two significant pauses, in which melody, texture and suggestiveness\u000a      are at their most lush, in\u000a      contrast with the whimsical, witty miniature that follows. As reference,\u000a      and no more than that, one\u000a      could cite Birtwistle, Ligeti, Lutos&#322;awski and Tippett as being\u000a      co-conspirators in Anderson's gripping\u000a      orchestral adventure(s), the five movements seeming closely connected yet\u000a      significantly different\u000a      to stand apart, heavy-duty brass returning towards the close of `Fantasia\u000a      5' as a sort of full-circle\u000a      marker to give relationship to the whole.\u000a    \u000aIf rainforests and \"Tom and Jerry\" have been, respectively, a direct\u000a      influence and a post-composition\u000a      suggestion then these may not be immediately apparent to the listener.

In summary\u000a      the apparently arcane investigation the researcher\/composer undertook into\u000a      the continuum from\u000a      discontinuity to continuity of musical materials drew from him an\u000a      unusually vivid language of\u000a      musical expression in order to clarify to the audience the experiments it\u000a      was observing. It is this\u000a      vividness of language, and the unfolding of language, that has contributed\u000a      much to the research's\u000a      subsequent impact.\u000a    Music from many cultures and ages relies on a debate between continuity\u000a      and\u000a      discontinuity. The research submitted here took this seesaw of\u000a      construction and, through\u000a      experiments with colleagues at various international conferences and\u000a      seminars, plotted the\u000a      possible trajectories that a number of musical fragments might take in\u000a      different sonic environments.\u000a    Fantasias is a controlled detonation releasing this melodic,\u000a      harmonic and structural energy\u000a      found in the material finally selected. It is plausible that the\u000a      subsequent impacts of the work are\u000a      related, in part, to its audiences' excitement at the heated debates,\u000a      rational arguments and sudden\u000a      contradictions that are outcomes of the research process encapsulated in\u000a      the music.\u000a    The research is submitted as REF output 1b.\u000a    Impact 1 &#8212; Improving technical abilities The required clarity of\u000a      aesthetic intention and musical\u000a      voice introduced above resulted in a challenging score, one that stretched\u000a      the technical abilities of\u000a      even the commissioning body &#8212; The Cleveland Orchestra (Cleveland, Ohio,\u000a      USA). When the work\u000a      was subsequently performed by the National Youth Orchestra of Great\u000a      Britain (NYO) it naturally\u000a      posed significant challenges to its young musicians. But the fact that\u000a      both professionals in the USA\u000a      &#8212; and subsequently at the London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO) &#8212; and\u000a      seasoned and young\u000a      professionals in the UK chose to master the work, record, broadcast, and\u000a      include it in their\u000a      repertoires demonstrates that its impact is based on musical criteria of\u000a      quality rather than just\u000a      technical utility.\u000a    Impact 2 &#8212; Widening audiences The musical language of Fantasias\u000a      is complex both in terms of\u000a      material and in its handling of that material. Although no concessions are\u000a      made to seduce a\u000a      widened audience this piece has received many repeat performances after\u000a      its US premiere, being\u000a      heard at Birmingham's Symphony Hall, the Royal Albert Hall, Royal Festival\u000a      Hall, the 2010 Snape\u000a      Proms and in four concerts by the NYO. It has been broadcast on radio in\u000a      both the UK and USA\u000a      and on TV following its Proms performance. The research has therefore\u000a      impacted the lives of\u000a      many who would not normally wish to trace the contrapuntal derivation of a\u000a      non-tonal segment.\u000a    Impact 3 &#8212; Supporting young composers The popular impact of the\u000a      research has led the\u000a      researcher\/composer to be invited to join commissioning and selection\u000a      panels for new work, and\u000a      has convinced these groups that contemporary pieces can enhance the\u000a      standing of their\u000a      ensembles in the eyes not only of an elite cadre of specialists but also\u000a      in the eyes, and ears, of a\u000a      wider public that wishes to be entertained as well as challenged.\u000a    The research was carried out between 2008 and 2009.

Opening up public discourse\u000a    I've always appreciated Mar&#237;a's insight regarding theatre matters, and\u000a        especially her advice to me during my time as Director of the Grec\u000a        Festival in Barcelona [2006-11]. Her reviews, comments and perceptions\u000a        about the international scene resulted in my inviting many highly\u000a        appreciated artists to present their work in our programmes. &#8212;\u000a      Ricardo Szwarcer, Director of Usina del Arte, Buenos Aires (2012)\u000a    Delgado has made 30+ BBC radio appearances to discuss Spanish and\u000a      Latin-American stage and screen culture across six different programmes: The\u000a        Strand (World Service); Open Book, Saturday Review,\u000a      Start the Week, The Film Programme (Radio4); and NightWaves\u000a      (Radio3). She is also a frequent reviewer and contributor to mass media\u000a      and trade publications, such as Sight &amp; Sound (five exclusive\u000a      interviews and features, 12 film and book reviews and 13 commentaries); Plays\u000a        International [PI] (12 reviews); and Western European\u000a        Stages (11 reviews). All are key industry publications with an\u000a      extensive readership; for example, Sight &amp; Sound's estimated\u000a      monthly readership is 45,000; PI's subscription base includes\u000a      Steppenwolf Chicago and Market Theatre Johannesburg.

For example: in 2013 a film she championed for Sight &amp;\u000a      Sound's `Hidden Gems' feature (Aug. 2007), Cr&#237;a cuervos\/Raise\u000a      Ravens, was re-released by the BFI, Delgado was invited to chair\u000a      the interview\u000a      with its director Carlos Saura\u000a      at the BFI, London (11 June 2011), and she contributed a 2,000 word essay\u000a      to the 2013 DVD release. In another case, a review of Lake Tahoe\u000a      first published in Sight &amp; Sound, was reproduced in the DVD\u000a      release notes (Yume Pictures, 2009).\u000a    Delgado has conducted public interviews with more than 50 major cultural\u000a      figures from Spain and Spanish-America since 2008, including Pedro\u000a      Almod&#243;var and Pen&#233;lope Cruz, Javier\u000a      Bardem, Alfredo Castro, Benicio del Toro, Diego Luna, and Alejandro\u000a      Gonz&#225;lez I&#241;&#225;rritu. Over 4,000 audience members have viewed these\u000a      interviews live or online and feedback indicates audiences' enhanced\u000a      appreciation of the films. Three of the interviews have also been\u000a      disseminated as commentaries on DVD film releases: Tony Manero\u000a      (dir. Pablo Larra&#237;n, Network, 2009); Abel (dir.

She participated\u000a      in the 2012\u000a      Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Almod&#243;var tribute with a\u000a      public interview and conducted the only public\u000a      Q&amp;A for the 2013 UK premiere of Almod&#243;var's I'm So Excited!,\u000a      presented across 40+ UK cinemas in a live stream.

All these\u000a      events have served to enhance public and industry understandings of the\u000a      working practices of Spain's leading filmmaker.\u000a    II. Improving the programming and circulation of Spanish-language\u000a      theatre and film\u000a    Delgado's publications have been hugely influential in shaping my\u000a      programming.

Of these films, 9\u000a      have secured UK releases, generating cinematic box-office and DVD sales.\u000a    In 2009, Tristana Media invited Delgado to select the films for the\u000a      `Lorca on Film' season at London's Cine Lumi&#232;re, 27-30 March 2009. The\u000a      season attracted an audience of 607 attending the six screenings, with\u000a      three public Q&amp;As chaired by Delgado. The accompanying `Lorca on Film'\u000a      website had 3,329 visitors between Feb. and May 2009. The National\u000a      Galleries of Scotland requested the double-bill programme of Un Chien\u000a        andalou and Trip to the Moon as part of a `Lorca on Film and\u000a      Surrealism' event on 8 July 2010.\u000a    In August 2010, Delgado co-programmed a `South American Renaissance'\u000a      season at the BFI, London, showing 21 films over 47 screenings, and\u000a      drawing audiences of 2,941.\u000a    Building on the success of the `Lorca on Film' season, Tristana Media\u000a      invited Delgado to curate two programmes of films on acting in Spain,\u000a      `Acting Across Frontiers' (2012-13), again at the Cin&#233; Lumi&#232;re, for the \u000a\u0009  London Spanish Film\u000a      Festival. The first, `Acting Almod&#243;var' (29 Sept. &#8212; 2 Oct. 2012),\u000a      comprised five screenings, an onstage conversation between actors Marisa\u000a      Paredes and Antonia San Juan and Delgado, and three Q&amp;As attracting\u000a      audiences of 441. The accompanying web pages attracted 76,000 page views\u000a      between Aug. and Oct. 2012. Delgado was also commissioned to write an\u000a      essay on Almod&#243;var's work for Latino Life, the UK's largest\u000a      Latin and Spanish lifestyle portal which attracts over 30,000 visits a\u000a      week. The subsequent `Acting on Both Sides of the Atlantic' season (25-28\u000a      April 2013) picked up on transnational currents in Spanish cinema,\u000a      presenting six linked films and three onstage interviews with actors Juan\u000a      Diego and Mar&#237;a Botto, Blanca Su&#225;rez and Carlos Areces, and Oscar-winning\u000a      director Fernando Trueba with audiences of 831. Press coverage includes\u000a      features in El Pa&#237;s (10\/09\/12), Living Spain (Autumn\u000a      2012), RTVE (28\/09\/12). The London Spanish Film Festival website\u000a      hosts videos\u000a      from both seasons.\u000a    In 2012, Sof&#237;a Serbin de Skalon, a publicist with over 10 years\u000a      experience in the international film industry, invited Delgado to\u000a      collaborate as a programming associate on a new Argentine Film Festival in\u000a      London, with the aim of establishing a showcase for the best contemporary\u000a      films from and about Argentina, as well as providing Londoners with a\u000a      unique insight into Argentine culture. Its two editions have screened 19\u000a      features and 20 shorts across 4 venues (Ritzy Cinema 2012, 2013; Cineworld\u000a      Haymarket, Hackney Picturehouse 2013) attracting audiences of c.1,600\u000a      in 2012 and c.1,800 in 2013. The festival has been well-covered by\u000a      press both in the UK and Latin America with outlets including Evening\u000a      Standard, Financial Times, Guardian, Independent, Huffington Post,\u000a      Monacle24, Screen Daily, Time Out (Pick of the Week 2013 edition),\u000a      and La Naci&#243;n (Argentina). The\u000a      festival website received over 8,000 unique visitors in the 6 months\u000a      (Feb-July 2012) following its launch and 8,000 unique visitors in April\u000a      2013 alone, with an overall digital reach of 60 million in online\u000a      newspaper and magazine coverage in 2013.\u000a    This activity shows how Delgado is actively bringing Spanish-language\u000a      films to UK audiences. Many of the films selected for festival screenings\u000a      are not otherwise available in the cinema, and were previously unknown\u000a      outside the Spanish-speaking world.\u000a    III. Contributing creative and economic prosperity through consultancy\u000a      and advocacy in the creative industries in the UK, Spain and Argentina\u000a    Delgado is one of the key drivers of our theatre in the UK\u000a      &amp;madsh; Marcos Ord&#243;&#241;ez, El Pa&#237;s (14\/6\/12)\u000a    Cultural organisations and directors in the UK, Spain and Argentina have\u000a      solicited Delgado's advice on the staging of plays, or sought her\u000a      knowledge of key figures in contemporary Hispanic theatre. She has\u000a      consulted for The Globe London, Grec Festival Barcelona, Teatre Lliure\u000a      Barce-lona, and Teatro El Extranjero Buenos Aires. Two examples of\u000a      consultation work are detailed here.\u000a    Her documenting of Lorca's relationship with his lead actress Margarita\u000a      Xirgu fed into Peter Sellars' production of Osvaldo Golijov's opera Ainadamar\u000a      (Barbican Centre, 2008, Teatro Real Madrid, 2012), with Delgado providing\u000a      a programme note for the 2008 staging and advising on the revisions to the\u000a      libretto for 2012. Her contribution was recognised by Sellars in his\u000a      comment that the production `owes its very existence to the weight and\u000a      depth of Maria Delgado's work'.\u000a    Bijan Sheibani (Associate Director of the National Theatre) drew on\u000a      Delgado's Federico Garc&#237;a Lorca (2008) in staging The House of\u000a      Bernarda Alba (opened Almeida Theatre, London 19 Jan. 2012).\u000a      Delgado advised on the choice of translation and the re-situating of the\u000a      play from 1930s Andalusia to contemporary Iran and provided a programme\u000a      note. The 77 press reviews, preview features and recommendations published\u000a      in the UK, USA and Spain commented on the `inspired' resituating of the\u000a      play (Evening Standard, 2\/2\/12; Independent 4\/2\/12; The\u000a      Times, 30\/1\/12), its `clarity' (Guardian 28\/1\/12) and a\u000a      `thrilling staging, eloquent and justified' (Time Out, 31\/1\/12).\u000a      The production played at 93.6% capacity over 54 performances (16,582\u000a      spectators). Delgado has further advised Sheibani on Tirso de Molina's Damned\u000a        by Despair at the National Theatre (Olivier auditorium, opened\u000a      11\/10\/12), providing research materials, discussing ideas about `this\u000a      challenging work' (Guardian 12\/10\/12) and the Golden Age stage,\u000a      authoring a programme note (`weighty essay' Daily Express\u000a      12\/10\/12) and providing detailed feedback in preview. The production was\u000a      seen by 29,972 people, reviewed in 26 print and 5 online publications (`a\u000a      damned interesting way to spend an evening', Daily Telegraph\u000a      12\/10\/12), and generated 24 preview pieces including `Hot tickets in\u000a      London' (NYTimes.com) and `Theatre pick' (Financial Times).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The range, quantity and quality of Hispanic theatre production, film\u000a      exhibition and cultural understanding in the UK has been significantly\u000a      enhanced by the research on Spanish-language stage and screen cultures by\u000a      Professor Maria Delgado (at QMUL since 1997).

She maps\u000a      transnational, transcultural currents in her major publications &#8212; The\u000a        Paris Jigsaw (2002), `Other' Spanish Theatres (2003), Catalan\u000a        Theatre 1975-2006 (2007), Federico Garc&#237;a Lorca (2008), Contemporary\u000a        European Theatre Directors (2010), A History of Theatre in Spain\u000a      (2012) and Spanish Cinema 1973-2010 (2013). These works construct\u000a      revisionist cultural histories, offering readers new approaches to the art\u000a      of making theatre and film in the Spanish-speaking world, reassessing\u000a      periods, companies or figures in twentieth-century cultural history in\u000a      modes that recognize fertile &#8212; and often undocumented &#8212; collaborations in\u000a      Spain and Spanish America.\u000a    ISSUES: Her research to date has focused on three key,\u000a      inter-related areas: i) Spanish-language theatrical cultures (with a\u000a      particular emphasis on the cultural significance of Federico Garc&#237;a\u000a      Lorca); ii) screen cultures, including creative processes, distribution,\u000a      curation and exhibition; and iii) the working methods and material\u000a      conditions of production across both film and theatre.\u000a    THEATRE: In relation to theatrical cultures, Delgado's research has\u000a      brought the `hidden' histories of performers, producers, directors and\u000a      companies into the public domain. Her publications have focused on: the\u000a      contribution of actresses to the dramaturgy of Lorca; the transcultural\u000a      currents that have moulded theatrical practices in Spain as well as in the\u000a      Americas; regional cultures in Spain (especially Catalan-language\u000a      performance); the evolution of the role of the director on the Spanish\u000a      stage; the performance of historical memory; and the role of Lorca's\u000a      legacies in state representations of Spain through cultural branding and\u000a      the heritage industry.\u000a    FILM: Delgado's influential research on Spanish-language film places its\u000a      histories within a broader cultural ecology &#8212; including theatrical, visual\u000a      and musical cultures. Through writing, and also crucially through the\u000a      practices of curation, organisation and programming, her research on\u000a      screen cultures has opened up dialogue about under-acknowledged archives\u000a      and practices, encouraged and facilitated global patterns of exchange and\u000a      distribution and generated critical understandings of stage\/screen\u000a      interactions. This can be seen, for example, through her public\u000a      discussions about craft in the cinema of Pedro Almod&#243;var (2009-13) and her\u000a      `Lorca on Film' season (2009).\u000a    SUMMARY: Across her research in theatrical and screen cultures, Delgado\u000a      has undertaken extensive work as a critical commentator, translator, and\u000a      historian of working methods in theatre and film in the Spanish-speaking\u000a      world. Her research involves extensive interviews with leading\u000a      practitioners (especially actors and directors), and extended periods in\u000a      rehearsal observation. The resulting body of work makes evident the varied\u000a      interpretations (and tensions) that prevail in the construction of\u000a      theatrical and cinematic histories of Spain. Her work has embedded\u000a      Spanish-language practitioners within dominant histories that habitually\u000a      marginalise Hispanic work, offered expanded understandings of creative\u000a      agency in Spain and recognised the problems of mapping `national'\u000a      histories of performance and film across cultures of exile, migration and\u000a      global exchange shaped by postcolonialism as well as economic\u000a      globalization.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"19052","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    Heritage's work brings culture to the centre of the agenda...

The production's overall Klout score of\u000d      52.87 in 30 days was a `significant achievement.

Initial funding was from AHRB\u000d      (&#163;160k) and UK Lottery (&#163;105k). Created in partnership with a range of\u000d      Brazilian public agencies - including Boal's Centre of the Theatre of the\u000d      Oppressed (Rio de Janeiro) and the Latin American UN Agency for the Study\u000d      of Crime and Delinquency [ILANUD] - the initial stage led to a human\u000d      rights Performance Forum at the Latin American Parliament in S&#227;o Paulo\u000d      (Dec. 2001). Federal Ministry of Justice funded two further phases of the\u000d      project in 11 states between 2002-05 (c. &#163;100k in Brazilian reais).\u000a      A parallel programme focused on women prisoners was led by Lois Weaver and\u000d      Caoimhe McAvinchey (both QMUL). A further three-year research programme in\u000d      the juvenile justice system ran from 2003 with funding from the UK\u000d      Community Fund (&#163;405,000). In partnership with the BBC's Writersroom,\u000d      Heritage created a 90min play for Radio3, based on a historic case of\u000d      human rights abuse in the S&#227;o Paulo prison system (Carandiru:\u000d      broadcast 2002, 2003; shortlisted for the Sony Prize 2002).

Some takes place at the time of a performance, workshop or other\u000a      event, and feeds back immediately into the development of the research.\u000a      Some takes the form of an ongoing legacy for those engaged by and through\u000a      the research. As playwright and Yale School of Drama playwriting lecturer\u000a      Lisa Kron notes, `Lois has profoundly influenced generations of theater\u000a      makers.'\u000a    (i) On artists. The impact of Weaver's innovative, research-led\u000a      practice as a performance artist is demonstrated by the number of artists\u000a      &#8212; over twelve between 2008 and `13 &#8212; who have been inspired to emulate or\u000a      build on her work and sought her collaborative leadership as a mentor\u000a      and\/or director. Such collaborators include: Bird la Bird (2010-11);\u000a      Rosana Cade (2013); Stacy Makishi, Making of Bull the True Story\u000a      (2009-12) and The Falsettos (2013); Louise Mothersole and Rebecca\u000a      Fuller (Sh!t Theatre), Job Seekers Anonymous (2010-13); Dan\u000a      Fishback (NYC) for La Mama series, Squirts (2013); Holly Hughes, Let\u000a        Them Eat Cake (2009) and The Dog and Pony Show (bring your own\u000a        pony) (2010); and Serge Nicholson and Laura Bridgeman, The\u000a        (Trans) Mangina Monologues (2009). Artists who received direct\u000a      support from Weaver's EEC project after 2008 include Oreet Ashery, Richard\u000a      DeDominici, Sheila Ghelani and Jiva Parthipan. Artists who developed new\u000a      work with support and\/or mentoring organised by Weaver through AiR and PtP\u000a      include Helena Hunter, Kira O'Reilly, Julia Bardsley, Mehmet Sander (AiR\u000a      residencies 2009-11) and Lauren Barri Holstein, Hester Chillingworth and\u000a      Jamie Lewis Hadley (PtP 2013). Here, Weaver's research through her own\u000a      performance practice combines with her research on structures for\u000a      supporting artists; her curated events and mentoring deliver the impact of\u000a      her research to the work of other artists, and to the culture of live art\u000a      in general.\u000a    (ii) On audiences. Incorporating audiences is crucial to Weaver's\u000a      research through performance conversations, Long Tables or Porch Sitting.\u000a      Techniques for audience incorporation were developed as part of Weaver's\u000a      ongoing research into forms facilitating access and participation. In\u000a      these performances, audiences are invited to contribute photographs and\u000a      writing in the pre-show, enabling them to engage in public conversations\u000a      during the performance, based on their contributions &#8212; members of the\u000a      public are supported in their participation rather than put on the spot. Miss\u000a        America: 15+ public performances, 2008-9, in NYC, London, Boston,\u000a      Minneapolis and Zagreb (audience c. 2,000).

The impact of Weaver's\u000a      research and development of curatorial strategies is evident in a range of\u000a      significant enhancements in the UK's theatre\/performance culture,\u000a      including: expansion of live art programming (at Duckie and Chelsea\u000a      Theatre, where Weaver is on the Board of Directors); development of new\u000a      artist-led spaces\/initiatives (LADA's DIY was set up as a result of\u000a      Weaver's EEC experiments; the tenth DIY edition ran in 2013); development\u000a      of new artist development programmes at venues including the Colchester\u000a      Arts Centre (2005-the present) and (from 2012), The Junction, Cambridge.\u000a      Mark Ball, Artistic Director of LIFT since 2009, acknowledges her impact\u000a      when he writes that: `Lois Weaver opened my eyes to a new type of\u000a      performance that was conceptual, experimental, sexy but still deeply\u000a      political in nature. That introduction to what's now termed \"live art\"\u000a      changed my view of what theatre could be and do.'\u000a    The impact of Weaver's social research also takes place both in\u000a      the process of the research itself (for participants) and in its legacy\u000a      and continuation by others. Rachel Anderson, former Artangel Head of\u000a      Interaction delineates Weaver's expert MC'ing skills as Tammy at the\u000a      launch of Stay (2010): `[Weaver] managed to guide the audience\u000a      across ... a bumpy terrain with absolute sensitivity, respect and\u000a      humour... [Weaver] successfully created a beautiful celebration whilst\u000a      also holding the severity and seriousness of the context in equal\u000a      position.'\u000a    (i) DemTech devised methods to engage participants often excluded\u000a      from digital and new media technology in discussions about digital\u000a      technology design. Workshops involved 36 participants from local groups:\u000a      Bow Women's Choir, The Geezers, S-AGE at the Sundial Centre and\u000a      Association of Greater London Older Women (AGLOW), who worked alongside\u000a      interactive design students and the project researchers\/artists. The\u000a      research was disseminated for a general public through The Not Quite\u000a        Yet Exhibit at Space Gallery (2008) featuring works by five artists\u000a      commissioned to respond to the research conducted in the workshops, a\u000a      related symposium and a professional development DVD resource for\u000a      designers, activists and policymakers (www.spacestudios.org.uk\/whats-on\/exhibitions\/the-not-quite-yet).\u000a      The impact of the original research includes work undertaken by the\u000a      participants following DemTech's formal events, including projects by\u000a      AGLOW, who won a Community Cohesion Award from the London Health\u000a      Commission in 2010 for `performance work challenging ageism across service\u000a      deliverers and getting people talking about good practice and how it can\u000a      be achieved.'\u000a    (ii) Participatory events in which Weaver has drawn on her\u000a      research to engage non-specialist and often marginalised publics. Most of\u000a      these involve Tammy WhyNot. Five public performances of What\u000a        Tammy Needs to Know about Getting Old and Having Sex (2008-13)\u000a      (estimated total audience 600); public workshop with 10 lesbian\u000a      asylum-seekers using personae to support participants in the confident\u000a      expression of their sexual identity and assertion of rights claims, with\u000a      audience of c. 120 family, friends, artists and activists, as part\u000a      of Stay, an Artangel project led by Oreet Ashery (2010); Tourist\u000a        Information Wanted (2010) with Stacy Makishi, part of Alternative\u000a      Village F&#234;te, produced by Home Live Art for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee,\u000a      in which members of the public were invited to remember events in their\u000a      own lives for which they would like to have a `Jubilee' (350\u000a      participants); What Tammy Found Out (2013) performance at Contact\u000a      Theatre, Manchester (audience c.170); five-day residency in a retirement\u000a      home in Varazdin, Croatia with c. 35 residents and staff, on\u000a      issues of health, sexuality and aging (2013), culminating in five films\u000a      and a live performance (audience of 125); What Tammy Needs to Know\u000a        About Being Femme (2013), City of Women Festival, Ljubljana,\u000a      audience c.150 (also with a Long Table on Gender and Drag).\u000a    (iii) The widespread use of the `open source' technologies developed\u000a      under the Public Address Systems (PAS) umbrella. Weaver herself\u000a      has hosted 26 Long Tables since 2008, of which 17 were in theatres,\u000a      festivals or related non-HEI contexts in Glasgow, London, New York and\u000a      Boston. Other people have organised them in Sydney, Pittsburgh, London and\u000a      New York. Events have involved discussion of human rights, technology\u000a      design, feminism, autobiography, labour, riots in London, Afrofuturism,\u000a      performance art and sexuality, with c.1,500 participants. Other\u000a      PAS events include Porch Sitting for the Future of Queer Performance,\u000a      La Mama, NY (2012), with 75 participants, leading directly to enhanced\u000a      LGBT youth programming at La Mama and the establishment of an annual queer\u000a      youth festival, Squirts; Getting On: A Back Stage Tour (2013),\u000a      three workshops using theatrical language to increase conversation on fear\u000a      of aging with elder groups in San Francisco and London (25-30 participants\u000a      and pamphlet for dissemination of workshop methodology); a workshop to\u000a      present and disseminate PAS with c. 20 artists and activists, CREATE,\u000a      Dublin, 2013; and launch of Public Address Systems website, 2013.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Lois Weaver joined QMUL Drama in 1997. Her research-led\u000a      practice as artist, curator and activist has had substantial impact within\u000a      two areas. First, within the cultural world of live art she has influenced\u000a      the practice of both emerging and established artists, and the programming\u000a      and curation of performance. She has facilitated, mentored and directed a\u000a      range of artists; opened up new spaces for performance's production and\u000a      presentation; and actively supported other curators in the expansion of\u000a      live art programming, especially in London. Second, Weaver's research into\u000a      forms of public dialogue &#8212; her `Public Address Systems' &#8212; has had impact\u000a      in the wider social field, leading to events and projects around the world\u000a      in which citizens of diverse perspectives and backgrounds, often excluded\u000a      from public discourse on grounds of age, class, gender and sexuality, have\u000a      been able to contribute meaningfully to discussions of urgent social\u000a      issues, including human rights, sexuality, aging and new technologies.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Queen Mary, University of London","InstitutionName":"Queen Mary, University of London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007775}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"5206379","Name":"Pittsburgh"},{"GeoNamesId":"2147714","Name":"Sydney"},{"GeoNamesId":"3186886","Name":"Zagreb"},{"GeoNamesId":"5037649","Name":"Minneapolis"},{"GeoNamesId":"2964574","Name":"Dublin"},{"GeoNamesId":"5391959","Name":"San Francisco"},{"GeoNamesId":"2174003","Name":"Brisbane"},{"GeoNamesId":"6167865","Name":"Toronto"},{"GeoNamesId":"4930956","Name":"Boston"},{"GeoNamesId":"3196359","Name":"Ljubljana"},{"GeoNamesId":"3337528","Name":"Varaždinska Županija"},{"GeoNamesId":"5128581","Name":"New York City"},{"GeoNamesId":"2964574","Name":"Dublin City"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a(i) Since 2007, the Split\u000a          Britches Video Archive has been held at the Hemispheric\u000a      Institute Digital Video Library, New York University.

In 2004, LADA awarded Weaver an &#163;8,000 One-to-One Bursary for\u000a      development of Tammy WhyNot as public engagement facilitator. This\u000a      research was submitted to RAE 2008 (What Tammy Needs to Know: Using\u000a        Persona to Facilitate Public Engagement).\u000a    \u000a(iii) Democratising Technology (DemTech). In 2007, a &#163;183,000\u000a      AHRC\/ EPSRC Designing for the 21st Century award was granted to\u000a      Weaver and co-investigators for DemTech.

Her\u000a      innovations place her research at the forefront of a turn to greater\u000a      social engagement in live art practice. Weaver's research has resonated\u000a      nationally and internationally through the dissemination of her ideas and\u000a      practices, and through their adoption by others responding to her\u000a      invitation to treat the her research outcomes as `open-source' social and\u000a      performance technologies. The two areas of Weaver's research &#8212; artistic\u000a      and social &#8212; are presented here: the artistic in sections (i) performance\u000a      and (ii) curation; and the social in section (iii) social design.\u000a    (i) As a researcher working through performance practice. Weaver's\u000a      practice is animated by a central research question: how can popular\u000a      theatrical forms, sometimes deeply conventional, be redeployed to discover\u000a      new gender possibilities, to challenge the traditions of theatrical\u000a      practice, and, above all, to engage audiences in active conversation about\u000a      their own lives? Through close engagement with feminist research and\u000a      ongoing collaborations with feminist scholars (Jill Dolan, Peggy Phelan)\u000a      and artists (Holly Hughes, Peggy Shaw), Weaver has developed a feminist\u000a      performance methodology that favours the fantastical constructions of\u000a      biographical imagination over the logics of psychological narrative. Her\u000a      performances also explore the possibilities of non-coercive, accessible\u000a      participation for audiences. The primary work which emerges from this\u000a      approach and which constitutes this research has been a series of theatre\u000a      productions created by Weaver with Split Britches, the theatre company she\u000a      co-founded in the early 1980s, including, most recently Miss\u000a            America (2008), Lost\u000a            Lounge (2009), and Ruff\u000a      ( 2012-13).\u000a    (ii) As a researcher working through curation. Weaver's curation\u000a      is shaped by feminist research and practice that seeks non-hierarchical\u000a      alternatives to existing structures for the development and presentation\u000a      of performance. In collaboration with the Live Art Development Agency\u000a      (LADA), Weaver created East End Collaborations (EEC, 1999-2009) at a time\u000a      when there was only one annual event &#8212; primarily a showcase &#8212; at which\u000a      emerging live artists could present their work. With EEC she experimented\u000a      with new formats for such platforms, adapting investigative practices from\u000a      the university research environment she had recently entered, to\u000a      incorporate critical conversations and a professional development seminar,\u000a      transforming the nature of such events through research-driven\u000a      intervention. The aim is to offer participants the tools to realise their\u000a      own artistic, social and political aspirations. This work has continued,\u000a      in collaboration with colleagues at QMUL and LADA, through QMUL-hosted\u000a      festivals of live art by early-, mid- and later-career artists: AiR\u000a          Project (2009-11) and Peopling the Palace (PtP 2013).\u000a      In addition, Weaver directed PSi#12: Performing Rights at QMUL in\u000a      2006, at which a conference and a performance festival were held\u000a      simultaneously to provide a platform for the development of research at\u000a      the intersection of political engagement and performance. These projects\u000a      presented artists whose work falls outside of dominant markets; challenged\u000a      live artists to address social issues such as human rights and age and\u000a      wage; and brought new audiences to experimental performance. Weaver's work\u000a      in this area has been pioneering in its exploration of what the research\u000a      university can contribute to the world of experimental and\u000a      socially-engaged performing arts.\u000a    (iii) As a researcher into the design of social and communicative\u000a        structures. Drawing on her research-led performance practice, Weaver\u000a      has developed a series of performance techniques and new structures for\u000a      organising public engagement, which she terms `Public Address Systems'.\u000a    (a) Personae. Weaver's performance work makes extensive use of\u000a      imaginary personae, created by Weaver or project participants. The use of\u000a      personae was developed first within the AHRC-funded research project,\u000a      Staging Human Rights (2002), in which Weaver explored the potential of\u000a      personae as roles through which participants (here, women in a Brazilian\u000a      prison) could express their desires for change, use fantasy as means of\u000a      imagining solutions to everyday problems, and perform narratives of\u000a      alternative futures. This research has continued in a range of contexts\u000a      since. In Democratising\u000a          Technology (2007-09) Weaver's use of performance techniques,\u000a      including personae, empowered groups of elders from Tower Hamlets to\u000a      design ideas for new technologies and invent solutions to problems\u000a      specifically affecting their demographic. Weaver's own main persona is her\u000a      &#252;ber-feminine Tammy\u000a          WhyNot, a country-and-western singer trying to make her way as\u000a      a lesbian performance artist. Comically na&#239;ve but enthusiastically\u000a      self-proclaimed `learner' and `non-expert', Tammy encourages audiences to\u000a      engage in dialogue on difficult questions on the basis of curiosity and\u000a      desire rather than conventional understandings of expertise.\u000a    (b) Public Address Systems, including the Long\u000a          Table and Porch Sitting. The Long Table is a conversational\u000a      performance format, also developed within Staging Human Rights,\u000a      which experiments with participation and public engagement, foregrounding\u000a      inclusivity and challenging more institutional and often hierarchical\u000a      forms of public debate. Participants gather as if at a dinner table; there\u000a      is no moderator nor any structure for debate beyond rules that anyone at\u000a      the table can speak and if you are not at the table and wish to speak all\u000a      you have to do is take a seat.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"19074","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The following impacts arose between January 2008 and July 2013.\u000d\u000a    1.

STDC received referrals from\u000d\u000a      physiotherapists working across hospital wards, exemplifying a growing\u000d\u000a      demand for ISD's incorporation in a multi-disciplinary approach to pain\u000d\u000a      management, neuro-rehabilitation and recovery post-surgery. STDC have been\u000d\u000a      invited by AHCH Pain and Sedation Service to share their findings at the\u000d\u000a      Paediatric Pain Travelling Club Annual Conference (Birmingham Children's\u000d\u000a      Hospital, April 2014); the inaugural dance practitioner presentation at\u000d\u000a      this national event. The work in relation to pain is very interesting and\u000d\u000a      encouraging. `The perception that pain will be induced by movement can\u000d\u000a      result in a reduction of spontaneous movement, increased anxiety and\u000d\u000a      associated muscle tension which can directly lead to increased pain. Dance\u000d\u000a      improvisation in the wards, encountering patients who have different\u000d\u000a      clinical conditions particularly cardiac, orthopaedic and neuromedical,\u000d\u000a      has shown that participation in the dance programme has not only reduced\u000d\u000a      patients' perceptions of their pain but that of their parents and clinical\u000d\u000a      staff as well [...] In some cases patients have spent significantly less\u000d\u000a      time in hospital because their requirement for medication and their\u000d\u000a      rehabilitation has been more rapid. ' (FS1)\u000d\u000a    3: Benefit to dance practitioners\u000d\u000a      STDC have successfully documented the effectiveness of ISD in the From\u000d\u000a        Where You Are and Invisible Duets films, greatly\u000d\u000a      facilitating sharing of approaches, experiences and insights beyond AHCH,\u000d\u000a      with both artists and health practitioners. The Foundation for Community\u000d\u000a      Dance's national annual Summer School (2013) screened From Where You\u000d\u000a        Are as an example of good practice on the Dance, Health and\u000d\u000a      Wellbeing strand of this training. STDC attracted applications for CPD\u000d\u000a      from artists and health practitioners, and are national leaders in\u000d\u000a      training dance artists in ISD in clinical settings. Eight apprentices\u000d\u000a      participated in their apprenticeship programme, with some thirty enrolling\u000d\u000a      for Healthful Dancing training weeks (2012-13), and evaluation\u000d\u000a      questionnaires confirm impact on individuals' professional development.\u000d\u000a      Participant feedback is strongly positive, with all respondents rating the\u000d\u000a      experience as very good or excellent. Examples of participants who\u000d\u000a      expanded their practice include one now working with disability dance\u000d\u000a      groups, and another now using ISD with elderly and frail clients. One\u000d\u000a      participant commented, `I felt very honoured to hear Small Things,\u000d\u000a      alongside the Guest Artists, the medical profession and families of the\u000d\u000a      children attending Alder Hey hospital, discuss and share their experience.\u000d\u000a      It was incredibly inspiring, refreshing and informative. The impact of the\u000d\u000a      work undertaken by Lisa and Catherine has been of great significance.' An\u000d\u000a      apprentice observed, `Being an apprentice has allowed me to experience new\u000d\u000a      and exciting insights into this work. The first-hand experience I received\u000d\u000a      is invaluable and has taught me so much about the importance of\u000d\u000a      somatic\/sensory work in a children's hospital and approaches on how to\u000d\u000a      deliver such work in these settings.'

Be\u000a          the Best that You Can Be (commissioned by A Handbag of Harmonies,\u000a        for Across the World, BBC Music Nation Weekend: BBC\/LOCOG\u000a        Festival, Cultural Olympiad 2012) was performed by over 700 people from\u000a        across Cheshire to 5000 people (3 March 2012). Theatre in the Quarter\u000a        reprised it for Olympic Torch relay celebrations (Chester; Tatton Park),\u000a        and for the visit of HRH Queen Elizabeth II to Chester. It was filmed to\u000a        show the process of making the work, as well as the final performance\u000a        (Other Source (OS) 2).\u000a      \u000aNew audiences in difficult to reach places: the inclusion of\u000a        schools in less affluent and deprived areas of Chester brought in people\u000a        &#8212; parents, families &#8212; who might not usually visit the theatre and\/or who\u000a        have never visited a theatre before. Direct targeting facilitated\u000a        inclusion of schools such as Blacon Primary School, with matin&#233;es and\u000a        evening performances given at Blacon Community Centre, leading to these\u000a        communities having the opportunity to engage with cultural narratives\u000a        and histories (Corroborating Statements (CS) 3 and 4).\u000a      \u000aIncreased community participation: community singers\/players &#8212;\u000a        choirs were incorporated into narratives as a body of characters;\u000a        ghostly ancestors (Forgotten Fortress); 1940s radio station\u000a        audience (Home for Christmas) and were included in all\u000a        performances, but increasing demand for participation and stage design\u000a        economies required for small venues led to the creation of teams\u000a        performing in rotation. Community participation rose from 20 choristers\u000a        (Silent Night, 2008) to 140 (A Christmas Carol, 2012) (CS\u000a        3).\u000a      \u000aIncreased community awareness of their environment: the\u000a        Hillforts project in particular led to greater engagement with, and\u000a        appreciation of, the local environment and history by people in the\u000a        community (OS 1).\u000a      \u000aExpenditure in local economies: It was company policy, where\u000a        possible, to employ locally based artists, or those originally from the\u000a        area. Impacts thus include `local spend' of company grants and artists'\u000a        income close to rehearsal location (Garden Lane Methodist Church:\u000a        rehearsal charges at &#163;500 per project); actors received Equity rates and\u000a        daily subsistence allowance (food, etc.); actors and artists rented\u000a        rooms locally (CS 3).\u000a      \u000aIncreased opportunities to see professional music theatre &#8212;\u000a        bringing musical theatre to a wider audience, either in Chester, or on\u000a        The Rural Touring Network circuit (CS 4).\u000a      \u000aAudience spend: venues in the Rural Touring scheme are\u000a        subsidised by the Network, but rely on additional audience spend:\u000a        capacity audiences mean that beverages sales and raffles can raise more\u000a        income.\u000a    \u000a    Artist Employment (See CS 3, 5)\u000a    The critical success of CCITT projects led to commissions for Theatre in\u000a      the Quarter to create five new works (2011-14).

In the census period, the company has employed over 50 artists &#8212;\u000a      actors, designers, writers, musicians, stage-managers &#8212; some of them\u000a      repeatedly, and all at Equity rates (CS 3, 5; OS 2).

During the period for which\u000a      impact is claimed, Newall was a writer of drama and music theatre,\u000a      an investigator in and of performance practice, and was commissioned on\u000a      nineteen occasions by the Nuffield Theatre, Southampton, Chester Gateway\u000a      Theatre, Theatre in the Quarter (TiQ), and Off the Ground Theatre to\u000a      produce original scripts for professional performance. This project\u000a      emerged out of the closure in 2007 of the Chester Gateway Theatre, the\u000a      city's only funded producing house (and where Newall was\u000a      writer-in-residence), but also out of a dissatisfaction with forms of\u000a      community theatre that the professional participants had previously been\u000a      commissioned to make. Whereas the Gateway was a building, TiQ is for the\u000a      most part a touring company, taking theatre to local and rural communities\u000a      and non-theatre spaces. Influenced by Mike Pearson's work in the field, Newall\u000a      designed an investigation into how latent relationships between Cheshire's\u000a      palimpsestic sites (urban and rural) and people local to the county now\u000a      might be articulated in bespoke dramatic forms (`responsive scripts') and\u000a      performance events. Newall's investigation of reminiscence and\/or\u000a      folklore (sourced from community interviews, local archives, local urban\u000a      myths, landscapes, artefacts, personal diaries etc.) underpinned the\u000a      development of Cultural capital in telling tales (CCITT),\u000a      a portfolio of community-rooted `responsive scripts' and related artefacts\u000a      (songs, etc.). CCITT consisted of a series of productions (2008-2012),\u000a      attracting repeat Arts Council England (ACE) funding and EHU research\u000a      support (teaching remission). TiQ's creative team included: Newall\u000a      (writer), Matt Baker (Artistic Director; Composer; Musical Director) and\u000a      Russ Tunney, (formerly Associate Director, Nuffield Theatre, Southampton;\u000a      Artistic Director, Pound Arts; playscripts' dramaturg; director). In\u000a      committing to involve local participants &#8212; including schoolchildren &#8212; Newall's\u000a      research speaks to a poetics of community theatre responsive to problems\u000a      raised by the summary closure of a local cultural institution.\u000a    Research questions:\u000a    1. How might relationships between a palimpsestic\u000a      landscape\/cityscape and its current inhabitants be imagined in\u000a      `responsive' playscripts?\u000a    2. What contributions and benefits might be offered and gained by\u000a      local participants, audiences and theatre artists involved in\u000a      participatory community theatre projects emerging from this investigation?\u000a    Research methodology:\u000a    1. Structured interviews, archive research, generating narrative\u000a      material realised in playscripts and lyrics, articulating and\u000a      interrogating, in content and form, traces in landscapes of `complex\u000a      articulations of history and place, the milieu of human inhabitation'\u000a      (Pearson &amp; Shanks, Theatre\/Archaeology, 2001: 39).\u000a    2. Bespoke, community-sensitive playscript and production\u000a      structures designed to enable realisation of community narratives and\u000a      stakeholder aspirations, in high quality professionally presented theatre\u000a      events. This approach was underpinned, also, by using local actors and\u000a      professionals as part of the process.\u000a    Insights 1: Responsive scripts foreground narrative archetypes and\u000a      repetitions in themes of past-in-present; artists should prioritise\u000a      creative imperatives, while responding to participants and diverse\u000a      stakeholders (Newall, `Digging to Find Something (to Write): the\u000a      Archaeology of a Creative Impulse in a Community Context', IFTR\u000a      Communities Conference, 2011).\u000a    Insights 2: Responsive scripts enable production models to\u000a      accommodate diverse &#8212; even contradictory &#8212; needs of professionals and\u000a      amateurs, and create popular forms aesthetically challenging for\u000a      audiences.\u000a    Other outcomes: Seminar presentations; public engagement workshop.\u000a      Online: article, performance videos; video documentaries.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"20509","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1835841","Name":"South Korea"},{"GeoNamesId":"248816","Name":"Jordan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Through her impact upon selected publications, media outlets, dance\u000d\u000a      groups and artists, Jordan\u000d\u000a      has challenged preconceptions about how music and dance work together and\u000d\u000a      consequently\u000d\u000a      enhanced the knowledge and experience of audiences and critics.

Citing\u000d\u000a      four ballet reviews as\u000d\u000a      examples (2008-12), he notes Jordan's ideas of mutual reinforcement and\u000d\u000a      contradiction between\u000d\u000a      media, referring to her work's impact as having one's `eyes and ears newly\u000d\u000a      made keen... I\u000d\u000a      continually recommend Moving Music to other writers and dance\u000d\u000a      enthusiasts as a primer of great\u000d\u000a      intelligence and acuity'. Spanish critic Maria Torija chose to interview\u000d\u000a      Jordan for her Por la Danza\u000d\u000a      article on Rite, because of the `unique information' she provides\u000d\u000a      about Stravinsky's ballets.\u000d\u000a      Jordan's Stravinsky research also informed discussions with Zachary Woolfe\u000d\u000a      in preparation for his\u000d\u000a      New York Times feature on Rite and Robert Craft.\u000d\u000a    Since 2008, the Mark Morris Dance Group have seized upon Jordan's\u000d\u000a      research as the opportunity\u000d\u000a      to address the grave under-representation, and misunderstanding, of the\u000d\u000a      key, musical aspect of\u000d\u000a      Morris's work. Executive Director Nancy Umanoff stresses that Jordan's\u000d\u000a      ideas on the range and\u000d\u000a      cognitive effect of Morris's musical approach play a crucial role in\u000d\u000a      developing audiences\u000d\u000a      outside the `dance ghetto', also in re-educating dance audiences and\u000d\u000a      critics who reject his\u000d\u000a      emphasis on music to appreciate multiple approaches and re-evaluate their\u000d\u000a      prejudices. Jordan's\u000d\u000a      contributions have driven the expansion of the MMDG's styles of\u000d\u000a      educational material,\u000d\u000a      demonstrating that academic depth should be made accessible to a broad\u000d\u000a      readership. `This kind of\u000d\u000a      work has opened a door and makes us re-think what we can offer', says\u000d\u000a      Umanoff, recognising a\u000d\u000a      wealth of expertise useful to audiences. Jordan has tailored her research\u000d\u000a      ideas specifically for the\u000d\u000a      MMDG website (articles on Italian Concerto and the revival of Four\u000d\u000a        Saints&#8212;a link sent to all 6,000\u000d\u000a      ticket-holders), playing a key role in the website's conceptualisation for\u000d\u000a      enhanced access prior to\u000d\u000a      its autumn 2013 re-launch. She also did so in speaking about the breadth\u000d\u000a      of Morris's musical\u000d\u000a      approach to the Friends of Pacific Northwest Ballet. Furthermore, her\u000d\u000a      original research writings on\u000d\u000a      his Dido and Aeneas, Frisson and Four Saints since\u000d\u000a      2007 have contributed to press-publicity\u000d\u000a      materials sent to promoters abroad, for instance, in Germany and Korea. In\u000d\u000a      the US, this includes,\u000d\u000a      significantly, the circuit of university-based presenters who answer to\u000d\u000a      academic communities and\u000d\u000a      their funding streams. Umanoff considers that Jordan's work `raises the\u000d\u000a      bar...deepens the\u000d\u000a      understanding of producers, press, and potential sponsors, and re-affirms\u000d\u000a      the seriousness of\u000d\u000a      Morris's work, which helps sell it'. Similar support relationships have\u000d\u000a      been forged with Richard\u000d\u000a      Alston's company, extracts from Jordan's Shimmer article included\u000d\u000a      on TheAlstonStudio.com (183\u000d\u000a      views to date, ranking 22 out of over 400 webpages, publicised in the\u000d\u000a      programme note for the UK\u000d\u000a      tour 2012-13).\u000d\u000a    Jordan's research has helped shape recent commemorations, within the\u000d\u000a      media, for instance, the\u000d\u000a      100th anniversary of the Ballets Russes (2009). Radio 3 invited her to\u000d\u000a      speak on three occasions\u000d\u000a      (2008-9) about their musical innovations (BBC RAJAR stats, based on\u000d\u000a      quarterly averages for\u000d\u000a      broadcast slot: 85k, 115k, 129k; iPlayer total: 2,496). One of these was a\u000d\u000a      live public interview prior\u000d\u000a      to a Promenade Concert, broadcast during the interval and also filmed as\u000d\u000a      podcast. After her\u000d\u000a      keynote at a public conference in Australia, ABC Classic FM interviewed\u000d\u000a      her for a programme in\u000d\u000a      their series `The Astonishing Ballets Russes' (2009).\u000d\u000a    Such impact escalated with the 2013 Rite centenary. The 45-minute BBC\u000d\u000a      Radio 3 Rite\u000d\u000a      documentary (May, 2013), presented by Jordan, enjoyed a range of\u000d\u000a      beneficiaries: the producers\u000d\u000a      (Just Radio (JR)&#8212;Susan Marling and Paul Smith), critics, promotional\u000d\u000a      publications, as well as the\u000d\u000a      listening public (RAJAR: 100k; iPlayer 3,531). The programme was listed as\u000d\u000a      `choice of the week' in\u000d\u000a      the Times and Radio Times, and highlighted in reviews in The\u000d\u000a        Daily Telegraph and Stage.\u000d\u000a      Unusually, an account of the score's legacy from the dance point of view,\u000d\u000a      it drew extensively from\u000d\u000a      the Rite chapter of Jordan's Stravinsky Dances, `the story\u000d\u000a      of the programme'. It also featured her\u000d\u000a      recent research and public outcomes derived from research publications (a\u000d\u000a      Royal Ballet\u000d\u000a      programme note and April 2013 DT article). Supporting JR practice\u000d\u000a      of moulding academic ideas for\u000d\u000a      a larger public, Jordan's research was used from the start, in preparing\u000d\u000a      the initial proposal,\u000d\u000a      identifying artist interviewees and framing questions, editorial planning,\u000d\u000a      incorporating prose from\u000d\u000a      research publications within the script, and checking script accuracy. JR\u000d\u000a      rate Jordan `a natural\u000d\u000a      presenter', able to translate her knowledge into an `accessible,\u000d\u000a      enlightening and entertaining'\u000d\u000a      programme. BBC commissioners are keen to run more programmes on dance. JR\u000d\u000a      immediately\u000d\u000a      invited Jordan to work with them again on ideas for 2013-14.\u000d\u000a    Meanwhile, Jordan's Stravinsky database and book have been widely\u000d\u000a      consulted for figures and\u000d\u000a      information on dances to Stravinsky, especially (in centenary year) on the\u000d\u000a      200 plus Rite entries: for\u000d\u000a      articles, e.g. Le Figaro (Bavelier), Sunday Times (Jays),\u000d\u000a      Por la Danza (Torija); for public talks and\u000d\u000a      V &amp; A seminars (Pritchard); for programme notes (Konaev, Bolshoi\u000d\u000a      Theatre). The database is also\u000d\u000a      valued within undergraduate and graduate teaching (e.g. Penn State,\u000d\u000a      Indiana, Oregon, Temple\u000d\u000a      and Kingston university music departments, the University of Michigan\u000d\u000a      dance department and\u000d\u000a      Royal Academy of Dancing). In Dance Now magazine, Jonathan Still\u000d\u000a      recommends Jordan's book\u000d\u000a      `unreservedly...courses in music theory for anyone working in dance,\u000d\u000a      whether they are an hour or\u000d\u000a      a year long, should be geared to understanding her analytical\u000d\u000a      approaches...'

Prickett had also articulated the particular negotiations\u000a      involved in presenting the body, in dance, in environments where neither\u000a      is promoted. She contributed to Sabri's conceptualisation, with due\u000a      cultural sensitivity, of her highly successful 2011 performances and\u000a      workshops in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. In 2012, the company became a\u000a      National Portfolio Organisation, funded by Arts Council England, a process\u000a      assisted by Prickett's analysis of funding for dance companies outside the\u000a      mainstream canon. The resulting financial stability allowed Sabri `to plan\u000a      for three years in terms of artistic vision'.\u000a    Shalini Bhalla, the creator of Just Jhoom! (an accredited\u000a      Bollywood and bharatanatyam-derived fitness genre copyrighted in 2012),\u000a      notes how our research challenged her assumptions and inspired her to\u000a      think about cultural activity within an entrepreneurial framework. She had\u000a      `focused on Bharata Natyam...only exploring avenues within that\u000a      discipline' as she had `an internal conflict - some would say snobbery -\u000a      between the classical and the popular'. She felt empowered to reassess the\u000a      hierarchies within South Asian dance, reflecting on 1. Grau's observations\u000a      (1993) that western classification of dance, into classical, folk and\u000a      primitive, tells us more about class and race than dance 2. David's\u000a      analysis of Bollywood within diasporic communities (2010) 3. Meduri's\u000a      investigation of Rukmini Devi's cultural vision (2005). She `became less\u000a      rigid in [her] thoughts about classical versus popular' and started a\u000a      Bollywood dance class. Our research helped her find the right niche for Just\u000a        Jhoom!. Becoming one of the Asian Women of Achievement 2013,\u000a      the judges commented: `Shalini [...] turned an art form into a very\u000a      successful business and is making a huge contribution to bringing an Asian\u000a      dance form to the wider community and to a full range of generations -\u000a      from the very young to the elderly.'\u000a    Our research also contributed to the development of the work of\u000a      independent artist Anusha Subramanyam, in her capacity as bharatanatyam\u000a      Programme Leader at the Centre for Advanced Training (CAT) for South Asian\u000a      and Contemporary Dance (funded by the Department for Education and hosted\u000a      by Birmingham's DanceXchange). Prickett's analysis of the ISTD syllabus\u000a      (2007) and Meduri's discussion of the dispersal of the Rukmini Devi legacy\u000a      in the diaspora (2005) helped her contextualise her teaching within a\u000a      global context. Subramanyam noted that David's research and ongoing\u000a      dialogue on dance in Indian UK society has shaped her thinking in her own\u000a      community work. Grau's work on the Sarabhais' social commitment through\u000a      dance (2013) validated Subramanyam's own artistic engagement within an\u000a      ethos of social justice. Through such recognition she feels empowered to\u000a      explore the emotive and gestural grammar of bharatanatyam and combine it\u000a      with a contemporary dance style that generally shies away from such\u000a      movement material.\u000a    Urja Desai Thakore, director of Pagrav Dance Company, came to our\u000a      research initially through an Arts Council sponsored mentorship for\u000a      research and development towards Baharan &#8212; Spring (2009).\u000a      Mentoring by David in 2008 started a journey that took her artistic output\u000a      into new directions. David's research helped illuminate and challenge the\u000a      cultural values and assumptions that she held about the place of kathak\u000a      and how it might be viewed. Today Thakore sees multiculturalism or the\u000a      global reach of South Asian dance forms as potential subject matters.\u000a      Fellow artists have noticed a marked shift in her work, commenting: `This\u000a      is something we never expected from you'.\u000a    Similarly advised by Meduri through an Arts Council mentorship in 2011,\u000a      Divya Kasturi drew upon our research dealing with identity construction\u000a      when she devised NowHere, a work that articulates two\u000a      sensibilities of `nowhere' and `now here' and negotiates boundaries\u000a      between the classical, traditional and contemporary aesthetics. Our\u000a      reflections helped her articulate such issues within her artistic\u000a      practice. The work toured internationally and was well received. A Dublin\u000a      critic described NowHere as `an interesting fusion of cultures\u000a      ...[it] depicts a journey in search of one's identity'; whilst another\u000a      critic wrote that Kasturi appeared `to shed her past upon entering a\u000a      multilayered examination of her tradition and identity'.\u000a    Long-established choreographers have also been keen to engage in\u000a      intellectual dialogue with us. Shobhana Jeyasingh, for instance, invited\u000a      Meduri as a consultant to help her unpack the way in which her\u000a      choreographic work could be analysed within a broader framework of\u000a      globalised dance and diasporic dialogues (from projects 2 and 4). The\u000a      impact of this work was such that when, for the first time since its\u000a      inception, her company was invited to undertake a ten days tour in India,\u000a      she asked Meduri to contribute to this HOME meets HOME project.\u000a      The result was the essay `Traces and Trails' (http:\/\/www.rescen.net\/Shobana_Jeyasingh\/HmH\/delhi.html),\u000a      which not only provides new spectatorial theories based on the `look' and\u000a      `trace effects' in world choreographies but also makes academic theory\u000a      accessible to a broad audience.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study details the impact of South Asian dance research on its\u000a      practitioners and organisations.

The following researchers worked individually and\u000a      collaboratively on four fully-funded interdisciplinary projects: Grau\u000a      (1993 to date), Professor of the Anthropology of Dance; Prickett, (2000 to\u000a      date), Principal Lecturer in Dance Studies; Lopez y Royo (1999 to August\u000a      2013), Reader in Dance and Visual Culture; Meduri (2005 to date), Reader\u000a      in Dance and Performance Studies; and David (2007 to date), Reader in\u000a      Dance Studies.\u000a      1. South Asian Dance in Britain: Negotiating Cultural Identity through\u000a          Dance, 1998-2001, directed by Grau with Lopez y Royo, with\u000a        contributions from David (prior to her appointment) and Prickett.\u000a    The project examined the place of South Asian dance within the\u000a      multicultural fabric of contemporary Britain. Findings indicated the\u000a      emergence of an exciting professional theatre practice in the UK and a\u000a      lively parallel community practice. It also became clear that the two\u000a      practices did not interact, and that the general public still had little\u000a      knowledge of South Asian Dance genres. On the other hand, practitioners\u000a      of, and organisations supporting, South Asian dance were keen to engage\u000a      with academic researchers; the project's Advisory Board (all from outside\u000a      academia) appreciated the opportunity to help shape the research. \u000a      2. New Directions in South Asian Dance: Postcolonial Identity\u000a          Construction, 2002-2007 led by Grau with Lopez y Royo, David, and\u000a        Prickett, and with input from Meduri.\u000a     In this project, while taking new approaches influenced by postcolonial\u000a      theory, we focused on the aesthetics (Lopez y Royo) and pedagogy\u000a      (Prickett) of the dance genres. This was a response to our collaborators'\u000a      critique that our emphasis had been on the contexts rather than on the\u000a      dance. Rich and productive debates between artists and scholars about\u000a      classicism, communication and the use of rhythm unpacked choreographic\u000a      techniques and ways of engaging with diverse audiences on issues of social\u000a      justice. The fluidity of the genres' boundaries and the process by which a\u000a      canon and a tradition are constructed and re-constructed were articulated.\u000a      Developing from project 1, the research revealed South Asian dance as a\u000a      vibrant contemporary art dance in Britain, while popular dance, especially\u000a      in its Bollywood incarnation, was gaining public recognition (David). Grau\u000a      also examined issue-based work through the collaboration with the Indian,\u000a      Ahmadabad-based NGO Centre for Non-Violence through the Arts (directed by\u000a      Mallika Sarabhai). After her appointment in 2005, Meduri's work on\u000a      performing the postcolonial archive, the transnationalism of Indian dance\u000a      and Rukmini Devi contributed to the research. \u000a      3. The Southall Story: A Cultural History of Britain's 'Little India'\u000a          since 1979, 2011-2013, a project hosted by the University of\u000a        Exeter, with David as co-investigator, documented the cultural history\u000a        of Southall, West London. David explored the multi-layered relationships\u000a        between the popular genre bhangra and socio-political organisations and\u000a        events, demonstrating that dance can operate at the centre of social\u000a        analysis and play a key role in documenting and reconstructing a\u000a        community's historical moments.\u000a      4. Interweaving Performance Cultures. Meduri joined this project,\u000a        based at the International Research Centre of the Freie Universit&#228;t\u000a        (Berlin) for the 2012-13 academic year. She examined the limits of\u000a        `interweaving' within the performance of translations of dance culture.\u000a        The year's work culminated in two international meetings open to the\u000a        general public: 1. Indian Dance in a Global Age (Berlin) a\u000a        collaboration with the Tagore Centre and the Indian Council for Cultural\u000a        Relations (a reviewer commenting that Meduri `put together this whole\u000a        symposium with purpose and flair') and 2.

[7] In `Performing Idea' 41 early-career artists\u000d\u000aundertook intensive workshop processes with three influential art practitioners and three critical\u000d\u000ainterlocutors.

Each of these research concerns was extended by PM through the facilitation of\u000d\u000adiverse examinations of the status of performance within social structures and dominant critical\u000d\u000adiscourses. `Performing Idea', the first year of PM curated by Heathfield, interrogated\u000d\u000aperformance's increased visibility in contemporary culture, the aesthetic shift toward durational\u000d\u000aperformances that treat life as form, and the proliferation of artworks that foster embedded\u000d\u000aparticipation. It also investigated the changed position of performance in relation to validating\u000d\u000ainstitutions: its reformed relation to the museum, the archive and art criticism.

PM's thorough integration of early-career artists and a diverse\u000d\u000anational community of postgraduate researchers secured its immediate impacts on emergent\u000d\u000acreative practices and research agendas. These processes were documented by the British Library\u000d\u000aand accessed and contextualised through a well maintained website.

This case study addresses three\u000d\u000a      specific areas of impact, and the significance and reach of each, focused\u000d\u000a      on the research imperatives behind the subject matter and innovative form\u000d\u000a      of The Unfortunates.\u000d\u000a    i) Contribution to the preservation of cultural heritage\u000d\u000a    The adaptation of The Unfortunates brought the fictional\u000d\u000a      innovations of BS Johnson to renewed and wider public attention,\u000d\u000a      contributing to the preservation of the work and innovative formal\u000d\u000a      practices of the author, one of the leading British experimental novelists\u000d\u000a      of the twentieth century. In finding an updated dramatic equivalent to\u000d\u000a      Johnson's fictional strategies through the use of online forms and the\u000d\u000a      randomising of the broadcast's structure it also helped to support\u000d\u000a      awareness of the close relationship between the writer's experimentation\u000d\u000a      and the complexity of the subject under analysis in his novel &#8212; the\u000d\u000a      processes of memory. The recovery and preservation of this influential\u000d\u000a      novel's achievement was further enhanced by White and Steven Johnson, BS\u000d\u000a      Johnson's son, and a representative of the Johnson estate, appearing on\u000d\u000a      BBC Radio 3' `literary cabaret' show The Verb in the run-up to the\u000d\u000a      production to stage a draw which would determine the random order of the\u000d\u000a      sections for the radio broadcast. Ping-pong balls were given the name of\u000d\u000a      fictional footballers featured in the book. Each name was linked to one of\u000d\u000a      the sections and the order in which the studio guests drew the balls\u000d\u000a      decided the order in which the sections would be broadcast. The show also\u000d\u000a      featured a discussion of Johnson's career, work and approach to writing.\u000d\u000a      In addition, White contributed a Blog for the BBC Radio 3 website which\u000d\u000a      demonstrated the manner in which Johnson's fictional techniques found an\u000d\u000a      updated equivalence in radio studio practices. The beneficiaries in this\u000d\u000a      case were the radio audience (the audiences for BBC Radios 3 and 4, as\u000d\u000a      well as the public who had access to and visited the websites associated\u000d\u000a      with these stations) and, as an indicative example of how impact regarding\u000d\u000a      the promotion and re-presentation of the work of cultural heritage might\u000d\u000a      function, the BS Johnson estate. White's wider project of adapting a range\u000d\u000a      of texts concerned with the performance of memory and\/or of subjectivity\u000d\u000a      has also aided the preservation of cultural heritage in bringing to\u000d\u000a      further public prominence the work of Henry James and JG Ballard.\u000d\u000a    ii) Contribution to processes of memorialisation\u000d\u000a    White's underpinning research exploration of the presentation of memory\u000d\u000a      informed the dramatisation of The Unfortunates and impacted on the\u000d\u000a      radio audience through the broadcast, the adaptation foregrounding the\u000d\u000a      exploration of the processes of memory both in its subject matter and in\u000d\u000a      its dramaturgy. In the case of The Unfortunates the decision to\u000d\u000a      adapt a text concerned with finding an innovative structure to highlight\u000d\u000a      the processes of memory was in part a result of strategies employed in\u000d\u000a      White's previous ...Angry Brigade drama, bringing contrasting\u000d\u000a      narratives to the fore and playing out through the arrangement of textual\u000d\u000a      elements a collision between conflicting accounts of events, moments and\u000d\u000a      their significance. In addition the online version provided a direct,\u000d\u000a      interactive audience encounter with a shifting text and its meanings, both\u000d\u000a      as an exploration of memory and as a demonstration of the challenge to\u000d\u000a      conventional linear narrative of experimental techniques. In this case the\u000d\u000a      beneficiaries were the public audience, though the work also impacted on\u000d\u000a      the BBC and the BS Johnson estate. White's adaptation of Henry James' The\u000a        Ambassadors also foregrounded the processes of memory &#8212; James'\u000d\u000a      protagonist, Lambert Strether, played in the production by Henry Goodman,\u000d\u000a      is, like Bryan in The Unfortunates, forced to confront the\u000d\u000a      disjunction between past and present in another city, Paris. A review of\u000d\u000a      the production by Moira Petty for The Stage stated that `Graham\u000d\u000a      White has excavated deep into the archaeology of The Ambassadors... and\u000d\u000a      come up with an exquisite and subtle drama...built up in layers and daubs,\u000d\u000a      like oil on canvas, until the glistening accretion becomes quite mesmeric'\u000d\u000a      (21\/11\/11).\u000d\u000a    iii) Contribution to formal innovation in broadcasting\u000d\u000a    In this case the beneficiaries were both the audience and the BBC itself,\u000d\u000a      whose editorial and broadcast practices were adapted as a result of The\u000a        Unfortunates' formal innovations. The randomised broadcast was\u000d\u000a      available for the usual week after transmission on the BBC iPlayer, but\u000d\u000a      the provision of the online version required changes to usual broadcasting\u000d\u000a      practices. This included, the extension of the availability to three\u000d\u000a      months and the devising of a new form of website presence for the drama &#8212;\u000d\u000a      the carousel of images allowing the audience to scroll through the\u000d\u000a      sections of the production. The significance of the innovative form was in\u000d\u000a      part evidenced by critical responses to the production, for example `a\u000d\u000a      remarkable radio play; moving, tender, thought-provoking, reminiscent of\u000d\u000a      Joyce's Ulysses but easier to grasp. The memories, evocatively\u000d\u000a      dramatised as short audio flashbacks, soon came flooding back in no\u000d\u000a      particular order, which is the point of the book's structure; and, in a\u000d\u000a      clever post-broadcast addition that I'm keen to try, the play's dedicated\u000d\u000a      Radio 3 website now offers listeners the option of hearing 18 of the\u000d\u000a      individual segments in any order' (Pete Naughton, Daily Telegraph,\u000d\u000a      17\/10\/10). Such critical responses provide a record of the impact of the\u000d\u000a      work's approach to questions of narrative and memory. Further evidence of\u000d\u000a      the significance of the work includes the winning of the 2012 BBC Audio\u000d\u000a      Drama Award for Innovation for the production. The citation for the award\u000d\u000a      described this as a `beguiling blend of great storytelling and an\u000d\u000a      innovative approach to structure' which `pushed the boundaries of audio\u000d\u000a      adaptation'. While other of White's adaptations during the census period\u000d\u000a      appeared in more conventional broadcast slots and forms, the work\u000d\u000a      contributed to innovation in content &#8212; both The Drowned World and\u000d\u000a      Concrete Island brought the work of JG Ballard to mainstream radio\u000d\u000a      in the context of BBC Radio 4's `Dangerous Visions' season of dystopian\u000d\u000a      dramas in 2013.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Graham White's research has had an impact on the preservation of cultural\u000d\u000a      heritage, on processes of memorialisation and on formal innovation in\u000d\u000a      broadcasting practice. His work on the performance of memory and the\u000d\u000a      presentation of the self, explored particularly in public legal processes\u000d\u000a      of historical reconstruction, fed into his creation of a series of\u000d\u000a      original and adapted radio dramas during the census period.

This led to\u000d\u000a      research focused on the role of memory and the `play' of performance in\u000d\u000a      the self-presentation of individual witnesses and protagonists in\u000d\u000a      significant historical events, and on the clash between documentary\u000d\u000a      sources and witness voices in resulting accounts of such events. White has\u000d\u000a      investigated the `playing' and narration of memory by witnesses in a\u000d\u000a      series of research articles and book chapters published between 2006 and\u000d\u000a      2011 dealing with public legal processes, in part funded by an AHRC\u000d\u000a      research award titled Appearing Before The Tribunal: Performance and\u000d\u000a        the Public Inquiry in the West since the `60's. These publications\u000d\u000a      included research on witness self-presentation in the context of the\u000d\u000a      `Bloody Sunday' Tribunal, on narratives surrounding witnesses at the Hague\u000d\u000a      trial of Slobodan Milosevic, and on the characterisation of witness\u000d\u000a      performance in a number of trials and tribunals in which conflicting\u000d\u000a      accounts of what occurred in the courtroom have become significant in the\u000d\u000a      development of contemporary conspiracy theories. In 2006, interest in the\u000d\u000a      implications for narrative form of the complex questions of representation\u000d\u000a      exemplified by such material led him to propose an adaptation of Laurence\u000d\u000a      Sterne's novel The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman\u000d\u000a      - a text famously concerned with the performance of the self and the\u000d\u000a      reconstruction through subjective memory of the complex and shifting\u000d\u000a      patterns of the past. This critically acclaimed production for BBC Radio 4\u000d\u000a      staged the adaptation in ten 15 minutes segments, and foregrounded\u000d\u000a      Tristram as the narrator of his own life, struggling both with the\u000d\u000a      difficulties of memory and the demands of the dramatic structure in which\u000d\u000a      he was presenting it.\u000d\u000a    This research and research-driven practice, has been explored further\u000d\u000a      since 2008 through the dramatisation for radio of a series of novels which\u000d\u000a      foreground the performance of memory. White dramatised B.S. Johnson's 1969\u000d\u000a      `book in a box'; The Unfortunates, for BBC Radio 3 in 2010, with\u000d\u000a      the protagonist, Bryan, played by Martin Freeman. Johnson's novel was\u000d\u000a      originally published in a series of interchangeable sections to be read &#8212;\u000d\u000a      apart from the first and last &#8212; in any order. This structure was intended\u000d\u000a      to mimic the processes of memory which lay at the heart of the book's\u000d\u000a      narrative, in which a sportswriter encounters memories of people and\u000d\u000a      events on a visit to a familiar town. The novel was adapted by White in 18\u000d\u000a      sections which were randomly shuffled prior to broadcast, as well as being\u000d\u000a      made available in an online interactive `shufflable' version, foregrounded\u000d\u000a      the `play' of memory through these structural devices. Other adaptations\u000d\u000a      for BBC Radio during the census period (The Ambassadors, starring\u000d\u000a      Henry Goodman, The Drowned World, with Hattie Morahan and Tim\u000d\u000a      McInnerny and Concrete Island, with Andrew Scott) have also focused\u000d\u000a      on texts in which the protagonists and narrators have been bound up in the\u000d\u000a      attempt to define themselves and their experience, and in their\u000d\u000a      self-conscious voicing of this process.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"20912","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The early stages of writing the opera included composer and librettist\u000a      consulting\u000a      representatives of 11 anti-trafficking organisations (principally City\u000a      Hearts, which also later\u000a      facilitated a meeting in sheltered housing between trafficking victims and\u000a      opera cast members).\u000a      These organisations gave valuable feedback to ensure that the content of\u000a      the opera was as\u000a      accurate as possible. Meanwhile, the wider potential of the opera to\u000a      effect change in public\u000a      attitudes was part of the agenda from the beginning.\u000a    A website, YouTube channel (3000 hits), and Facebook page (160 followers)\u000a      were set up.\u000a      Introductions to senior policy-makers were made through the offices of\u000a      Kaye's MP, Bob Walter,\u000a      who backed the project (http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/qfabfsr)\u000a      and subsequently arranged a meeting\u000a      between librettist and composer, and the Immigration Minister, Damian\u000a      Green, at a reception\u000a      hosted by the Prime Minister at 10 Downing Street to mark Anti-Slavery\u000a      Day, 17 October 2011.\u000a      They also met other politicians and NGO leaders at the House of Lords,\u000a      including Sir Anthony\u000a      Steen, Chairman of the Human Trafficking Foundation. Representatives of\u000a      the UN Global\u000a      Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking (UN GIFT) were quick to endorse the\u000a      project,\u000a      understanding its potential: Siria Gastelum, UN GIFT's Public Information\u000a      Officer, said: `We\u000a      commend this effort to engage and inspire the anti-trafficking community\u000a      while raising\u000a      awareness about human trafficking'. Tony Lloyd, MP for Central Manchester,\u000a      visited rehearsals\u000a      at the RNCM and recorded an interview (http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/p2ht7e6),\u000a      in which he talked about\u000a      the potential for the opera to make an impact on people beyond `just\u000a      entertainment': `If it takes\u000a      things through to people who've not thought about these issues before,\u000a      it's an amazing\u000a      service...

For example, a story by Glyn Mon Hughes trailing the\u000a      performances in The\u000a        Liverpool Daily Post on 1 March 2012 was run on its Arts pages on 4\u000a      March 2012\u000a      (http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/o6c3rq2),\u000a      quoting statistics on trafficking and comments from the Director,\u000a      Caroline Clegg, about the meeting between the cast and victims of sex\u000a      trafficking. Two days\u000a      later, The Independent carried an article quoting Sir Jonathan\u000a      Miller, who said that `the project\u000a      showed no subject should be off-limits', and also Iqtadar Hasnain, a\u000a      spokesman for Anti-Slavery\u000a      International, who said `As far as we're aware, there has never been an\u000a      opera on this\u000a      subject.

The latter's involvement included an extended Twitter interview\u000a      with the librettist\u000a      (http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/oavdpja).The\u000a      organisation provided `How to Respond' packs that were\u000a      distributed at the Liverpool premi&#232;re and they also helped with PR. Purple\u000a      Teardrop had an\u000a      information stall in the foyer at the RNCM performance, and were supported\u000a      by volunteers\u000a      from Soroptomist International, which also endorsed the opera. A\u000a      spokesperson from Purple\u000a      Teardrop reported that for them, being `partners' of the opera helped them\u000a      `extend the public's\u000a      awareness of human trafficking and its victims to both organisations'\u000a      followers and supporters', and\u000a      they used Twitter, Facebook and their own website to promote their\u000a      partnership. Following the\u000a      second performance of the opera, a member of the audience blogged: \"I saw\u000a      this performance\u000a      last night at the RNCM. It was an incredibly powerful and moving piece ...\u000a      This thought-provoking\u000a      opera deserves a much wider platform as it demonstrates how modern opera\u000a      can,\u000a      and should be used.\" A short film of rehearsals of Anya 17 had had\u000a      700 views on YouTube by\u000a      31 July 2013. The two performances were seen by live audiences totalling\u000a      632 people, with a\u000a      further 812 viewings of a YouTube `showreel' (http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/pjjplk3)\u000a      by 31 July 2013.\u000a    Anya17 was positively reviewed in the Sunday Times and\u000a      subsequently won 'Best Stage or\u000a      Film Production Dealing with Human Trafficking, 2012', presented by John\u000a      Bercow, MP at the\u000a      Speaker's House on 17 October 2012 in the presence of British MPs,\u000a      parliamentarians and\u000a      former ministers from across the EU, as well as journalists, police and\u000a      border agency staff, and\u000a      NGOs.\u000a    Among those who attended the first performance was the Chairman of the\u000a      Friendship\u000a      Foundation (UK-Romania). The Foundation is active in increasing public\u000a      awareness of human\u000a      trafficking, seeing it as vital to changing policy: \"that's how\u000a      governments get cajoled into\u000a      making laws\". The Foundation immediately saw the potential of taking Anya17\u000a      to Romania and\u000a      presenting it to policy makers and campaigning organisations as an\u000a      innovative way of\u000a      promoting a strong message from a `receiving' country such as the UK to a\u000a      `source' country\u000a      such as Romania. A successful application for funding was made to Arts\u000a      Council England for\u000a      &#163;5k a further award of &#163;1,860 from the RNCM in June 2013, so that a\u000a      performance of Anya17\u000a      could be part of the Third International Symposium on Human Trafficking in\u000a      Arad, Romania, on\u000a      17 October 2013.\u000a    Immediately following the 2012 premi&#232;re, two international opera\u000a      companies became aware of\u000a      the work and decided during the course of their planning for the 2013-14\u000a      seasons during\u000a      summer 2012, to stage the opera. Arrangements were made for the first\u000a      fully-staged run, at the\u000a      Stadttheater, Meiningen, Germany (November-December, 2013), and for the US\u000a      premi&#232;re at\u000a      Opera Parall&#232;le in San Francisco (June, 2014). The Executive Director of\u000a      Opera Parall&#232;le, Tod\u000a      Brody, describes how `the opera company's first focus is the artistic\u000a      quality of the work, but the\u000a      power of art to bring awareness, and to change minds, is something that's\u000a      of great interest and\u000a      concern to us'. In preparation for the production, they assembled a\u000a      Community Taskforce of\u000a      organisations, including the SAGE project (www.sagesf.org),\u000a      whose `mission is to improve the\u000a      lives of persons who have experienced or are at risk of sexual\u000a      exploitation, human trafficking,\u000a      violence and other forms of trauma'.

It aims to educate about the real lives\u000a      behind the trade in\u000a      humans, primarily for sexual slavery.\u000a    Principal research insights which relate to the impacts were:\u000a    \u000a      The strong evidence of the potential to engage civil society\u000a        organisations, policy-makers\u000a        and their constituencies through the medium of opera, in ways that go\u000a        beyond\u000a        the normal use of high art simply as a means of fund-raising.\u000a      potential of the publicity surrounding the opera and its performances\u000a        in a relatively\u000a        niche context (live performance of contemporary music) to help raise\u000a        wider public\u000a        awareness of human trafficking was quickly understood by international\u000a        anti-trafficking\u000a        organisations, who found ways to use it to support their campaigns to\u000a        influence policy-makers\u000a        and make changes in UK law.\u000a      The effectiveness of uncompromisingly `contemporary' music in the form\u000a        of an opera\u000a        (rather than, for example, musical theatre) effectively to articulate a\u000a        highly emotive\u000a        `real-life' story on a topic never before tackled in the medium.

For example, most high\u000a      schools, colleges and local communities in the US have at least one wind\u000a      orchestra, and for many school students and communities, bands are the\u000a      primary form of music-educational experience. Youth and school ensembles\u000a      at local and national level are a feature of the musical life in all the\u000a      countries listed above. There are secular professional, and many\u000a      elite-level military wind ensembles in many countries, as well as a\u000a      thriving music publishing and commercial recording sector servicing these\u000a      markets. WASBE is a key force in developing standards and promoting\u000a      innovative new musical works; it has a membership of over 1000 individuals\u000a      and organizations in more than 50 countries from throughout the world. It\u000a      is `completely dedicated to enhancing the quality of the wind band\u000a      throughout the world and exposing its members to new worlds of repertoire\u000a      and musical culture'. Likewise, the British Association of Wind and Brass\u000a      Ensembles (BASBWE) includes in its objectives the following: `The wind\u000a      band\/ensemble has been the fastest growing medium in `classical'\u000a      music-making in the latter part of the twentieth century [...] A crucial\u000a      role has been in developing awareness of repertoire and ensuring that\u000a      there is a constant supply of new music, without which the whole movement\u000a      could stagnate'. And in the words of William V. Johnson, president of\u000a      WASBE, `The RNCM has done much more than helping to change behaviours and\u000a      impacting the international field of wind orchestras. It is the birthplace\u000a      of the modern international wind band movement' - the organisation was,\u000a      indeed, founded at the RNCM in 1981, largely thanks to the influence of\u000a      one individual, Tim Reynish, who remains one of the international\u000a      movement's leading directors, educators and commissioner of new work'. In\u000a      2000 the RNCM was awarded the Queen's Anniversary Prize for Higher and\u000a      Further Education for `the outstanding and pioneering work of its Wind\u000a      Orchestra'.\u000a    1. Composition (examples)\u000a    It is against this background that many new works for wind orchestra\u000a      (including those listed above) have been created, mostly developed through\u000a      rehearsal, performance and recording by the RNCM's own world-class\u000a      ensemble under its various staff conductors, and then disseminated into\u000a      the wider movement through publication, advocacy, educational events and\u000a      continual take-up by ever more ensembles around the world, contributing to\u000a      the stimulation of innovations in their repertoire. For example, between\u000a      1993 and 2013, Adam Gorb published 25 works, ranging from pieces\u000a      specifically designed for youth and other beginner ensembles (6 of his\u000a      works are in the top 35 downloads from the specialist publisher of sheet\u000a      music for amateur wind ensembles, G &amp; M Brand), to sophisticated and\u000a      demanding commissions for professional ensembles. Examples of the later\u000a      are Towards Nirvana (for the Tokyo Kosei Wind Orchestra), and Adrenaline\u000a        City, commissioned and performed by a consortium of major US College\u000a      ensembles, later programmed by the elite US Marine Corps Band in 2011. Farewell\u000a      is a symphonic-length work commissioned by the National Youth Wind\u000a      Orchestra of Wales that has since been widely taken up internationally by\u000a      upper-level ensembles. It was featured at the WASBE conference in Taiwan\u000a      in 2011, performed by Philharmonic Winds, Singapore - one of south-east\u000a      Asia's leading wind orchestras. Professor Eugene Corporon, one of the US's\u000a      leading wind orchestra conductors and teachers, says `I consider him to be\u000a      one of the most important Wind Band composers of our time. Many of his\u000a      contributions have broadened our repertoire and become well respected as\u000a      legacy works that have advanced the medium'.\u000a    2. Performance (examples)\u000a    Reliable evidence of performances worldwide that can be evidenced is\u000a      impossible to achieve; recordings and YouTube viewings can help give\u000a      snapshots of impact. Among Gorb's most widely-performed works are the\u000a      intermediate-level Yiddish Dances and senior-level Awayday.\u000a      The former has been issued on CD 5 times, 2 since 2008; currently on\u000a      YouTube are recordings of 21 performances by different high school and\u000a      college bands in the US, UK, Italy, Spain Mexico, Korea, Austria and\u000a      Germany with a total of 139,353 viewings between 2008 and July 213;\u000a      equivalent figures for Awayday are: 5 CDs (1 since 2008) by some\u000a      of the leading professional ensembles in the world, one of which features\u000a      as the soundtrack to a YouTube videogame (20,578 viewings). 22\u000a      performances in the US, UK, New Zealand, Thailand and Germany with a total\u000a      of 29,419 viewings\u000a    A different kind of impact was achieved by Gorb's Eternal Voices,\u000a      `dedicated to all Royal Marines and their families who have given the\u000a      ultimate sacrifice and have been affected by modern conflicts since the\u000a      year 2000'. The work combines symphonic wind orchestra with a full chorus,\u000a      soloists and a narrator. It was first performed in Exeter Cathedral in\u000a      November 2010 and mixes texts by the poet, Ben Kaye, with excerpts from\u000a      BBC news bulletins: `a haunting, sobering, and beautiful piece' said one\u000a      reviewer; another blogger wrote `Exeter audiences are not given to many\u000a      standing ovations, so they were obviously delighted with the evening'. It\u000a      was attended by 1,020 people and later repeated at Coventry Cathedral in\u000a      October 2011 (attendance c.500) and Chichester Cathedral in October 2012\u000a      (attendance c.487). After the latter, a comment was posted on the Royal\u000a      Marines' website: `I ... was completely blown away with the whole evening\u000a      ... everyone in my group agreed it was one of the most poignant and moving\u000a      events they had been to in recent years'.\u000a    The main beneficiaries of educational work are players and young\u000a      conductors introduced to new works and coached at numerous courses of by\u000a      conductors Clark Rundell and Mark Heron and RNCM instrumental specialists.\u000a    RNCM Wind Orchestra, with its two conductors, Rundell and Heron, together\u000a      with composers Gorb and Carpenter, and Senior Oboe Tutor, Melinda Maxwell\u000a      (oboe), were in residence at the 2009 WASBE conference in Cincinnati, OH,\u000a      attended by 12,000-15,000 students and adult band members. Over the course\u000a      of six days, they performed works by five RNCM composers (Carpenter, Gorb,\u000a      Gregson, Horne and Emily Howard). In addition, there was an open\u000a      rehearsal; a repertoire session and another on `Effective Rehearsal\u000a      Strategies' led by Rundell; an oboe master-class by Maxwell; `composer\u000a      drop-in sessions'; and a pre-concert talk. Public concerts included the US\u000a      premi&#232;re of Carpenter's Doubles concerto for oboe and clarinet\u000a      (REF2), the world premi&#232;res of Gorb's Tranquility (Festival\u000a      commission), David Horne's Waves and Returns, Emily Howard's, Deep\u000a        Soul Diving, and Edward Gregson's classic, Metamorphoses\u000a      (with electronics).

The\u000a      2009 Weekend was specifically devoted to Wind Orchestras (in collaboration\u000a      with BASBWE) attended by 370 band members and a further 164 individual\u000a      players (excluding RNCM students), who participated in a total of 19\u000a      workshops given by College staff and international `star' teachers.\u000a      Another 918 non-student audience members joined them at five public\u000a      concerts. All the music played and workshopped over the weekend was\u000a      demanding contemporary works, including the world premi&#232;re of Gorb's Freedom,\u000a      as well as Towards Nirvana and Farewell. The Oct. 2010 the\u000a      RNCM\/BASBWE Wind and Brass weekend included c. 20 workshops and\u000a      master-classes for ensembles, and for all individual wind orchestra\u000a      instruments at both senior and junior levels, as well as 13 concerts:\u000a      attended by 2,400 in total (excluding RNCM students); in Nov. 2012 the\u000a      Wind Weekend was devoted to double-reed instruments, and included\u000a      master-classes and performances by 13 international oboe and bassoon\u000a      celebrities, all sponsored by major European instrument manufacturers:\u000a      attended by 1,052 people (excluding RNCM students).\u000a    Mark Heron exemplifies the RNCM's approach to invigorating repertoire and\u000a      standards in wind orchestra practice through his work as a course director\u000a      and conductor, introducing new works including by RNCM composers: at\u000a      Canford Summer School, with a 50-strong ensemble and 20-30 student\u000a      conductors, every year since 2008; as guest conductor of the National\u000a      Youth Wind Orchestra of Israel (April and June 2011); as lecturer and\u000a      conductor at national wind festivals in Ireland (April, 2009), Spain (Nov.\u000a      2009), Portugal (March 2011), London, Royal Academy of Music (Feb. 2008);\u000a      he led advanced conducting schools in Melbourne for 30 students (Jan.\u000a      2013) and another in Slovenia for 10 students (July 2013).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Works written by RNCM composers, performances and commercial recordings\u000a      of new music by the world-renowned RNCM Wind Orchestra and its staff\u000a      conductors, advocacy and leadership in UK and world-wide organisations,\u000a      and copious educational spin-offs from research, have, over the past 20\u000a      years, made significant impacts on the development of both the quality and\u000a      innovative practices in the huge international wind orchestra movement.\u000a      New compositions in particular, have contributed to a notable\u000a      re-invigoration of creative practice, inspiring successive generations of\u000a      musicians to engage with demanding contemporary music in what has\u000a      traditionally been an artistically conservative medium.

Compositions for wind orchestra\u000a    A variety of works exemplify innovative writing in terms of style, genre,\u000a      and technical demands, both at the elite-level for professional-level\u000a      military, college and national youth ensembles, and at intermediate\u000a      student-level for school and community symphonic wind orchestras.\u000a    Widespread international dissemination through performances and\u000a      recordings has contributed to the recognition by the international wind\u000a      orchestra community of these works as particularly significant in terms of\u000a      quality, and the ways in which they challenge ensembles to break out of\u000a      the standard diet of marches, film-music medleys and competition pieces\u000a      that were pervasive until the 80s and mid-90s. Largely thanks to advocacy\u000a      for challenging compositions in recent years, and a burgeoning of new\u000a      music writing, the repertoire base has been transformed.\u000a    The RNCM's pivotal role in stimulating high-quality composition for wind\u000a      orchestra has been continuous since the start of the impact period (1993),\u000a      although this continues a record of innovative work in the medium begun in\u000a      the 1970s, both by RNCM composers such as Anthony Gilbert (retired 1999)\u000a      and Edward Gregson (retired July 2008), and those commissioned by the RNCM\u000a      (who include a roll-call of later 20th-century British composers in the\u000a      field, including Michael Tippett, Thea Musgrave, Richard Rodney-Bennett,\u000a      David Bedford, Judith Bingham, Derek Bourgeois, etc.). This was primarily\u000a      due to one key figure in the foundation of the international wind\u000a      orchestra movement, Tim Reynish, Head of the RNCM School of Wind and\u000a      Percussion from 1977 until his retirement in 2002, now Emeritus Tutor in\u000a      Chamber Music. His continuing activities, beside extensive international\u000a      conducting, teaching and advocacy, include Editor of Maecenas Music for\u000a      bands and wind ensembles.\u000a    Among the most successful composers in the medium overall is Adam Gorb\u000a      (Head of the RNCM School of Composition): `One of Britain's top composers'\u000a      (The Jewish Chronicle 7 October 2010). Gorb's music is highly\u000a      adventurous in terms of orchestration (for example in their extensive use\u000a      of percussion and idiomatic writing for individual instruments),\u000a      semi-programmatic in adventurous ways, and often allusive of dance, folk\u000a      music and non-Western sounds. He has also been a pioneer in bringing the\u000a      wind-orchestra into other genres, notably oratorio. Other staff composers,\u000a      including Gary Carpenter, David Horne, Emily Howard and Andy Scott have\u000a      made important and sometimes mould-breaking contributions to the\u000a      repertoire. Scott's jazz concerto for two saxophones, Dark Rain is\u000a      a case in point.\u000a    2. Performance and commercial recordings of significant wind orchestra\u000a      repertoire\u000a    Regular programming of these works internationally by a huge number and\u000a      range of ensembles has enriched the artistic values and engagement both of\u000a      musicians and audiences. Since 1993, approximately 30 CDs of works by RNCM\u000a      composers and others have been recorded for Chandos and the specialist new\u000a      music label, NMC, as well as Polyphonic, Campion, Doyen, etc. Between 2008\u000a      and July 2013, 9 commercial CDs were released by the RNCM Wind Orchestra\u000a      under its conductors, Tim Reynish, Clark Rundell (Head of Conducting and\u000a      New Music) and Mark Heron (Tutor in Conducting).\u000a    3. Educational benefits arising from performing new music\u000a    Researchers' artistic expertise has informed interactions with thousands\u000a      of wind orchestra musicians around the world. RNCM composers and\u000a      conductors are regularly invited faculty at major international wind\u000a      orchestra festivals and summer schools and the RNCM's own major national\u000a      annual weekend courses, where they work with young players and ensembles,\u000a      introducing them to new repertoire (including research cited in this\u000a      study) and advise and encourage young composers to work in the medium.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21143","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Following the original English edition, which has sold over 2,300 copies,\u000a        Dramaturgy and Performance has contributed to international debates\u000a      about dramaturgy and the role of dramaturgs. Informal conversations with\u000a      freelance dramaturgs and graduates who are developing careers as\u000a      dramaturgs together with a statement by the dramaturg at Slovene National\u000a      Opera Theatre (SDR) (Ref 6) suggest that the book has empowered and helped\u000a      them assert a sense of professional identity and that it has enabled them\u000a      to articulate their own contribution to the theatre production process.\u000a      Dramaturgs' role within this process is rarely talked about and thus the\u000a      role of dramaturgs can be somewhat invisible. This is certainly the case\u000a      in UK theatre practice where the role is almost non-existent and rarely\u000a      credited, though Behrndt's research is referred to on several web blogs\u000a      (Ref 7).\u000a    While the book was intended for a UK and US readership, it has made a\u000a      critical contribution to highlighting dramaturgical practice in other\u000a      countries (Ref 1). DR commented that the translation of Dramaturgy and\u000a        Performance into Slovenian was `a gift' for `theatre practice in\u000a      this small country', and goes on to call the book `an important step\u000a      forward in the theory and practice which unites our visions of the\u000a      professions' future and an important tool of communication between\u000a      professional dramaturges, theatre researchers and performing art in\u000a      general' (Ref 6).\u000a    Behrndt's research has offered ways of articulating dramaturgical\u000a      processes beyond the so-called text-driven theatre. In a statement curator\u000a      and artistic director of `Prague Quadrennial` (PQ) remarks that Behrndt's\u000a      `research is quite crucial for my work as a dramaturg and a curator. Her\u000a      articles, presentations and of course Dramaturgy and Performance\u000a      have been an important support in my own research and performance-making.\u000a      First of all Behrndt's work combines practical and theoretical aspects of\u000a      dramaturgy that is often not text-based and thus hard to define and write\u000a      about.` Lotker concludes that `the work has been highly inspiring but more\u000a      than anything helpful in defining what I'm actually doing` (Ref 5). In\u000a      2012 Behrndt was invited to co-convene PQ's practitioner Platform at\u000a      Prague's Archa Theatre, focussing on highlighting dramaturgy's role in\u000a      devising and experimental theatre. This event facilited exchange between\u000a      artists and dramaturgs from all over the world (Ref 5).\u000a    A key theme in the impact of Behrndt's research is knowledge transfer\u000a      and combining academic reflection with practical know-how. The book's\u000a      publication has led to invitations to speak at events to mixed delegations\u000a      of international artists, practitioners, dramaturgs and academics (Ref 2).\u000a      However, it has also helped underpin a project that explores new models of\u000a      creative producing at the Basement, Brighton. In his invitation to\u000a      contribute to the venue`s international project on dramaturgical mentoring\u000a      of emerging artists (2012 and onwards) director of Development at the\u000a      Basement in Brighton describes the collaboration as an `exciting\u000a      opportunity to link up this practical, professional research with academic\u000a      research in the same area` (Group Ref 2).\u000a    Behrndt's impact as a dramaturg is noted through her collaboration with\u000a      professional theatre companies that hitherto did not work with dramaturgs.\u000a      The Artistic Directors for Fevered Sleep (FS) and Transport Theatre (TT)\u000a      both emphasise the critical knowledge transfer aspect of Behrndt's role.\u000a      FS remarks that Behrndt `played a central role in the conceptualisation,\u000a      development and creation' of their work and that she had been\u000a      `instrumental in the development of a dramaturgical framework for these\u000a      projects, which allowed the work to emerge through this mesh of research'.\u000a      TT acknowledges the importance of the knowledge transfer remarking that\u000a      Behrndt brought a `wealth of expertise and knowledge to the rehearsal room\u000a      which had a profound influence on the formation of the piece'. TT explains\u000a      that the dramaturg helped facilitate `objectivity and as a practitioner to\u000a      forge new ground (...)' (Ref 4).\u000a    This knowledge transfer has enabled the directors to be conceptually\u000a      ambitious and to consider new ways of approaching structure, content as\u000a      well as the documentation of their work. The documentation that Behrndt\u000a      has produced with FS has enabled the company to reflect upon their work\u000a      and to disseminate their work to a wider audience and promote their work\u000a      internationally. (Ref8&amp;9).\u000a    Behrndt's integration of dramaturgical practice and reflection into\u000a      professional theatre practice has made a difference to the way in which\u000a      the companies approach their work and has meant a positive engagement with\u000a      a critical and questioning audience perspective. FS remarks that Behrndt's\u000a      involvement with the company's work 'has made it possible for the company\u000a      to be more ambitious in terms of scale and complexity of its projects. It\u000a      is beyond question that Synne's involvement has had an impact on the reach\u000a      and success of the company's work' (Ref 3). `Synne exposed me to new\u000a      perspectives which enable me to develop as a practitioner' (Ref 4).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study refers to the work of Synne Behrndt and stems from\u000a      publications on `Dramaturgy' and her practice as a dramaturg. The impact\u000a      of Behrndt's practice and research is threefold: firstly it has raised\u000a      awareness of a little known area and professional role in theatre\u000a      production. Secondly, it has empowered dramaturgs in their work by\u000a      providing emerging and professional dramaturgs with a language to describe\u000a      and articulate their work, role and relationship to collaborators. Above\u000a      all the publications have articulated the nature of their job and the\u000a      skills and qualities that dramaturgs bring to a creative process. Thirdly,\u000a      Behrndt's research has made a difference to professional theatre companies\u000a      by introducing new dramaturgical approaches and models of critical\u000a      dissemination to their process. Her collaboration with theatre directors\u000a      has impacted on their companies' working practices, and has led to\u000a      dramaturgy and the dramaturg becoming a fully integral part of their\u000a      creative process and dissemination.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    University of Winchester\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Winchester (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Winchester","PeerGroup":"F","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10003614}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"3067696","Name":"Prague"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

In her work as a dramaturg she\u000a      seeks to embed conceptual and research-based reflection in the practical\u000a      process, in order to enhance the creative and critical potential of the\u000a      performance. Behrndt's research is therefore driven by an interest in\u000a      transferring knowledge between different contexts (the academy and\u000a      professional theatre making): thus dramaturgical practice can be\u000a      understood as a bridge between reflection and practice.\u000a    Her book Dramaturgy and Performance (2008) (Ref 1) and the\u000a      co-edited journal `New Dramaturgies' (Contemporary Theatre Review\u000a      20:2 2010) (Ref 2 &amp;3) were published together with Dr Cathy Turner.\u000a      The aim of Dramaturgy and Performance was to further an\u000a      understanding of dramaturgy through a historical and analytical\u000a      perspective whilst also highlighting the dramaturg as a creative and\u000a      valuable role within theatre production. While the book introduced\u000a      discussion of case studies that documented professional dramaturgs' work,\u000a      the authors also acknowledged the importance of distinguishing between\u000a      dramaturgy and the dramaturg arguing that a conflation of the two would\u000a      limit an understanding of dramaturgy itself. The argument follows that\u000a      dramaturgy exists even without the presence of the dramaturg.\u000a    While dramaturgy is traditionally linked to theatre and drama, the book\u000a      also made a case for a flexible and expanded application\u000a      of the term and practice. Dramaturgy was posited as a flexible, open and\u000a      slippery term that can be used differently depending on the context and\u000a      field of study; for example, the book highlighted dramaturgy's application\u000a      to other disciplines such as sociology and architecture.\u000a    In a guest-edited volume of Contemporary Theatre Review these\u000a      ideas were developed with a focus on expanding the application of the\u000a      term. Behrndt's own article discussed how dramaturgy's introduction into\u000a      dance studies has invited a re-examination of the implication of\u000a      dramaturgy, thus arguing that dramaturgy signifies a process of\u000a        interpretation and not a rigid method. The article also examined the\u000a      reasons why dramaturgy and the dramaturg are often aligned with the\u000a      presence of external authority and authoritative interpretation. This was\u000a      done in order to challenge the view that the dramaturg would restrict and\u000a      censor the artist in their creative endeavour (Ref 2&amp;3).\u000a    Since 2003 Behrndt has worked with UK directors and devising companies\u000a      (Ref 6). In this context she functions as a production dramaturg and\u000a      participates in the project from its conception through to final\u000a      production. Her role is to assist the director with research, and to\u000a      translate theoretical concepts and research into creative performance\u000a      material. In this role she transfers knowledge from the academic discourse\u000a      to a practical art context. An integral part of her role in these\u000a      processes has been to produce, write and edit documentation. This\u000a      documentation functions as a critical extension of the performance,\u000a      providing a discursive context for the work and evidencing the research\u000a      and dramaturgical discussions underpinning the performance, and it is made\u000a      available to a wider audience through the company.

(Ref 1 - 11 Aug 2011). A US reviewer of the Reader\u000d\u000a      notes that `Prentki and\u000d\u000a      Selman's discussion of Brechtian influences, popular education, and\u000d\u000a      theories of community\u000d\u000a      development are particularly strong.... The book goes far beyond simply\u000d\u000a      defining, describing or\u000d\u000a      advocating popular theatre' (Ref. 2), while the NTQ reviewer\u000d\u000a      suggests that `This book offers\u000d\u000a      detailed and noteworthy insights into a variety of practices throughout\u000d\u000a      the world' (Ref 3). Overall\u000d\u000a      this book generated new ways of thinking that influenced subsequent\u000d\u000a      practice.\u000d\u000a    The initial impact of Prentki's work came mostly from direct contact with\u000d\u000a      participants internationally,\u000d\u000a      but it is through training trainers in NGOs across disciplines around the\u000d\u000a      world that the reach and\u000d\u000a      significance of his practice have been established, helping professionals\u000d\u000a      and organisations to\u000d\u000a      adapt to changing cultural values.\u000d\u000a    In Bangladesh, he conducted one month of workshops each year for four\u000d\u000a      years from 2000-3. The\u000d\u000a      participants in these workshops represented many of the leading NGOs in\u000d\u000a      the country, thereby\u000d\u000a      enabling a swift dissemination of these practices around the entire\u000d\u000a      country. Core participants from\u000d\u000a      NGOs working in women's access to legal services, combating domestic\u000d\u000a      violence, and addressing\u000d\u000a      children's rights developed significant experience in using Theatre for\u000d\u000a      Development in their\u000d\u000a      everyday practice. As the Save the Children officer says `Still lot of\u000d\u000a      NGO's are using the TfD\u000d\u000a      process as means of raising children voices for advocating and negotiating\u000d\u000a      with the policy makers\u000d\u000a      at local and national level on the issues affecting children lives.' (Ref\u000d\u000a      4 - 1 Nov 2012) Further\u000d\u000a      influence was achieved in the HE sector: `Dhaka University included TfD in\u000d\u000a      its Masters syllabus\u000d\u000a      during the Higher Education Link project jointly implemented by British\u000d\u000a      council. Now all most all the\u000d\u000a      public university in Bangladesh included TfD as part of academic course in\u000d\u000a      particular dramatics\u000d\u000a      department.' (Ref 5).\u000d\u000a    Delegates at `Theater? Mit Mir?

Since then Prentki\u000d\u000a      has also enjoyed a\u000d\u000a      professional collaboration with Serbian NGO Zdravo da ste\/Hi Neighbour,\u000d\u000a      whose mission and\u000d\u000a      activities are aimed at protecting vulnerable groups and promoting their\u000d\u000a      development during the\u000d\u000a      long period of war and post\/war crisis in ex-Yugoslavia.

He\u000d\u000a      mentored 8 members of a class as they practiced facilitation in\u000d\u000a      communities. Community\u000d\u000a      facilitators from that class record that `Approaching the community of\u000d\u000a      Barra da Lagoa,\u000d\u000a      Florian&#243;polis, and taking part in a Forum Theatre practice there, I could\u000d\u000a      open my perspective....understanding that [the joker] may incite the\u000d\u000a      audience to intervention' (Ref 6 - 19 Oct 2012) and\u000d\u000a      describe how he `learned throughout the seminar that the facilitator can,\u000d\u000a      beyond expressing\u000d\u000a      conflict, take part in it.

Brussels: DICE Consortium.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    ","Title":"\u000d\u000a    Theatre for Development: Tim Prentki\u000d\u000a    ","UKLocation":[],"UKRegion":[],"UOA":"Music, Drama, Dance and Performing Arts","UnderpinningResearch":"\u000d\u000a    Throughout his career Prentki has developed insights both from practice,\u000d\u000a      which has subsequently\u000d\u000a      formed the basis for written theoretical reflection, and from writing,\u000d\u000a      which he has incorporated in\u000d\u000a      subsequent practical workshops and programmes. His methodology, developed\u000d\u000a      and refined over\u000d\u000a      many years of field-work and collaboration, involves a workshop process\u000d\u000a      which commences with\u000d\u000a      individual life-maps. These are then developed through collaborative\u000d\u000a      devising, culminating in the\u000d\u000a      presentation of a contradiction to the audience.\u000d\u000a    The impetus for the research arises out of the belief that theatre can be\u000d\u000a      used to support social\u000d\u000a      change, therefore it falls into the tradition of socially engaged theatre.\u000d\u000a      Whilst drawing upon the\u000d\u000a      practices of Brecht and Boal, Prentki's work seeks to make the process\u000d\u000a      available to any social\u000d\u000a      group capable of and desiring to bring about social change. From Brecht\u000d\u000a      comes the shared\u000d\u000a      conviction that humans are always capable of change if circumstances\u000d\u000a      permit, together with the\u000d\u000a      application of irony and contradiction within theatrical structures. From\u000d\u000a      Boal comes the desire to\u000d\u000a      remove the barrier between participants and audience. Unlike Boal's\u000d\u000a      practice of Forum Theatre,\u000d\u000a      however, Prentki's work undermines any fixed hierarchy of oppressor and\u000d\u000a      oppressed.\u000d\u000a    The intention in each workshop is always to establish a practical\u000d\u000a      dialogue between core principles\u000d\u000a      and the specific circumstances pertaining to that workshop. For instance,\u000d\u000a      when working with\u000d\u000a      groups that might be described as victims of social systems the emphasis\u000d\u000a      might fall on building\u000d\u000a      confidence and capacity. Whereas when working with groups who have access\u000d\u000a      to the levers of\u000d\u000a      social change the emphasis might fall upon the contradictions between the\u000d\u000a      personal convictions of\u000d\u000a      workshop members and the systems within which they are required to\u000d\u000a      operate.\u000d\u000a    The book Popular Theatre in Political Culture: Britain and Canada in\u000d\u000a        Focus (2000) together with\u000d\u000a      the journal articles written between 1995 and 2008 explore applied theatre\u000d\u000a      practice according to a\u000d\u000a      view that it is the most socially deprived who are likely to benefit most\u000d\u000a      from these interventions.\u000d\u000a      Since then, by tapping into older theatrical conventions of `fooling'\u000d\u000a      derived from research for his\u000d\u000a      recent book The Fool in European Theatre (2012), Prentki has\u000d\u000a      developed a more sophisticated\u000d\u000a      and ambiguous relationship to the sources of social change. That means\u000d\u000a      that more attention is\u000d\u000a      now given to the aesthetic dimensions of applied theatre and that the\u000d\u000a      contradictions and fissures\u000d\u000a      within the constructs of power are deconstructed within the process. One\u000d\u000a      of the consequences of\u000d\u000a      this change has been to widen the definition of applied theatre so that it\u000d\u000a      can now embrace a range\u000d\u000a      of popular theatre traditions previously considered beyond its scope.\u000d\u000a    Prentki's work was described as `outstanding' and `world-leading' by RAE\u000d\u000a      2008. The report also\u000d\u000a      stated that the University's `contribution to research in Theatre for\u000d\u000a      Development is recognized\u000d\u000a      internationally with staff working in this area giving keynotes at UK and\u000d\u000a      overseas locations and\u000d\u000a      taking key roles in the formulation of policy.'\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21729","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Rhythm Changes has capitalised on jazz's centrality to European\u000a      cultural discourses, using theoretical and practice-led research methods\u000a      to answer questions about the changing Europe, inherited culture and\u000a      national identity.

This event, entitled `The Time\u000a          and The Place', provided a new opportunity to build capacity,\u000a        commission new works and develop pan-European collaborations. The\u000a        three-day festival showcased the work of the first HERA Joint Research\u000a        Programme, developing insights into cultural dynamics and questions of\u000a        inheritance and identity in Europe, and reached new audiences through\u000a        combining the themes of leading European humanities research projects\u000a        with new arts commissions, public events and high profile concerts. The\u000a        success of the Rhythm Changes' ongoing Knowledge Exchange\u000a        activities has led to a partnership with the London Jazz Festival for\u000a        its 21st anniversary year in November 2013.\u000a      The 2013 Rhythm Changes Conference, `Rethinking Jazz Cultures'\u000a        celebrated the cross-disciplinary strength of international jazz\u000a        research.

The Rhythm Changes\u000a        team engaged directly with stakeholder groups, delivered public\u000a        engagement events and published materials in partnership with arts\u000a        organisations that are of relevance to both academic and non-academic\u000a        users.\u000a      As the largest research project ever funded for jazz in Europe, Rhythm\u000a          Changes filled a gap in existing research provision at the\u000a        European level, with the following aims:\u000a      \u000a\u000a        Understanding concepts of national thought and identity in jazz;\u000a        Collating jazz-related data, moving from specialist analysis towards\u000a          interdisciplinary and transnational synthesis;\u000a        Showing how jazz venues and festivals preserve, reflect and inform a\u000a          sense of cultural memory;\u000a        Furthering pan-European humanities research by establishing networks\u000a          that encourage transnational collaboration.\u000a      \u000a      Through the Rhythm Changes project, Whyton et al have published work\u000a        on the value of jazz in national settings and developed this research\u000a        for festivals, venues and arts promoters; from ethnographic explorations\u000a        of individual festival settings to online resources for jazz, from an\u000a        appraisal of cultural policies and the work of national jazz agencies to\u000a        practice-based engagement with professional development schemes.\u000a      \u000a2012: In Europe and the New Jazz Studies Whyton\u000a        observed, based on the development of Rhythm Changes, that as a\u000a        research area still its infancy, the European New Jazz Studies offers\u000a        further potential for groundbreaking insights into cultural politics of\u000a        jazz past and present, resisting essentialist ideologies and examining\u000a        the way in which jazz cultures obtain their meaning in the function that\u000a        the music has for its musicians, audiences and industry.

In 2008 their recording of\u000a      Handel's Messiah was\u000a      awarded the Classic FM\/Gramophone Baroque Vocal Album award and the March&#233;\u000a      International\u000a      du Disque et de l'Edition Musicale Award (Cannes) for a Baroque Album,\u000a      giving it immediate\u000a      worldwide renown in the classical arena. On the release of Messiah,\u000a      Gramophone Magazine\u000a      stated `Butt and the Dunedin Consort marry astute scholarship to sincere\u000a      artistic expression and\u000a      the result is comfortably the freshest, most natural, revelatory and\u000a      transparently joyful Messiah I\u000a      have heard for a very long time.'

In 2011, Gramophone Magazine listed the\u000a      Dunedin Consort at no11 in the\u000a      World's Greatest Choirs.\u000a    Butt's research was key in understanding what was possible when\u000a      recreating original\u000a      performances of well-known pieces, considering the size, balance and\u000a      stylistic parameters of the\u000a      original forces and imagining them as they may have been when `new' and\u000a      unknown. The blending\u000a      of historical performance knowledge and musical expertise brought\u000a      audiences the freshness and\u000a      originality that would have been conveyed when the pieces were originally\u000a      performed (listening\u000a      practice also being a crucial consideration in Butt's approach). Taking\u000a      this approach with such\u000a      familiar pieces as Messiah, Bach's Passions and Mass,\u000a      and Handel's Cannons has enriched the\u000a      classical music culture for both audiences and critics.\u000a    Commercial success of recordings and performances\u000a      The recordings have been released by Linn Records, an independent record\u000a      producer based in\u000a      Scotland. Originally established as a manufacturer of high-performance\u000a      music systems, Linn\u000a      began producing records 30 years ago because its founders felt that there\u000a      were too few that were\u000a      of a high enough standard to be played on their systems (all recordings\u000a      can be purchased in studio\u000a      master quality). Linn Records has a reputation as a high-quality niche\u000a      producer with a modest but\u000a      stable turnover until the release of the Dunedin Consort's historically\u000a      informed version of Messiah,\u000a      which became the highest profile, best-selling production at that point in\u000a      their history, including\u000a      sales of over &#163;144K (20,000 copies). Messiah was chosen by Linn to\u000a      feature in high quality LP\u000a      format, something which is particularly favoured by the Japanese market.\u000a    The success of the Dunedin Consort's recordings has meant that royalty\u000a      income can be reinvested\u000a      in future recordings; funds have also been raised through public\u000a      subscription, generous private\u000a      donations and schemes such as the `Big Give' (2010 for Esther and\u000a      2011 for Brandenburg\u000a        Concertos). This stronger income stream has also helped seed public\u000a      funding, with support from\u000a      Creative Scotland rising in recent years (unlike most other\u000a      organisations), reaching &#163;90K in 2013.\u000a      All this funding has enabled an expansion of performing activity and\u000a      outreach.\u000a    Further to this expansion in funding is the growing number of\u000a      international touring opportunities,\u000a      including performances of Acis and Galatea in Tel Aviv (Israel)\u000a      and Chaise Dieu (France); Mass in\u000a        B Minor in Torroella de Montgri (Spain); Matthew Passion at\u000a      Bach's church in Eisenach (Germany)\u000a      and Messiah in Handel's church in Halle (Germany), Noirlac and the\u000a      Chapelle Royale of Versailles\u000a      (France). The Dunedin Consort also broadcast Bach cantatas live in the Lufthansa Festival\u000a      on\u000a      BBC Radio 3 (22 May 2013) to an average listener audience of more than 2\u000a      million.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    John Butt's research has played a leading role in bringing historically\u000a      informed music performance\u000a      to professional and public audiences across the world.

Playing\u000a        with History\u000a      (Cambridge University Press) established many of the primary questions\u000a      regarding the role of\u000a      historically informed performance in contemporary culture - such as how it\u000a      ties into other historical\u000a      conditions and its potential to refresh many aspects of classical music\u000a      culture. One of the most\u000a      significant conclusions was identifying the need to use historical\u000a      knowledge and experience to\u000a      encourage new creative possibilities in contemporary performance, even if\u000a      adopting historical\u000a      parameters might suggest a restriction of performative possibilities. A\u000a      further monograph in 2010,\u000a      Bach's Dialogue with Modernity: Perspectives on the Passions.\u000a      (Cambridge University Press) &#8212; opened\u000a      up new ways to read and hear Bach's Passions, presenting studies\u000a      of listening,\u000a      experiencing music over time and subject formation during performance\u000a      which were seminal in\u000a      influencing the interpretation of both live and recorded works. Further\u000a      publications such as a theory\u000a      of listening practice in western art music (2009), an article concerning\u000a      emotions in the German\u000a      Baroque (2011) and a study of theology, counterpoint and narrative of\u000a      Handel's Messiah (2010), all\u000a      reflect much of the groundwork for the recordings, which form another\u000a      major part of Butt's research\u000a      activities.\u000a    Performance and recording preparation\u000a      Each recording required different degrees of scholarly engagement and\u000a      research. The three\u000a      Handel recordings (Messiah 2006, Acis and Galatea 2008 and\u000a      Esther 2012) involved considerable\u000a      communication with other scholars to establish the current state of\u000a      knowledge of the original\u000a      performances; these were integrated into fresh study of the primary\u000a      sources and preparation of\u000a      new performing editions. The musical texts for the Bach works (Matthew\u000a        Passion 2008, Mass in B\u000a        Minor 2010 and John Passion 2012) were more securely\u000a      available in modern editions, but required\u000a      revisiting the sources to establish the texts for the specific\u000a      performances to be reconstructed (the\u000a      Mass recording used the first edition to present the work as Bach\u000a      left it in 1750). Work on the\u000a      musical text was undertaken in tandem with work on the original forces,\u000a      most importantly the type\u000a      of vocal scoring, the number and placing of forces and the type of\u000a      performers required. All the\u000a      vocal recordings reflect work on the constitution of choruses and their\u000a      relation to the individual\u000a      soloists; these recordings have been seminal in developing the concept of\u000a      `soloist led'\u000a      performance. Musicological research has also informed the pacing of these\u000a      performances &#8212; most\u000a      notably the dramatic flow and division of scenes or individual numbers and\u000a      possible tempo\u000a      relationships between these.\u000a    Performance and recording process\u000a      When it came to the performance and recording process, all elements of\u000a      historical knowledge\u000a      (whether relating to forces, style, articulation or ornamentation),\u000a      required considerable\u000a      experimentation, even with very experienced performers. The interaction\u000a      between scholarly ideas\u000a      and performance was not necessarily symmetrical or predictable. For\u000a      instance, the notion of\u000a      `soloist-led' choral performance required establishing a soloist's\u000a      putative approach, which was then\u000a      reinforced by doubling singers. This introduced questions of spontaneity\u000a      and uniformity of\u000a      ornamentation, much of which could only be solved by attention to the\u000a      emerging results of the\u000a      performance. In other words, by setting new parameters of performing\u000a      engagement new creative\u000a      possibilities emerged. Other specific issues of musical interpretation\u000a      included the notion of\u000a      attempting to make this music `new', as if heard for the very first time,\u000a      together with issues of\u000a      affective embodiment and dialogue between performers. Each recording also\u000a      required Butt to\u000a      produce extensive sleeve notes, designed to be relevant for both scholarly\u000a      readership and the\u000a      general public.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23453","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The University of Salford has pioneered practice-based research work in\u000a      the field of Brass Band\u000a      studies as a key area of research in performance and composition,\u000a      extending significantly\u000a      beyond the University, with the introduction of the practice-led and\u000a      brass-specialist PhD and\u000a      DMA programmes, and the subsequent integration of brass band research into\u000a      University of\u000a      Salford SMRC research programmes.

The brass band\u000a        movement in the UK and\u000a        worldwide is organised around the principle of competition in a number\u000a        of different sections,\u000a        equivalent to the league structure in sport. Competitions generally\u000a        feature between 10 and\u000a        20 bands playing a single set piece, with the adjudication carried out\u000a        by an expert jury who\u000a        cannot see the band playing to ensure that only musical-technical\u000a        criteria are used to make\u000a        the assessment. Enhancing, exponentially the repertoire of brass bands\u000a        by bringing\u000a        contemporary \"concert hall\" concepts and techniques to amateur music\u000a        making, setting\u000a        competition standards to which brass bands aspire:\u000a      Within this framework, the composition of a `set-piece' literally sets\u000a        the technical and musical\u000a        demands for the musicians competing at that level, and also defines the\u000a        level towards which\u000a        bands in lower sections aspire. Set pieces are often repeated for\u000a        several competitions,\u000a        meaning that many hundreds of musicians over a period will rehearse one\u000a        set piece over a\u000a        period of a decade or more, and it may serve as a benchmark for the\u000a        standards required by\u000a        promotion to a particular section. In addition, a test piece appropriate\u000a        to the particular section\u000a        can be chosen by an individual band as an `own choice' in some\u000a        competitions.\u000a      The influence of Salford composers over this unique form of technical\u000a        benchmarking for\u000a        music can be established, leading the development of brass band cultures\u000a        internationally,\u000a        from the UK to the US, from Scandinavia to Australia:\u000a      \u000a        \u000aGraham's 1994 Montage has been used as a set test\u000a          piece at Championship\u000a          level on\u000a          13 separate occasions, and has been chosen as an `own choice' on 48\u000a          occasions.\u000a          Featuring in 1995 in the Norwegian National Championships; the\u000a          European\u000a          Championships (ten times), the British and Scottish Opens (seven\u000a          times), in smaller\u000a          competitions such as the Fife Charities Band Association Contest and\u000a          in April 2013, in\u000a          the North American Championships.

Drs. Sch&#246;gler and Skulina then determined to form a\u000d\u000a      commercial company to bring the Skoog to market. They raised &#163;400k\u000d\u000a      investment funds from the University of Edinburgh, Nesta, Scottish\u000d\u000a      Enterprise, Banwell plc and the Daedalus Investment Fund; Skoog music was\u000d\u000a      launched in early 2010.

In its commercially developed form, the Skoog is a musical\u000d\u000a      instrument based on a sensor covered with a coating which makes it\u000d\u000a      sensitive to touch but tough enough to resist strong handling. The sensor\u000d\u000a      is linked to a computer, which takes in information about how slow or\u000d\u000a      fast, soft or hard, and from which direction the player is touching the\u000d\u000a      sensor. In essence, there is a virtual instrument inside the computer. The\u000d\u000a      Skoog has been programmed to produce the sound of a flute, trumpet, bowed\u000d\u000a      or plucked strings and clarinet, among other instruments. It can be set\u000d\u000a      for different levels of ability or range of movement.\u000d\u000a    The great majority of sales have been to schools or education services.\u000d\u000a      Skoog use figures are therefore much higher than the sales figures.

In the words of one customer:\u000d\u000a    `I am an HCPC registered Senior Music Therapist from Northern Ireland.\u000d\u000a        In my clinical work I address the development of children and\u000d\u000a        adolescents living with visual impairments, physical impairments and\u000d\u000a        complex needs. Recently, I acquired a Skoog and it has quickly become an\u000d\u000a        asset in my music therapy instrument \"tool-kit\", providing an effective\u000d\u000a        means for shared communication. The Skoog's touch-sensitive\u000d\u000a        responsiveness means that it can bypass some of the more stringent\u000d\u000a        physical playing demands made by conventional musical instruments.'\u000d\u000a      (5.3)\u000d\u000a    One of the Skoog's most important attributes is its versatility: it can\u000d\u000a      be used in all sorts of music education settings, and therefore makes a\u000d\u000a      major contribution to policies of inclusivity. A review in the magazine, Special\u000d\u000a        Children, noted that:\u000d\u000a    `The Skoog makes music accessible to everyone. It has transformed the\u000d\u000a        life of one young girl at our school in particular. She is on the autism\u000d\u000a        spectrum, with limited speech. However when she plays the Skoog, she\u000d\u000a        becomes graceful, confident and at ease with herself. It's wonderful to\u000d\u000a        watch.' (5.4)\u000d\u000a    In 2011, Skoogmusic donated two Skoogs for use at Athens Special Olympics\u000d\u000a      events, and set up a Skoog Zone in the delegates' area for trying out the\u000d\u000a      instruments. Videos from the Skoogmusic website show many of the athletes\u000d\u000a      enjoying making music with the Skoogs (5.5). Mary Mavis, Managing Director\u000d\u000a      of Special Olympics Europe\/Eurasia, commented that `The Skoog is a\u000d\u000a      wonderful invention which is accessible to everyone and gives people with\u000d\u000a      disabilities of all ages an opportunity to express themselves and develop\u000d\u000a      new skills' (5.6).\u000d\u000a    The Skoog also featured prominently in a composition commissioned for the\u000d\u000a      2012 Cultural Olympiad. The Skoog was one of three instruments developed\u000d\u000a      for use by disabled performers, which were the inspiration for and\u000d\u000a      centrepiece of Technophonia, a piece commissioned from Oliver\u000d\u000a      Searle by the Drake Music School Project. The piece premiered in Queen's\u000d\u000a      Hall Edinburgh, and was performed in the South Bank Centre as part of the\u000d\u000a      London Olympics celebrations (5.7). In an interview given while working on\u000d\u000a      the piece, Searle explained how experimenting with the Skoog and the other\u000d\u000a      two instruments shaped the process of composition. In particular, he\u000d\u000a      enjoyed `being able to work hands on with the instruments, with the\u000d\u000a      sounds, that might give me ideas that I might use later in the piece'\u000d\u000a      (5.8). The Southbank Centre website commented that the piece would `stir\u000d\u000a      their audience and stimulate them to think again about what is possible,\u000d\u000a      as well as how we define musical instruments and performing musicians.'\u000d\u000a      The piece has been short-listed for the 2013 British Composer Awards\u000d\u000a      (Community or Educational Project category).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research (2003-12) by Osborne at the Reid School of Music (RSM) revealed\u000d\u000a      a need for a new musical instrument for disabled users. Under the\u000d\u000a      direction of Osborne, between 2006-8 an interdisciplinary team across\u000d\u000a      Music, Psychology and Physics, including RSM-based Sch&#246;gler, developed a\u000d\u000a      new musical `object', the Skoog, which allowed people with a wide range of\u000d\u000a      disabilities accessible expressive control of sound.

The initial stage of\u000d\u000a      this research, carried out in collaboration with the Tapestry Partnership\u000d\u000a      between 2003 and 2005, involved extensive consultation at a school level,\u000d\u000a      and identified music as a tool for improving learning engagement in\u000d\u000a      children with profound physical and learning difficulties. Some of these\u000d\u000a      insights were later published in Osborne 2010 and 2012 (see 3.1 and 3.2\u000d\u000a      below). In order to develop research on these issues the School formed the\u000d\u000a      Institute for Music in Human and Social Development (IMHSD) and a funding\u000d\u000a      bid was made to the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the\u000d\u000a      Arts (Nesta), which in 2006 awarded Osborne a grant of &#163;195k for the\u000d\u000a      development of a musical `object' that would be commercially viable and\u000d\u000a      useful to as wide a range of ages and abilities as possible.\u000d\u000a    Under Osborne's leadership a team was established to design and create\u000d\u000a      such a new musical instrument. The team set itself three research\u000d\u000a      objectives: to develop a universal interface to sense fine or limited\u000d\u000a      movements of the body; to develop an appropriate way of understanding and\u000d\u000a      interpreting the musical meaning and expressivity of such movements; and\u000d\u000a      to develop a way of communicating this meaning and expressivity to a new,\u000d\u000a      flexible and attractive source of musical sound, so that the new\u000d\u000a      instrument would offer its users the opportunity for learning, progression\u000d\u000a      and creativity.\u000d\u000a    Professor Osborne was joined on the research management team by\u000d\u000a      Professors Campbell (Physics) and Lee (Psychology); and by two\u000d\u000a      NESTA-funded Post-doctoral Research Fellows (2006 - 2008): Ben Sch&#246;gler\u000d\u000a      (Music\/Psychology) and David Skulina (Music\/Physics). The underlying music\u000d\u000a      psychology research concerned the relationship between brain activity and\u000d\u000a      expressive gestures and temporal patterns of movement and sound, as\u000d\u000a      understood through Tau theory (an approach to the relationship between\u000d\u000a      perceptual and intrinsic motion guidance in human action through\u000d\u000a      measurement of the `time to closure' of a motion gap). The resulting\u000d\u000a      account of the relationship between physical movement (however minimal)\u000d\u000a      and musical expression informed subsequent work on the sensory guidance of\u000d\u000a      purposive movements and on the acoustical properties of computer-based\u000d\u000a      sound simulation. The computer software translating the hand movements on\u000d\u000a      the sensor into expressive sound is based on a `neuron mathematics of\u000d\u000a      movement', on the theory that there is a clear relationship between brain\u000d\u000a      activity, physical movement and musical expression. The main difference\u000d\u000a      between the Skoog and the technology used in most other forms of computer\u000d\u000a      music-based musical therapy is therefore that the Skoog does not use MIDI\u000d\u000a      (Musical Instrument Digital Interface); it allows a direct relationship\u000d\u000a      between the movement of the Skoog user and the sound made. Continuing\u000d\u000a      practice-led music community research projects enabled the researchers to\u000d\u000a      test the effectiveness of this approach in practice.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24040","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The Live Music Exchange (http:\/\/livemusicexchange.org\/)\u000d\u000a      was set up with support of a follow-on grant of &#163;119,064 from the AHRC to\u000d\u000a      develop knowledge exchange in the live music sector.

The evidence of LMX impact is\u000d\u000a      therefore not only the effect of specific input into specific policy\u000d\u000a      issues, as listed above, but also the fact that LMX team members now have\u000d\u000a      a voice as academic researchers in high-level policy meetings.

Key findings of the initial project\u000d\u000a      were that\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      the economic and cultural importance of live music was underestimated\u000d\u000a        by both academic researchers and policy makers, who tended to focus on\u000d\u000a        the recording industry and copyright issues;\u000d\u000a      the value of live music could not be understood simply in terms of\u000d\u000a        cost: cultural factors were equally important in determining live music\u000d\u000a        promoters' abilities to sustain a business;\u000d\u000a      the health of the live sector, particularly over time, depended on a\u000d\u000a        balance of different kinds of promoter (enthusiast, state, commercial)\u000d\u000a        and types of venue (in terms of both size and audience experience);\u000d\u000a      the activity of local government in terms of regulation, licensing and\u000d\u000a        the interpretation of national legislation had a significant impact on\u000d\u000a        the health of the live music sector in different cities and UK regions.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The second strand of the research focused on music policy makers'\u000d\u000a      knowledge of and approach to the live music sector and what effects their\u000d\u000a      beliefs and assumptions were having on the sector's practices. In May\u000d\u000a      2011, meetings were organised in collaboration with UK Music and PRS for\u000d\u000a      Music to examine how policy making in the sector could be improved. The\u000d\u000a      object was to identify key stakeholders and their positions; to assess the\u000d\u000a      quality of data used; and to document how the sector represented its\u000d\u000a      interests to government. The first meeting involved large and small\u000d\u000a      promoters, agents, the Arts Council, festival organisations and venue\u000d\u000a      owners; the second meeting involved representatives from all the UK's\u000d\u000a      major music sector bodies (International Federation of the Phonographic\u000d\u000a      Industry, British Phonographic Industry, Featured Artists Coalition,\u000d\u000a      Musicians Union, Association of Independent Producers, Phonographic\u000d\u000a      Performance Limited, and the Music Manager's Forum as well as UK Music and\u000d\u000a      PRS for Music). Key findings from this research (which also drew on more\u000d\u000a      than 100 interviews with promoters) were that:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      the music industry in general needs a reliable source of statistical\u000d\u000a        data and advice on how to read the continuous flow of market research\u000d\u000a        data so as to improve its effectiveness in lobbying government and\u000d\u000a        responding to policy proposals;\u000d\u000a      music policy makers need to be better informed about long-term trends\u000d\u000a        and comparative data from policy experiences in other markets and\u000d\u000a        legislations;\u000d\u000a      the live music sector needs authoritative and impartial support in\u000d\u000a        negotiating between its interests and public interests represented by\u000d\u000a        local government;\u000d\u000a      there is a lack of support and useful information or training material\u000d\u000a        for new entrants into the live music sector, particularly following the\u000d\u000a        decline of the student union entertainment sector.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    LMX was created to meet these needs as an open access source of online\u000d\u000a      information and discussion and through its organisation of focused\u000d\u000a      meetings and research services.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24041","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Each Botanics event has involved primary school pupils (200-300 per show)\u000a      from areas of significant deprivation within the City of Edinburgh. For\u000a      The Quicken Tree (2011), for example, the three schools taking part served\u000a      the 15% most deprived areas of the City, with Pilton serving one of the\u000a      15% most deprived areas of Scotland. Children from these schools live in\u000a      areas with very high levels of unemployment and local neighbourhood crime\u000a      and low levels of educational achievement.\u000a    The value of this project to the community is reflected in the investment\u000a      of various trusts and charities in production costs; The Quicken Tree,\u000a      for example, cost &#163;60,000 to develop and stage. It was supported\u000a      financially by the University of Edinburgh, Lanvern Foundation, Robertson\u000a      Trust, Creative Scotland, D'Oyly Carte, Robin Leith Trust and the Thornton\u000a      Foundation.\u000a    Its primary benefit is for the children taking part. Following the final\u000a      public performances of each show, the University of Edinburgh Music in the\u000a      Community students involved have continued to work with the school pupils\u000a      for a further 12 months in order to sustain and develop further the skills\u000a      and interests arising from the performance project, thus helping to\u000a      achieve an enduring legacy for the schools. The benefit of this activity\u000a      is that prolonged engagement with the arts as a tool for learning helps\u000a      the participating children gain confidence and self-esteem, becoming\u000a      better able to concentrate and apply themselves across all learning areas,\u000a      and to express themselves and communicate with others more effectively. In\u000a      the words of the headmaster of one of the schools which has been involved:\u000a    \"Community music should be available on the National Health Service,\u000a        it should be an entitlement for communities to have music ... it makes\u000a        such a difference ... [Community music] is the yeast in the dough ...\u000a        [it] lifts you above the nitty gritty and takes you out of yourself and\u000a        makes you really believe in yourself ... It is worth a thousand bottles\u000a        of antidepressants, and there is just not enough of it. It is a\u000a        wonderful wonderful thing and children learn things from [community\u000a        music] which help them with ... maths and language and social studies.\u000a        They learn to focus, they learn to listen, they learn lower order\u000a        thinking skills like memory ... but they also learn the highest order\u000a        thinking skill of creativity. They learn to create something and that\u000a        helps them across the curriculum. [Community Music] is just so important\u000a        when education is being cut ... when music specialists are rare ... when\u000a        this is happening music in the community is vital and I am terrified\u000a        that it is just going to fade away ... Every school across the globe\u000a        would benefit from this.\" (See 5.1)\u000a    The project also benefits the primary school teachers involved, through\u000a      its provision of a programme of music-based continual professional\u000a      development, and parents, by providing experiences that help them see the\u000a      capacity of their children in a new light.\u000a    For the National Museum of Scotland event in 2012, The City Sings,\u000a      an independent report was commissioned which used observation,\u000a      questionnaires and interviews to evaluate the impact of the show on the\u000a      participants&#8212;the children, the teachers, the participating students and\u000a      the wider community. Evidence was gathered on the effects of the work on\u000a      children's personal and social development&#8212;their confidence, social and\u000a      team building skills and aspirations; on the importance of the musical\u000a      skills and expertise of the music in the community practitioners; on the\u000a      importance of partnerships; and on the effectiveness of the professional\u000a      development involved and its contribution to the delivery of the\u000a      expressive arts component of the Curriculum for Excellence:\u000a    \"Active learning is always very, very important and for [the children]\u000a        to be actively involved in areas of the curriculum where teachers don't\u000a        always have expertise is just a phenomenal opportunity. For [the\u000a        children] to have role models with the confidence and expertise and\u000a        obvious talent to work with the children has just changed the children's\u000a        ideas about music, about singing, about live performance... it has made\u000a        their studies much more engaging.\" P5 teacher\u000a    \"The City Sings was a great production and my family said \"that was\u000a        amazing!\" I am sure that this experience has brought back all my\u000a        confidence.\" (P5 pupil)\u000a    \"At the end of the performance the parents were saying that they\u000a        didn't think their child would ever be able to do that kind of thing.

Practice-led research in this field followed\u000a      the formation of the Institute for Music in Human and Social Development\u000a      (IMHSD) in 2006. IMHSD's founding research strategy was to develop\u000a      scientific understanding of the cognitive processes involved in music\u000a      making, and to apply that understanding to experimental work with music as\u000a      an educational and therapeutic tool. One such application was a series of\u000a      music theatre events, devised and managed by Dee Isaacs (Lecturer in\u000a      Music, and Course Organiser for the Music in the Community courses at RSM)\u000a      in collaboration with Edinburgh's Royal Botanic Garden. Seven such events\u000a      have so far been staged (the 2012 event, The City Sings, part of that\u000a      year's Cultural Olympiad, took place in the National Museum of Scotland).\u000a      The delivery of a live arts experience within schools is central to the\u000a      Scottish Curriculum for Excellence, and the Botanics project, in\u000a      contributing to this policy, has drawn on IMHSD research in devising live\u000a      arts activities for children with significant learning and behavioural\u000a      difficulties. Botanics events are organised around continuous research\u000a      investigation into a) the most effective ways teachers can use music in\u000a      the development of social skills and self-confidence among children with\u000a      learning and other difficulties and b) how best to enable teachers without\u000a      musical training to use musical tools.\u000a    Such research draws on two methodologies. The first of these is\u000a      psychological and neuro-scientific research into music and the brain, as\u000a      applied to work with children with various kinds of learning difficulty\u000a      and trauma (Osborne 3.1; 3.2), including the beneficial effects of musical\u000a      experiences in terms of enhancing interpersonal communication (Overy 3.3),\u000a      and the impact of group based musical experiences (Overy 3.4). This work\u000a      shows the importance of studying every day, non- expert forms of musical\u000a      behaviour that include social interaction and positive shared experiences\u000a      as key components.\u000a    The second methodology utilised is practice-led research involving\u000a      composition and performance (Isaacs 3.5; 3.6) where music-theatre works\u000a      are developed through a process of continuous experimental collaboration.\u000a      In these circumstances, there is an iterative relationship between the\u000a      `underpinning' research and the `impact' as the research process is itself\u000a      shaped by the creative process: research-based suggestions as to the\u000a      effect of musical practice on children's ability to concentrate and\u000a      communicate are tested and refined through such practice.\u000a    During school sessions, including a period of in-service training with\u000a      teachers, the children make music, explore the themes of the production,\u000a      develop listening and collaborating skills and discover how the elements\u000a      of music, dance, visual art and design combine to create a performance.\u000a      Process and performance are of equal importance and the performing\u000a      environment is crucial to the whole experience. The final\u000a      composition\/performance is created through this process of collaboration,\u000a      which is itself shaped by constant reflection on what engages children's\u000a      attention and enables them to concentrate and collaborate, and on what\u000a      creative methods enhance teachers' confidence and teaching skills. This\u000a      work is an innovative extrapolation of action research models of\u000a      investigation which are very influential within social science and health\u000a      care research.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24884","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research resulted in creation of the performance work Blueprint\u000d\u000a      which has since been staged\u000d\u000a      at, and contributed to the programmes of, a number of UK theatres and\u000d\u000a      performance venues and\u000d\u000a      to nationally and internationally respected festivals of performance. Blueprint\u000d\u000a      has provided public\u000d\u000a      access to theatre that, through its approach to working with\u000d\u000a      non-performers, is recognised to have\u000d\u000a      created an original experience of parental relationships in performance.\u000d\u000a    In the REF period, there were eight public presentations of the work, in\u000d\u000a      seven different venues,\u000d\u000a      collectively attracting audiences of some 400. The work was publicly\u000d\u000a      marketed by promoters for its\u000d\u000a      exploration of relationships between mothers and daughters and its\u000d\u000a      incorporation of non-performers\u000d\u000a      via video. This attracted audiences with little or no previous knowledge\u000d\u000a      of experimental\u000d\u000a      performance and contemporary theatre; in consequence, Blueprint\u000d\u000a      has not only introduced new\u000d\u000a      audiences to contemporary performance but also to the contemporary\u000d\u000a      performance programmes of\u000d\u000a      some of the venues in which it has been staged. By and large, these venues\u000d\u000a      cater for regional\u000d\u000a      audiences whose access to, and awareness of, new work is otherwise highly\u000d\u000a      limited.\u000d\u000a    Additionally, however, Blueprint's incorporation within significant\u000d\u000a      festivals (Brighton Fringe; Flint\u000d\u000a      Festival) engaged audiences with an existing interest in contemporary\u000d\u000a      performance in some of the\u000d\u000a      key debates currently informing theatre and live work. It can also,\u000d\u000a      therefore, be seen to have\u000d\u000a      contributed to the thinking and\/or practices of informed, non academic\u000d\u000a      audiences: other theatre\u000d\u000a      makers; performance promoters and programmers; students of drama and\u000d\u000a      performance; critics;\u000d\u000a      Arts Council England officers and so on.

An after-show talk at the\u000d\u000a      Flint Festival for example\u000d\u000a      was attended by other artists performing at the festival as well as\u000d\u000a      regular visitors to the theatre.\u000d\u000a      Blueprint was discussed and commented on positively with regard to\u000d\u000a      its originality.

Subsequent development involved a second work-in-progress\u000d\u000a      showing at the Brighton\u000d\u000a      Fringe, exploring how the performers might encourage increased audience\u000d\u000a      participation.\u000d\u000a    In July 2012 a performance extract of the resultant work, Blueprint,\u000d\u000a      was presented at the University\u000d\u000a      of Worcester's interdisciplinary conference a place, a space. The\u000d\u000a      extract was selected specifically\u000d\u000a      to explore the performative possibilities of creating a sense of `real'\u000d\u000a      place in performance via the\u000d\u000a      live video presence of non-performers in their private spaces.\u000d\u000a    Throughout the research, Rippel worked with close family members as a\u000d\u000a      strategy for creating\u000d\u000a      intimacy, informed by relevant extant strategies and performance\u000d\u000a      paradigms. This involved\u000d\u000a      intensive study of current practice in which performers have worked with\u000d\u000a      parents: Michael\u000d\u000a      Pinchbeck (The post show party show, 2009), Martin Nachbar (Repeater,\u000d\u000a      2007), and German\u000d\u000a      theatre company SheShePop (TESTAMENT, 2010). Rippel also paid\u000d\u000a      attention to work exploring\u000d\u000a      the spectator as a non-performer, specifically various works by Gob Squad.\u000d\u000a    In light of the above, and drawing on theories of virtual presence and\u000d\u000a      posthumanism, especially\u000d\u000a      Hayles' seminal How we Became Posthuman (1999), the research\u000d\u000a      considered the potential of the\u000d\u000a      digital, visual presence of unaware `non-performers' in remote locations\u000d\u000a      to produce an `authentic',\u000d\u000a      `unaffected' live presence within the performance. It also drew on\u000d\u000a      theories of non-representational\u000d\u000a      presence in performance, specifically analysing the matrix of Kirby's From\u000d\u000a        Acting to Non-acting\u000d\u000a      (1972) and Derrida's theories on the possibilities of non-representation\u000d\u000a      in performance. At the core\u000d\u000a      of the research, from the insights of which Blueprint derives, was\u000d\u000a      practice-based negotiation of\u000d\u000a      different states of unperformed presence and of the realities and\u000d\u000a      mythologies surrounding\u000d\u000a      concepts of `authentic presence'. Blueprint and Rippel's\u000d\u000a      discussions of it have thus sought to make\u000d\u000a      a distinctive contribution to the discourse on `liveness' developed by\u000d\u000a      theorists including Auslander\u000d\u000a      and Phelan, and Feral's investigation of theatrical presences.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"26124","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"6290252","Name":"Serbia"},{"GeoNamesId":"732800","Name":"Bulgaria"},{"GeoNamesId":"719819","Name":"Hungary"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The underpinning research made a distinct and material contribution to\u000d\u000a      impact in the following ways:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Generating new ways of thinking that influence creative practice;\u000d\u000a      Informing and influencing the understanding of religious\/ethnic\u000d\u000a        discrimination;\u000d\u000a      Preserving, conserving, and presenting cultural heritage;\u000d\u000a      Helping media, Jewish education and other professionals adapt to\u000d\u000a        changing cultural values.\u000d\u000a\u0009\u000d\u000a\u0009Specifically, this research has:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Enhanced regional, national and international public awareness of\u000d\u000a        representations of ethnic minorities in contemporary media resulting\u000d\u000a      in cultural and intellectual enrichment of the wider public.

According to the\u000d\u000a      American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (AJJDC) (5.3), `by placing in\u000d\u000a      the center of his interest the way Jews and Judaism are portrayed by\u000d\u000a      contemporary films produced in the Western world, Dr. Abrams opened a very\u000d\u000a      interesting avenue whereby young adults were able to question their own\u000d\u000a      identity, culture, tradition, affiliation and prejudices.'\u000d\u000a    Encouraged social inclusion through greater public and media\u000d\u000a        understanding of how ethnic stereotyping works in media, particularly in\u000d\u000a        a non-US context.

In particular, his book (3.1) has provided much\u000d\u000a      influence for our content. His discussion of the Walter character in the\u000d\u000a      Coen Brothers film The Big Lebowski has directly influenced our\u000d\u000a      interpretation of this film to the point that we sold an article\u000d\u000a      incorporating some of his insights (`Could The Big Lebowski Be The\u000d\u000a      Greatest Film Ever Made?') to Siemens via SabotageTimes.com' (5.4).

Referring to output 3.1,\u000d\u000a      the Bookeywookey blog wrote: `I tend not to be much of a fan of academic\u000d\u000a      criticism of film or literature. I find most of it reductive and the\u000d\u000a      language insular and convoluted, but what is interesting in this book is\u000d\u000a      Abrams's argument that post-1990 one sees Jews in film as nationals,\u000d\u000a      cowboys, skinheads, gay and many other categories and that the body of\u000d\u000a      work by and about Jews in this period conveys the message that \"there is\u000d\u000a      more than one way to be Jewish.\" This is about as anti-reductive a message\u000d\u000a      as one could hope for and is the strength of this book for my money'\u000d\u000a      (5.10). (See also 5.7-5.9). As recognition of this, in September 2013,\u000d\u000a      Abrams was invited to join ITV Wales' diversity panel.\u000d\u000a    Beneficiaries\u000d\u000a      The main beneficiaries are media audiences (especially in Europe, North\u000d\u000a      America and Israel) with an interest in Jewish issues.

A\u000d\u000a      Welsh-Jewish mini film festival, organised by the First Minister for\u000d\u000a      Wales's representative in New York, entitled `Jewish Tales from Wales' was\u000d\u000a      held in New York City in March 2012. Directly arising out of the research\u000d\u000a      (3.2, 3.3), issues covered Welsh-Jewish identity and how this was\u000d\u000a      expressed through a cinematic medium. The Welsh Assembly Government,\u000d\u000a      Bangor University and the Museum of Jewish Heritage (MJH), New York\u000d\u000a      jointly sponsored the festival. Abrams was involved in all post-screening\u000d\u000a      discussions.

It is the first project to use archival materials\u000d\u000a      systematically, including Kubrick's archives, to consider how Kubrick's\u000d\u000a      ethnic heritage and New York Intellectual pedigree influenced his\u000d\u000a      directorial vision and has already generated impact. Some of the results\u000d\u000a      of this research have already been published (3.2, 3.3) and will be\u000d\u000a      expanded in an edited collection (The Hidden Presence of Jews in\u000d\u000a        British Film and Television) in 2014 to be published by Northwestern\u000d\u000a      UP.\u000d\u000a    Research Findings\u000d\u000a    The most significant findings were in three areas:\u000d\u000a    1. Representations of Jews, Jewishness and Judaism (cinema\/video\u000d\u000a          gaming\/social networking). An assessment of changes in\u000d\u000a      the number and nature of representations of Jews, Jewishness and Judaism\u000d\u000a      in cinema globally since 1990 discovered a quantitative and qualitative\u000d\u000a      shift that represents a significant departure from the binary\u000d\u000a      representations of the past. A spectrum between formerly extreme poles of\u000d\u000a      stereotyping is now being populated. Exploration of stereotypical\u000d\u000a      representations in video gaming have been pioneered and research into\u000d\u000a      social networking, in particular Facebook, have opened up new areas to\u000d\u000a      consider how online activities have an impact in the offline world by\u000d\u000a      influencing congregational formation among young Jews (3.1, 3.2, 3.6).\u000d\u000a    2. Stereotyping and self-images of Jews, Jewishness and Judaism.\u000d\u000a      Identification of significant trends in stereotyping and self-images of\u000d\u000a      the above, both from the out-group and in-group perspective, including\u000d\u000a      fostering intergroup and interfaith relations. There is a move away from\u000d\u000a      more didactic edifying images to those that show less concern with what\u000d\u000a      out-group members think (3.1).\u000d\u000a    3. Implicit, conceptual, and sub-textual Jewishness.The\u000d\u000a      extension of research into new areas has considered Jewishness where it is\u000d\u000a      rendered implicit, conceptual, and sub-textual rather than overt and\u000d\u000a      explicit. In many films the `ethnicity' of the text is beneath the\u000d\u000a      surface, e.g. The Shining (1980) or the 007 franchise\u000d\u000a      (3.1, 3.5). The significance of the research lies in the widening of how\u000d\u000a      stereotyping can operate beneath the surface of media texts thereby\u000d\u000a      generating subtle but potentially insidious impacts on popular\u000d\u000a      understanding of ethnicities.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"26126","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Applied and practice-led elements (making and enacting) have engendered\u000a      immediate impact in new experience and deeper understanding of late\u000a      medieval buildings, objects, texts, music and ritual practices, and their\u000a      inter-relationships [5.1-3, 5.5, 5.9, 5.10]. Three principal areas\u000a      of impact can be identified: (i) engagement with craftspeople and artists\u000a      in investigating and making artefacts and vestments, (ii) provision of\u000a      unique resource of three historical organs for players and singers to use\u000a      in their own buildings during residencies, (iii) active participation of\u000a      clergy, singers, musicians, servers, vergers and congregations in the\u000a      enactment of medieval rituals.\u000a    (i) Impacts on the practice and technical expertise of craftsmen\u000a    The 18 craftsmen involved in creating artefacts and vestments, all\u000a      working in Britain, collaborated closely with the researchers over 20\u000a      months in all, e.g. making and painting of the organs [5.8, 5.11]\u000a      over 15 months, and a Pax-board [5.9] over four months, with a\u000a      total economic benefit to the craftsmen of &#163;91,726 excluding VAT [5.12].\u000a      Impact on craftsmen was further achieved through the project-led challenge\u000a      of investigating and making historically-informed ritual objects. New\u000a      methods and issues were explored (e.g. practical interpretation of partial\u000a      archaeological and iconographical evidence for hanging pyx and all\u000a      vestments, techniques of painting on oak board for altar reredos). It\u000a      enabled them to acquire and share between them new knowledge and\u000a      techniques, and to engage with archaeological, iconographical and\u000a      documentary evidence. The combination of interpretation and imagination in\u000a      making new objects led them to new questions (e.g. implications for the\u000a      height of stools and benches in relation to medieval posture); seeing them\u000a      in use enhanced their understanding of the visual effect, ritual meaning\u000a      and religious impact of the objects (e.g. the Five Wounds image as altar\u000a      painting based on a late medieval carving preserved in Scotland [5.11],\u000a      and the Pax-board modelled on a survival found in Essex [5.2, 5.9]).\u000a      Funding of reconstructions of two organs based on early 16th-century\u000a      fragments (Wetheringsett and Wingfield, Suffolk, 2001, 2002) and a third\u000a      `new' pre-Reformation organ (St Teilo's, 2011 [5.8]) has enabled\u000a      Goetze and Gwynn (who specialise in building new organs on historical\u000a      principles and historical restoration) to survey 16th-century remains of\u000a      organs (English, Southern French and Spanish) and extend their techniques\u000a      (e.g. bellows made from a single cow-hide) and craft (e.g. manufacture of\u000a      copies of soundboards and pipes).\u000a    (ii) Impacts on the performance practice of early organ and choral\u000a        music in church\u000a    Ensuring that these three organs were easily movable has enabled\u000a      residencies in specific locations. Extended residencies (3-12 months) have\u000a      offered unique resources for singers and players. Keyboard players have\u000a      been able to investigate new issues of performance practice for 16th- and\u000a      early 17th-century organ playing and repertory in Britain (e.g. pitch,\u000a      tonal qualities, keyboard fingering and articulation, improvisation on\u000a      plainsong melodies, accompaniment textures), and singers working with the\u000a      organs have reconsidered issues of church pitch and timbre. Practical\u000a      exploration with the organs has led to very significant rethinking of\u000a      these matters, and stimulated new engagement with manuscript sources by\u000a      cathedral musicians (e.g. residencies in Durham Cathedral in 2007 and 2009\u000a      with subsequent CD [5.3, 5.6]). The organs have already enabled a\u000a      wide range of players to reconsider the appropriate pitch for both solo\u000a      and alternatim British organ music before 1680, and 16th-century\u000a      improvisation on plainsong [5.7]; and their continuing\u000a      availability ensures that such impacts are ongoing and long-lasting.\u000a    (iii) Impacts on new experience and deeper understanding of historical\u000a        buildings, objects, texts and ritual practices\u000a    Some 2,500 participants actively participated in the liturgical\u000a      enactments. In addition, each enactment, prefaced by contextual\u000a      introductions, has uniquely enabled regular users of medieval buildings\u000a      (e.g. clergy, choirs &#8212; including the choristers, staff and congregation of\u000a      Salisbury Cathedral [5.1, 5.4] and St Davids Cathedral, [5.3])\u000a      to engage with and experience how their building was used in the late\u000a      Middle Ages, and to reflect on its present configuration and use: that\u000a      impact is cultural and religious, enhancing both historical and\u000a      contemporary understanding of ritual objects and gestures; use of space,\u000a      sound and silence; and wider aesthetic, spiritual and devotional issues.\u000a      The physicality of medieval ritual, the reliance on memory and non-verbal\u000a      cues, the absence of texts for congregation with concomitant religious\u000a      challenges and freedom, and the long periods of silence have all proved\u000a      revelatory [5.4, 5.5].\u000a    The experience has encouraged promotion of aspects of medieval practice\u000a      in contemporary worship. Linda Woodhead (director of the Religion and\u000a        Society programme) used it in an invited presentation to the Roman\u000a      Catholic bishops of England and Wales, `The End of Religious Uniformity',\u000a      3 October 2012 [5.5]. Elements of medieval ritual practice\u000a      (extended periods of kneeling, facing eastwards, movement) and repertory\u000a      (chant, early polyphony) were explored in modern worship at Bangor\u000a      Cathedral (November 2011 and 2012), and for a week of services (August\u000a      2012).\u000a    Although drawing on research undertaken since 1993, this case for impact\u000a      has focused on a recent, major research project (2009-13). As such its\u000a      full potential is not yet realised. At St Fagans Museum, collaboration\u000a      with curators, conservators and interpreters has addressed questions of\u000a      the configuration, embellishment and ritual use of St Teilo's Church: the\u000a      ensuing cultural and educational public benefit is long-term\u000a      (interpretation of the building, depositing of artefacts, and future use\u000a      of the church for enactments) [5.2]. This is also true at\u000a      Salisbury Cathedral and its predecessor, Old Sarum (interpretation of the\u000a      building\/ruins, contemporary liturgical practice, and planned future\u000a      historical enactment) [5.1].\u000a    More generally, unrestricted access to two globally available major web\u000a      resources, developed as core outcomes of the project, enables ongoing\u000a      cultural, historical, educational and religious impact. The Experience\u000a        of Worship website [3.2] provides a full narrative of the\u000a      project as well as resources to enable future enactments of each liturgy\u000a      in other places. Sarum Customary Online [3.3] offers\u000a      contextual introductions to the two cathedrals of Salisbury and their\u000a      influential ritual practices (the Use of Sarum).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Direct cultural, historical, religious, creative and musical impact has\u000a      been achieved through active participation of five distinct groups in a\u000a      major practice-led research project (2009-2013): (i) 18 craftspeople and\u000a      artists creating historically-informed artefacts; and (ii) clergy, (iii)\u000a      singers, (iv) organists and (v) congregations participating in the\u000a      enactment of medieval rituals (footfall over 2500). Impact over a longer\u000a      period (2001-13) has been achieved through use of three reconstructed\u000a      medieval organs in residencies (c.3-12 months) at cathedrals,\u000a      churches and college chapels, with direct musical impact on early\u000a      performance practice by choirs and organists.

The\u000a      project has combined traditional but interdisciplinary scholarship with\u000a      applied and practice-led research, using imagination and creativity as\u000a      part of the method. People from outside the academy have contributed at\u000a      every stage, principally in making artefacts, addressing issues of\u000a      performance practice, and inhabiting and reflecting on late medieval\u000a      liturgical ritual [3.2, 3.6].\u000a    Enabled by a major grant from the AHRC\/ESRC Religion and Society research\u000a      programme [3.1], and led by Prof John Harper (Bangor University,\u000a      Chair of Music, 1991-8; Research Professor 1998-) and Dr Sally Harper\u000a      (Bangor University, Lecturer, 1991-2001; Senior Lecturer 2001-), the\u000a      research (a) investigated and analysed the nature and conduct of late\u000a      medieval worship in the cathedrals and churches for which it was intended\u000a      and for which they were built; and (b) through enactments of late medieval\u000a      rituals, explored and reflected on the sentient, sensory, emotional and\u000a      physical experience of worship in the late Middle Ages by each group\u000a      present (priests, assistants, musicians, lay people). It has taken into\u000a      account (i) post-medieval and post-Christian assumptions and values, (ii)\u000a      medieval spirituality and devotion, and (iii) opportunities and\u000a      constraints of direct public engagement [3.2, 3.3].\u000a    Elements of the research central to impact include (a) investigation of\u000a      texts to establish norms of medieval ritual practice (especially medieval\u000a      Customaries and rubrics of liturgical books), and ritual analysis of the\u000a      buildings [3.3, 3.4]; (b) historically-informed (re)construction\u000a      of artefacts and vestments (including a late medieval organ), all for use\u000a      within the rituals [3.1, 3.5]; (c) enactment of three medieval\u000a      rituals in Salisbury Cathedral (2011) and eight in St Teilo's Church (17\u000a      public events, 2010-11), as well as additional enactments in New York,\u000a      Bangor Cathedral and St Davids Cathedral (2011-13); (d) processes of\u000a      preparatory inculturation, observation, reflection, analysis and\u000a      interpretation related to the enactments [3.2, 3.6].\u000a    The project has benefited from the outcomes of seven earlier enactments\u000a      (John Harper, at Aberdeen, Oxford and Salisbury, 1995-2008), participation\u000a      in the AHRC-funded Medieval Liturgy Network (John and Sally Harper,\u000a      2009-10, including one enactment), and research into medieval Welsh\u000a      liturgy and music, including the 14th-century Bangor Pontifical [3.4].The\u000a      scope of its impact has been enhanced by the earlier research initiative\u000a      of The Early English Organ Project (1998-2005, a charity funded by\u000a      grants from trusts &#8212; chair and research director, John Harper) with the\u000a      pioneering reconstruction of two late medieval organs based on newly\u000a      discovered English medieval organ fragments, and related musicological and\u000a      archival investigation of repertory and context [3.5].

The key research\u000d\u000a      insight is that the\u000d\u000a      conceptualisation of `intercultural', as used in relation to this form,\u000d\u000a      extends well beyond its\u000d\u000a      conventional association with language and ethnicity.\u000d\u000a    It is concerned with the use of drama as an act of translationary\u000d\u000a      context, where people are talking\u000d\u000a      `at' or `past' each other. In such contexts, individuals and organisations\u000d\u000a      can be restricted by the\u000d\u000a      confines of their own world-view. In asking different questions and\u000d\u000a      looking at issues from varied\u000d\u000a      points of view, new world-views may emerge.\u000d\u000a    It is this process of seeing the world differently which allows\u000d\u000a      individuals and organisations to see\u000d\u000a      themselves from a new perspective. This form of research-based pre-text\u000d\u000a      performance allows\u000d\u000a      people and organisations to work through processes that can lead to change\u000d\u000a      in working practices,\u000d\u000a      behaviours and values.\u000d\u000a    The underpinning research consists of two performance-based outputs and\u000d\u000a      two written outputs\u000d\u000a      which further interrogate the key concepts underpinning the dramaturgical\u000d\u000a      form (see section 3).\u000d\u000a      These four research outputs have impacted directly on the professional\u000d\u000a      practice of two theatre\u000d\u000a      institutions, two theatre companies and two national drama organisations\u000d\u000a      in a total of six countries\u000d\u000a      as detailed below.

The Grand-Guignol\u000d      specialised in one-act plays: every night at the Grand-Guignol featured a\u000d      `hot and cold shower' of carefully written terror plays interspersed with\u000d      comedies performed by an ensemble of versatile performers and innovative\u000d      special effects technicians. The result was an intense evening of theatre\u000d      designed to terrify and titillate the spectator through a mixture of\u000d      horror, laughter and the erotic. Such was its success that the term\u000d      `Grand-Guignol' was used to refer to the theatre itself and the genre of\u000d      plays that were performed there. In addition, `grand-guignolesque' has\u000d      entered English and other languages to describe any heightened display of\u000d      horror. The huge popular success of the Paris theatre led to offshoots\u000d      around the world including, in London, the British Grand-Guignol\u000d      experiment (1920-22) which attracted figures such as Sybil Thorndike to\u000d      act in it and No&#235;l Coward, Joseph Conrad and H.

Hand (University of South Wales, formerly University of\u000d      Glamorgan see REF5, 1997-present) and Michael Wilson (University of\u000d      Glamorgan 1997-2010) began their research into the Grand-Guignol in 1998.\u000d      Their research work (funded variously by the AHRC, British Academy and the\u000d      Society for Theatre Research) is most profoundly embodied in their two\u000d      co-written books published by the University of Exeter Press (UEP) as part\u000d      of its \"Studies in Performance\" series. Their research has subjected the\u000d      Grand-Guignol form, legend and subsequent influence to unparalleled\u000d      scrutiny. This has been achieved through archival research (in France, the\u000d      UK and the US); theoretical analysis and practical investigation in the\u000d      drama studios at the University of South Wales and through touring\u000d      productions. As well as offering substantial historical contextualization\u000d      and critical analysis which has taken into detailed account issues of\u000d      writing and performance, stagecraft and technology, audience and\u000d      reception, legacy and influence, Hand and Wilson's two books make\u000d      available for the first time in English 10 translations of classic\u000d      Grand-Guignol plays (in the 2002 book) and the publication of 10 British\u000d      plays (in the 2007 volume), including works which had been banned by the\u000d      theatre censor and\/or never published. Independently, Hand has explored in\u000d      depth Conrad's association with the British Grand-Guignol, which has\u000d      included Hand directing and touring in 2000 the world premiere of Conrad's\u000d      1920 Grand-Guignol play Laughing Anne the script of which he will\u000d      be publishing, with British Academy support, in the forthcoming Cambridge\u000d      critical edition of Conrad's plays.With AHRC support, Hand has also\u000d      translated and published (2011) two full-length plays by Mirbeau, a French\u000d      writer who wrote several plays for the Grand-Guignol and whose novel Torture\u000a        Garden was adapted for the Grand-Guignol (and translated by Hand and\u000d      Wilson in the 2002 volume).\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"27760","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1655842","Name":"Laos"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The Centre's research has achieved cultural, economic and policy impact\u000d\u000a      by advising broadcasters, theatre companies, music professionals and\u000d\u000a      community radio stations on their creative strategy and cultural role.

Small nations face distinct challenges and\u000d\u000a      possibilities in their artistic production and creative industries. For\u000d\u000a      Wales &#8212; a recently devolved nation &#8212; the vitality of its creative\u000d\u000a      industries and their capacity to provide distinctive forms of information,\u000d\u000a      education, entertainment and national imagery is a matter of live public\u000d\u000a      interest and concern. Our extensive programme of research asks the\u000d\u000a      following research questions:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      What role do the creative industries in Wales play in representing the\u000d\u000a        nation and its diverse cultural identities?\u000d\u000a      How do the structures and strategies of the creative industries in\u000d\u000a        Wales support practitioners and communities in contributing to\u000d\u000a        sustainable Welsh creative ecology?\u000d\u000a      What contemporary and historical challenges face the creative\u000d\u000a        industries in Wales and what strategies and principles might enable them\u000d\u000a        to be met successfully?\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The research employs established research methods including audience and\u000d\u000a      other stakeholder focus groups, surveys, textual analysis, historical\u000d\u000a      analysis, policy analysis and interviews with key industry personnel. It\u000d\u000a      demonstrates that whilst small nations face particular challenges (e.g.\u000d\u000a      limited resources, a restricted market and vulnerability to foreign and\u000d\u000a      dominant-language penetration), they also possess certain advantages over\u000d\u000a      their larger neighbours. Blandford's (2007) research on theatre and\u000d\u000a      performance in Wales and Scotland (see REF2), for example, shows how small\u000d\u000a      nations are often more willing to challenge established models and offer\u000d\u000a      instead alternative approaches to national theatre.\u000d\u000a    Both Centre directors (Barlow 2006-2008; Blandford 2009-) have steered\u000d\u000a      this research, drawing on the range of expertise within the Centre to\u000d\u000a      collaborate on specific elements of the work. For example, Barlow was a\u000d\u000a      joint recipient with Philip Mitchell in 2001 of an ESRC award to\u000d\u000a      investigate independent radio in Wales which, in turn, supported the\u000d\u000a      Centre's subsequent research on community radio in Wales and Traynor's\u000d\u000a      application of it in Laos. The latter also exemplifies the Centre's\u000d\u000a      mission to apply research from Wales to small nation contexts across the\u000d\u000a      world.

Our research has helped enrich the lives and imaginations\u000a      of the people and\u000a      organisations with whom we have worked, providing them with opportunities\u000a      for personal\u000a      expression and creativity. Our strong collaborative ethos of working in\u000a      partnership with diverse\u000a      social organisations and charities, often at grass roots level, has been\u000a      central to our ability to bring\u000a      about change through renewed understanding of different lives and voices.\u000a      In the process, our\u000a      research has also delivered tangible educational and economic benefits by\u000a      transferring technical\u000a      skills from our research centre to the citizens and communities with whom\u000a      we have worked.\u000a      Rooted in the conviction that storytelling is a creative practice that can\u000a      have a positive impact on\u000a      quality of life and mutual understanding in civil society, our research\u000a      has also had an impact in\u000a      policy-making by both providing powerful evidence of the effects of policy\u000a      decisions and debates\u000a      on the lives of ordinary people, and by advocating for the value of\u000a      creative arts practice as a\u000a      process that helps build individual and community assets, by fostering\u000a      social inclinations and skills\u000a      critical to civic renewal. Details of the impact are best indicated\u000a      through examination of some of\u000a      GEECS's collaborative outputs and how they ensure the reach and\u000a      significance of the above\u000a      research.\u000a    Impact: Public Services.\u000a      The `Who Do You Think I Am?' project applies Fyfe's research on the\u000a      benefits of participation in\u000a      the arts (see for example 3.1 3.3 and Fyfe REF 2), making an impact by\u000a      improving the delivery of\u000a      public services for homeless people whilst promoting an understanding of\u000a      disadvantaged and\u000a      marginalised individuals. It was a collaborative project carried out in\u000a      2010, led by Fyfe for GEECS,\u000a      in collaboration with British Telecom, Boomerang TV, Cube Interactive and\u000a      Cardiff Y.M.C.A\u000a      Housing Association, which resulted in six short films (http:\/\/vimeo.com\/40769899)\u000a      created using\u000a      the stories of homeless people at the Cardiff YMCA Housing Association.\u000a      Who Do You Think I\u000a      Am? was funded by a grant of &#163;44,715 from the Welsh Assembly Government\u000a      demonstrating the\u000a      interest in Fyfe's research among policy makers. The project had a direct\u000a      impact on vulnerable\u000a      young people's opportunities and ability to imagine a better future. As\u000a      well as the benefits for the\u000a      young people involved, this project helped professionals and organisations\u000a      better understand and\u000a      meet the needs of vulnerable people.

It has enabled over 22,231 individuals and 232\u000a      community groups to\u000a      become digitally literate, better accessing civic and consumer life,\u000a      becoming less isolated and\u000a      improving their employability.

It has\u000a      received commissions from more than 20 organisations (e.g. Equalities and\u000a      Human Rights\u000a      Commission, Newport Social Services, Aneurin Bevan Health Board) to create\u000a      digital, multi-media\u000a      narratives. Karen Lewis was recruited to lead the unit from the BBC, where\u000a      she was producer of\u000a      the BBC's award-winning Digital Storytelling Project, Capture\u000a        Wales . Storyworks fully realised its\u000a      potential in 2013 as a spin-out that now operates as a\u000a      commercially-independent business,\u000a      generating economic prosperity, and applying insights from GEECS research\u000a      to public service and\u000a      cultural sectors, whilst maintaining close links with GEECS. Lewis has\u000a      since become co-director of\u000a      GGECS with Fyfe, completing her MRes in 2012.\u000a    Fyfe and Wilson's storytelling research has responded to the knowledge\u000a      transfer and catalyst\u000a      agendas. For example, in 2009 Wilson and Fyfe received a &#163;184,000 grant\u000a      from the Technology\u000a      Strategy Board to undertake collaborative work with the Marylebone Cricket\u000a      Club (MCC) to unearth\u000a      and preserve the history of local cricket clubs (see 5.1). Alongside\u000a      published academic research, a\u000a      MCC website (http:\/\/www.takingthefield.com\/)\u000a      and museum display were curated to ensure that the\u000a      research had reach and significance both within and outside the academy.\u000a      GEECS' research has\u000a      made an important cultural impact on the revival and development of\u000a      storytelling as both a\u000a      performance practice and a means for better understanding individuals and\u000a      communities across\u000a      society. It has shared its findings with a wide range of stakeholders\u000a      thereby influencing civil\u000a      society, public discourse and policy making.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28142","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1512440","Name":"Uzbekistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"732800","Name":"Bulgaria"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Context\u000a      The life of Mieczys&#322;aw Weinberg illuminates our understanding of cultural\u000a      responses to the mass migration provoked by the Second World War.\u000a      Following his flight from Poland to Soviet Belo-Russia, Uzbekistan and\u000a      finally Moscow, Weinberg's experiences led him to produce vocal and stage\u000a      works that number among the finest musical commemorations of the\u000a      Holocaust. Weinberg's music is now recognised to be of far greater range,\u000a      social resonance and intrinsic value than had been previously realised\u000a      thanks to the work of Professor Fanning and the performances by Quatuor\u000a      Danel. The important influences that Weinberg had on his friend and mentor\u000a      Shostakovich and others are also now recognised.\u000a    Pathways to Impact\u000a      The research was disseminated and promoted through a wide variety of\u000a      sources, including scholarly publications such as a monograph (796 copies\u000a      sold June 2010-December 2012), essays and conference papers. It has also\u000a      been published in CD booklet essays and newspaper articles. There have\u000a      also been various recordings and performance events in national and\u000a      international venues. All performances referred to here were given to\u000a      non-academic audiences in commercial settings.\u000a    Reach and Significance of the Impact\u000a    Impact on public knowledge of Mieczys&#322;aw Weinberg\u000a      Before Professor Fanning's research there was just one book on Weinberg &#8212;\u000a      a specialised study in Russian, dealing with 10 symphonies &#8212; and no\u000a      scholarly articles. Recordings of his music were also limited in number.\u000a      Roughly four times as many CDs are now available, of which most are\u000a      directly or indirectly connected to the research. Professor Fanning's\u000a      publications on Weinberg are seen as essential sources. Gramophone\u000a      said his work \"Will serve as the key reference point for enthusiasts and\u000a      skeptics alike\" (February 2011) and BBC Music Magazine wrote \"A\u000a      totally sympathetic yet balanced appraisal of this highly significant\u000a      figure... Fanning's book is a voyage of discovery... his enthusiasm is\u000a      vividly conveyed\" (December 2010).\u000a    Professor Fanning has also contributed to commercial documentaries by\u000a      &#214;sterreichischer Rundfunk (2010) and Neos (DVD\/BluRay issue of Weinberg's\u000a      opera, The Passenger &#8212; NEOS 51005, 2010).\u000a    Broadcasters and journalists routinely refer to Professor Fanning's\u000a      writings as their principal source of information. For example, a\u000a      journalist from The New Yorker says: \"It is difficult to think of\u000a      another example of scholarly work having such immediate impact on the\u000a      repertory of ensembles and opera houses around the world... only when I\u000a      came across Fanning's researches, the quartet performances that the Danels\u000a      executed under his supervision, and, perhaps, most importantly, the\u000a      masterly Holocaust opera The Passenger, which Fanning translated and\u000a      helped to ready for performance, did I take the measure of Weinberg's\u000a      extraordinary gifts.\" [5.1] Fanning's public talks relating to Weinberg's\u000a      work have occurred with Quatuor Danel at the University of Manchester.\u000a      There have also been talks with Weinberg's friend Tommy Persson [5.5], the\u000a      composer Reinhard Flender and at the Royal Northern College of Music and\u000a      Opera North. His talks on Weinberg have also proved popular at the German\u000a      festivals Bregenzer Festspiele and Gohrisch Festival. [5.8]\u000a    Impact on music\u000a      The Quatuor Danel's performance of Weinberg's 17 string quartets in\u000a      November 2009 attracted an audience of 751 people from Sweden, USA,\u000a      France, Belgium, Holland, Germany and the UK to the University of\u000a      Manchester's Martin Harris Centre of Music and Drama [5.2]. The\u000a      group also performed the complete cycle in Belgium in 2011. Before that\u000a      Quatuor Danel performed Weinberg's quartets individually at the University\u000a      of Manchester from 2008-2011 (10 concerts, averaging 125 attendees each\u000a      [5.2], including 10 UK and 5 world premieres) and then more widely in 57\u000a      European and UK concerts (2008-11).\u000a    The University of Manchester Quartet cycle (and Lady Magnesia)\u000a      were nominated as the `most adventurous programming [in the UK] of 2009'\u000a      by Ivan Hewett in The Daily Telegraph. The first volume of CD\u000a      recordings of the cycle (2007-2012) was nominated by BBC Music Magazine as\u000a      `Chamber CD of the month' (March 2008, p. 72; magazine circulation\u000a      47,091).\u000a    Record companies in the UK, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland (Chandos\u000a      [5.3], CPO, BIS, Divox, and Toccata Classics [5.4]) have published booklet\u000a      essays by Professor Fanning accompanying their CDs of Weinberg's music.\u000a      BIS and Divox reported sales of 1390 and 993 units respectively, as of Oct\u000a      2011. The companies have also drawn on his advice over repertoire and\u000a      scores, described as \"a vital element in the success of the recordings\".\u000a      [5.4]\u000a    Impact on musicians\u000a      The significance of the research is evident through its promotion of, and\u000a      influence on, performances of Weinberg's works. It has enabled\u000a      professional music organisations to provide innovative programmes for\u000a      their audiences. For example:\u000a    \u000a      Professor Fanning's translation was used in preparation for the world\u000a        premiere of Weinberg's Requiem by the Royal Liverpool\u000a        Philharmonic Orchestra (RLPO) in 2009 [5.7].\u000a      His singing translation of Lady Magnesia led to the world\u000a        premiere of this opera [5.7], conducted by Clark Rundell (RLPO, 2010).\u000a      His literal translation for the opera The Passenger formed the\u000a        basis of David Pountney's libretto for the English National Opera's\u000a        production in 2011. [5.8]\u000a      His research on Weinberg's The Portrait influenced the\u000a        Bulgarian conductor Rossen Gergov's approach to this opera which was\u000a        performed by the Bregenzer Festspiele in August 2010 and Opera North in\u000a        February 2011.\u000a    \u000a    Professor Fanning's research has also impacted on performers' choice and\u000a      interpretation of repertoire. For example, the American pianist Allison\u000a      Brewster Franzetti has recorded the complete works of Weinberg's piano\u000a      music on four Naxos CDs [5.6].\u000a    Recent and forthcoming premieres of operas in Germany and Houston (where\u000a      Professor Fanning is an invited speaker) testify to the growing\u000a      international reverence for Weinberg. A large part of this new-found\u000a      interest is as a result of the Manchester research.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This research has had a significant impact on raising the profile of the\u000a      Polish born composer Mieczys&#322;aw Weinberg. Prior to Professor Fanning's\u000a      work little was known in the West about this composer's extensive musical\u000a      output and his music was rarely performed. Professor Fanning's research\u000a      has enhanced public and professional awareness of the music of Weinberg,\u000a      impacting on musicians, record companies, arts venues and audiences in\u000a      Britain and Europe. It has led to the first ever performance cycle of his\u000a      17 string quartets as well as world premieres of his Requiem and\u000a      his comic opera Lady Magnesia, alongside other performances and\u000a      numerous recordings.

The key researcher\u000a      was Professor David Fanning (1992-date) who was aided by Marc Danel, Giles\u000a      Millet, Vlad Bogdanas and Guy Danel of the Belgian string quartet Quatuor\u000a      Danel (2004-date).\u000a    The aim of the research was (and continues to be) to reveal the full\u000a      range and significance of the music of Mieczys&#322;aw Weinberg. The pianist\u000a      and composer was born in Poland in 1919 and twice fled Nazi invasions\u000a      before finally settling in Moscow where he became one of the most highly\u000a      regarded composers in the Shostakovich circle. Professor Fanning wanted to\u000a      explore his contribution to both Soviet and international musical\u000a      development and how Weinberg's work reflects wider social and cultural\u000a      issues.\u000a    The key research steps were:\u000a    \u000a      Building on work published in 2004 [3.6] Professor Fanning embarked on\u000a        intensive research into Weinberg's life and music. In 2006 he was\u000a        invited to speak on Weinberg at the conference \"Shostakovich and\u000a        Weinberg\" at the University of Rochester in New York.\u000a      On the strength of this and his track record in Soviet music, he was\u000a        entrusted with the legacy of Per Skans, the Swedish broadcaster and\u000a        scholar who had amassed a substantial collection of biographical\u000a        materials concerning Weinberg. Skans died in February 2007.\u000a      Professor Fanning visited the Weinberg family archive in Moscow in\u000a        2006 and 2010 and his research led to the first book-length survey of\u000a        Weinberg's life and works in any language [3.1].\u000a      During this time the Belgian string quartet Quatuor Danel embarked on\u000a        performances of all 17 Weinberg string quartets, in conjunction with CD\u000a        recordings for the German label CPO. The group performed the complete\u000a        cycle in November 2009.\u000a    \u000a    The key research outputs were:\u000a    \u000a      An assessment of all Weinberg's manuscripts, which amounted to some\u000a        20,000 pages of material [3.1, 3.2].\u000a      A critical analysis of his works including 154 opuses and more than 70\u000a        film and theatre scores [3.1, 3.2].\u000a      The translation of vocal works, both literal and for singing [3.4].\u000a      The preparation of performing editions of the string quartets, which\u000a        were done in partnership with Quatuor Danel [3.3].\u000a    \u000a    The research is still active with recent and prospective productions of\u000a      Weinberg's operas, notably The Portrait (Opera North, 2011) and The\u000a        Passenger (English National Opera, 2011).

[5.10]\u000a    The main impacts of the edition are:\u000a    \u000a      Since 2009 an acclaimed British pianist has been recording the\u000a        complete cycle of 35 sonatas,\u000a        not just the usual 32, using Professor Cooper's edition. He states that\u000a        \"this edition is now the\u000a        benchmark for all other editions of these works, as the meticulous\u000a        scholarship of [Prof] Cooper has\u000a        brought to light many important details hitherto glossed over.\" [5.1]\u000a      It has been used as the basis for live performances of all 35 sonatas\u000a        in London by another\u000a        acclaimed British pianist during 2011 and 2012 (he states that \"Cooper's\u000a        research has undoubtedly\u000a        influenced and informed my own performance practice of Beethoven's\u000a        works, as well as that of my\u000a        students, colleagues and amateurs\") [5.3] and for a series of\u000a        master-classes led by Professor\u000a        Cooper at the Musikeon in Valencia, Spain in 2010 and 2012.\u000a      Two movements from Professor Cooper's edition were included in ABRSM's\u000a        Grade 8 piano\u000a        exam syllabus for 2009-10 and another two for 2011-12. ABRSM's graded\u000a        exams are taken in over\u000a        90 countries, meaning that children and adult learners of the piano\u000a        around the world are benefiting\u000a        directly from the research by having a better text and performance\u000a        advice available. [5.2]\u000a      Professor Cooper's edition as a whole, or portions of it, has achieved\u000a        substantial sales. It has\u000a        also been published in German, and a Chinese edition published under\u000a        licence by the Shanghai\u000a        Music Publishing House in 2010 generated additional income for ABRSM\u000a        [5.2].\u000a    \u000a    Impact on recordings and performances\u000a    Professor Cooper's reconstruction of the original slow movement of\u000a      Beethoven's Quartet Op. 18\u000a      No. 2 was reported around the world when it was performed by the\u000a      Brussels-based string quartet\u000a      Quatuor Danel in September 2011. It featured in 19 radio and television\u000a      broadcasts, including\u000a      reports by the BBC, CBS and PBS, and in more than 100 global newspaper\u000a      articles. The coverage\u000a      recognises the significant cultural impact that making an extra Beethoven\u000a      piece available for\u000a      performance and recording has. A recording was broadcast in full on BBC\u000a      Radio 3 on the day of\u000a      the first performance, with excerpts presented on other radio stations\u000a      including Radio 4 [5.4].\u000a      Several ensembles have requested sets of parts to enable them to perform\u000a      the piece, notably a\u000a      leading British string quartet, the Belcea Quartet, who hold concerts\u000a      around the world [5.5].\u000a      Professor Cooper's discovery and performance of Beethoven's hymn `Pange\u000a      lingua' in 2012 had\u000a      similar media coverage and cultural impact.\u000a    Impact on the public knowledge of Beethoven\u000a    Concert Programme notes\u000a    Since 2008 Professor Cooper has contributed many sets of programme notes.\u000a      For example, in\u000a      2008 his notes appeared in programme booklets for eight BBC Promenade\u000a      Concerts at the Royal\u000a      Albert Hall. The hall capacity is 5,544, and that year average attendance\u000a      was 90% of capacity, so\u000a      the programme booklets were read by potentially 40,000 people. Excerpts\u000a      from the printed\u000a      programme are often summarised in the radio announcements too, reaching a\u000a      potential audience\u000a      of around 16 million, who benefit from the increased understanding of and\u000a      insight into the works\u000a      they were listening to [5.6]. Proms programme notes were also written from\u000a      2009-13. Other notable\u000a      programme notes have been written for the Brighton Festival 2010, the 2010\u000a      Three Choirs Festival\u000a      in Gloucester, the Halle Orchestra and the Edinburgh International\u000a      Festival.\u000a    CD liner notes\u000a    CD liner notes written by Cooper have appeared for over a dozen\u000a      recordings, including those in\u000a      boxed sets, within the specified period. Two of the most notable are the\u000a      complete Beethoven\u000a      symphonies as conducted by Osmo V&#228;nsk&#228; and the complete Beethoven piano\u000a      concertos played\u000a      by Ronald Brautigam, conducted by Andrew Parrott and issued by BIS Records\u000a      between 2008 and\u000a      2011 (more than 137,000 copies sold) [5.7].\u000a    Public Lectures\u000a    Professor Cooper's research on Beethoven's life and works has had a very\u000a      extensive reach,\u000a      interpreting cultural heritage for the benefit of many audiences external\u000a      to universities. Key\u000a      examples include the 2008-9 year-long celebration `Beethoven Unwrapped' at\u000a      Kings Place in\u000a      London. 19 lectures were given by Professor Cooper, supported by other\u000a      specialists of his choice.\u000a      Professor Cooper has also held pre-concert talks for Manchester Camerata\u000a      and other orchestras.\u000a      Further afield he has spoken at concerts given by the Vanbrugh Quartet in\u000a      Cork, the BBC Scottish\u000a      Symphony Orchestra in Glasgow and the City of Birmingham Symphony\u000a      Orchestra (\"Cooper's two\u000a      talks were each attended by at least 300 members of the general public\u000a      [several of whom]\u000a      commented to our staff about how helpful and interesting they found the\u000a      talks, and urged us to\u000a      book him again\") [5.8]. Cooper was invited to be one of the main speakers\u000a      at the 2012 Musical\u000a      Brain \"The Beethoven Question: Can Art Make Life Worth Living?\"\u000a      conference at the Southbank\u000a      Centre, London. In feedback questionnaires, numerous attendees cited\u000a      Professor Cooper's\u000a      contributions as their highlight [5.9].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This research investigating many aspects of the life and works of Ludwig\u000a      van Beethoven led to the\u000a      publication of a ground-breaking new edition of his 35 piano sonatas. The\u000a      research has not only\u000a      influenced and informed the professional and amateur performance practice\u000a      of Beethoven's works\u000a      but has also contributed to a wider public understanding of his music,\u000a      particularly through the\u000a      performance of previously unheard Beethoven works. It has also contributed\u000a      to economic\u000a      prosperity in the creative and publishing sectors.

The key researcher was Professor Barry Cooper\u000a      (1994-date).\u000a    The research extended from an initial examination of Beethoven's largely\u000a      neglected folksong\u000a      settings [3.1] to a new life-and-works study and a detailed examination of\u000a      all the source material for\u000a      the 35 piano sonatas. The key research outcomes were:\u000a    \u000a      In 2000, Professor Cooper's monograph [3.2] on Beethoven was first\u000a        published. It was a\u000a        thorough re-examination of all the evidence on which previous Beethoven\u000a        biographies had\u000a        been based. Many new conclusions were reached, on such diverse issues as\u000a        Beethoven's\u000a        relationships with his sister-in-law Johanna and teacher Joseph Haydn,\u000a        the originality of his\u000a        earliest works, the genesis of his First Symphony and of the Prometheus\/Eroica\u000a        theme and\u000a        the origins of the name Elise in his famous F&#252;r Elise.\u000a        The book was reissued in paperback\u000a        in 2008, suitably updated to incorporate the latest research by\u000a        Professor Cooper and\u000a        others.\u000a      The research also led to the publication of various articles and\u000a        shorter studies by Professor\u000a        Cooper. These include the first complete transcription and commentary on\u000a        Beethoven's late\u000a        revisions to his Fourth Piano Concerto [3.4] and a reconstruction from\u000a        Beethoven's\u000a        sketches of the original lost slow movement for his String Quartet Op.\u000a        18 No. 2 [3.5].\u000a      A second major branch of the research was a detailed examination of\u000a        all the source\u000a        material for Beethoven's 35 piano sonatas, which culminated in a new\u000a        edition of them with\u000a        a 150,000-word commentary [3.3]. Although these works have been\u000a        published before,\u000a        Professor Cooper's 2007 edition differs substantially from all previous\u000a        ones, containing\u000a        major innovations.\u000a    \u000a    The research combined scholarly textual criticism of the highest order,\u000a      where every variant\u000a      is taken into account, with investigation into performance practice and\u000a      its relationship to\u000a      Beethoven's notation. An example of the former is provided by the sonata\u000a      Op. 31 No. 3,\u000a      where there are two original editions, one from Zurich and one from\u000a      London. In bar 7, the\u000a      Zurich edition shows four semiquavers &#8212; a reading adopted in all previous\u000a      modern editions,\u000a      but the London one shows a quaver plus three triplet semiquavers.\u000a      Beethoven's sketches\u000a      confirm that this version is correct.\u000a    As for performance issues, these also required much original research,\u000a      particularly\u000a      regarding grace notes, trills, staccato signs (dot or dash) and double\u000a      bars [3.6]. For each of\u000a      these issues Professor Cooper's research led to somewhat surprising\u000a      conclusions about\u000a      how to relate the original notation to performance. The notational and\u000a      performance\u000a      research generated detailed bar-by-bar commentaries on each of the 35\u000a      sonatas.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28191","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"831053","Name":"Kosovo"},{"GeoNamesId":"2275384","Name":"Liberia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"783754","Name":"Albania"},{"GeoNamesId":"6290252","Name":"Serbia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1227603","Name":"Sri Lanka"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1149361","Name":"Afghanistan"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Context: Theatre practitioners and artists in war\/conflict zones\u000a      before this project reported a sense of disconnection, a lack of resources\u000a      and training and demand for documentation of theirs and others' work.\u000a      Excellent local practices were rarely linked and there was little\u000a      opportunity for learning from past experiences. The work was often seen as\u000a      marginal, and international donors made decisions on funding based on\u000a      minimal understanding of the role of the arts in these settings. In the\u000a      practice of applied theatre professionally, the field of theatre in war or\u000a      conflict zones was unexplored.\u000a    Pathways to impact: The project from its initiation has worked\u000a      with artists, theatre practitioners, NGO workers and others living and\u000a      working in war zones. At all times it is their experience that has been\u000a      acknowledged for its value, documented\/archived and shared throughout the\u000a      project. To make this possible, we visited conflict zones directly, while\u000a      also running workshops and seminars in Manchester for invited\u000a      international artists. All resources of the project were made freely\u000a      available to all partners. The project's online strategy has pro-actively\u000a      developed throughout the initiative, at all times responding to the\u000a      changing demands of the partners. Its primary objective is to enable a\u000a      sharing of materials and as wide a public discussion of this work as\u000a      possible.\u000a    Reach and Significance:\u000a      Cultural impact on international arts organisations. IPOW\u000a      has documented, archived and facilitated the interconnection of over\u000a        350 arts organisations internationally. This has provided a platform\u000a      for their work and linked these organisations with similar groups\u000a      internationally. These organisations acknowledge the importance that the\u000a      project has had in supporting and enhancing their work: the sustainable\u000a      nature of the research, notes the Creative Director of Community Arts\u000a      North West, \"has allowed time for real interchange, growth, development of\u000a      understanding and shared terminology, and the ability to grow as a\u000a      world-wide movement\" [5.2]. IPOW has been involved in training theatre\u000a      workers in participatory theatre techniques, and in supporting evaluations\u000a      of their work in local contexts. The benefit reported by these\u000a      organisations is increased international profile, increased domestic\u000a      profile created by international links, shared learning of different\u000a      approaches and practices, and sustaining of their work through the\u000a      international connections that have been created. 40 of the groups and\u000a      practitioners whose work has been documented attended the various public\u000a      events organised by IPOW as part of its networking phase. This included 4\u000a      events in Manchester: In Place of War Network Meeting 1 (23-24 July 2011);\u000a      Skype Seminar from Places of War (8th November 2011); Performance:\u000a        In Place of War Book Launch (17 December 2011); Project Closing\u000a      Event (15 March 2012). There was also one event in London at the\u000a      Roundhouse (11 February 2012), one in Pristina, Kosovo (June 2010) and one\u000a      in Goma, DRC (June 2011). Over 800 people attended the Manchester events,\u000a      35 the Kosovo event and 30 the Goma event. The Kosovo event, comments the\u000a      Executive Director of the Centre for Childrens' Theatre Development, \"has\u000a      had a huge impact on audiences, and has opened up further discussions on\u000a      the role of theatre in a newborn country. Mr Thompson's research was also\u000a      crucial when designing and developing the Voices project in Kosovo\u000a      &#8212; an interactive theatre project concerning people gone missing during the\u000a      war. For the first time after the war in Kosovo, Albanian and Serbian\u000a      actors worked together in developing and presenting forum theatre scenes\u000a      to both the Albanian and Serbian community\" [5.1].\u000a    Engaging with and mediating between NGOs. A number of NGOs\u000a      have had close association with IPOW during the course of its work, in\u000a      particular Children in Crisis (CiC) and Search for Common Ground. These\u000a      partners acknowledge how participation in the network and involvement in\u000a      the artist training led by researchers has helped improve their use of\u000a      theatre and the arts, and\/or encouraged them to make new links to local\u000a      arts groups. By way of example, CiC have developed a new initiative in DRC\u000a      that incorporates theatre performances in their education programmes. This\u000a      is part of a multi-year project supported by Comic Relief and the Baring\u000a      Foundation and has led to Thompson visiting DRC to run training\u000a      programmes (July 2010, June 2011, January 2013), as well as running\u000a      workshops for CiC in London (April 2010), for staff from DRC, Sierra\u000a      Leone, Liberia and Afghanistan. The Director of Programmes at CiC credits\u000a      these interventions as \"making a significant contribution towards the\u000a      fulfilment of the two core project objectives: (i) improvements in\u000a      participation, completion and quality of education for at least 14,000\u000a      children; and (ii) strengthened community cohesion and promotion of the\u000a      rights of women and girls As evidence of this, an 8-10 % increase in\u000a      children's enrolment has already been recorded in the schools targeted\u000a      since 2010; and as a direct result of the TIE component, church leaders\u000a      from the northern axe of the Plateau have put together a decree supporting\u000a      the abolishment of all forms of early and forced marriage\" [5.3]\u000a    Enhancing public understanding. As well as these direct\u000a      beneficiaries, a greater international understanding of the role of the\u000a      arts in troubled situations has been developed through public access to\u000a      the website, dissemination of the project publications (latest sales\u000a      figures for Performance in Place of War: 554 in US\/UK; 461 in\u000a      India), and presentation of the project through public events and media\u000a      outlets. In Place of War's new online platform went live in December 2012\u000a      and currently has profiles of 550 different organisations and individuals,\u000a      and stores 191 artefacts relating to their work. As of July 2013, the site\u000a      had received 4,383 separate visitors, making 8,332 visits, viewing a total\u000a      of 27,000 pages [5.5]. Between 2008 and 2010, the previous IPOW website\u000a      received over 6,000 hits from individuals in 30 different countries. These\u000a      figures demonstrate an expanding public discourse about the arts in\u000a      situations of armed conflict. Coverage of the project's work in the UK\u000a      press has also helped to extend public understanding of these issues [5.7;\u000a      5.8].\u000a    Influencing professional training. During its primary\u000a      research phase, the IPOW project conducted sustained case study work in\u000a      Sri Lanka, creating significant educational and professional practitioner\u000a      impact in this context. A manual was produced from the training workshops\u000a      run by Thompson (2004-08), which was distributed across the NGO\u000a      sector on the island. Versions were produced in Sinhala, Tamil and English\u000a      for people working with children, particularly during the post-tsunami\u000a      relief period, from 2005 onwards. The manual was also made freely\u000a      downloadable in pdf form from the IPOW website.\u000a    Contributing to civil society and cultural life in the UK.\u000a      IPOW's other sustained case study explored arts initiatives with refugee\u000a      and asylum-seeking communities across the UK. As part of this research,\u000a      IPOW helped establish the Greater Manchester Refugee Arts Partnership.\u000a      This coalition of Manchester organisations raised the funds for and\u000a      created the Exodus project, which developed and supported arts programmes\u000a      by refugee communities from 2004-10 [5.9]. During the REF assessment\u000a      period, this included five Refugee Arts festivals and two theatre\u000a      festivals. Participant feedback testified to the power of the productions\u000a      in contributing to public discourse about refugees, and the importance of\u000a      having a reflective context in which practitioners could gather: \"Brilliant\u000a        to have this space for discussion. Great to have the contradictions in\u000a        practice\" (from evaluation report on 2010 Exodus Festival) [5.4].\u000a      One particular initiative amongst the many arts programmes supported was\u000a      the drama group at the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of\u000a      Torture, set up by Thompson and run by Jeffers from\u000a      2004-10 [5.6]. The latter won the University of Manchester \"Volunteer of\u000a      the Year\" award for her work on this project, and was also awarded the\u000a      University's first Medal for Social Responsibility (both 2010).UoM's\u000a      Martin Harris Centre hosted Platforma from 31st\u000a      October-1st November 2013, a national conference of refugee\u000a      artists, advocates and activists, co-organised by Jeffers.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    In Place of War (IPoW) is a research project that has had substantial\u000a      impact on civil society and cultural life worldwide by documenting,\u000a      analysing and enhancing the work of war zone theatre practitioners.\u000a      Paradoxically, in a context of globalisation, these artists are\u000a      professionally and geographically isolated: indeed, it is often assumed\u000a      that art cannot take place in a war zone, when in fact it remains a vital\u000a      means of human expression during times of crisis. To overcome this\u000a      relative invisibility, the project has helped professionals and\u000a      organisations in several countries by building artist networks, developing\u000a      resources for creative practice, and offering practitioner training. The\u000a      project has also provided support for third sector agencies developing\u000a      projects in this field, with the research enabling more context-sensitive\u000a      planning of programmes. There has also been impact on public discourse,\u000a      providing new insights about the role of artistic work in conflict\u000a      situations and the esteem in which it is held, while contributing to the\u000a      increased public profile of such work and its potential for global\u000a      circulation.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    University of Manchester\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Manchester (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Manchester","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"North West","UKPRN":10007798}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"216281","Name":"Goma"},{"GeoNamesId":"786714","Name":"Pristina"}],"References":"\u000a    Key outputs &#8212; Monographs:\u000a    \u000a3.1 James Thompson, Jenny Hughes and Michael Balfour (2009).

The key researchers have been: James\u000a      Thompson (PI), Jenny Hughes (project research assistant\u000a      2004-08, UoM lectureship from 2006), Alison Jeffers (project PhD\u000a      2004-07, UoM lectureship from 2008), and Co-I Michael Balfour (University\u000a      of Exeter 2004-07; Griffith University, Australia, 2007-present). The\u000a      primary aim of the research was to examine the relationship between\u000a      performance and war through an analysis of contemporary examples of\u000a      theatre in sites of armed conflict internationally. Concomitantly, there\u000a      was also a UK-based focus to the project, looking at performances made\u000a      here by refugees and asylum seekers, and at forms of theatrical protest\u000a      against wars prosecuted in other parts of the world. The research has\u000a      occurred in three key phases:\u000a\u0009  \u000a    \u000aMapping (AHRC project funding, 2004-08) The first phase\u000a      of the project involved a mapping exercise during which project\u000a      researchers contacted over 300 theatre and arts organisations in war-zones\u000a      internationally, as well as all major refugee arts projects in the UK. The\u000a      objective was to construct as comprehensive an understanding as possible\u000a      of the ways in which theatre and performance has been used in response to\u000a      conflict situations. This mapping extended, for instance, to responses to\u000a      the \"war on terror\" &#8212; a \"counterinsurgency\" war resulting in distinct\u000a      forms of performative response. To document our findings, we constructed\u000a      an associated website and database of theatre practitioners, digitised\u000a      thousands of items of data for an online archive, organised seminars and\u000a      conferences and published a range of outputs including the major project\u000a      monograph, Performance in Place of War (2009) [3.1]. This edition,\u000a      written by Thompson, Hughes and Balfour, combined critical analysis,\u000a      contextual research and a mapping of the diverse range of international\u000a      practices uncovered by the study. A further AHRC grant (Research Leave\u000a        scheme) allowed Thompson to complete an additional\u000a      monograph, Performance Affects (2009) [3.2], which drew on this\u000a      research to make an argument for an `affective turn' in Applied Theatre. Hughes\u000a      also published a monograph stemming from aspects of the mapping research,\u000a      Performance in a Time of Terror (2011) [3.3], and Jeffers\u000a      published a monograph based on her PhD thesis, Refugees, Theatre and\u000a        Crisis (2011) [3.4]. In 2010, the project won the THE Award\u000a      for `Excellence and Innovation in the Arts'.\u000a    \u000aNetworking (Leverhulme network grant, 2009-11)\u000a      Leverhulme network funding allowed the development and expansion the\u000a      network of scholars and artists established during the initial research\u000a      phase, and included three major conferences: in Manchester (2009), at the\u000a      National Theatre, Kosovo (2010), and in Goma, DR Congo (2011). This\u000a      network enabled interactions between artists never before possible and\u000a      facilitated regional meetings of artists that helped open new alliances\u000a      and opportunities for collaboration.\u000a    \u000aIn Place of War Online (AHRC follow-on grant, 2012-13)\u000a      During this third project phase, aimed specifically at extending its\u000a      potential reach and impact, additional AHRC funds have supported the\u000a      development of a new online platform for artists and creative\u000a      practitioners in sites of armed conflict, unrest or disaster. The new\u000a      phase has opened the project to all art forms and provides an online\u000a      vehicle for the archiving, connecting and sharing of creative responses to\u000a      war. The platform is a response to the outcomes of the IPOW project, which\u000a      demanded ways for work to be stored, for expertise to be shared and for\u000a      artists to learn from, and become linked to, each other.\u000a\u0009  \u000a    Key Findings. The direct insights gained from this body of\u000a      research include: (i) a greater understanding of the role of the\u000a      arts in war and disaster situations &#8212; particularly the relation between\u000a      the space\/time of a conflict and related arts outputs; the differences in\u000a      orientation between reconciliation and justice-based projects; the links\u000a      between memorialisation and theatre making; and new understandings of the\u000a      aesthetic challenges faced by artists in these situations; (ii) a\u000a      critique of international donor practices, which has improved artists'\u000a      understandings of funding contexts and has helped make donor support more\u000a      sensitive to local contexts; (iii) an affirmation of the\u000a      importance of arts practices to communities in these sites, which has\u000a      helped to challenge external assumptions about the priorities of people\u000a      living through war. This in particular has validated the work of artist\u000a      groups and enabled new networks of practitioners who can confidently argue\u000a      for their work as central to local and national development concerns.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28192","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Context: The research investigations both build on and challenge\u000d\u000a      previous conceptions of popular\u000d\u000a      performance cultures and, particularly through their dissemination into\u000d\u000a      the commercial market\u000d\u000a      place and popular media contexts, have begun to impact on public\u000d\u000a      understandings of past\u000d\u000a      performance cultures and their connection to contemporary ones.

This has involved re-examining understandings\u000d\u000a      of popular and working\u000d\u000a      class performance cultures of the 19th Century, particularly by\u000d\u000a      refocusing attention on the working\u000d\u000a      experiences of professional and amateur performers in provincial as well\u000d\u000a      as urban settings.\u000d\u000a      Performance histories of the period have previously tended to focus on\u000d\u000a      large theatres in urban\u000d\u000a      centres, and on text-based theatrical forms such as melodrama, comedy,\u000d\u000a      travesty, etc.\u000d\u000a      Featherstone's work complements and extends these understandings by\u000d\u000a      highlighting marginal\u000d\u000a      forms (circus, fairground booth, music hall, etc.) and locations \"off the\u000d\u000a      beaten track\", and by\u000d\u000a      exploring the lives and routines of jobbing performers rather than the\u000d\u000a      stories of playwrights,\u000d\u000a      impresarios and \"name\" actors. This has been achieved through the analysis\u000d\u000a      of primary sources\u000d\u000a      including: theatre and performance archives; periodical and trade papers;\u000d\u000a      letters and personal\u000d\u000a      diaries of performers and audience members, many of which have been\u000d\u000a      sourced from the\u000d\u000a      descendants of their authors.\u000d\u000a    The first major publications to come out of this research included The\u000d\u000a        Victorian Clown, written with\u000d\u000a      Jacky Bratton [3.1]), which drew on rare 19th C. clown's comedy\u000d\u000a      notebooks, and  Journals of\u000d\u000a        Sydney Race 1892-1900 [3.3], which used the spectatorial\u000d\u000a      recollections of a Nottingham clerk as\u000d\u000a      the focus for a series of essays on provincial circus, fairground and\u000d\u000a      freak show performances.\u000d\u000a      These publications extended existing understandings of the complexities of\u000d\u000a      popular performance,\u000d\u000a      and the findings of this scholarly, archival research also &#8212; somewhat\u000d\u000a      unexpectedly &#8212; began to be\u000d\u000a      disseminated widely in popular press and media contexts. The Victorian\u000d\u000a        Clown, in particular,\u000d\u000a      prompted extensive media interest, including appearances and interviews on\u000d\u000a      Richard and Judy\u000d\u000a      (Channel 4), BBC Radio 4's Today programme and The World\u000d\u000a        Tonight, BBC News 24, BBC\u000d\u000a      Northwest Tonight, BBC Radio Manchester and RTE. A re-construction\u000d\u000a      of Victorian Clown material\u000d\u000a      was commissioned for a performance at the Grand Theatre, Blackpool, in\u000d\u000a      February 2007. Note:\u000d\u000a      These `impacts' are not detailed in the following sections of the case\u000d\u000a      study, as they predate the\u000d\u000a      current REF period. However, in highlighting the extent of public interest\u000d\u000a      in `forgotten' performance\u000d\u000a      traditions, they also directly informed Featherstone's subsequent research\u000d\u000a      and writing.\u000d\u000a    While continuing to publish her findings in traditional academic\u000d\u000a      contexts, Featherstone has also\u000d\u000a      sought to make her scholarly understanding of the period and its\u000d\u000a      performers accessible to popular\u000d\u000a      audiences as historical fiction, in the form of her novels Walking in\u000d\u000a        Pimlico (2009) and The\u000d\u000a        Newgate Jig (2010). The former involves a Victorian clog-dancing\u000d\u000a      comedian who becomes caught\u000d\u000a      up in a murder mystery, and tracks his experiences \"through shabby\u000d\u000a      pump-room pavilions,\u000d\u000a      fairgrounds and freak shows\" (Amazon.com). In the latter, a fugitive finds\u000d\u000a      sanctuary at the London\u000d\u000a      Aquarium amongst performing dogs, a doll-lady, a giant, and an author of\u000d\u000a      penny-dreadfuls. The\u000d\u000a      depiction of these milieux and the dialogues between characters draw\u000d\u000a      directly on continuing,\u000d\u000a      primary research into performers' acts and working lives. Thus, what began\u000d\u000a      as a scholarly\u000d\u000a      endeavour whose presumed audience also lay within the HE sector has been\u000d\u000a      transformed, through\u000d\u000a      adaptation and creative practice, into outputs more suited for\u000d\u000a      dissemination to a wider public.\u000d\u000a      Whilst the process of research has not altered, the means by which it has\u000d\u000a      been shaped for broader\u000d\u000a      consumption, and therefore its impact potential, have developed over the\u000d\u000a      period. Just as the\u000d\u000a      academic publications have contributed to the `social turn' in British\u000d\u000a      theatre history, through their\u000d\u000a      examination of the interrelationships between urban and rural poverty and\u000d\u000a      performance cultures,\u000d\u000a      so the fictional outputs have used an imaginative framework to locate\u000d\u000a      working-class performers in\u000d\u000a      a new and re-envisioned version of nineteenth century popular cultural\u000d\u000a      history.

The work has been presented in this context at the BBC\u000a      Radio 3 Free Thinking Festival, 2011, (\"BBC Radio 3 brings together\u000a      leading thinkers for a weekend of provocative debate, new ideas, music and\u000a      drama\" attended by over 4700 members of the public), Networked Electronic\u000a      Media Summit, 2010 (\"the event involves up to 400 attendees, 20 sponsors,\u000a      50 exhibitors and 40 speakers and authors selected following a competitive\u000a      call for papers.\") and the Thinking Digital Conference, 2011 (\"Exceptional\u000a      talent from the worlds of technology, science, business, media and the\u000a      arts.\").\u000a    The reach and significance of the electroacoustic works by the group is\u000a      demonstrated through numerous International performances including:\u000a    - Music under the influence of computers, Atkinson Hall, California, USA\u000a      2010\u000a    - International Festival Primavera de La Habana, Havana, Cuba 2010\\\u000a    - Sound Junction, Sheffield University, UK, 2010\u000a    - Sound Studio Concert, City University, 11th May, UK. 2010\u000a    - Days of Electroacoustic Music, Corfu, 29th Oct, Corfu, Greece, 2010\u000a    - XVI Festival Internacional de M&#250;sica Electroac&#250;stica, Tenerife, Spain,\u000a      2009\u000a    as well as international awards:\u000a    - 2009 Punto de Encuentro Canarias International Electroacoustic\u000a      Composition Competition, Spain, First Prize.\u000a    - Destellos Foundation Eleactroacoustic Music Competition, Prize\u000a      Selection.\u000a    - Bourges Electroacoustic Music Competition, Shortlist.\u000a    The group curates the biannual Echochroma concert series at Leeds\u000a      Metropolitan University, presenting compositional outputs from members of\u000a      the group and guests (including Manuella Blackburn, Liverpool Hope\u000a      University, Adrian Moore, Sheffield University, Dale Perkins, Leeds\u000a      College of Music). Attendees (estimated at a total of 1000 to date) at\u000a      this free concert since 2008, have included members of the public, as well\u000a      as students at Leeds Metropolitan University, their friends and their\u000a      families. Informal feedback indicates that a considerable number of\u000a      audience members had no previous exposure to contemporary music\u000a      composition and performance practice.\u000a    Following the growing recognition of the group's work, the Echochroma\u000a      collective has been invited to curate concerts and present work at the\u000a      Noisefloor Festival (Staffordshire University), in which original\u000a      practice-led research was presented from academic staff, postgraduate and\u000a      undergraduate students, Interactive Audio Game Showcase and MANTIS\u000a      Festival, NOVARS Research Centre, University of Manchester, alongside\u000a      other invited international artists from academia and industry, further\u000a      extending the reach and impact of their research.\u000a    Research by the group also informs more localised educational and\u000a      entertainment activities, including composition for theatre and dance\u000a      (Mooted Theatre Company, York Shakespeare Project), interactive sound\u000a      installations (York Minster, Swaledale Festival), youth workshops (Opera\u000a      North and local primary schools), and a regular after-school computer\u000a      programming club (Code Club) in which 9-11 year olds create new\u000a      interactive audio-visual works and games. This gives the group further\u000a      opportunity to disseminate compositional and interactive concepts from\u000a      their International-level research to many across the region.\u000a    The group is continuing to develop its profile and capacity for\u000a      international impact, and has a clearly defined and forward-looking\u000a      trajectory for future development. Further high-impact research outputs\u000a      have been confirmed for 2014. Ash is currently involved in a &#163;160 000\u000a      project that has successfully received funding from the Wellcome Trust and\u000a      Arts Council, which is anticipated will reach over 150,000 young people in\u000a      2014. The project will draw from research into interactivity, sonfication\u000a      and live generative systems, and includes an interactive childrens'\u000a      theatre show that will tour the UK, as well as an interactive installation\u000a      in the INTECH Science Centre, Winchester, which receives over 150,000\u000a      visitors a year.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The impact of the research by the Echochroma New Music Research Group at\u000a      Leeds Metropolitan University relates to new approaches to interactivity\u000a      in music performance and composition.

Kelly's research on identity in French\u000a      music has resulted in regular invitations to present, interview and take\u000a      part in discussions on BBC Radio 3 on a number of early twentieth-century\u000a      French composers. Most significant was her invitation to design and\u000a      present a 20-minute Proms interval feature on Ravel's Paris in August 2010\u000a      [Source 1]. The Proms is the most prominent annual event in the UK for\u000a      communicating classical music to a diverse non-specialist audience. Kelly\u000a      interviewed Ravel experts and international performers, designed the\u000a      programme and selected the music. In tracing the Parisian locations with\u000a      Ravelian associations, she argued for the significance of place to an\u000a      understanding of his musical identity. In her three appearances on Radio\u000a      3's flagship magazine programme Music Matters, to talk about\u000a      Debussy (2009), Ravel (2011) [source 2] and Poulenc (April 2013) [source\u000a      3], she discussed the composers' relationships to modernism and tradition.\u000a      She was academic advisor and contributor for the Poulenc programme,\u000a      establishing themes, questions and identifying specialists in France.\u000a      Inviting Kelly to be interviewed for the programme the Radio 3 researcher\u000a      asserted that `we could of course shape it round the areas you're most\u000a      interested in', adding in another email that `the producer was keen to\u000a      speak to you before going to Paris with a view to you being the person\u000a      that makes it all hang together!' [source 4]. BBC Radio 3 has an average\u000a      listening audience of over 2 million people per week, each of whom listen\u000a      to an average of over 6 hours of coverage per week [source 5].\u000a    Reyland made a substantial contribution to an edition of Radio 3's Music\u000a        Matters devoted to Lutoslawki in January 2013 [source 6]; here\u000a      Reyland's research on narrative contributed to the discussion. As with\u000a      Kelly, the value the BBC place on Reyland's expertise is evident in repeat\u000a      invitations, such as for Reyland to give a pre-concert Proms Plus talk on\u000a      this same theme at the BBC proms this year to a lay audience of 249\u000a      people. Reyland's talk drew on his research, offering the audience an\u000a      insight into the music they were to experience in live performance that\u000a      evening. He also contributed a programme note on the Cello Concerto for a\u000a      BBC Prom on 17th July.\u000a    The publication of Reyland's book led to calls from Guardian\u000a      readers, as part of the newspaper's focus on The Three Colours\u000a      Trilogy that month (Nov, 2011), to contact Reyland to discuss his research\u000a      further. As a result, he was commissioned to write a 1000-word article\u000a      communicating his research into the music's contribution to the films'\u000a      narratives and symbolism to a lay audience. After publishing the article,\u000a      Reyland discussed the films and his ideas in the comments' section (23\u000a      comments) with various readers [source 7]. He also participated in a live\u000a      blog on the films over the next few nights. Critics, readers and bloggers\u000a      regularly referenced and quoted his research in positive terms throughout\u000a      the week. It led to wider engagement through social media platforms, with\u000a      157 shares on Facebook, 4 on Linkedin and G+, and 31 tweets on Twitter,\u000a      showing continued impact of Reyland's work on the readership. In a review\u000a      of the French version of Kelly's chapter within French Music, Culture\u000a        and National Identity book by French popular interest magazine Forum\u000a        Opera, Kelly's chapter is singled out as being especially\u000a      informative [source 8].\u000a    The group has enabled the BBC to make lesser-known composers known to a\u000a      wider audience, reaching both creative arts organisations and their\u000a      audiences. In 2010 Williams chaired a study session as part of the BBC\u000a      `Total Immersion: Wolfgang Rihm' programme, one of a series of\u000a      high-profile events in which the BBC Symphony Orchestra engages with a\u000a      wider public. The Symposium included an interview with Rihm and a\u000a      presentation by a member of the Arditti Quartet [source 9]. Williams also\u000a      presented a paper on Rihm and the French surrealist writer Antonin Artaud;\u000a      here he was able to draw links between concerts in the programme given by\u000a      the BBC Symphony Orchestra and the London Sinfonietta. Kelly was invited\u000a      to interview Mme Christine Jolivet-Erhlih in front of a live audience of\u000a      c.200 people at Hoddinett Hall, BBC Wales in a pre-concert talk during a\u000a      `Discovering Jolivet' day. She tackled themes of cultural identity and\u000a      response to WWII in his musical oeuvre.\u000a    Through participation in commemorative Festivals and anniversary events,\u000a      the group makes an impact on national and international cultural life.\u000a      Kelly responded to a French Ministry of Culture invitation to participate\u000a      in national celebrations of the 150th anniversary of Debussy.\u000a      The focal point of these celebrations was a festival, L'Esprit Debussy,\u000a      at the Cit&#233; de la Musique in Paris in February 2012, which included\u000a      performances of Debussy's works by leading orchestras and discussions of\u000a      the composer's significance. Kelly's talk focused on Debussy's legacy,\u000a      drawing directly on her work on Debussy and legacy in publications from\u000a      2003, 2008 and 2012 [source 10]. She also contributed to the festival's\u000a      prize-winning publication (Paul Marmottan prize, Acad&#233;mie des Beaux-Arts),\u000a      which is aimed at a wider readership [source 11]. Kelly's chapter is one\u000a      of five (out of thirty-six) which is singled out by a music critic in a\u000a      public oriented website Musicologie.org. Here her chapter is\u000a      described as `virtuosic', helping the reader discover new elements of the\u000a      composer's legacy [source 12]. She also received an invitation to\u000a      contribute to national French commemorations of Poulenc, which took place\u000a      at the Conservatoire National Sup&#233;rieur de Musique in Paris in January\u000a      2013 [source 13]. Dr Reyland participated in Lutoslawski centennial\u000a      celebrations throughout Europe in 2013. He wrote a specially commissioned\u000a      essay on narrative, meaning and drama in Lutoslawski's music for the\u000a      Philharmonia Orchestra's Woven Words festival. The aim was to\u000a      explain musical meaning and how it relates to Lutoslawski's work in\u000a      non-technical language, while showing to a diverse audience how\u000a      Lutoslawski's work relates to wider social and cultural ideas. With the\u000a      title of Essences and Essentials: Lutos&#322;awski's Musical Stories,\u000a      it appears, translated into several languages including Polish, as one of\u000a      five commissioned essays on the orchestra's `Woven Words' website,\u000a      celebrating the life and work of Lutoslawski [source 14]. As part of the\u000a      festival he also spoke at a public study day at London's South Bank Centre\u000a      in March 2013 [source 15]. Williams took a leading role in organising and\u000a      programming Rihm 60th birthday celebrations in 2012; this Grove\u000a      Forum Plus event entitled `Wolfgang Rihm's Constructions of Subjectivity\u000a      and Tradition', which was a Royal College of Music and the\u000a      Goethe-Institut, London collaboration, explored key themes of Williams'\u000a      research on the role of the past in constructing contemporary German\u000a      traditions in front of a diverse audience [source 16].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The musicology group's research on modernity, tradition, cultural\u000a      identity and narrative has had an impact on the media, cultural industries\u000a      and performers.

These outputs share a number of\u000a      interlocking themes: the group's work elucidates the wider cultural\u000a      meaning of artistic creation and production, exploring the impact of\u000a      identity, tradition and politics on musical creativity in Europe over the\u000a      past 100 years. The group employs a distinctive range of methodologies to\u000a      interrogate these underlying themes, including historiography,\u000a      hermeneutics and analysis. Indeed, all members of the group have made\u000a      significant contributions to methodological debates in their area.\u000a    The group's focus on national identity and tradition permeates their\u000a      published work. Kelly's work on identity and tradition is dealt with most\u000a      fully in her monograph on Milhaud, Tradition and Style in the Works of\u000a        Darius Milhaud (Ashgate, 2003). Here she explored the composer's\u000a      religious and national identity, showing how Milhaud challenged prevailing\u000a      discourses in an effort to place himself within French traditions.\u000a      Williams tackles issues of national identity and tradition in relation to\u000a      post-WWII modernism in Germany, showing how composers, such as Rihm,\u000a      animate their Austro-German past. In his article, 'Swaying with Schumann:\u000a      Subjectivity and Tradition in Wolfgang Rihm's Fremde Szenen I-III and\u000a      Related Scores', Music and Letters (2006), he analyses the\u000a      complexities of German cultural and musical identity, contributing to\u000a      recent debates about the place of Germany in Europe. Since the publication\u000a      of his award-winning Music &amp; Letters article `Lutoslawski,\u000a      'Akcja', and the Poetics of Musical Plot' (2007), Reyland has developed\u000a      his interest in the relationship between Lutoslawski's music, Polish\u000a      history and cultural identity and, in his recent chapter in Music and\u000a        Narrative since 1900 (2012), he has begun to contest the composer's\u000a      claim that his music has nothing to do with the politics of his time.\u000a    Reyland's research on Preisner, which came to fruition in his substantial\u000a      study Zbigniew Prieisner's Three Colors Trilogy: A Film Score Guide\u000a      (Scarecrow, 2011), is concerned with narrative, symbolism, politics and\u000a      post-communism's engagement with capitalism and late modern consciousness.\u000a      It shows how artists respond to their times, tracing those events and\u000a      responses in their creative work. The study unpicks shifts in identity\u000a      during the journey from communism into democracy and western\u000a      consciousness. Kelly's collaborative and interdisciplinary edited\u000a      collection, French Music, Culture, and National Identity (2008),\u000a      explores music's link to the politics of its time, contributing to timely\u000a      debates about the extent to which music can respond to and reflect\u000a      political events, particularly at times of national crisis, such as war.\u000a    The group's research is concerned with the nature, scope and meaning of\u000a      modernism and postmodernism. Williams' first book, New Music and the\u000a        Claims of Modernity (Ashgate, 1997) proposed a more inclusive\u000a      understanding of modernism. He developed this idea in `Ageing of the New:\u000a      the Museum of Musical Modernism', in The Cambridge History of\u000a        Twentieth-Century Music, eds. Cook and Pople (2004), where it is\u000a      argued that modernism underwent significant expansion after 1975. Kelly's\u000a      research on Ravel and Les Six challenges narrow definitions of modernism\u000a      that exclude composers who resist Austro-Germanic notions of musical\u000a      progress. Reyland's work on narrativity is also revisionist by examining\u000a      the continuities between music before and after modernism, while his book\u000a      on Preisner deals with films chronicling the postmodern human condition.\u000a    Dates at Keele: Kelly has been Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, and is\u000a      now Professor; Reyland has been Lecturer and is now Senior Lecturer; and\u000a      Williams has been Lecturer, Senior Lecturer, and is now Reader.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28882","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"1562822","Name":"Vietnam"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Cloonan's research has achieved impact both internationally &#8212;\u000a      campaigning for artistic freedom\u000a      for musicians via Freemuse; and in the UK &#8212; assisting the campaign\u000a      for Licensing Act reform,\u000a      which led to the Live Music Act 2012.\u000a    International impact &#8212; artistic freedom and censorship &#8212; The right\u000a      to freedom of artistic\u000a      expression is enshrined in, among several international treaties, the\u000a      International Covenant on\u000a      Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, ratified by the United Nations\u000a      General Assembly in\u000a      December 1966.

Freemuse has\u000a      had Special Consultative\u000a      Status with the United Nation`s Economic and Social Council, ECOSOC, since\u000a      2012.\u000a    Cloonan's involvement stems from his leading role in its foundation &#8212; at\u000a      the 1st World Conference\u000a      on Music and Censorship in Copenhagen in 1998. Since he has been chair of\u000a      its Executive\u000a      Committee, providing strategic direction to the organisation's\u000a      Copenhagen-based Secretariat.\u000a      During its history Freemuse has published many reports on international\u000a      music censorship and a\u000a      right-based agenda for artists, as well as establishing a portal promoting\u000a      and highlighting different\u000a      national and international campaigns. Cloonan authored and acted as a key\u000a      advisor on many of\u000a      Freemuse's publications by identifying key issues, supporting and\u000a      developing the commissioning of\u000a      reports as well as assessing the credentials of likely writers and\u000a      commenting on drafts of the\u000a      reports. Freemuse reports are sent to the UN, international NGOs\u000a      interested in issues of freedom\u000a      of expression and various media outlets including the NME. Among\u000a      its reports is: Headbanging\u000a        against repressive regimes: Censorship of heavy metal in the Middle\u000a        East, North Africa, Southeast\u000a        Asia and China (Report 9, Freemuse, Copenhagen, 2010); ISSN:\u000a      1601-2127. ISBN 978-87-988163-3-1.104\u000a      pages; Cloonan acknowledgement pg 8) &#8212; available online at http:\/\/freemuse.org.\u000a    In December 2012 the programme manager of Freemuse, launched a new\u000a      consultation with all UN\u000a      General Assembly member states on cultural rights with these words:\u000a    The protection of artistic expression is just as important for the\u000a      development of democracy as\u000a      the protection of media workers. It is frequently artists who &#8212; through\u000a      music, visual arts or films\u000a      &#8212; put the `needle in the eye' and strike a chord with millions of people,\u000a      some of them unable to\u000a      read and with no access to express themselves.\u000a    The establishment of Freemuse, and its maturing as a trusted advocacy\u000a      group with international\u000a      reach, marked a major step forward in the recognition of musicians as\u000a      having the same rights to\u000a      freedom of expression as authors and other creators. Its work in\u000a      recording, monitoring and\u000a      lobbying on infringements of these rights has resulted in Freemuse's\u000a      recognition as the leading\u000a      NGO with expertise in issues of freedom of expression relating to\u000a      musicians. Since its\u000a      establishment Freemuse has recorded and publicised incidents of censorship\u000a      and oppression of\u000a      musicians internationally, published annual and country reports on freedom\u000a      of music expression\u000a      and lobbied against censorship. Recent Freemuse publicity (in June 2013)\u000a      has focused on a\u000a      Tunisian rapper sentenced to two years in prison, two Tibetan singers\u000a      sentenced in China, and a\u000a      Vietnamese musician fined for publishing `content that goes against the\u000a      policies and laws of the\u000a      Party and the State'.\u000a    In July 2012, the Chief of UN's Department of Economic and Social Affairs\u000a      (ECOSOC) NGO\u000a      Branch, formally conferred `special consultative status' on Freemuse,\u000a      stating:\u000a    We welcome the opportunity to work with you and will be happy to\u000a      facilitate your participation in\u000a      the work of the United Nations, in particular ECOSOC and its subsidiary\u000a      bodies.\u000a    UK: supporting live performance of music &#8212; The UK Licensing Act\u000a      introduced in 2003\u000a      significantly increased levels of control over live music, requiring\u000a      licences for most public and many\u000a      private performances. The Act proved controversial and campaigners argued\u000a      that the impact on\u000a      small venues including pubs, community halls, schools etc was hugely\u000a      detrimental as previously\u000a      performances in such places involving one or two artists had been exempt\u000a      from licensing\u000a      requirements. There was sustained campaigning from groups such as the Live\u000a      Music Forum &#8212; see\u000a      www.livemusicforum.co.uk &#8212;\u000a      established by independent live music campaigners, and other\u000a      individuals supporting live music. The campaigning took a higher profile\u000a      approach when the\u000a      Department for Media, Culture and Sport (DCMS) released a 2010 report\u000a      concluding that the live\u000a      music sector in the UK was `thriving'. Due to Cloonan's research expertise\u000a      in live music and its\u000a      regulation, he was one of three academics &#8212; the others being Alison\u000a      Macfarlane, statistician at City\u000a      University London and Cloonan's frequent collaborator Simon Frith,\u000a      Edinburgh &#8212; cited by the Live\u000a      Music Forum in a protest against what it saw as misleading claims by the\u000a      DCMS that were\u000a      intended to support the stringent licensing requirements. Cloonan,\u000a      Macfarlane and Frith also\u000a      signed a letter (18 June 2010) alongside the Live Music Forum to the UK\u000a      Statistics Authority &#8212; see\u000a      www.livemusicforum.co.uk\/text\/hbbulletin310.htm\u000a      &#8212; protesting misrepresentations by DCMS. Their\u000a      position was that the sector was not `thriving' and that this view had\u000a      been used by the Local\u000a      Government Association and the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health\u000a      to reject the idea of\u000a      exempting smaller premises and events from licence requirements, as had\u000a      previously been the\u000a      case before.\u000a    The campaign was supported by Lord Tim Clement-Jones, the Liberal\u000a      Democrats' cultural\u000a      spokesperson, whose adviser on the issue was the head of the Live Music\u000a      Forum. In March 2012\u000a      the Live Music Act proposed by Clement-Jones was passed by the UK\u000a      Parliament, removing the\u000a      need for a licence to play live music in most small venues, such as pubs\u000a      and community halls.\u000a    Public and industry sector awareness of issues around live music in the\u000a      UK has been enhanced by\u000a      the presence of the industry information website Live Music Exchange &#8212; see\u000a      livemusicexchange.org &#8212;\u000a      co-founded by Cloonan and Frith. Live Music Exchange is an information\u000a      hub for the live music industry. It provides blogs, newsletters, news\u000a      digests, training, consultancy\u000a      and mediation. It was initially funded by the AHRC as a follow-up project\u000a      to The Promotion of Live\u000a        Music Project.\u000a    A distinguishing aspect of Cloonan's research is its emphasis on\u000a      collaboration. It is clear, however,\u000a      that his unique expertise and long standing authority in relation to music\u000a      policy and regulation has\u000a      made a fundamental contribution to initiatives, campaigning bodies and\u000a      public facing resources\u000a      that have impacted on diverse user groups nationally and internationally &#8212;\u000a      musicians experiencing\u000a      censorship; the music industry in terms of both recording and live venues;\u000a      and the general public\u000a      interested and concerned in the powerful role that popular music plays\u000a      both in their own lives and\u000a      within the wider culture.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Music reflects and frequently empowers its listeners.

Throughout his research career he has\u000a      concentrated on issues of\u000a      empowerment and regulation. His pioneering PhD on music and censorship\u000a      (`Banned: Censorship\u000a      of Popular music in Britain, 1967-1992' (1993)) is the first major work in\u000a      this area. Since then he\u000a      has been interested in researching, and seeking to impact upon, the power\u000a      dynamics within the\u000a      music industries &#8212; musicians, music policy, recording companies and live\u000a      venues.\u000a    His most recent work has concentrated on the live music industry &#8212; in\u000a      terms of regulation (policy)\u000a      as well as its cultural and economic benefits. His research has,\u000a      therefore, long been inter-twined\u000a      with processes of knowledge exchange and public engagement: for example &#8212;\u000a    - As a result of this long term engagement and his commitment to empowerment\u000a    and regulation\u000a    issues, Cloonan played a key role in the foundation of Freemuse,\u000a    an independent international\u000a    organisation advocating freedom of expression for musicians and composers,\u000a    and acts as\u000a    Executive Committee Chair of the organisation.\u000a    - He has also been directly involved in campaigning against the UK\u000a      Licensing Act in 2003 which\u000a      increased levels of control over live music, requiring licences for most\u000a      public and many private\u000a      performances. After almost 10 years of campaigning for new legislation and\u000a      contributing to the\u000a      public debate surrounding the issues of small venues, Cloonan and\u000a      colleagues saw the Live\u000a      Music Act passed in March 2012. This Act removed the need for a licence to\u000a      play live music in\u000a      most small venues, such as pubs and community halls. This was a key\u000a      intervention in music\u000a      policy and legislation and was seen as victory for performers and small\u000a      venues.\u000a    Evidence of the significance of Cloonan's research in relation to his key\u000a      areas of impact &#8212; policy,\u000a      regulation and live music &#8212; includes his support from funders:\u000a    - AHRC, The Musicians Union: a social history (PI: Cloonan; 2011;\u000a      &#163;556,910)\u000a    - Royal Society of Edinburgh, Music Research and Music Policy\u000a      (PI: Cloonan; with Co-I Simon\u000a      Frith, Edinburgh; 2009; &#163;5,500)\u000a    - AHRC, The Promotion of Live Music (Co-I: Cloonan; with PI Simon\u000a      Frith, Edinburgh; 2008:\u000a      &#163;308,000). Dissemination of findings will be via three major publications\u000a      including Martin\u000a      Cloonan, Simon Frith, Matt Brennan and Emma Webster, The History of\u000a        Live Music in the UK:\u000a      Volume 1: From The Dance Hall to the 100 Club (Aldershot:\u000a      Ashgate, 2013) (REF 2 Selection).\u000a    Cloonan's work has frequently returned to the question of cultural policy\u000a      and music and has\u000a      involved engagement with a number of key stakeholders &#8212; including Creative\u000a      Scotland, the\u000a      Scottish Music Industry Association and the Musician's Union.

Impacts on public audiences:\u000d\u000a    Public performances, broadcasts and recordings of musical compositions\u000d\u000a      have had an impact on\u000d\u000a      performance bodies, and concert and festival programmes, attracting media\u000d\u000a      attention, including\u000d\u000a      commentaries by enthusiastic audiences who have been able to experience\u000d\u000a      Fischman's\u000d\u000a      compositions directly. This has led to the creation of cultural capital,\u000d\u000a      enriching and expanding the\u000d\u000a      lives, imaginations and sensibilities of such audiences. For instance, &#191;Te\u000d\u000a        Acuerdas Hijo? is\u000d\u000a      regularly performed to diverse viewers worldwide at concerts (since 2008),\u000d\u000a      and excerpts have\u000d\u000a      been published in non-academic venues accessed by the general public, e.g.\u000d\u000a      Animation World\u000d\u000a      Magazine and Network Television (Section 5, item 1). Inclusion of\u000d\u000a      Fischman's works in commercial\u000d\u000a      recordings, curated online channels (e.g. the YouTube channel Cl&#225;sicos\u000d\u000a        Peruanos, which features\u000d\u000a      a historic repertoire of significant Peruvian classical composers) and\u000d\u000a      archives (e.g. Daniel Langlois\u000d\u000a      Foundation Latin American Electroacoustic Music Collection, Digi-Arts\u000d\u000a      UNESCO knowledge portal)\u000d\u000a      is testament to the significance of his compositions to a broader public:\u000d\u000a      Fischman's output has\u000d\u000a      been recognised as part of the historical patrimony of Peruvian\u000d\u000a      composition as evidenced in the\u000d\u000a      collections above. Furthermore, his compositions have enabled audiences to\u000d\u000a      gain new\u000d\u000a      interpretations of cultural heritage: `influences from dance forms in\u000d\u000a      Fischman's works have\u000d\u000a      involved the reconstruction of a basic paradigm of a rumba polyrhythm in\u000d\u000a      his acousmatic work Kol\u000d\u000a        HaTorr and the \"proprioceptive\" characteristic of relating musical\u000d\u000a      gesture to physical movement,\u000d\u000a      resulting in a particular kind of expression that is linked to the\u000d\u000a      experience of dancing genres. This\u000d\u000a      latter influence cannot be considered as a direct reference to any\u000d\u000a      particular genre, but instead,\u000d\u000a      generative of a Latin American flavour personal to Fischman's own musical\u000d\u000a      language' (Blackburn,\u000d\u000a      2010, Section 5, item 2). For instance, a new interpretation of the\u000d\u000a      integration of Afro-Peruvian\u000d\u000a      folklore in &#161;A Que No Me quemas! has been disseminated thanks to\u000d\u000a      performances worldwide,\u000d\u000a      including the London Sinfonietta Latin American tour, featuring in\u000d\u000a      two high profile Mexican\u000d\u000a      festivals: Visiones Sonoras, Morelia (full house at MUAC hall,\u000d\u000a      capacity 220) and Festival\u000d\u000a        Internacional Cervantino, Guanajuato (full house at Auditorio de\u000d\u000a      Minas, capacity 420), described\u000d\u000a      as `the most important festival in Latin America' and `one of the premier\u000d\u000a      arts and cultural festival in\u000d\u000a      Mexico and Latin America'. This prompted media attention in the form of\u000d\u000a      interviews (Radio of the\u000d\u000a      State of Michoac&#225;n, M&#233;xico.

Another illustration of this\u000d\u000a      impact is found in the integration\u000d\u000a      of traditional Jewish and Middle Eastern musical materials with\u000d\u000a      contemporary art music and\u000d\u000a      electronics, providing a contemporary interpretation of the expulsion of\u000d\u000a      Adam and Eve from the\u000d\u000a      Garden of Eden in the context of Middle Eastern conflict; as realised in Ets\u000d\u000a        HaDa'at.

His work has focused on electro-acoustic and multimedia\u000d\u000a      compositions along with the\u000d\u000a      development of compositional tools in the form of music software. During\u000d\u000a      the last few years, he has\u000d\u000a      expanded these interests into the audiovisual domain and the use of\u000d\u000a      gestures to operate digital\u000d\u000a      controllers in conjunction with multi-channel composition, within a long\u000d\u000a      term strategy for the\u000d\u000a      realisation of structured interactive immersive musical experiences,\u000d\u000a      in which users advance at their\u000d\u000a      own pace, choosing their own trajectory through a musical work but having\u000d\u000a      to act within its\u000d\u000a      structure, rules and constraints.

Indicative impacts are described here\u000d\u000a      according to category of beneficiary:\u000d\u000a    (a) Music-lovers and concertgoers: Cooke's research has\u000d\u000a      transformed the understanding of a large general audience of music-lovers\u000d\u000a      through the media of public talks, notes for programme booklets, book\u000d\u000a      sales, and CD liner notes (discussed in section b). Between 2008 and 2013\u000d\u000a      Cooke has given public talks on Britten at venues including LSO St\u000d\u000a      Luke's in London, the Royal Opera in Copenhagen, the Royal Northern\u000d\u000a      College of Music, and Wigmore Hall. The first of these events is\u000d\u000a      indicative of the relationship between Cooke's original research and these\u000d\u000a      engagement activities. It involved sharing new archival findings on\u000d\u000a      Britten's creative and personal relationships with first performers of his\u000d\u000a      works (especially the cellist Mstislav Rostropovich and soprano Galina\u000d\u000a      Vishnevskaya), to illuminate a discussion and subsequent live performances\u000d\u000a      of Britten's Cello Sonata and War Requiem. Unsolicited\u000d\u000a      correspondence from audience members testifies to `such an interesting and\u000d\u000a      enjoyable lecture. An inspiring and evocative account of all the events\u000d\u000a      surrounding the War Requiem', and 'Wonderful day yesterday &#8212; thank you &#8212;\u000d\u000a      so illuminating' (source 1). In the same period Cooke has provided articles\u000a        and notes on Britten for the programme booklets of leading European\u000d\u000a      opera houses (ROH, ENO, Opera North, La Monnaie (Brussels) and Bilbao),\u000d\u000a      festivals at Aldeburgh, Cheltenham, Edinburgh and Krakow, and concerts at\u000d\u000a      Brighton Dome, Carnegie Hall, Royal Festival Hall (Philharmonia\u000d\u000a      Orchestra), and Wigmore Hall. These contributions, while serving an\u000d\u000a      introductory function for non-specialists, are also regularly illuminated\u000d\u000a      by new insights: for instance, notes on the opera Death in Venice\u000d\u000a      for Aldeburgh Festival and Opera North draw original comparisons between\u000d\u000a      the principal character Aschenbach's attraction to an `eastern' soundworld\u000d\u000a      in the context of the score's serial elements, and the composer's own\u000d\u000a      creative block in the mid-1950s which he solved by borrowing from the\u000d\u000a      music of the gamelan.\u000d\u000a    The public reach of the Britten letters edition (outputs 4 to 6)\u000d\u000a      is evidenced by numerous press reviews in non-specialist publications (see\u000d\u000a      e.g. The Telegraph 5.7.08 and 26.12.10, The Spectator,\u000d\u000a      14.6.08, The Economist 9.12.10, Wall Street Journal\u000d\u000a      18.1.13, The Spectator 9.2.13) (source 2), and by sales figures\u000d\u000a      which substantially outpace most musicological titles (to end July 2013:\u000d\u000a      vol. 4: 1,115; vol. 5: 841; vol. 6: 812; source 3). Volume 6 of the\u000d\u000a      edition was the subject of an item on BBC Radio 3's Music Matters\u000d\u000a      (24 November 2012), whose presenter Tom Service found the letters\u000d\u000a      `extremely revealing' and commended the `astonishing detail' of the\u000d\u000a      editors' notes (source 4). Since 2008, Cooke's other Britten\u000d\u000a        publications (outputs 2 and 3) aimed at general audiences have also\u000d\u000a      continued to sell well (cumulative sales figures to end July 2013 are War\u000a        Requiem: 3904; Cambridge Companion to Britten: 3731; source\u000d\u000a      5). Further public engagement is achieved through Cooke's CD liner\u000d\u000a        notes (see section 4b), which have recently included a cover CD of\u000d\u000a      Britten's War Requiem for the BBC Music Magazine (ABC\u000d\u000a      circulation figures of 41,226 for 2012).\u000d\u000a    (b) Recording companies: Since 2010 Cooke has written liner\u000d\u000a        notes for twelve Britten CDs, including nine on the\u000d\u000a      internationally-distributed Hyperion and Chandos labels. The Chandos notes\u000d\u000a      are downloadable at www.chandos.net\u000d\u000a      and www.theclassicalshop.net\u000d\u000a      (our request for CD sales figures or web-page hit data was declined). The\u000d\u000a      notes provide an opportunity for the findings of Cooke's original research\u000d\u000a      to be shared with the CD-buying public, as in the case of Hyperion's\u000d\u000a      Gramophone Award-winning CD of Britten's songs for baritone and piano,\u000d\u000a      which relates the previously unknown circumstances of composition of the\u000d\u000a      lesser-known songs. As well as benefitting music lovers, this activity\u000d\u000a      directly benefits the reputation of independent record labels like Chandos\u000d\u000a      and Hyperion for being closely informed by cutting-edge scholarship (on\u000d\u000a      its website Chandos describes its mission as `groundbreaking') (source 6).\u000d\u000a      The Literary Editor for Chandos (who commissions all CD liner notes),\u000d\u000a      writes that Cooke `is our first choice for consideration' for Britten\u000d\u000a      releases, because `he writes with unusual care and elegance, and is able\u000d\u000a      to concentrate an extraordinary amount of information within the\u000d\u000a      relatively limited space available in our booklets'; he adds that `one\u000d\u000a      always comes away from reading his notes with a thrilling sense of having\u000d\u000a      absorbed a huge amount of fresh knowledge, and then turn eagerly to the\u000d\u000a      music' (source 7). CD reviewers frequently cite Cooke's notes approvingly,\u000d\u000a      adding lustre to the releases: see, for instance, International Record\u000d\u000a        Review (March 2011, `Notes are by the Britten authority Mervyn\u000d\u000a      Cooke'), American Record Guide (July\/August 2011, `As Mervyn\u000d\u000a      Cooke's liner notes point out ...'), Fanfare (Sept\/Oct 2011, `the\u000d\u000a      clear and sensible notes of Mervyn Cooke') (source 8).\u000d\u000a    (c) Performance organisations: Cooke's engagement activities\u000d\u000a      benefit the educational and outreach remit of performance venues, music\u000d\u000a      festivals and performing groups &#8212; a remit upon which these organisations'\u000d\u000a      public subsidy is often dependent. Indicative are Cooke's contributions to\u000d\u000a      a 2011 London Symphony Orchestra Discovery Day &#8212; events marketed by the\u000d\u000a      orchestra under `Lifelong Learning' &#8212; which included two illustrated\u000d\u000a      lectures on the War Requiem and the Cello Sonata, and a panel\u000d\u000a      discussion on the Sonata with the two performers (source 9). The event\u000d\u000a      served to bring together Cooke's research findings, a substantial public\u000d\u000a      audience of interested concert-goers and amateur musicians, and players\u000d\u000a      from the UK's most prestigious orchestra. In 2013 Cooke introduced an\u000d\u000a      afternoon film screening of Night Mail (music by Britten) at\u000d\u000a      Wigmore Hall, to an audience of c. 65, in advance of a concert performance\u000d\u000a      of Britten's radio and film music by the Nash Ensemble.\u000d\u000a    (d) Performers: Cooke's research has broadened the Britten\u000d\u000a      repertory, furnishing conductors, orchestras and singers with attractive\u000d\u000a      and highly marketable new repertoire. The suite drawn by Cooke and\u000d\u000a      Mitchell from the full-length ballet The Prince of the Pagodas has\u000d\u000a      stimulated new public interest in one of the composer's most neglected\u000d\u000a      major works, which was hitherto an impractical proposition for the concert\u000d\u000a      hall. Since 2008 the suite has been performed eight times, by three\u000d\u000a      internationally renowned orchestras and conductors (LSO, Tilson Thomas;\u000d\u000a      Hall&#233;, Elder; Spanish National Orchestra, Slatkin), with four more\u000d\u000a      performances scheduled for 2014 in San Francisco (SFSO, Tilson Thomas)\u000d\u000a      (source 10). Audience figures from the LSO performance, which sold out the\u000d\u000a      Barbican Hall (1,884 tickets; source 11), indicate the commercial\u000d\u000a      attractiveness of this music. The Guardian review of this\u000d\u000a      performance noted that `Britten's 1957 ballet, given in the concert suite\u000d\u000a      prepared in 1997 by Donald Mitchell and Mervyn Cooke, ... is a gift for\u000d\u000a      Tilson Thomas, whose conducting tingled with excitement from start to\u000d\u000a      finish' (12.6.13); and a review of Elder's performances asked\u000d\u000a      enthusiastically for `a repeat performance of this suite by [other]\u000d\u000a      concert orchestras' (bachtrack.com review, 4.2.13) (source 12).\u000d\u000a    The conference `Benjamin Britten on Stage and Screen' at Nottingham in\u000d\u000a      July 2013 saw a rare performance and subsequent premiere commercial\u000d\u000a      recording of another neglected Britten work, his incidental music to The\u000a        Ascent of F6. This work from 1937 was revived by Cooke and student\u000d\u000a      performers at the Aldeburgh Festival in 1996, and his advocacy has now\u000d\u000a      brought the participation of two leading professional singers (Jean Rigby\u000d\u000a      and Andrew Kennedy), the Ex Cathedra choir under their conductor Jeffrey\u000d\u000a      Skidmore, and NMC Records. As part of this project, Cooke also oversaw and\u000d\u000a      performed in the premiere recording of the incidental music to On the\u000d\u000a        Frontier (1938) for inclusion on NMC's commercial CD release (source\u000d\u000a      13), which will further their pioneering commitment to releasing hitherto\u000d\u000a      unrecorded Britten works; and the performers have gained valuable\u000d\u000a      employment and exposure in the process. The conference also included a\u000d\u000a      performance of The Golden Vanity by the choir of Loughborough\u000d\u000a      Grammar School.\u000d\u000a    (e) Other creative output: The letters edition is widely\u000d\u000a      acknowledged as an essential source for popular biographies of Britten, of\u000d\u000a      which there has been a small explosion in recent years. For instance, in\u000d\u000a      his Britten's Children (2006), John Bridcut states `I should\u000d\u000a      acknowledge the central importance of the first three selections of\u000d\u000a      Britten's letters' (p. xii); Paul Kildea's recent highly-publicised Benjamin\u000a        Britten (2013) similarly states `This book could not have been\u000d\u000a      written without the groundbreaking Britten letters project' (p. xv), and\u000d\u000a      specifically mentions the pre-publication access given to the final\u000d\u000a      volumes in the series.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case study describes the impact of Professor Mervyn Cooke's research\u000d\u000a      on the music of Benjamin Britten.

Specific focal points within this\u000d\u000a      activity include studies of major works (books on Billy Budd and War\u000a        Requiem [output 3], published in 1993 and 1996), investigation into\u000d\u000a      the composer's creative response to Indonesian and Japanese music (the\u000d\u000a      monograph Britten and the Far East, 1998 [output 1]), revival of a\u000d\u000a      rare work (student and professional performances and premiere recording of\u000d\u000a      The Ascent of F6), and a new edition, made together with Donald\u000d\u000a      Mitchell, of a suite from Britten's ballet The Prince of the Pagodas\u000d\u000a      (1997). These and other Britten-related research projects formed the\u000d\u000a      foundation for the detailed editorial commentary contained in the\u000d\u000a      recently-completed multi-volume edition of Britten's letters (2004, 2008,\u000d\u000a      2010, 2013 [outputs 4-6]), described by Peter Ackroyd as `one of the most\u000d\u000a      illuminating biographical projects in recent years' (source: Boydell and\u000d\u000a      Brewer promotional flyer). Within this edition, each letter receives\u000d\u000a      substantial contextualising commentary, based on a voluminous range of\u000d\u000a      primary source materials, giving an unprecedentedly detailed account of\u000d\u000a      Britten's career, creative preoccupations and personal life.\u000d\u000a    The scope and rigorous documentary basis of Cooke's Britten research has\u000d\u000a      furnished a vast array of new insights and findings. Topics that have\u000d\u000a      received sustained attention include the composer's characteristic working\u000d\u000a      methods, literary and artistic interests, commitment to festival\u000d\u000a      organisation and performance (as pianist and conductor), attitude towards\u000d\u000a      audio and television recordings of his works, relationships with\u000d\u000a      institutions such as the BBC and Covent Garden, dealings with both\u000d\u000a      professional and amateur collaborators, his activities in Asia, and his\u000d\u000a      controversial relationships with children. This breadth of insight enables\u000d\u000a      him to contribute to a wide range of public events, performances and\u000d\u000a      recordings, in the course of which public understanding of Britten's music\u000d\u000a      is changed, the missions of assorted musical organisations are furthered,\u000d\u000a      and the creative output of performers, writers and filmmakers is\u000d\u000a      stimulated. Some indicative specific examples are given in section 4.\u000d\u000a    Cooke has been a member of academic staff at Nottingham throughout the\u000d\u000a      period covered here (1993-2013). For vol. 3 of the letters edition (2004),\u000d\u000a      the editorial work was split equally between Cooke, Mitchell and Philip\u000d\u000a      Reed.

The lavish\u000a      manuscript facsimile (output 1) has sold 163 copies (source 1), and is now\u000a      held by major public reference libraries around the globe (including the\u000a      Deutsche Nationalbibliothek, the National Library of Sweden, the\u000a      Biblioth&#232;que Nationale de France, the New York Public Library, the British\u000a      Library and the Zentralbibliothek Z&#252;rich; source 2), making the repertoire\u000a      available to enquiring performers internationally. Additionally, the\u000a      monograph (output 2) contains new performing editions of 13 complete works\u000a      from the manuscript.\u000a    The benefits of this research have been especially significant for the\u000a      principal collaborators in the dissemination phase of the project,\u000a      Stimmwerck. First, the appeal of the new repertoire for concert\u000a        promoters is indicated by the fact that Stimmwerck have performed it\u000a      at 9 separate concerts in 4 European countries over a period of five years\u000a      (April 2007 to January 2012; all but the first of these fall within the\u000a      assessment period), and the group continues to offer it to venues (see\u000a      source 3). Second, the group gained insights on context and\u000a        performance practice through the informed advice offered by Wright\u000a      and Rumbold, building on the insights on performance practice they offer\u000a      in chapter 5 of the monograph; in the words of the group's founder and\u000a      director, `we had a perfect musicological background: the highest quality\u000a      modern editions and a systematic analysis of the music made it very easy\u000a      for us to reawaken this marvellous music' (source 4). Third, the group's prestige\u000a      was enhanced by involvement in this pioneering and scholarly project.\u000a      Notably, it has triggered further high-profile scholarly collaborations.\u000a      To quote the group's director again, `Since the St Emmeram Codex-CD it has\u000a      become a kind of trademark that Stimmwerck is in close contact with\u000a      musicologists. In 2013 we plan an important recording with Professor\u000a      Reinhard Strohm (Oxford University) ... [who] mentioned in his initial\u000a      contacts that he has our Emmeram-CD' (source 4). This second musicological\u000a      collaboration &#8212; a direct consequence of Stimmwerck's involvement with\u000a      Wright and Rumbold- is for the international project `Musikleben des\u000a      Sp&#228;tmittelalters in der Region &#214;sterreich' led by the universities of\u000a      Oxford and Vienna; the CD recording session took place in September 2013\u000a      (source 5). The St Emmeram CD was also judged best `Late Middle Ages'\u000a      recording of 2009 by the Dutch classical music retailer Prelude, a fact\u000a      proudly trumpeted on Stimmwerck's website (source 6).\u000a    Audiences\u000a    Sizeable and diverse audiences have engaged with the repertoire made\u000a      available by Wright and Rumbold, and also (through programme notes, public\u000a      talks and the CD booklet) directly with their scholarship. Since 2008\u000a      Stimmwerck have performed this repertory on 8 occasions in Germany,\u000a      Portugal and the Czech Republic, with audiences averaging over 300 at each\u000a      concert (source 4). The reach of these performances has extended\u000a      substantially beyond the specialist early music audience, to include\u000a      concerts in the leading German multi-genre arts festival Movimentos\u000a      (2010), P&#243;voa de Varzim's summer international music festival aimed at the\u000a      city's tourist market (2011), and the cultural programme of the DIAK\u000a      social welfare centre for the sick and elderly in Schw&#228;bisch Hall (2011).\u000a      In addition to the purely musical satisfactions brought to these diverse\u000a      audiences (Stimmwerck report spontaneous applause after their performances\u000a      of the particularly ebullient contrafactum `Ad honorem \/ Par maintes\u000a      foys'; source 4), programme notes prepared by Rumbold enabled enhanced\u000a      appreciation of the music's historical context.\u000a    The CD released by Aeolus has sold 1217 copies since its release in May\u000a      2008 (source 7).

The project was\u000a      funded by the AHRC (&#163;256,934). In the Dissemination phase (see below),\u000a      Philip Weller (Lecturer in Music) contributed translations of the Latin\u000a      texts and detailed scholarly notes about them to the concert programmes\u000a      and CD booklet.\u000a    The main aim of the project was to investigate a key source of early\u000a      fifteenth-century European polyphony (or part-music), manuscript Clm 14274\u000a      of the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek in Munich, known to musicologists as\u000a      the `St Emmeram Codex'. Key outputs from the project include a colour\u000a      facsimile of the Codex published by the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek\u000a      (output 1), and a 374-page book published by Boydell and Brewer (output\u000a      2). The facsimile is accompanied by a 164-page commentary volume in German\u000a      and English that establishes for the first time many details of the\u000a      manuscript's history and make-up, including the materials used in its\u000a      construction, the working methods of the scribes, and the different types\u000a      of musical notation they employed. The book is a detailed study of the\u000a      compiler of the codex, Hermann P&#246;tzlinger, and his colleagues, the centres\u000a      in which they lived and worked, and the manuscripts and music they\u000a      produced there.\u000a    This phase of the project produced key insights that underpinned\u000a      subsequent impacts. Rumbold's and Wright's research established in detail\u000a      the full significance of the manuscript, which contains an international\u000a      repertoire of 247 items, some 141 of which are found in no other source.\u000a      The geographical spread of the repertoire, identified with new precision\u000a      in this research, attests to the complex networks of musical exchange that\u000a      shaped musical composition and performance at this time. The Boydell\u000a      monograph has also transformed our understanding of the milieu around a\u000a      late medieval music collector, and includes an Appendix containing new\u000a      performing editions of no fewer than 13 complete works from the\u000a      manuscript.\u000a    The subsequent grant of an AHRC Pilot Dissemination Award (&#163;10,500) led\u000a      to a highly productive collaboration with the professional vocal ensemble\u000a      Stimmwerck. This involved Rumbold and Wright developing their earlier\u000a      research through (a) the creation of modern editions of a selection of\u000a      music from the codex; (b) acting as musicological consultants to\u000a      Stimmwerck by advising on matters of interpretation and historical\u000a      performance practice; (c) devising a concert programme based on a\u000a      well-varied selection of works, a number of which had most probably not\u000a      been performed since the fifteenth century. This programme was\u000a      subsequently performed internationally and recorded for commercial CD\u000a      release (output 6).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"30224","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"798549","Name":"Romania"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Early Music Online\u000a    Rose's research on early music-printing has created significant cultural\u000a      benefit to amateur and professional musicians. His digitisation project\u000a      has supplied them with access to digitised versions of over 10,000\u000a      compositions that previously were available only to researchers visiting\u000a      the British Library. Underpinning this impact is Rose's research on the\u000a      types and formats of early printed music. Using his expertise, Rose\u000a      determined the categories of metadata entry (to ensure that users could\u000a      discover all relevant items) and selected the items to be digitised. He\u000a      chose repertories that would have high impact, including vocal polyphony\u000a      suited to amateur choirs (a growth area of musical participation), and\u000a      lute tablatures for plucked-string enthusiasts and guitarists.\u000a    Early Music Online has enriched and expanded the lives of thousands of\u000a      amateur musicians worldwide. In its 24 months of operation, over 320,000\u000a      items have been viewed or downloaded. Each month an average of 3,500 PDFs\u000a      of complete music-books are downloaded by users to print or save to their\u000a      computers. The Secretary of The Lute Society comments: `Early Music Online\u000a      is a fantastically useful project, making the sources of early music\u000a      available to music lovers anywhere in the world. The inclusion of lute\u000a      tablatures is especially welcome, because lute players are more likely\u000a      than singers to perform from the original notation. There is increasing\u000a      interest in the lute in middle-income countries such as Romania, Brazil\u000a      and China, where musicians cannot afford to buy printed facsimiles, and\u000a      Early Music Online makes music accessible to them.'\u000a    As further evidence of how Early Music Online has enriched cultural life,\u000a      many public libraries worldwide have created links to the site. (See\u000a      section 5 below.) The Library of Congress and the Hochschule f&#252;r Musik,\u000a      Leipzig, have incorporated Early Music Online's bibliographical data into\u000a      their own library discovery systems. Rose's research is thus shaping how\u000a      Western cultural heritage is preserved and presented by these libraries.\u000a    Rose's digitisation project has also created wealth in the creative\u000a      sector, enabling professional musicians to devise concerts based on this\u000a      newly available material. On 7 September 2012 The Brabant Ensemble gave a\u000a      concert `Le Fleur des Chansons: An Evening of Renaissance Music from the\u000a      British Library' at King's Place, London. The concert was marketed as a\u000a      `showcase programme featuring some of the most popular works of the 16th\u000a      century as represented in the 300 books so far digitised in Early Music\u000a      Online'. The Director of The Brabant Ensemble explains:`Early Music Online has had a significant positive effect on the\u000a      availability of sources for my performance projects. The quality of the\u000a      performing editions I have been able to prepare has increased\u000a      substantially as a result of this wider availability of sources via EMO.'\u000a      Early Music Online is a collaborative project. Rose at Royal Holloway\u000a      supplied the academic leadership and research expertise. Sandra Tuppen at\u000a      the British Library supplied the day-to-day supervision of the research\u000a      assistants. Royal Holloway's institutional support includes: hosting the\u000a      digital repository for the digitised content; hosting the RISM UK database\u000a      for the metadata (at a benefits-in-kind estimate of &#163;2000 per year); and\u000a      the ongoing support of the digital repository team to deal with technical\u000a      and user enquiries.\u000a    Collaboration with The Academy of Ancient Music\u000a    Rose's research into the contexts of German music has benefited the\u000a      orchestra The Academy of Ancient Music and its audiences. His research,\u000a      communicated via programme notes, pre-concert talks and as a musicological\u000a      consultant to the orchestra, has allowed the AAM to create wealth in the\u000a      cultural sector by developing new concert repertories and attracting new\u000a      audiences.\u000a    The AAM is a leading period-instrument orchestra dedicated to exploring\u000a      historical performance styles, and to presenting the public with\u000a      interpretations rooted in recent research. Since 2003 Rose has written\u000a      introductory essays and programme notes for the AAM's UK and international\u000a      concerts (over 70 different programmes, representing several hundred\u000a      performances to a total of over 85,000 audience members). Each of these\u000a      programme notes is printed in at least 1000 copies and given free of\u000a      charge to all concert-goers.\u000a    Since 2008 the relationship has intensified, and the AAM has used Rose's\u000a      research to discover new repertory for concerts, and to present familiar\u000a      repertory (such as Bach) in a fresh light. Insights from Rose's research\u000a      allow the AAM to create a distinctive cultural offering that draws in new\u000a      audiences. For example, several AAM concerts have incorporated research\u000a      from Rose's monograph The Musician in Literature in the Age of Bach.\u000a      In October 2011 its Halloween programme `Witches and Devils', held in\u000a      London and Cambridge to a combined audience of about 1000, derived from\u000a      Rose's research into the links between Baroque violinists, the demonic and\u000a      magic. The programme included a Telemann concerto, Tartini's `Devil's\u000a      Trill' Sonata and arias from Handel's Alcina. Rose's research\u000a      provided a narrative giving coherence to the programme. Extracts from\u000a      Chapter 4 of The Musician in Literature were used in Rose's essay\u000a      introducing the concert; the AAM also used these extracts to market the\u000a      concert via its website and Facebook.\u000a    In March 2013, the AAM's performances of Bach's Passions (held in London\u000a      and Cambridge to a combined audience of about 4000) used Rose's research\u000a      on the social contexts of Bach to help modern audiences hear these\u000a      familiar works afresh. Through pre-concert talks, programme notes and\u000a      contributions to the AAM's blog, Rose enabled concert-goers to realise how\u000a      and why 18th-century listeners reacted so violently against the Passions.\u000a      As well as enriching the imaginations and sensibilities of concert-goers,\u000a      Rose's research here created economic prosperity for the AAM, making its\u000a      presentation of Bach's Passions stand out from those offered by competitor\u000a      ensembles. Reviewers and bloggers commented on the power of Rose's\u000a      introductions to help them hear the music afresh: `While such large-scale\u000a      religious music may strike contemporary ears as conservative, Stephen\u000a      Rose's incisive programme note remarks that Bach's congregation would\u000a      never before have heard anything quite like it'; `The AAM clearly put a\u000a      lot of thought into their programme notes, namely Stephen Rose's\u000a      background into the St John Passion, and to the 1724 version of the St\u000a      John Passion'. (Sources of these comments are listed in section 5 below.)\u000a    As an indication of this continuing collaboration, since December 2012\u000a      the AAM has used Rose's expertise in the social history of music to plan a\u000a      concert programme that will explore crossovers between 17th-century\u000a      courtly music and the music of North African visitors to central Europe.\u000a      Rose has excerpted primary sources that offer a possible narrative for the\u000a      concert, and has offered expertise in the previously unknown musical\u000a      repertory that documents these cultural encounters. This impact is at an\u000a      early stage, with the concerts to be held in 2015 at the Barbican and in\u000a      Cambridge.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Stephen Rose's research on the sources and contexts of German music\u000a      1500-1750 has benefited amateur musicians, professional musicians and\u000a      commercial concert-life. Building on his research in early music-printing,\u000a      his digitisation project Early Music Online has provided musicians\u000a      worldwide with digitised copies of over 10,000 pieces of early printed\u000a      music previously available only to researchers visiting the British\u000a      Library.

This case-study focuses on\u000a      activities from 2005 onwards.\u000a    Between 2005 and 2008 Rose published refereed journal articles that\u000a      investigated how and why music was printed in Germany during the 16th and\u000a      17th centuries. This research examined the formats in which music was\u000a      printed, the genres of music available in print, the mechanisms via which\u000a      printed music was disseminated, and the uses of printed music (as\u000a      performing material and symbolic tokens of prestige). See articles listed\u000a      in section 3 below.\u000a    Building on these investigations into music-printing, in 2011 Rose\u000a      directed the research project Early Music Online, which digitised over 320\u000a      volumes of the world's earliest printed music from holdings in the British\u000a      Library. Using a team of 13 research assistants, the project created\u000a      comprehensive new metadata (catalogue entries) for all the digitised\u000a      books, discovering important new information about the provenance and\u000a      concordances of the British Library exemplars.\u000a    Complementing his work on the sources of 16th- to 18th-century music,\u000a      Rose also researches the social contexts and meanings of music in this\u000a      period. His monograph The Musician in Literature in the Age of Bach\u000a      (Cambridge University Press, 2011) puts J. S. Bach into context by\u000a      uncovering the disreputable and dangerous connotations of a musical career\u000a      around 1700. Rather than basing his social history on conventional sources\u000a      such as archival material from churches and courts, Rose examines a more\u000a      colourful and subversive set of sources, namely novels by or about\u000a      musicians. Here, a cast of outsiders and itinerants contrasts sharply with\u000a      the role of the honourable craftsman to which many musicians aspired.\u000a      Instead, music appears as dangerously seductive, demonic, bestial,\u000a      manipulative and destabilising, its practitioners as fascinating as they\u000a      are reprehensible and unworthy of `guild' status. The interdisciplinary\u000a      nature of the book, together with its capacity to reach far beyond the\u000a      traditional subjects of music history, produces findings and insights of\u000a      transformative significance for our understanding of German musical\u000a      culture. Such use of novels as windows into past musical cultures is\u000a      commonplace for the nineteenth century, when the realist novel made such\u000a      techniques self-evidently useful. For earlier periods, when the `novel'\u000a      was itself an experimental phenomenon, the task is far more challenging,\u000a      and has not been attempted before. The book that resulted from this\u000a      research therefore has the capacity to act as a model for\u000a      interdisciplinary studies of music.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"30225","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Brown's research on the sounds of early film exhibition has impacted upon\u000d\u000a      cultural life and public discourse by bringing new levels of understanding\u000d\u000a      to practitioners, enthusiasts and institutions in the cultural sector,\u000d\u000a      such as the Barbican Cinema and the British Silent Film Festival. With its\u000d\u000a      public events, its involvement of a ballet conductor to synchronize music\u000d\u000a      with silent film for the first time, and its openness to practitioners in\u000d\u000a      cognate areas such as that of magic lantern, this body of research has\u000d\u000a      also encouraged and effected new cross-overs of expertise and experience\u000d\u000a      between related forms of art and entertainment.

The opening event of the AHRC\u000d\u000a      Network `The Sounds of Early Cinema in Britain' (2009) involved the\u000d\u000a      Barbican Cinema. As a venue with a regular Sunday afternoon `Silent Film\u000d\u000a      with Live Music' series, the venue curators recognized the interest of\u000d\u000a      this event for its broader cinema audience, and saw the potential for\u000d\u000a      collaboration to present new historical recreations. The Network's first\u000d\u000a      conference involved two such reconstructions: one was followed by an\u000d\u000a      on-stage interview and discussion session, which was open to audience\u000d\u000a      questions. A further collaboration and historical recreation followed in\u000d\u000a      April 2011. The network's sound effects workshop (Edinburgh, 13 October\u000d\u000a      2009) also culminated in a public evening mixed bill film event at\u000d\u000a      Edinburgh's Cameo Cinema involving early film live sound. The British\u000d\u000a      Silent Film Festival takes the musical presentation of its films\u000d\u000a      seriously, so also recognized the value of collaboration, while the\u000d\u000a      Network welcomed the opportunity to encourage the general constituency of\u000d\u000a      silent film enthusiasts to experience and engage with the latest research.\u000d\u000a      Several of those enthusiasts became network members.\u000d\u000a    In conjunction with the British Silent Film Festival at the Barbican\u000d\u000a      Cinema Brown's historical recreation of Frederick Laurence's score to the\u000d\u000a      film Morozko was brought to public performance (see underpinning\u000d\u000a      research (item 2): also grant `Film fitting' in Britain). After a\u000d\u000a      10-minute introductory lecture on this little-known film, the music and\u000d\u000a      its composer, Brown led a post-screening Q&amp;A involving conductor and\u000d\u000a      double bass player. A lively question and answer session followed, which\u000d\u000a      enabled members of the public to engage with Brown and the performers. The\u000d\u000a      event, held in the 284-seat Cinema One, was nearly sold out (257 seats\u000d\u000a      were sold), which indicates the level of public engagement achieved. By\u000d\u000a      the end of the final conference at which this performance took place, a\u000d\u000a      British Film Institute silent film curator, opined that `The work of this\u000d\u000a      project adds real value to the understanding, enjoyability and performance\u000d\u000a      of the films in our collection.'\u000d\u000a    Media reporting of Brown's silent film score discoveries adds to the\u000d\u000a      public impact of her work. Brown has also contributed in similar ways to\u000d\u000a      other non-specialist audiences: she has spoken to Friends of the Cambridge\u000d\u000a      University Library (February 2012) about a silent film score held in the\u000d\u000a      university manuscripts collection, and to a geography film society,\u000d\u000a      Passengerfilms (25 February 2013), which meets at various locations in\u000d\u000a      London.\u000d\u000a    Beneficiaries &#8212; Group 2 &#8212; Performers:\u000d\u000a      Brown's research has brought new levels of understanding to various\u000d\u000a      categories of practitioner. None of the roughly twenty professional\u000d\u000a      musicians involved had previously accompanied silent film, yet all found\u000d\u000a      it a revelatory experience&#8212;a real insight into what their counterparts in\u000d\u000a      the 1920s would have experienced. Among them was Mervyn Heard, President\u000d\u000a      of the British Magic Lantern Association, who participated in the\u000d\u000a      Edinburgh workshop (13 October 2009) and served as `film lecturer' for the\u000d\u000a      evening performance. Though a known \"reconstructor\" of the art of lantern\u000d\u000a      slide lecturing, this was Heard's first attempt at film lecturing and\u000d\u000a      revealed to him the continuities between the practices. The Silent Film\u000d\u000a      and Live Performance workshop at Royal Holloway in October 2010 culminated\u000d\u000a      in a public evening screening of Cecil Hepworth's Comin' Thro' the Rye\u000d\u000a      (1923), which had been approached during the day from various musical\u000d\u000a      points of view, and whose original `live prologue' had also been explored\u000d\u000a      in practice. This latter was a direct outcome of Brown's research on the\u000d\u000a      rediscovered score to Comin' Thro' the Rye and also on live film\u000d\u000a      prologues (see underpinning research (items 1 &amp; 2); also grant `Film\u000d\u000a      fitting' in Britain).\u000d\u000a    The conductor of Morozko had over 20 years of experience with the\u000d\u000a      Birmingham Royal Ballet and was used to fine-grained synchronization of\u000d\u000a      music and movement. Nevertheless he said later that the discipline of\u000d\u000a      working with the running film put into new perspective the relative\u000d\u000a      freedom of his role. It made him appreciate the difficulty dancers faced\u000d\u000a      in planning large stage-movements ahead of time, especially when dancing\u000d\u000a      in groups, and the fact that they might sometimes regard the orchestra (as\u000d\u000a      he did the film), as tyrannical, dictating too precisely time they had to\u000d\u000a      execute complex movements, and making them panic when they realised they\u000d\u000a      were running late. For the composer's grandson, who played double bass,\u000d\u000a      the event had impact of an entirely different order. It first made him\u000d\u000a      appreciate his family history in a completely new way. However, as a\u000d\u000a      highly regarded professional double-bass player himself, someone who\u000d\u000a      frequently performs in orchestral recordings of contemporary Hollywood\u000d\u000a      film scores, he was able to understand the gulf between early and current\u000d\u000a      film music practices: above all, he was able to appreciate the luxury that\u000d\u000a      musicians enjoy today in having time to perfect the synchronization.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Dr Julie Brown's research on the sounds of `silent film' exhibition in\u000d\u000a      Britain has had an impact well beyond academia.

The specific research is that dating from 2009 on the sonic\u000d\u000a      dimension of early film exhibition, including her discovery of numerous\u000d\u000a      otherwise unknown British silent film `special scores' &#8212; that is, full\u000d\u000a      scores specially put together for given silent films. We previously knew\u000d\u000a      of only one such score.\u000d\u000a    In July 2010 she commenced a British Academy research project entitled\u000d\u000a      `\"Film Fitting\" in Britain, 1913-1926' the twin aims of which were to\u000d\u000a      provide the first overview of the professional debate about film fitting\u000d\u000a      over this same period, and to explore possible synchronisations of the\u000d\u000a      surviving films using electronic means. This research has revealed,\u000d\u000a      amongst other things, a more concert oriented approach to film fitting in\u000d\u000a      the UK compared to elsewhere while her electronic `practice-based'\u000d\u000a      research has led to insights into conceptual and practical dimensions of\u000d\u000a      silent film `special score' recreation: so far publications include an\u000d\u000a      account of the palimpsest-like problems of film score recreations, and the\u000d\u000a      lively though ephemeral nature of live film prologues of the 1920s. The\u000d\u000a      project also funded Research Assistant Guy Bunce (joined Royal Holloway\u000d\u000a      September 2008) to produce working instrumental parts and a conductor's\u000d\u000a      score for the film Morozko, the entirely original and modernist\u000d\u000a      British score she had found; Brown also acquired a copy of the 40-minute\u000d\u000a      film from Russian film archive Gosfilmofond and produced an exemplary\u000d\u000a      synchronization of the film.

Based partly on an\u000d\u000a      earlier established network (the AHRC-funded `Music and the Melodramatic\u000d\u000a      Aesthetic'), the network included leading British and American academics,\u000d\u000a      both affiliated (Austin (2), Birkbeck, Exeter, Indiana, Leeds, Manchester,\u000d\u000a      Warwick) and freelance, from British silent film studies and from film\u000d\u000a      musicology as well as silent film performers (Neil Brand, Stephen Horne,\u000d\u000a      Gillian Anderson, Philip Carli, Donald MacKenzie, Paul Robinson, the band\u000d\u000a      Minima) and industry and institutional stakeholders (BFI silent film\u000d\u000a      curator, British Silent Film Festival organiser Laraine Porter, British\u000d\u000a      Library film specialist Luke McKernan).

In addition to\u000a      advising David Whelton (Managing Director) on specific programme choices,\u000a      Johnson provided the intellectual framework in which these concert series\u000a      were presented. Through series programme books, educational films\u000a      available on the orchestra's website, BBC Radio 3 interviews, study days\u000a      and pre-performance talks, he shaped the public understanding of a wide\u000a      international audience.\u000a    The Programme book for the Philharmonia's series City of Dreams\u000a      sold 3,300 copies in the UK alone. Around 48,000 people in 20 European\u000a      cities attended the concerts. As author-editor, Johnson wrote the\u000a      introductory essay and all programme notes, commissioned three further\u000a      essays, chose images and provided a timeline and further reading, thus\u000a      shaping the public understanding of audiences internationally. The series\u000a      was shortlisted for a 2010 South Bank Show Award. Hugh Canning (Times,\u000a      8 March 2009) referred to Johnson's `brilliant introductory essay to a\u000a      book of outstanding programme notes'. The Programme book for the\u000a      Philharmonia series Maazel: Mahler Cycle 2011 sold around 6,000\u000a      copies.

Viewing figures range from c.500,000 (mid-week)\u000a      to over 2 million (Saturday evenings). Since 2010 he has given 10 live\u000a      interviews on BBC Radio 3's Performance on Three (average UK\u000a      audience c.700,000); and has made four guest appearances on Building a\u000a      Library (c.90 mins, average UK audience c.400,000; independent figures\u000a      from Radio Joint Audience Research). In November 2011 he presented a Radio\u000a      3 Building a Library (45 mins), reviewing currently available recordings\u000a      of Mahler's 8th Symphony and in January 2013 similarly for\u000a      Mahler's 6th Symphony.

This case study focuses on post-2007\u000a      activities alone. Johnson's work has been published in a number of\u000a      academic journal articles and in two monographs, the most important of\u000a      which is his most recent: Mahler's Voices. Expression and Irony in the\u000a        Songs and Symphonies (Oxford: OUP, 2009, 348pp). This is the first\u000a      single-authored, full-length study in English of Mahler's complete output\u000a      for over 25 years, and crosses the borders between academic scholarship\u000a      and a broader readership while at the same time providing a radical\u000a      reappraisal of the ways Mahler's music constructs and deconstructs its\u000a      meanings for contemporary audiences.\u000a    The research embodied in this monograph is further elaborated and\u000a      supplemented by a range of essays published in scholarly journals and\u000a      edited volumes and by high profile papers presented at international\u000a      conferences. Johnson was an invited speaker in Cologne for the\u000a      international symposium `Ferne Heimatkl&#228;nge: Gustav Mahler und die\u000a      Moderne' (6-7 May 2010), gave the keynote lecture at the international\u000a      Mahler Centenary Conference at Surrey University in July 2011, and a\u000a      further keynote lecture at the international symposium `Transformations of\u000a      Modernism' in Paris, October 2011. This research has also been developed\u000a      in public formats &#8212; such as shaping the discussion of Mahler's symphonies\u000a      on BBC Radio 3's `Building a Library' (in November 2011 and January 2013)\u000a      or public lectures (as part of the BBC `Proms Plus' talks in 2010 and\u000a      2011, at the Sage, Gateshead in November 2011, the University of Stavanger\u000a      in April 2012, and the South Bank Centre in January 2013). In May 2013 he\u000a      accompanied the South Bank Centre and the Aurora Orchestra to frame,\u000a      present and discuss a series of concerts of 20th-Century Music\u000a      at the Shanghai Concert Hall, China.\u000a    At the heart of all Johnson's research is a central question about the\u000a      contemporary resonance and value of music's engagement with social\u000a      modernity over the past two hundred years. His specific research on Mahler\u000a      and Viennese musical modernism is placed in the context of this broader\u000a      question in two further books, aimed at a non-specialist readership,\u000a      exploring the wider social and cultural importance of the art music\u000a      tradition to modern society &#8212; Who Needs Classical Music? (revised\u000a      paperback Oxford: OUP, 2011; original 2001), and Classical Music: A\u000a        Beginners' Guide (Oxford: Oneworld, 2009). The first of these has\u000a      currently sold around 6,000 copies and is very widely reviewed in academic\u000a      and non-academic journals in the UK and USA (including The Independent,\u000a      The Economist, The New Republic, BBC Music Magazine,\u000a      Gramophone).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"30227","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The major long-term impact of the Yeats\/de Valois work had been through generating\u000a        new ways of thinking that influence creative practice and creating,\u000a        inspiring and supporting new forms of artistic, expression.\u000d\u000a      In the first instance, the restaging of The King allowed an\u000d\u000a      audience of 250 at the Margot Fonteyn Studio at the Royal Ballet School\u000d\u000a      (RBS) to see the danced components of a play which had been lost since the\u000d\u000a      1930s. This performance was filmed and then screened at a Friends of\u000d\u000a      Covent Garden Study Evening devoted to de Valois' legacy (Royal Opera\u000d\u000a      House November, 2011, audience 150) and at the `Come Dance with Me'\u000d\u000a      conference presented by the Irish Ballet Forum at the Abbey Theatre,\u000d\u000a      Dublin (14 October 2012, audience 300). The book which arose from the\u000d\u000a      symposium, Ninette de Valois: Adventurous Traditionalist, edited\u000d\u000a      by Cave and Royal Holloway Senior Lecturer Dr Libby Worth (Dance Books\u000d\u000a      2012) has an accompanying DVD which includes the performance.\u000d\u000a    The project's most significant impact, however, is in its developing\u000d\u000a        a new methodology for dance theatre that the RBS have now revisited.\u000d\u000a      The creative but carefully researched re-imagining of The King\u000d\u000a      convinced the RBS to apply the research, recreation and revival process to\u000d\u000a      other works from the first decades of the Company's history and Cave,\u000d\u000a      Schafer and Worth have all been invited to contribute to the research\u000d\u000a      process as the RBS now seek to recover, re-stage and document the dance\u000d\u000a      works of de Valois' prot&#233;g&#233;e, Robert Helpmann (1909-1986), a dancer,\u000d\u000a      choreographer and actor, notable for the theatricality of his dance.\u000d\u000a    The first stage of the RBS revisiting and adapting Cave's methodology\u000d\u000a      occurred when David Drew (former Principal dancer at the RB, currently a\u000d\u000a      teacher at the RBS) organised a study day (19 November 2011) on Helpmann's\u000d\u000a      ballet Miracle in the Gorbals (1944). The aim for this day was the\u000d\u000a      reconstruction of a ten-minute scene, where the body of `The Suicide' is\u000d\u000a      discovered in the Clyde river, and she is revived by `The Stranger'.\u000d\u000a      Drawing on the memories of several dancers from the original performances,\u000d\u000a      the work was directed by Gillian Lynne, who performed as `The Young Lover'\u000d\u000a      in Miracle in the 1950s. David Bintley, Artistic Director of the\u000d\u000a      Birmingham Royal Ballet (BRB), was so impressed by the performance of this\u000d\u000a      scene that he commissioned Gillian Lynne to develop a reconstructed\u000d\u000a      choreography of Miracle with the BRB for staging in 2014. All of\u000d\u000a      this work on Miracle was directly the result of Drew being\u000d\u000a      inspired by the performance of The King and the creative\u000d\u000a      approaches taken to dance reconstruction in the production of Yeats's\u000d\u000a      dance play. This is noted by White Lodge Museum Curator, Anna Meadmore,\u000d\u000a      who writes in April 2013 Dancing Times (p. 37) `the idea to\u000d\u000a      attempt a revival of the ballet was inspired by Richard Allen Cave's\u000d\u000a      reconstruction of the W.B. Yeats\/Ninette de Valois collaboration, The\u000d\u000a        King of the Clock Tower'.\u000d\u000a    The impact of the de Valois symposium has also meant the Royal Ballet\u000d\u000a      School is keen to organise another event around restaging Helpmann. Cave\u000d\u000a      is chair of the steering committee for this project; the first study day\u000d\u000a      was on 18 February 2013, focusing on Adam Zero (1946). The next\u000d\u000a      stage in the process is a symposium, `The Many Faces of Robert Helpmann',\u000d\u000a      to be held on 21 October 2013.\u000d\u000a    The impact of the research will continue to grow as a book based on the\u000d\u000a      RBS April 2011 conference (Ninette de Valois: Adventurous\u000d\u000a        Traditionalist, outlined above) reaches wide distribution. This\u000d\u000a      volume is remarkably wide-ranging and includes contributions from dancers,\u000d\u000a      academics, choreographers, dance notators, museum archivists, curators,\u000d\u000a      journalists, reviewers, historians, film makers, and luminaries from the\u000d\u000a      world of dance. It includes a DVD of The King, allowing those\u000d\u000a      interested in Yeats, de Valois, ballet, and modernist dance an opportunity\u000d\u000a      to see The King in performance. A similar volume, edited by Anna\u000d\u000a      Meadmore and Richard Cave, is planned to follow the Helpmann symposium.\u000d\u000a    The project has also had an impact on the educational work of the\u000d\u000a      Royal Ballet School. The DVD of The King is used in the GCSE\u000d\u000a      Expressive Arts course at the School to teach mask work. The teacher has\u000d\u000a      replaced former material with that from The King. However, the\u000d\u000a      most significant impact remains the project's influence on the RBS's\u000d\u000a      programming and events and the change in the school's approach to\u000d\u000a      re-imaging historic choreography.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research by Emeritus Professor Richard Cave and Professor Elizabeth\u000d\u000a      Schafer into modernist dance drama has:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a       Produced a methodology for the restaging of lost repertoire, which\u000d\u000a        has widened programming within the professional dance world;\u000d\u000a       Enabled a re-creation of the initial production of W.B.Yeats's 1934\u000d\u000a        dance play, The King of the Great Clock Tower, by using research\u000d\u000a        to re-imagine the largely lost choreography of Ninette de Valois;\u000d\u000a       Inspired the Royal Ballet School to apply the same methodology to a\u000d\u000a        project on the choreography of de Valois' prot&#233;g&#233;e, Robert Helpmann\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    Royal Holloway, University of London\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Royal Holloway, University of London","InstitutionName":"Royal Holloway, University of London","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"London","UKPRN":10005553}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2964574","Name":"Dublin City"},{"GeoNamesId":"2964574","Name":"Dublin"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a1.

Cave argues that the\u000d\u000a      performance text of The King is distinct from the written text and\u000d\u000a      that, through the use of music scores, set designs, photographs, revisions\u000d\u000a      to the script, reviews, correspondence and reminiscences by other\u000d\u000a      performers, the lost performance can be re-imagined.\u000d\u000a    Professor Elizabeth Schafer joined Royal Holloway in 1991. Her research\u000d\u000a      into the early history of the Royal Ballet, especially at the Vic-Wells\u000d\u000a      during the 1930s, emphasizes the importance of theatre in de Valois' dance\u000d\u000a      practice as well as the way in which the physical material conditions at\u000d\u000a      the Vic-Wells theatres influenced de Valois' choreography in this period.\u000d\u000a      Schafer was invited to be a consultant for Royal Ballet's symposium,\u000d\u000a      `Ninette de Valois: Adventurous Traditionalist' (April 2011). This three\u000d\u000a      day, international, public event, set out to re-evaluate de Valois'\u000d\u000a      achievements on the tenth anniversary of her death, with the purpose of\u000d\u000a      emphasizing the links between dance and theatre in her work. Cave's\u000d\u000a      research on re-imagining the 1934 staging of The King of the Great\u000d\u000a        Clock Tower resulted in the Royal Ballet School commissioning him to\u000d\u000a      restage the lost piece for their symposium. This collaboration brought\u000d\u000a      together Schafer's research on de Valois in the 1930s, Cave's textual\u000d\u000a      research, and Cave's research into the set design, photographs, etc. with\u000d\u000a      practice-based research, in order to re-imagine de Valois's lost 1934\u000d\u000a      choreography, working with Royal Ballet choreographer Will Tuckett.\u000d\u000a    The King was an appropriate test case for the methodology of\u000d\u000a      re-imagining as it is hard to engage with this dance play &#8212; which requires\u000d\u000a      extensive choreography, mime and sustained tableaux &#8212; via the literary\u000d\u000a      text alone. The recreation of the choreography particularly emphasized the\u000d\u000a      profound impact of the danced role of The Queen, who is still and silent\u000d\u000a      for the first half of the play. The re-imagining revealed that the\u000d\u000a      stillness of The Queen unnerves the audience almost as much as it unnerves\u000d\u000a      The King, creating a build-up in tension as the audience anticipates the\u000d\u000a      moment The Queen will finally move. Then throughout the second part of the\u000d\u000a      play, The Queen's dancing with the severed head of The Stranger\u000d\u000a      marginalizes The King's bluster and violence. The methodology of bringing\u000d\u000a      together Cave's manuscript work with practice-based exploratory research\u000d\u000a      enabled the performance of a dance play, the precisely calculated\u000d\u000a      choreographic impact of which had been lost to audiences for nearly eighty\u000d\u000a      years.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"30228","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    This research reaches two priority areas named in the Department's Impact\u000a      Strategy:\u000a      professional artists and the health and charitable sectors.

The editor writes:\u000a    \"Dr Emma Brodzinski's special issue of Health Care Analysis, the\u000a      journal I edit, was\u000a      extremely well regarded. I received very positive feedback during\u000a      conferences on the\u000a      philosophy of health care that I attended, particularly from people\u000a      interested in the\u000a      medical humanities and in the role that artistic and other creative\u000a      activity can play in\u000a      the provision of health care and therapy.

Working with South London and Maudsley NHS\u000a      Foundation Trust\u000a      (SLaM), Guys and St Thomas's Charity, Age Exchange Theatre Trust and\u000a      artists working in\u000a      geriatric care, it has brought benefit in three distinct ways:\u000a    1) analyzing dementia as a cultural practice (as distinct from\u000a      social or medical\u000a      models of dementia) is influencing dementia care in London. The research\u000a      has\u000a      provided evidence of the benefits of creative involvement of professional\u000a      carers,\u000a      ancillary staff and family members as well as artists and activity\u000a      co-ordinators in\u000a      residents' care and care plans. This approach to care is reaching older\u000a      adult services\u000a      across South London (working with over 60 care staff, 100 residents and 25\u000a      artists).\u000a    2) It has brought a paradigm shift in the artistic practice of\u000a        cultural organizations\u000a        working in dementia care, particularly Age Exchange Theatre Trust,\u000a      from person-centred\u000a      reminiscence, which relies on the memory and cognition of people with\u000a      dementia, to creating multi-sensory environments that encourage embodied\u000a      memory\u000a      and responses. This has benefitted over 100 people living with advanced\u000a      dementia,\u000a      and particularly those who are post-verbal.\u000a    3) The impact of this research is sustainable because improves\u000a      the culture of dementia\u000a      care; previous studies have measured the effects of the arts on\u000a      individuals. Research\u000a      findings underpinned Age Exchange's successful application to Guys and St\u000a      Thomas's Charity (2012, &#163;600,000), building capacity for the arts in\u000a      dementia care.\u000a    Training in the arts and dementia care has been offered at: The\u000a        King's Fund, April 2012\u000a      (120 artists and health professionals working with people experiencing\u000a      dementia); SLaM\u000a        and Age Exchange, December 2012 (30 managers of residential care\u000a      settings); Trinity\u000a        Laban, Age Gap Symposium (Paul Hamlyn funded) April 2013 (70\u000a      artists); Training\u000a      workshops in Hiroshima, Japan in 2008, for 40 health professionals\u000a      in geriatric care.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Department's impact on health and care has two strands that are\u000a      mutually enriching:\u000a      creative interventions in health and social care designed to benefit NHS\u000a      service users and\u000a      therapeutic client groups, and the application of innovative arts\u000a      methodologies to health\u000a      settings.

Both strands of the research problematize the culture of\u000a      performance\u000a      management and clinical governance that permeates the NHS, arguing that\u000a      arts\u000a      interventions in health and care have the potential to serve a positive\u000a      social function;\u000a      enhancing well-being through performance.\u000a    Creativity in health and care: Interdisciplinary and inter-agency\u000a        research\u000a    Brodzinski was funded by a joint funding scheme `The Nature of\u000a      Creativity' supported by the\u000a      AHRC\/ESRC\/DTI\/Arts Council England and required researchers to work with\u000a      non-academic\u000a      partners to consider the nature of creativity and its relationships with\u000a      innovation and risk.\u000a      One of the key outcomes from this project was a Special Edition of Health\u000a        Care Analysis\u000a      which published inter-disciplinary papers authored by researchers and\u000a      non-academic\u000a      partners around the theme of creativity in health and care. Brodzinski's\u000a      interest in creativity\u000a      within the risk averse culture of the NHS led to a critique of toolkits,\u000a      developed with an arts in\u000a      health practitioner working with Open Art, an organisation that\u000a      facilitate workforce training for\u000a      healthcare settings. Her research shaped the training that practitioners\u000a      were delivering to\u000a      front-line NHS workers. The research addresses the application of theatre\u000a      practices to\u000a      hospital care, in medical training and as an advocacy tool for service\u000a      users (2010).\u000a    The Arts in Dementia Care\u000a    Nicholson's research into dementia responds to national and international\u000a      concerns about\u000a      ageing populations. Working in partnership with the NHS and leading\u000a      charities, this research\u000a      challenges notions of `loss', `decline' and `failure' associated with\u000a      dementia. It provides new\u000a      insights into role of the arts in creating an emotional geography of home\u000a      and sustaining\u000a      relationship-centred care within NHS residential `units' for older adults.\u000a      The research builds\u000a      on a book co-authored with Brodzinski and Normington on devised theatre\u000a      (2007), her\u000a      monograph on applied drama (2005) and her research into performance and\u000a      memory (2003,\u000a      2009). The research project supports two full-time PGRs, Jayne Lloyd\u000a      (funded by Guy's and\u000a      St Thomas's Charity) and Nicola Hatton (funded by AHRC).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"30229","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact of Rebellato's research is evident in the significant\u000d\u000a        contemporary interest in Rattigan, in the professional theatre, in\u000d\u000a      film and in the wider public; he has contributed in various ways, directly\u000d\u000a      and indirectly, to this interest and to shaping Rattigan's revived\u000d\u000a      reputation. This is not, of course, to claim that Rebellato has\u000d\u000a      single-handedly revived Rattigan's reputation. It is that his research has\u000d\u000a      contributed to the general reassessment through (a) the significance of\u000d\u000a      the ideas themselves, (b) the influence he has therefore been able to have\u000d\u000a      on revivals of the work, and (c) the interpretive activity around these\u000d\u000a      revivals that he has been asked to take on.\u000d\u000a    The impact of his research has been evident in some of the revivals\u000d\u000a        of Rattigan's plays in major theatres. The director of After the\u000d\u000a        Dance at the National Theatre explained in a public interview at the\u000d\u000a      National Theatre on 17 June 2010 that she read the play in the Nick Hern\u000d\u000a      Books [NHB] edition, with Rebellato's introduction, and it was this that\u000d\u000a      persuaded her to direct a revival. Rebellato was asked to chair the\u000d\u000a      platform in the Lyttelton Theatre and write an article in the programme.\u000d\u000a      The director's faith in the play, partly deriving from Rebellato's\u000d\u000a      edition, was born out by 97% houses, and four Olivier awards in 2011,\u000d\u000a      including best revival, and Best Director in the Critics Circle awards.\u000d\u000a      This in turn encouraged the director to revive Rattigan's Cause\u000d\u000a        C&#233;l&#232;bre at the Old Vic the following year.\u000d\u000a    Several theatres marked Rattigan's centenary in 2011 with productions,\u000d\u000a      including Flare Path at the Haymarket, The Deep Blue Sea\u000d\u000a      and The Browning Version at Chichester, and In Praise of Love\u000d\u000a      at the Royal and Derngate. In each case, Rebellato provided programme\u000d\u000a      notes or pre-show talks to place these plays in context. In the case of In\u000a        Praise of Love, Rebellato was consulted early by the director who\u000d\u000a      had read his edition. When a new film of The Deep Blue Sea was\u000d\u000a      released in 2011, the tie-in edition published Rebellato's introduction to\u000d\u000a      the play alongside a piece by the film's producer who, in the 1990s, had\u000d\u000a      written a book on gay playwrights like Rattigan which made extensive use\u000d\u000a      of the NHB Rattigan editions. When English Touring Theatre revived French\u000a        Without Tears in 2007, the director drew directly on Rebellato's\u000d\u000a        introduction to the NHB edition in shaping his production. Every\u000d\u000a      major revival of Separate Tables since 1999 has used the `gay\u000d\u000a      variant' first published in Rebellato's edition, including Philip Frank's\u000d\u000a      acclaimed Chichester production (2009). Frank later drew on Rebellato's\u000d\u000a      work in 2011, when, at the same theatre, he directed a reading of First\u000a        Episode using the pre-publication copy of the definitive text that\u000d\u000a      Rebellato had newly established.\u000d\u000a    The range of activity demonstrates Rebellato's impact in this area; he is\u000d\u000a      the principal academic commentator on Rattigan's work with an established\u000a        ability to talk to a wider audience. In this REF period he has\u000d\u000a      appeared on platforms at the National on Rattigan and After the Dance\u000d\u000a      (both 2010), given three talks at the Chichester Festival Theatre in 2010\u000d\u000a      and 2011, and one each at Birkbeck College London, Theatre Royal,\u000d\u000a      Haymarket, the English-Speaking Union, and Harrow School all in 2011.\u000d\u000a      Recent programme articles include After the Dance (National\u000d\u000a      Theatre, 2010), In Praise of Love (Royal and Derngate, 2011), and\u000d\u000a      French Without Tears (Shaw Festival, Ontario, 2012). These might be\u000d\u000a      understood as interpretation activities (to use the term from the visual\u000d\u000a      arts) in which the insights given by the scholarly and critical work is\u000d\u000a      presented for a wider audience, offering a gateway through which the\u000d\u000a      academic work can have an impact on a wider non-academic public.\u000d\u000a    Audiences for the various publications and talks range in scale from\u000d\u000a      approximately three million listeners who heard the BBC Radio 4\u000d\u000a      Front Row special to the 150-strong audience for the talks at the\u000d\u000a      Chichester Festival Theatre. The NHB editions have sold strongly, many\u000d\u000a      selling in the thousands and they have established themselves as the\u000d\u000a      definitive editions of the plays. Rebellato's significance as a\u000d\u000a      commentator on Rattigan led to him being invited as a guest of honour at\u000d\u000a      the inaugural meeting of the Terence Rattigan Society in 2011. In the\u000d\u000a      words of Rattigan's literary executor `There is no doubt in my mind\u000d\u000a        that [Rebellato has] contributed to the rise (re-birth?) of Rattigan in\u000d\u000a        the past years'.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Professor Rebellato's research has been a significant factor in the\u000d\u000a        revival of Terence Rattigan's reputation as a serious playwright,\u000d\u000a      impacting on a wave of high-profile productions from 1998-2013.

It has\u000d\u000a      consistently revalued the cultural and sexual politics of Rattigan's\u000d\u000a        work and built greater understanding of the complexity of his\u000d\u000a        dramaturgy. It has involved the publication of chapters, articles, a\u000d\u000a      monograph, and new editions of the plays.\u000d\u000a    His work on Rattigan has been a key part of a broader project of\u000d\u000a      re-reading the theatre of the 1940s and 1950s. The monograph 1956 and\u000d\u000a        All That (London: Routledge, 1999) offered an historiographical\u000d\u000a      re-reading of the theatre of the 1940s and 1950s, drawing on Foucaultian\u000d\u000a      and `queer' models to revalue the theatre of the West End as it may have\u000d\u000a      seemed before the critical axis shifted towards Tynan and the Royal Court.\u000d\u000a      This involved re-reading the queer dynamics of the West End, the theatre's\u000d\u000a      relationship to its audience, changing attitudes to theatrical\u000d\u000a      collaboration, attitudes to Europe and Empire, the perception of emotional\u000d\u000a      repression, the cultural dynamics of homosexuality, and the theatre's\u000d\u000a      relation to political context.\u000d\u000a    Rebellato has also edited 12 volumes of Rattigan's plays for Nick Hern\u000d\u000a      Books, each of which comes with an original and substantial (7000-10,000\u000d\u000a      word) scholarly introduction as well as a general outline of Rattigan's\u000d\u000a      life and work. Several of these plays (First Episode, Less Than Kind,\u000d\u000a        Duologue) have never been published before; others (After the\u000d\u000a        Dance, Who is Sylvia?) have been long out of print. Publishing First\u000a        Episode involved tracking down the six existing typescripts and\u000d\u000a      establishing a definitive new edition. His edition of Separate Tables\u000d\u000a      was the first to publish Rattigan's own gay variant on the text. Each\u000d\u000a      edition offers critical, against-the-grain readings of the plays, their\u000d\u000a      development and their place in their historical, cultural and theatrical\u000d\u000a      contexts. The editions include hitherto unpublished materials from the\u000d\u000a      archives. In some cases, such as the edition of Who is Sylvia?\u000d\u000a      which publishes extracts from an incomplete first draft thought to have\u000d\u000a      been destroyed, Rebellato traced archive materials that were previously\u000d\u000a      unknown. Together these introductions revalue Rattigan's plays and\u000d\u000a      politics, demonstrating the sophistication of his playwriting.\u000d\u000a    Rebellato has extended the audiences for these ideas through public talks\u000d\u000a      and programme articles accompanying Rattigan productions. They include\u000d\u000a      talks at the National Theatre, Lyric Hammersmith, Chichester Festival\u000d\u000a      Theatre, Theatre Royal, Haymarket, and elsewhere and programme articles\u000d\u000a      for Rattigan productions by the National, Royal Exchange, English Touring\u000d\u000a      Theatre, Royal and Derngate, and the Shaw Festival, Ontario.

These include appearances before non-specialist\u000a      audiences in Boston and New York (February 2010; audience of 250),\u000a      Florence's Uffizi Palace (October 2011; 200) and the BBC Proms (July 2012;\u000a      450, plus Radio 3 listeners). Concert programmes related to the research\u000a      have been performed at venues throughout the UK, including London's\u000a      Cadogan Hall, Aberdeen (November 2009 and March 2011), Belfast (November\u000a      2009), Sheffield (October 2013), Bristol (January 2013) and Cheltenham\u000a      (May 2012); across Europe, including Magguzano (October 2009) and Cuenca,\u000a      Spain (March 2013); and in several other countries, including the USA\u000a      (Boulder, October 2009 and Boston and New York (February 2010).\u000a    In particular, continuing involvement with York Early Music Festival and,\u000a      until 2011, the Dartington International Summer School has provided a\u000a      valuable platform from which to develop audiences' understanding of the\u000a      new approaches to performance revealed by the research. Bryan's\u000a      association with the National Centre for Early Music, which he helped to\u000a      start and for which he still serves as artistic adviser, has engaged\u000a      audiences through programme planning (e.g. the sell-out series of concerts\u000a      curated by Bryan in 2011 to reflect the early music content of the 1951\u000a      Festival of Britain), programme-book articles and notes, lectures,\u000a      concerts and workshops.\u000a    2. Wider listening public\u000a    Bryan has been involved in the release of more than 20 albums since the\u000a      research began. Several of these have emerged during the impact period\u000a      and, like their predecessors, have been distributed internationally. As\u000a      well as introducing the wider listening public to the insights derived\u000a      from Bryan's work, they have earned critical acclaim for their novel\u000a      presentation of familiar repertory. Early and Baroque music magazine Goldberg\u000a      commended 2008's Four Gentlemen of the Chapel Royal for reflecting\u000a      \"the diversity of performance methods possible for English music of this\u000a      period\", while International Record Review observed: \"Four\u000a        Gentlemen of the Chapel Royal explores the flexible way in which\u000a      various musical genres intersected.\"\u000a    Concerts have been broadcast by national radio networks in the UK (BBC\u000a      Radio 3), Germany (WDR), and the USA, with additional contributions to BBC\u000a      Radio 3's The Early Music Show (July 2009), Spirit of the Age\u000a      and In Tune (September 2009). In November 2011 Bryan was\u000a      interviewed about viol construction on BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight\u000a      (audience of 1.7m). Invited lectures have been given at the Pan-Pacific\u000a      Viola da Gamba Gathering (Hawaii, 2008), Beverley and East Riding Festival\u000a      (May 2008), York Early Music Festival (July 2009) and the Viola da Gamba\u000a      Societies of America (Boulder and Tucson, October 2009; Boston, February\u000a      2010) and Great Britain (Chichester, June 2011), as well as at performance\u000a      courses in the UK, the USA and Italy.\u000a    3. Other performers\u000a    Bryan's research has influenced the performance approach of the many\u000a      ensembles and singers he has worked with, including the Rose Consort of\u000a      Viols, Musica Antiqua of London, the Consort of Musicke, I Fagiolini, Red\u000a      Byrd, Stile Antico, Dame Emma Kirkby, Catherine King and Clare Wilkinson.\u000a      In turn, these artists have drawn on their experience of newly researched\u000a      performance in their own collaborations.\u000a    In particular, this has led to increased interest in using different\u000a      types of viols in vocal repertories &#8212; as evidenced, for example, by Alessandro\u000a        Striggio: Missa Ecco si beato giorno (I Fagiolini, Decca 478 2734),\u000a      for which Bryan acted as an adviser. In 2011 this CD won the Gramophone\u000a        Early Music Award and the Diapason d'or de l'ann&#233;e. France's\u000a      Tutti Magazine described the album as \"an essential recording and\u000a      an all-too-rare example of risk-taking\". The research has also influenced\u000a      amateur players and singers through Bryan's coaching at summer schools and\u000a      workshops, including Dartington and the Viola da Gamba Societies of Great\u000a      Britain and America.\u000a    4. Instrument makers and music publishers\u000a    Increased interest in the `renaissance' viol has created business for\u000a      instrument makers. The likes of Richard Jones have been able to establish\u000a      careers dedicated solely to the building of `Venetian' instruments, as\u000a      opposed to the later and more familiar `Jacobean' pattern, to satisfy\u000a      demand from amateur players in the UK, the US and Europe. The development\u000a      of `Costa' viols was based on collaboration with students on the early\u000a      instrument-building course at West Dean College, Sussex, led by Roger\u000a      Rose, while the AHRC-funded project The Making of the Tudor Viol\u000a      has facilitated Bryan's collaborative research with Dr Michael Fleming\u000a      (Research Fellow), a maker of English viols.\u000a    Specialist publishing companies have increasingly turned to producing\u000a      performance editions of music suitable for voices and viols or `vocal'\u000a      material aimed at viol players. Both the Viola da Gamba Society of Great\u000a      Britain and Particular Music have published material initially performed\u000a      on CDs resulting from the research or introduced to prospective performers\u000a      at related workshops and lecture-recitals.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The University of Huddersfield's performance-led research into the\u000a      consort of viols and its relationship to the voice has resulted in\u000a      familiar repertory being heard in new ways and the performance of music\u000a      largely unknown to modern audiences. This work has earned international\u000a      recognition through public performances, lecture-recitals, commercial CDs\u000a      and radio broadcasts, influencing instrument makers, performers, concert\u000a      promoters and audiences. Its importance is further evidenced by a close\u000a      association with the National Centre for Early Music, advising on and\u000a      leading events and the award of a &#163;268,000 AHRC grant for the project The\u000a        Making of the Tudor Viol.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    The University of Huddersfield\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Huddersfield (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Huddersfield","PeerGroup":"D","Region":"Yorkshire And Humberside","UKPRN":10007148}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"3176959","Name":"Florence"},{"GeoNamesId":"5855797","Name":"Hawaii"},{"GeoNamesId":"5128638","Name":"New York"},{"GeoNamesId":"4930956","Name":"Boston"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

Practice-led research by the\u000a      University of Huddersfield has played a leading role in investigating\u000a      music for viols and voices, resulting in new insights into their\u000a      relationship and performance of their repertory.\u000a    Professor John Bryan (Principal Lecturer, 1994-2007; Professor of Music,\u000a      2007-present) has developed a range of approaches, including\u000a      iconographical, organological, archival and source-based evidence,\u000a      alongside musical analysis (particularly of texture and tessitura), to\u000a      underpin his international reputation in the performance of renaissance\u000a      music, demonstrated through concerts, lecture-recitals and teaching on\u000a      courses for amateur performers in the UK, Europe, Israel, the USA and\u000a      Canada. Working primarily with the Rose Consort of Viols (of which he is\u000a      artistic director), an ensemble distinctive in its use of accurate copies\u000a      of historical instruments strung throughout in gut and using bows with\u000a      `clip in' frogs, Bryan has explored techniques of performance informed by\u000a      close association with specialist singers using researched historical\u000a      pronunciation, leading to a particularly `vocal' approach to the consort\u000a      repertory and a growing refinement in terms of specific instrumentation\u000a      and technique in repertories from different geographical\/cultural centres\u000a      and historical periods.\u000a    The research has followed a number of discrete but inter-related strands:\u000a    1. Development of an instrument collection using historically\u000a          appropriate sources (1994-2002)\u000a      Based on the (very few) surviving instruments, together with evidence\u000a        derived from apposite iconographical sources, makers have been\u000a        commissioned to provide sets of instruments and bows appropriate to\u000a        different periods, cultural centres and repertories. These include\u000a        `Jacobean' (c.1610), `Venetian' (c.1560) and `Costa' (c.1500) viols,\u000a        each with their own distinctive sonorities and response that inform\u000a        performance, articulation, dynamic inflections and pitch levels and\u000a        tuning systems. Research into how makers and players may have conceived\u000a        of the `Elizabethan' viol is now being developed in the continuing\u000a        AHRC-funded project The Making of the Tudor Viol (2009-2014).\u000a      2. Investigation into the relationship between vocal and instrumental\u000a          performance in renaissance music (1994-2008)\u000a      Working with expert singers (e.g. the ensemble Red Byrd, Catherine\u000a        King, Clare Wilkinson), this research has been based on the exploitation\u000a        of evidence for `period pronunciation' and the effect this has on vocal\u000a        production and the transmission and reception of text. Close connections\u000a        have been found between singers' communication of text and the\u000a        techniques of bowing and articulation on `accompanying' viols,\u000a        illuminating the interrelationship between the different performance\u000a        elements. Research has focused on repertory specifically composed for\u000a        voice(s) and viols (consort song, verse anthem), `mixed' repertories\u000a        (madrigals, motets) and the application of `vocal' techniques to purely\u000a        instrumental genres (fantasias, In Nomines).\u000a      3. Re-examination of the connections between native and continental\u000a          repertories in 16th-century English sources and the implications this\u000a          may have for their performance (2002-2013)\u000a      This research has involved source study, the making of editions and the\u000a        application of different performance approaches and instruments (derived\u000a        from 1 and 2 above). For example, the innovative use of `Costa' viols in\u000a        early Tudor repertory (justified by the research published in ref. 6)\u000a        has opened listeners' ears to a previously unheard sound world.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"30509","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The HISSTools Impulse Response Toolbox has helped make high-level\u000a      technology available to\u000a      mid-level practitioners and has become an integral component of the work\u000a      of major international\u000a      companies, organisations and independent research centres involved in the\u000a      creation and\u000a      reproduction of state-of-the-art sound. The flexibility and module design\u000a      of the Toolbox has been\u000a      demonstrated by its uptake in a range of commercial and artistic contexts.\u000a      These range from music\u000a      production for new musical compositions at SudWestDeutscherRundfunk to the\u000a      architectural\u000a      consultants ARUP.\u000a    In 2012 Berlin-based software company Ableton, a world leader in its\u000a      field, approached Harker to\u000a      develop a new convolution reverb device for the Max for Live environment\u000a      to run within the firm's\u000a      flagship Live 9 software, which has an international user base of\u000a      approximately 1.7m. This\u000a      collaboration was initiated on the basis of an early version of the\u000a      HISSTools Impulse Response\u000a      Toolbox that was presented at both the Cycling '74 Expo 2011 (a\u000a      non-academic conference run by\u000a      Cycling '74, the San Francisco company behind MaxMSP) and an event staged\u000a      by NK (an artist-run,\u000a      independent, non-profit organisation) in Berlin in early 2012.\u000a    The resultant commercial devices &#8212; two reverb devices and an impulse\u000a      measurement device &#8212;\u000a      were made available as part of the downloadable Max For Live Essentials\u000a      pack, which can be\u000a      used by any owner of Max for Live (now part of the `Suite' version of Live\u000a      9). The devices are\u000a      dependent on the HISSTools Impulse Response Toolbox for core functionality\u000a      and, due to the co-development\u000a      of these projects, some features beneficial to both the reverb devices and\u000a      the\u000a      extended applications of the software.\u000a    The devices offer an unprecedented level of accessibility for the end\u000a      user to modify and adapt\u000a      them to their needs. Rather than presenting the user with a closed-source\u000a      and fixed software\u000a      package they are open-source and fully customisable devices. The reverb\u000a      devices also offer\u000a      specific novel features that depend on the flexibility and comprehensive\u000a      feature set of the\u000a      HISSTools Impulse Response Toolbox. These include the ability to use\u000a      different sampled spaces\u000a      for the early and late parts of the reverb, offering an enhanced level of\u000a      flexibility in the design of\u000a      virtual spaces, and real-time control over virtual positioning within the\u000a      space. The partitioning of\u000a      impulse responses into early and late parts within the reverb devices is\u000a      also based on analysis,\u000a      rather than determined by fixed time periods as is currently implemented\u000a      by many commercially\u000a      available plug-ins. This more accurately represents the duration and hence\u000a      sound of each part.\u000a    In March 2013, shortly after Live 9 Suite's release, Ableton produced a\u000a      video promoting the\u000a      convolution reverb facility, highlighting the ability to \"use the sound of\u000a      real spaces and tweak them\u000a      as you like\". This was been viewed over 50,000 times on YouTube. Another\u000a      video on the\u000a      company's YouTube channel shows producer and DJ Robert Lippok discussing\u000a      Live 9's new\u000a      features and praising the convolution reverb, observing that users had\u000a      been waiting for just such a\u000a      facility. In addition, a number of third-party online tutorial videos have\u000a      received a total of more than\u000a      7,500 views, while Sound on Sound magazine described the convolution\u000a      reverb as \"the most\u000a      impressive new Max for Live device\".\u000a    In March 2013 a collaborative project was started with boutique guitar\u000a      amp manufacturer\u000a      MATAMP, of Meltham, near Huddersfield. This project focused on developing\u000a      custom measuring\u000a      software based on the HISSTools Impulse Response Toolbox. This allows a\u000a      faster and more\u000a      accurate method of evaluating amplifier and equalisation circuit design\u000a      than was possible using the\u000a      company's previous toolset. Earlier techniques relied on taking a set of\u000a      measurements at fixed\u000a      frequencies for a given system, requiring a lengthy set of manual\u000a      observations to gain only a partial\u000a      impression of the frequency response of a circuit. Using HISSTools allowed\u000a      an almost immediate\u000a      measurement that could monitor a system in close to real-time, making it\u000a      possible to store and\u000a      catalogue accurate sets of measurements for design and product\u000a      specification purposes.\u000a    The SudWestDeutscherRundfunk studio is using the HISSTools IR Toolbox for\u000a      a number of\u000a      productions including major commissions by Dai Fujikura and Daniel Peter\u000a      Biro. The SWR is\u000a      renowned for its work with innovative tools, having developed unique\u000a      resources for composers\u000a      such as Luigi Nono stretching back over forty years. The Artistic Director\u000a      of the studio Detlef\u000a      Heusinger explains that Harker and Tremblay's \"work on convolution and\u000a      especially the non\u000a      commercial availability of the flexible \"HISSTools\" opened up a new step\u000a      in the musical application\u000a      of convolution...The modular construction with the inherent flexibility\u000a      and the multichannel options\u000a      are features making the \"HISSTooIs\" superior to any other commercially\u000a      available convolution\u000a      software.\" [10]\u000a    ARUP (New York), a global firm of consulting engineers, designers and\u000a      planning managers, have\u000a      been using the HISSTools toolbox in the context of their architectural\u000a      acoustics lab. The real time\u000a      convolution objects have been used for a real-time auralization system\u000a      that they have been\u000a      developing for simulating live room responses for musicians and speakers\u000a      so that clients can hear\u000a      what a concert hall (or other such space) will sound like prior to\u000a      construction. More recently they\u000a      have been looking into using these objects in the context of room\u000a      equalization.

NoTAM evaluated a number\u000a      of potential\u000a      approaches before selecting HISSTools on the strength of its modularity\u000a      and its suitability for easily\u000a      capturing and post-processing multi-channel impulse resposnses. NoTAM's\u000a      work is recognised as\u000a      of the highest quality, as illustrated, for example, by the award of a\u000a      Spellemann Prize &#8212; Norway's\u000a      Grammy equivalent &#8212; to H&#229;kon Thelin's album Light, which was\u000a      recorded, mixed and mastered by\u000a      NoTAM sound engineer Cato Langnes. The artistic director of NoTAM Notto\u000a      Theile writes: \"Not\u000a      only does the tool kit offer the possibility of capturing a large amount\u000a      of channels; it can be done\u000a      quickly and the results could be checked while in the venue. This is\u000a      extremely important in order to\u000a      attain an efficient workflow when embarking on capturing lRs from the\u000a      large amount of spaces we\u000a      are planning to.

One\u000a      significant appeal of the technology is that it allows the reverberant\u000a      behaviour unique to a certain\u000a      acoustic space &#8212; for example, a room, a recording booth or a concert hall\u000a      &#8212; to be captured and\u000a      recreated. It can also be used to apply filters and in other more creative\u000a      applications for sound\u000a      design. The original convolution reverbs were hardware boxes that, because\u000a      of their expense,\u000a      were confined almost exclusively to studios. The technology is now\u000a      commonly available as\u000a      affordable computer software, but technical limitations have constrained\u000a      utility.\u000a    Work in this field by the University of Huddersfield's Department of\u000a      Music can be traced back to\u000a      2008, when Dr. Pierre Alexandre Tremblay (Senior Lecturer, 2005-2010;\u000a      Reader in Composition,\u000a      2010-2013; Professor, 2013-present) began the research project Thinking\u000a      Inside the Box (TITB),\u000a      which aimed to improve compositional judgment in mixed music by allowing a\u000a      composer to\u000a      emulate the sound of a concert hall in a studio. Tremblay took a number of\u000a      impulse responses for\u000a      various combinations of loudspeaker types and speaker\/listening positions\u000a      to generate highly\u000a      realistic emulations of a concert space using convolution. The project\u000a      investigated how this\u000a      process might allow composers to better judge their work in relation to\u000a      the final concert\u000a      presentation and to actively reflect on suitable loudspeaker choices and\u000a      placement. This is further\u000a      explained in reference output [1] and is part of the compositional process\u000a      for output [5].\u000a    It was the exploration of the complementary approach to TITB that\u000a      provided the initial impetus for\u000a      the HISSTools Impulse Response Toolbox (HISS = Huddersfield Immersive\u000a      Sound System).\u000a    In 2011 Dr. Alex Harker (Research Fellow, 2011-2012; Lecturer,\u000a      2012-present) joined Huddersfield\u000a      to work on the HISSTools project and released a package of 82 externals\u000a      for the digital music\u000a      software system MaxMSP. These addressed a range of creative and technical\u000a      problems in a\u000a      modular fashion. Several of Harker's externals were based on innovative\u000a      spectral processing\u000a      techniques, including convolution. Rather than limiting the use of\u000a      convolution techniques to\u000a      emulating reverb, Harker's approach allows a more open set of\u000a      applications.\u000a    With the HISSTools, Tremblay and Harker set about achieving results\u000a      closer to the sound of a\u000a      studio within a concert hall environment. This involved measuring and\u000a      inverting the\u000a      room\/loudspeaker impulse response to correct the frequency response to\u000a      more closely match the\u000a      studio listening environment. A similar approach was required to improve\u000a      the sound quality of the\u000a      close-proximity microphone positions most suitable for live use. Rather\u000a      than a purely technical\u000a      improvement, one of the key aims of the research methodology was to have a\u000a      demonstrative\u000a      impact on the effective translation of musical ideas from the studio to\u000a      the concert hall.\u000a    Providing a single tool for these kinds of inversion\/correction problems\u000a      was not felt to be the most\u000a      beneficial output format for the project, as the sub-problems inherent in\u000a      the task are relevant to a\u000a      range of potential applications of much larger scope, both creative and\u000a      pragmatic. The notion of a\u000a      modular and reusable `toolbox' was therefore conceived, opening up the\u000a      toolbox to a much wider\u000a      set of creative and technical applications.\u000a    The resulting software offers well-encapsulated objects (or modules),\u000a      each dealing with a specific\u000a      convolution-related task or problem as explained and disseminated in\u000a      output [3]. Many are relevant\u000a      to speaker\/mic\/room correction, while others have more general\u000a      applications. The toolbox brings\u000a      together a core set of pre-existing algorithms in a single package that\u000a      has been practically\u000a      evaluated for musical use. It is the modularity and flexibility of the\u000a      toolbox that has allowed for its\u000a      deployment in a range of musical applications and allows users to tailor\u000a      solutions to context-specific\u000a      needs.\u000a    The research process also brought about innovative approaches through the\u000a      novel combination of\u000a      algorithms. For example, the standard method of retrieving an impulse\u000a      response from a recorded\u000a      swept sine signal (typically the ESS or exponentially swept sine) involves\u000a      convolving the result with\u000a      an analytic inverse sine sweep, in order to achieve the necessary\u000a      deconvolution. Due to the\u000a      bandlimited nature of the sweep signals, the result of this process is\u000a      implicitly filtered by a linear\u000a      phase bandpass filter, with equal temporal distribution of filter ring\u000a      (both pre and post ringing). In\u000a      the HIRT the deconvolution is carried out in the frequency domain using a\u000a      large FFT, allowing a\u000a      refactorisation of the equation that gives control over the phase of the\u000a      implicit filter. Thus, by using\u000a      a minimum (or almost minimum) phase filter, the sharpness of measured\u000a      impulse responses can\u000a      be maintained, and important frequency domain information retained when\u000a      the beginning of the\u000a      impulse is trimmed. Tremblay used the software as a testing ground for his\u000a      own compositions\u000a      throughout the course of his research (see reference output [6]).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"30510","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of Lim's research falls into three areas: (1) significant\u000a      take-up of her compositional work in the classical music industry; (2)\u000a      shifts in cultural policy in the German centre of Cologne, leading to\u000a      greater opportunities for participation in the arts by youth and artists\u000a      from disadvantaged ethnic groups; and (3) enrichment of Australian music\u000a      education provision through understanding of ethical frameworks in\u000a      Indigenous intercultural exchange.\u000a\u0009Cultural impact and international reach\u000a    A number of high-calibre organisations have commissioned, produced,\u000a      performed and documented Lim's compositional work since 2008.

General Secretary of the institution says: `Liza Lim has\u000a      brought a broad range of perspectives from her Asian and Australian\u000a      heritage and intercultural research which have contributed to the policy\u000a      directions of the institution resulting in positive impact in the\u000a      establishment of the international fellowship programme, the Youth academy\u000a      (involving 11 young Cologne artists from diverse cultural communities) and\u000a      the `open-call' project by which new opportunities have been established\u000a      for communities of artists who have not traditionally had access to such\u000a      funding. The Akademie receives ca. &#8364;1million euros annual funding of which\u000a      more than half is devoted directly to project activities and support of\u000a      artists'. [3] Extensive media coverage of the official opening included\u000a      praise in Deutsche Welle for Lim's curatorial work: \"The\u000a      Australian-born composer was concerned... to find music that emphasises\u000a      unity &#8212; music that says this cultural aspect is not only the foreign, the\u000a      other, but also something that belongs to us. Musically at any rate, the\u000a      Akademie has succeeded in bridging the gap.\" [4] Lim's specific\u000a      contribution to the Akademie's framework policy discussion on\u000a      transcultural exchange and Indigenous culture has led to wider\u000a      participation from cultural\/demographic groups that have typically not\u000a      accessed funding from grant bodies in Cologne and Germany's North-Rhine-Westphalia\u000a\u0009  region (population: 18m). Her curatorial work has\u000a      directly brokered new partnerships between international and local artists\u000a      and arts organisations in Cologne.\u000a    Benefit to Australian cultural practice and secondary education\u000a    Lim's work has contributed to shifting attitudes to Indigenous culture in\u000a      Australia. Writing in 2012, Dr Timothy McKenry, a music researcher at\u000a      Australian Catholic University, described her as \"one of the first music\u000a      practitioners to set out what can be described as an ethical framework to\u000a      govern the interaction between Indigenous and non-Indigenous music and\u000a      musicians\". [5] Contemporary music writer Tim Rutherford Johnson, writing\u000a      in Tempo in 2011, commented: \"In enacting an understanding,\u000a      expression and critique of global multi-cultural reality, this music\u000a      reveals something of value to us all.\" [6]\u000a    This framework, which posits the need for collaboration as the basis for\u000a      intercultural exchange, is at the heart of a resource kit, The Music of\u000a      Liza Lim (Australian Music Centre, 2012), created for use within the music\u000a      curriculum in Australia (upper secondary to A-levels). [7] The kit focuses\u000a      on the work related to Australian Aboriginal culture, comprising\u000a      background cultural information, score excerpts, audio and video\u000a      materials, analyses and related composition exercises. The resource was\u000a      used in the teaching of the Higher School Certificate\/Victorian\u000a      Certificate of Education curriculum in New South Wales and Victoria in\u000a      2012 and 2013, reaching 47% of A-level music students in New South Wales\u000a      and 27% in Victoria (20% of the AMC's national school network overall).\u000a      Kim Waldock, co-author of the Australian national curriculum implemented\u000a      in 2013, said: \"It is important to be able to provide students with an\u000a      understanding of the music of their time. Liza Lim's music reflects not\u000a      only her cultural and Australian roots but an understanding of how one's\u000a      environment and life experiences will feed richly into the composition\u000a      process, no matter who you are and what you do.\" [7]\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    University of Huddersfield research into intercultural exchange and\u000a      cultural constructions of identity has led to technical innovations in\u000a      composition and performance, giving vibrancy to work that has been taken\u000a      up by some of the world's pre-eminent orchestras and soloists and so\u000a      reaching a broad international audience.

Lim's\u000a      publications since her move to Huddersfield's department of music in 2008\u000a      - including orchestral works, an opera and a song cycle &#8212; are part of her\u000a      ongoing cross-cultural research, which began in the late 1990s and is to\u000a      some extent a critique of enduring post-colonial attitudes in relation to\u000a      issues of intellectual property rights and cultural exchange. Lim's\u000a      research is underpinned by her work published together with scholars of\u000a      ecological musicology, allowing her to bring a nuanced approach to\u000a      collaborations with a wide range of institutional partners.\u000a    The research has been pursued within the context of four large-scale\u000a      projects (2008-2012).\u000a    \u000a      Themes of embodiment, identity and transformation were explored in\u000a        Lim's opera project, The Navigator. A grant of AUD$600,000 was\u000a        awarded by the Major Festivals Initiative\/Australia Council, enabling\u000a        the commission, creative development and production of the opera in 2008\u000a        and 2009 (Brisbane, Melbourne, Berlin, Moscow, Paris). Lim collaborated\u000a        closely with the ELISION Ensemble, Australia's foremost international\u000a        contemporary music ensemble, bringing together performance practices\u000a        from several cultural traditions to investigate multiplicity and\u000a        complexity in sonic behaviour allied to explorations of narrative\u000a        slippage on the larger operatic canvas.\u000a      Lim's research into aesthetic prioritisations in Aboriginal art and\u000a        ritual, particularly the centrality of `shimmer' and structures of\u000a        hiddenness\/revelation in a knowledge economy, was carried out with the\u000a        support of a grant from the Ian Potter Cultural Trust (AUD$80,000,\u000a        2008-2009). This work involved ethnographic studies of cultural models\u000a        and ritual forms in Bardi and Yolgnu Aboriginal culture, leading to new\u000a        insights into the ethical dimension of cross-cultural collaboration as\u000a        well as into the formal and aesthetic organisation of sound.\u000a      Intercultural research was also at the centre of Tongue of the\u000a          Invisible (2011), a work commissioned by the Holland Festival for\u000a        jazz pianist Uri Caine and German ensemble musikFabrik. The piece made\u000a        innovative use of improvisational strategies modelled on Sufi poetics.\u000a        The composition was a case study for an AHRC Centre for Musical\u000a        Performance as Creative Practice project on `distributed creativity'.\u000a        Lim's related article in Music &amp; Letters (2013) discussed\u000a        participatory structures and reflected on relations of social and\u000a        political power in the creative decision-making process between composer\u000a        and performers. Drawing on the work of cultural anthropologist Professor\u000a        Tim Ingold, Lim also formulated a new model for thinking about the\u000a        collaborative process.\u000a      The composition The Guest (2010) was part of an ongoing\u000a        exploration of Sufi poetics (see above), as well as a wider project\u000a        investigating ideas of presence, mimesis and embodiment. Lim\u000a        collaborated with recorder player Jeremias Schwarzer to work with a\u000a        number of late-Renaissance and Baroque instruments and drew upon\u000a        elements of their performance practice to propose ways in which these\u000a        early instruments could interact musically\/socially\/politically with the\u000a        more `powerful' instruments of the orchestra. Together with Pearl,\u000a          Ochre, Hair String (2010), the compositions represent a\u000a        substantial engagement with the orchestral medium as a\u000a        musical\/socio-cultural framework for investigating intercultural issues.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"31111","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3923057","Name":"Bolivia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Fern&#225;ndez's solo-authored Misa de Corpus Christi achieved its\u000a      greatest impact via the\u000a      collaborative venture with the Instituto Laredo in Bolivia. As the focal\u000a      point of a major music-\u000a      educational project developing instrumental, vocal, choral and orchestral\u000a      practice, the composition\u000a      has had a direct influence on the personal and professional development of\u000a      220 students and\u000a      teachers from the school. Performances of the piece to several capacity\u000a      audiences in large\u000a      (1000+) venues were received with enthusiasm and acclaim.\u000a    Impact in the rehearsal process\u000a    The new Misa occupied two large choirs and a large orchestra for\u000a      the best part of four months in\u000a      2010. This was the predominant experience throughout the Instituto Laredo\u000a      during this time, as the\u000a      reach of the project extended deeply (and with growing intensity) into the\u000a      daily practice of students\u000a      and teachers there. The performers involved were challenged; some of the\u000a      young players had to\u000a      acquire skills they had not possessed before. Before rehearsals began, the\u000a      orchestral parts of\u000a      Misa were used as texts for instrumental lessons. Weekly choir\u000a      sessions also focused on Misa\u000a      during this period, and the sessions grew in frequency to three times a\u000a      week in the last month, and\u000a      daily in the last week. Melodies from Misa could be heard being\u000a      practised, hummed and whistled\u000a      across the school during this period (IMP1, IMP2, IMP6) &#8212; which\u000a      was symptomatic of the impact\u000a      the work had on the personal and professional development of the young\u000a      musicians. The director\u000a      of the children's choir recalls: `When they succeeded in understanding it,\u000a      the attachment, the love,\u000a      the devotion they felt would lead the children to sing it in the school\u000a      corridors; they wouldn't sing\u000a      their songs from the top ten or from Facebook; they would sing\u000a      their sections from Misa. Wherever\u000a      they were, they would lie down, or sit down; it was one continuous Misa\u000a      (IMP1).\u000a    As a direct result of the rehearsal process, singers experienced\u000a      improvements in their vocal\u000a      technique, young string players who had not played in higher positions\u000a      before learned them; brass\u000a      players extended their range; and percussionists learned new instruments (IMP6).\u000a    A benefit to personal and professional development was also experienced\u000a      by both students and\u000a      teachers as a direct result of engaging with this research output. As one\u000a      student states: `I learned a\u000a      lot about working on detail in a score ... to listen to the orchestra and\u000a      choir for better link-up ... I\u000a      learned ... discipline, responsibility, technical work, demanding more of\u000a      myself' (student, Y5\u000a      secondary) (IMP6). The choral director of the youth choir also\u000a      outlines how \"Prof. Fern&#225;ndez and\u000a      his music inspired an entire generation of teachers, students and other\u000a      professionals in the music\u000a      field. For me it was an experience that changed the course of my\u000a      professional life in many ways.\u000a      To begin with, it enticed me to enthusiastically seek a Master's degree...\u000a      One of my projects is a\u000a      presentation of a paper about Agust&#237;n Fern&#225;ndez's \"Misa de Corpus\u000a      Christi.\" It symbolizes the\u000a      progress my city and country has made in the last decade\" (IMP3).\u000a    There were also benefits on the wider school community. The Rector of\u000a      Instituto Laredo attests:\u000a      `[The Misa project] gave rise to a series of very special\u000a      phenomena. These phenomena\u000a      accelerated the internal dynamic in the institution and among the people,\u000a      and were of great\u000a      usefulness for the development of team relations, as well as academic and\u000a      technical; trust, love of\u000a      collective and mutual work, development of personal confidence. Although\u000a      students pass through\u000a      and the student body constantly renews itself, there remains in the memory\u000a      of the teachers and in\u000a      the collective memory of the community and of the institution ... a symbol\u000a      of what we can do when\u000a      we pursue things for their own goodness.' (IMP2). The community\u000a      that supports Laredo -\u000a      logistically, morally and as concert audiences &#8212; gained in cohesion (IMP2).\u000a      Even non-participating\u000a      students were inspired; as one such student reports, `that year was the\u000a      best .... Still now I\u000a      remember the words, the melody, the entry of the voices, the entries of\u000a      some instruments, and\u000a      even though I wasn't in the orchestra or the choir I knew everyone's\u000a      parts. My favourite was Agnus\u000a      Dei; pity I wasn't singing, but all the same I repeated everything and it\u000a      was exciting each time it\u000a      started again. Three years have gone by and I still love this whole thing'\u000a      (student, now 5th Year\u000a      secondary) (IMP6). And another student states: `At playtime you\u000a      could hear people singing bits of\u000a      Misa .... [Three years on] when we at school start remembering\u000a      various moments, it always gets in\u000a      that we sang in Misa de Corpus Christi. I don't think this\u000a      experience will be forgotten for a long\u000a      time, since even on the streets you hear people talk about Misa'\u000a      (student, now 5th year secondary)\u000a      (IMP6).\u000a    Impact of the performance\u000a    Total audiences of c. 3,400 people attended six performances of Misa\u000a      in 2010 and 2011. The\u000a      premi&#232;re, conducted by Fern&#225;ndez, was held at El Campo [conference hall].\u000a      People queued for\u000a      hours to gain admission, and the normal seating of 800 had to be increased\u000a      to 1000. Further\u000a      performances were conducted by Augusto Guzm&#225;n. For the second performance,\u000a      on a Sunday\u000a      morning in the historic village of Tarata, traffic came to a standstill\u000a      beforehand and afterwards, the\u000a      local restaurants ran out of food, and the church had large numbers of\u000a      people standing in the\u000a      corridors (IMP2). For the third performance at Cochabamba\u000a      Cathedral, the presence of people\u000a      standing in the wings and central corridor suggest an attendance of c.\u000a      1,700. Footage of the\u000a      performances shows a high level of audience engagement, with queues\u000a      forming to greet the\u000a      performers, as shown in a documentary specially made about the event by a\u000a      local production\u000a      company, Terranova Audiovisual (IMP7). As one student remembers,\u000a      `People who were total\u000a      strangers to us all rose to their feet to applaud us and idolised us' (IMP6).\u000a      Building on the success\u000a      of these earlier performances, Misa went on tour in 2011 leading\u000a      to performances at three\u000a      additional venues in La Paz and Cochabamba, promoted by Cochabamba's\u000a      Philharmonic Society.\u000a    Instituto Laredo as a whole benefited from a sea-change in the quality of\u000a      interpersonal relations.\u000a      As one students recalls, `[it] created ties between us all ... we became\u000a      more than friends ... you\u000a      could say we considered ourselves as each other's brother or sister' (IMP6).\u000a      See also Rector's\u000a      statement quoted above (IMP2). The benefit to collegiality is\u000a      perceived by many to be matched by\u000a      a noticeable contribution to the development of musicianship and music\u000a      appreciation: `Now, my\u000a      thinking about music is that no matter how complicated or \"senseless\" a\u000a      work might seem to us,\u000a      once you let yourself be enveloped by it it's the most beautiful thing,\u000a      and it is accepted by others\u000a      when you show this' (student, now 5th year secondary) (IMP6).\u000a    Misa also affected a wider network of around 2,000 parents,\u000a      friends, supporters and alumni\u000a      (IMP9), and it had a recognised impact on the community: `[Misa]\u000a      led people to rethink the\u000a      participation we allow art music [to have] in our lives .... Suddenly,\u000a      this art music no longer is the\u000a      exclusive heirloom of the Bolivian elites; we cast off the idea that it is\u000a      boring or incomprehensible\u000a      or inaccessible; it becomes democratised in the act of putting itself\u000a      within reach of everyone ... I\u000a      have not the slightest doubt that Misa de Corpus Christi\u000a      contributed to the formation of the\u000a      aesthetic sensibility of our society and to social harmony' (Paula Mu&#241;oz,\u000a      then Culture Editor of\u000a      national broadsheet Los Tiempos) (IMP4).\u000a    Press coverage was unusually generous before and after the event. The\u000a      national broadsheet Los\u000a        Tiempos put up an audio-visual clip of the premi&#232;re in its online\u000a      edition; while the print edition\u000a      contained a large photograph of the performers (front page) and a review\u000a      article, `Fern&#225;ndez\u000a      Surprises and Conducts his Own Mass'. The review stated: `A journey, the\u000a      journey, life in three\u000a      beats, dreams, solitudes, nostalgias and hopes, every feeling, sigh, moist\u000a      eyes and explosion of\u000a      applause. Such is the summary of the experience of an audience on its\u000a      feet, smiling and euphoric,\u000a      which last night shook the hall of Conventions Centre El Campo at the\u000a      performance of the\u000a      composition Misa de Corpus Christi by Bolivian composer Agust&#237;n Fern&#225;ndez.\u000a      With this work\u000a      Instituto Laredo celebrated 50 years of music, voice and spirit alongside\u000a      a humanistic education'\u000a      (IMP8). An article in Los Tiempos's supplement states:\u000a      `Agust&#237;n Fern&#225;ndez, one of Cochabamba's\u000a      prodigal sons, has been able to construct a space of his own outside the\u000a      trends of classical or\u000a      contemporary music. In his works he integrates diverse instruments and\u000a      sounds, many of them\u000a      Bolivian, from a universal perspective. His music is of a great\u000a      versatility.

At that\u000a      time, requests to mount the work in Cochabamba, then Bolivia's second\u000a      largest city, went\u000a      unfulfilled, as the city lacked the infrastructure to put on a concert of\u000a      this magnitude. Some of the\u000a      children who performed in the 1978 concert are now professionals, with\u000a      some in positions of\u000a      leadership; their generation has effected a shift where levels of\u000a      orchestral and choral activity in\u000a      Cochabamba are now comparable to those of La Paz. In 2010 a group from\u000a      Cochabamba's\u000a      Instituto Laredo (a specialist music school), headed by leading conductor\u000a      Augusto Guzm&#225;n,\u000a      approached Fern&#225;ndez to request a performance of Misa. The\u000a      performance was to showcase the\u000a      new musical status of Cochabamba and was to be part of the\u000a      fiftieth-anniversary celebrations of\u000a      the school. However, the score from the original composition, deemed by\u000a      Fern&#225;ndez to be\u000a      immature, was destroyed by him in the 1990s. The offer of an alternative\u000a      composition was\u000a      rejected, as the group wanted to revive the work they had performed as\u000a      children, which, they\u000a      claimed, had been a factor in their career choice as musicians. These\u000a      requests caused Fern&#225;ndez\u000a      to reassess the significance of his earlier work, and he made the decision\u000a      to compose Misa again.\u000a      The process of negotiation that led to this decision promoted a sense of\u000a      collegial ownership of the\u000a      work at Laredo, even before the onset of the 2010 performance project; as\u000a      expressed by the\u000a      director of the children's choir: `The years went by, and this beautiful\u000a      work went to sleep. It went to\u000a      sleep until we gathered the courage to awaken it, for the fiftieth\u000a      anniversary of the Instituto' (IMP1).\u000a    Underpinning Research\u000a    The 2010 version of Misa is a new rendering of the 1978\u000a      composition, with important differences.\u000a      The new composition had to be considered in the light of all that had\u000a      occurred since the original\u000a      was written. While preserving the spirit of the 1978 composition, the new\u000a      one resolves the latter's\u000a      imperfections through greater technical competence, and addresses the old\u000a      research question in a\u000a      new context (see next paragraph), making it a richer work that is much\u000a      more complex and allusive.\u000a    Fern&#225;ndez was intrigued to explore how the materials he had handled in\u000a      1977-8 would mix in the\u000a      new piece being composed in 2010. Part of this involved retesting the\u000a      assumption that Andean\u000a      folk-rooted materials could coexist with post-romantic influences to\u000a      produce an integrated whole.\u000a      The core issue is the viability of Bolivian music &#8212; which for most of the\u000a      twentieth century had been\u000a      consensually defined as folk music &#8212; on the concert platform in a\u000a      universal `classical' context. By\u000a      adopting the trappings of ambitious European compositions &#8212; e.g.\u000a      orchestra, choirs, large-scale\u000a      format and structures, and extensive contrapuntal treatment of material &#8212;\u000a      Misa invites scrutiny as a\u000a      classical work. By staying close to folk roots in rhythm, melody and some\u000a      of the approaches to\u000a      orchestration, it breaks some important assumptions in both genres, and\u000a      posits a syncretism that\u000a      in other parts of the world (e.g. Eastern Europe) had been tested decades\u000a      before, but in Andean\u000a      America was new. In a current national context of social turmoil in\u000a      Bolivia, characterised by\u000a      hegemonic ideas of nationhood along racial lines, it was important to make\u000a      a statement reminding\u000a      the nation of its mixed cultural heritage and interdependence. An\u000a      international context where the\u000a      development of parallel strands of postmodernity &#8212; some of which vindicate\u000a      local ethnicity\u000a      (Volans), while others reassess romantic legacies (Adams), and yet others\u000a      revisit a heritage of\u000a      modal liturgies (P&#228;rt, Taverner) &#8212; seemed to provide a fresh context where\u000a      Misa could make a\u000a      meaningful utterance.\u000a    As well as providing Instituto Laredo with an emblematic work written by\u000a      an alumnus to showcase\u000a      its musical achievement in its interface to the world, Misa was\u000a      also to serve as an educational tool\u000a      in instrumental, vocal, choral and orchestral practice. This required\u000a      Fern&#225;ndez to write the new\u000a      piece in a way that would be accessible for young non-professionals. It\u000a      was through the process of\u000a      rehearsal and performance that much of the impact was achieved. The new\u000a      premi&#232;re included\u000a      choristers who had been in the 1978 children's choir, as well as children\u000a      from Instituto Laredo.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"31760","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"2542007","Name":"Morocco"},{"GeoNamesId":"248816","Name":"Jordan"},{"GeoNamesId":"3895114","Name":"Chile"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact from this research can be considered in three ways:\u000d\u000a    1).

This event allowed for a knowledge exchange on translating\u000d\u000a        cultures between international seminar participants from the theatre\u000d\u000a        industry. Thus it demonstrated how HEIs can successfully bridge a gap\u000d\u000a        between theatres and practitioners in the exchange of working\u000d\u000a        methodologies and their efficacy. The Royal Court Theatre highlighted\u000d\u000a        the benefit of this event for its own external engagement with\u000d\u000a        translators and for developing a discourse into translation practice.\u000d\u000a        The brokering of new relationships demonstrates the critical role\u000d\u000a        universities can have in providing a forum for collaborations which may\u000d\u000a        endure beyond the scope of the project itself. Since the publication of\u000d\u000a        the Interim Report, the British Council in Chile and S&#227;o Paulo has used\u000d\u000a        its findings to reflect on the curation and development of arts\u000d\u000a        activities outside the UK.\u000d\u000a      Meetings with cultural agencies, practitioners and scholars in Morocco\u000d\u000a        (Le Centre International des Etudes de Spectacle), Brazil (the British\u000d\u000a        Council) and Chile (the British Council), led to further engagement with\u000d\u000a        local playwrights and dramaturgs. The work here was particularly useful\u000d\u000a        in delineating the role of theatre and new writing to capture political\u000d\u000a        events (such as the Arab Spring) and how such work becomes mediated\u000d\u000a        across cultures and languages.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    2).

In particular, the parallel\u000d\u000a      practical work of O'Thomas as a translator\/adapter of new\u000d\u000a      Portuguese language playwriting offers a platform for the development of\u000d\u000a      new international plays; and the work of Jordan as director of the\u000d\u000a      new plays of Carl Djerassi offers an important body of work in\u000d\u000a      professional, public production.\u000d\u000a    Meanwhile, a number of scholars within our research area have focused\u000d\u000a      their archival and critical research into specific playwrights, thus\u000d\u000a      broadening the focus of the research. Amongst these, Adiseshiah\u000d\u000a      (submitting as part of UoA29) has published widely on Caryl Churchill and\u000d\u000a      has organised three symposia on Caryl Churchill (2011), Sarah Kane (2012)\u000d\u000a      and Mark Ravenhill (2013). These symposia have taken place within the\u000d\u000a      context of week-long festivals devoted to the work of each playwright,\u000d\u000a      with performances for general public and school-student audiences and\u000d\u000a      post-show discussions involving the local community.\u000d\u000a    In order to complement and consolidate this thematic area of research,\u000d\u000a      key researchers have been recruited to the school whose work elsewhere has\u000d\u000a      contributed to the understanding of contemporary British playwriting. In\u000d\u000a      particular, Bull's work over several decades has tracked the\u000d\u000a      developing dynamic of British playwriting, and his scholarship continues\u000d\u000a      to document and archive new writing; thus it provides long-term historical\u000d\u000a      context for our contemporary investigations.

More\u000d\u000a      recently, her focus on the work of Simon Stephens both in Britain and\u000d\u000a      Germany, has contributed a significant body of knowledge to the academy.\u000d\u000a      This includes a critical preface to his play, Three Kingdoms\u000d\u000a      (Methuen, 2012), an extended critical guide to Pornography\u000d\u000a      (Methuen `Student Editions', 2014), an introduction to Blindsided\u000d\u000a      (Methuen, 2014) and a public platform session interviewing the playwright\u000d\u000a      in 2013.\u000d\u000a    Key findings that inform the stated impact:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      That the Royal Court's international strategies have influenced and\u000d\u000a        enabled diverse theatrical cultures both in the UK and abroad;\u000d\u000a      That an export economy of the arts influences writing for the stage in\u000d\u000a        the UK as well as internationally;\u000d\u000a      That workshop methodologies using translation for both delivery and\u000d\u000a        dialogue can enable `cultural' translation of texts;\u000d\u000a      Discrete knowledge and dissemination of practical methodologies,\u000d\u000a        especially in translation and adaptation;\u000d\u000a      Discrete subject expertise into specific playwrights and their work.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"31761","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    1a) The HMP Drake Hall project (Walsh: February &#8212; August\u000a      2012), in collaboration with the charity Women in Prison, the Arts\u000a      Alliance and Clean Break Theatre Company, involved practical theatre\u000a      workshops with women at HMP Drake Hall in Staffordshire. The project\u000a      engaged a core performance group of 15 prisoners, developed a research\u000a      focus group of 10 further prisoners, and had an audience of 45 prisoners\u000a      and staff. Coverage targeted the UK female prison population through Women\u000a      in Prison's Ready Steady Go magazine, enabling a `remote' creative\u000a      process to all women's prisons in the UK of up to 8,000 readers. The\u000a      process was discussed in an issue of Total Theatre Magazine and\u000a      was the subject of two prize-winning academic essays (Walsh 2012; Walsh\u000a      2013).\u000a    1c) The LOV project (Morrow) has had significant impact on\u000a      arts provision for young people in Lincolnshire: 854 young people have\u000a      been involved as audience members, 637 as workshop participants, 112 as\u000a      artists and performers and 137 as decision makers. Forty new artist\u000a      commissions are in place, 23 new events for young people have been\u000a      organized, 4 ongoing regional\/national partnerships forged, 7 regular\u000a      groups established as commissioning artists and 3 new jobs created. An\u000a      evaluation of the Lincolnshire One Venue `X-Change' programme is being led\u000a      by the School of Sport and Exercise Science in the University. The Paul\u000a      Hamlyn Foundation has recognised this as a benchmark project for future\u000a      similar initiatives around the country, and is rolling out similar schemes\u000a      in rural areas nationwide.\u000a    2a) The Hepatitis C Interactive Theatre process (Walsh:\u000a      January &#8212; April, 2013), in collaboration with United Lincolnshire\u000a      Hospitals, culminated in a performance to over 50 sector professionals and\u000a      users.

Following the project, Hoxton Hall (lead\u000a      partner) attracted significant Heritage Lottery funding for related\u000a      projects, and has since received &#163;3 million capital funding, partly to\u000a      develop an archive of its cultural role for and with the community.\u000a    3b) Dambusters 70 (Lawrence: March-May 2013) was\u000a      performed at RAF Scampton on 16 May 2013 as part of the national\u000a      commemoration. Revisiting personal experience through performance impacted\u000a      participants (performers), observers (audiences) and communities (local,\u000a      regional, national), and dissemination allowed this impact to be part of a\u000a      national memorialisation of historic achievements. It played to an\u000a      audience of 500 and was adapted for BBC Radio Lincolnshire audience of\u000a      30,000 listeners. BBC North also tracked the process, reaching a TV\u000a      audience of 100,000. The work was seen as audience building for both Radio\u000a      Lincolnshire and BBC North and offered positive publicity for the RAF. Its\u000a      impact on enhancing the cultural capital of listeners is evidenced by\u000a      ongoing\/repeat commissions from the BBC.\u000a    3c) STORM (Lawrence, O'Thomas: May 2011 -\u000a      April 2012) provided an effective template for collaborating with\u000a      multi-language partners, offering audiences a new performance methodology\u000a      and an awareness of how performance can reflect cultural dialogue.

Projects worked with:\u000a    \u000a      female prisoners (HMP Drake Hall: Walsh);\u000a      social service users and providers (Lincolnshire Social Services: O'Thomas\/Gaughan);\u000a      elderly nursing home residents (Lace Housing: Lawrence; Artist\u000a        in Residence: Bowtell);\u000a      sufferers of chronic illness, their nursing providers and families\u000a        (Hepatitis C: Walsh);\u000a      military personnel living with local Lincolnshire communities\u000a        (Dambusters 70: Lawrence);\u000a      diverse ethnic and cultural youth communities in London (It Happened\u000a        Here: Lawrence);\u000a      cross-cultural communities in the UK and Europe (STORM: O'Thomas,\u000a        Lawrence);\u000a      youth communities as cultural participants and producers (LOV Venues:\u000a        Morrow).\u000a    \u000a    The underpinning research considered three principal areas:\u000a    &#8226; 1) The degree to which marginalised and dispossessed communities can be\u000a      empowered through performance (HMP Drake Hall; Artist in Residence; LOV\u000a      Venues);\u000a    &#8226; 2) The ways in which practical experiential performance can facilitate\u000a      healthcare and training in the hospital and social services sectors\u000a      (Hepatitis C; Lincolnshire Social Services; Lace Housing; Artist in\u000a      Residence);\u000a    &#8226; 3) The degree to which site-specific performance can work as a tool for\u000a      community dialogue and memory (It Happened here, STORM, Dambusters 70).\u000a    1a) Research by Walsh (HMP Drake Hall) centred on the experiences\u000a      of women prisoners, considering how incarcerated individuals might\u000a      transcend the reduced horizons of the prison environment through the\u000a      embodied voice of performance. It developed through radical performance\u000a      pedagogies and feminist approaches to inclusive methodologies. Whilst\u000a      necessarily small in scope (for security reasons), the research explored\u000a      how performance tactics can be adopted as `resistance' or `compliance'.\u000a      This dovetails with Walsh's wider exploration of how Greek\u000a      protestors have performed their circumstances throughout the recent crisis\u000a      with similar strategies of resistance.\u000a    1b) Meanwhile, a different community of marginalised participants has\u000a      been the focus of research by Bowtell (The Artist in Residence),\u000a      funded by the Centre for Educational Research and Development with support\u000a      from East Lindsey District Council, into how diverse dance techniques can\u000a      be used by elderly participants to enable an embodied sense of self and an\u000a      ownership of their identity. The project led to further initiatives, `The\u000a      Companions of Skegness' and `Full Bloom', which continue to work with this\u000a      community.\u000a    1c) The collaboration of the LOV Venues (Morrow) has\u000a      empowered youth audiences to become producers, engaging proactively with\u000a      cultural provision throughout Lincolnshire in a project set to expand\u000a      nationwide. Work in this area has benefitted from collaboration with\u000a      social scientists within the University (School of Sport and Exercise\u000a      Science) to evaluate and process data related to the project.\u000a    2a) The Hepatitis C Interactive Theatre process (Walsh)\u000a      collaborated with healthcare professionals and service users in a verbatim\u000a      theatre exploration of issues affecting Hepatitis C carriers, their\u000a      families and partners. This built on practical work, such as Mark Storor's\u000a      For the Best, exploring the dynamics of participation and\u000a      performance in the understanding and treatment of chronic health\u000a      conditions by patients, healthcare providers and families. It has been\u000a      shortlisted for a prestigious national award for raising awareness about\u000a      Hepatitis C.\u000a    2b) This also intersected with a separate project (Lincolnshire Social\u000a        Services) in which researchers O'Thomas and Gaughan\u000a      worked with social services providers to design and establish a training\u000a      house for the delivery of training through role play. Rigged with cameras\u000a      and audio equipment, the house offers a simulated environment in which\u000a      child protection trainees can engage with actors performing as social\u000a      service users; footage of their handling of user characters can then be\u000a      fed back and discussed in the classroom environment.\u000a    2c) Lace Housing (Lawrence) involved student\u000a      producers in a two month interactive performance process in a Lincoln\u000a      nursing home. In dialogue with elderly service users with Alzheimer's, the\u000a      process explored memories of travel, friendship and time. Benefits\u000a      included increased self-esteem through physical embodiment of experience\u000a      (service users), exposure to a methodology for exercising and performing\u000a      memory (carers), and experience of professional practice (student\u000a      producers as Dramatherapists).\u000a    3a) It Happened Here (Lawrence) explored the memory\u000a      of a specific place and its cultural dialogue with local communities. The\u000a      practical process involved fifty 12 to19 year old Hackney residents\u000a      exploring five heritage sites for their performance potential. Developing\u000a      a performance methodology to stimulate young people's engagement with and\u000a      narrative routes through museums, theatres and churches led to two guided\u000a      performance tours, a film, and two heritage- informed performances.\u000a      Participants spanned inner London's mix of ethnic, religious and social\u000a      backgrounds.\u000a    3b) Dambusters 70 (Lawrence) used verbatim theatre\u000a      to explore the effects on individual memory of a major national narrative\u000a      affecting local communities and military personnel in Lincolnshire (the\u000a      retrospective of the Dambusters raid).\u000a    3c) STORM (Lawrence; O'Thomas) (funded by\u000a      the European Union, Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency:\u000a      &#8364;109,888) was a pan-European project relating to cultural production,\u000a      translation, dissemination and movement in the performance and heritage\u000a      sectors. In collaboration with Theatre Companies Fatias de C&#225;\u000a      (Tomar, Portugal) and Teatr im Aleksandra Sewruka (Elblag,\u000a      Poland), STORM explored the collaborative development of a\u000a      multi-language performance model for non multi-lingual audiences.\u000a    Key findings that inform the stated impact:\u000a    The principal research insights stemming from the collected projects\u000a      within this case study were:\u000a    \u000a      that the empowerment of communities is qualitatively improved by\u000a        focusing on lived experience, remembering, and the archiving of struggle\u000a        and celebration;\u000a      that positive effects of performance are emphasised in framing\u000a        individual and community participation in local, regional and national\u000a        narratives;\u000a      that establishing site as a locus for performance-through-discourse\u000a        strengthens bonds between identity, commonality and creative\u000a        productivity.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32748","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3077311","Name":"Czech Republic"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research undertaken at the Centre for Music and Science has had\u000a      impact since 2008 well\u000a      beyond academia, embracing direct outreach, media representation, and\u000a      influences on public\u000a      discourse concerning music in society, as well as impact on specific\u000a      industrial working practices.\u000a    CMS research has been represented widely in the media, including\u000a      internet, print, radio and\u000a      television. Interviews with Cross and representations of his research have\u000a      appeared in the\u000a      magazines Archaeology (2008) and Science (2010), on BBC R3\u000a      and R4 (in 2008, 2009, and most\u000a      recently in the May-June 2013 series The Science of Music; see\u000a      Section 5a) and in numerous\u000a      independent radio productions, on film (Music of the brain, 2009,\u000a      Screen Australia\/f-reel pty Ltd)\u000a      and on the web (e.g., Guardian podcast in 2008, Pacific\u000a        Standard webzine, 2012, Naked Scientist\u000a      podcast, April 2013), while CMS researchers have contributed to television\u000a      programmes for BBC1\u000a      and most recently More4 (What makes a masterpiece?, broadcast in\u000a      January 2012).\u000a    The strands of research within the CMS that have elicited the most media\u000a      interest are those\u000a      concerned with music, evolution and communication, including the impact on\u000a      empathy. Ideas and\u000a      findings from CMS publications have been widely cited, and have been\u000a      disseminated through\u000a      published or broadcast interviews and via secondary sources that have\u000a      drawn on CMS\u000a      publications; this has led to the incorporation of ideas derived from CMS\u000a      research into media\u000a      debates concerning the role and value of music in society in a wide range\u000a      of internet sources\u000a      (Section 5b, dating from January 2012 to February 2013) and in newspapers\u000a      and magazines (such\u000a      as Science News, Section 5c, dated 14.VIII.10).\u000a    They are also represented in a popular science book, The World in Six\u000a        Songs (Section 5d, 2008),\u000a      of which a reviewer wrote in New Scientist: `... a fantastic ride.\u000a      Along the way, you'll hang out with\u000a      Sting, Joni Mitchell and Oliver Sacks, as well as people you likely won't\u000a      have heard of but will be\u000a      equally interested to meet, like music theorist Ian Cross' (Section 5e,\u000a      dated 20.VIII.08). These\u000a      reflections of CMS research in popular media have helped to place science\u000a      as a significant\u000a      element in public discourse concerning the nature of music and its role in\u000a      society, and have\u000a      enhanced societal understandings of music as embedded in both biology and\u000a      culture.\u000a    Another direct impact of CMS research on the social (empathic) effects of\u000a      joint music-making has\u000a      been on work practices in the oil and gas industry. Senior executives from\u000a      the BG Group\u000a      encountered Cross's ideas and research at a seminar in Pembroke College on\u000a      20.VII.12 and\u000a      realised that joint music-making might provide an excellent means of team\u000a      bonding to enhance\u000a      health and safety in the field, an approach that they have found to be\u000a      efficacious: in the words of\u000a      BG's Executive Vice President for HR, `I cannot thank the Cambridge team\u000a      and Professor Cross\u000a      enough, the application of the theories discussed at Pembroke will help us\u000a      to ensure that people\u000a      working for BG remain free from injury and are able to go home to their\u000a      friends and family each\u000a      and every day' (Section 5f, dated 19.VI.13).\u000a    Cross has also brought his research to wider attention through extensive\u000a      public engagement\u000a      activities. He has contributed to events organised by the Wellcome Trust\u000a      and the Royal Society, in\u000a      both cases aimed at public dissemination of recent thinking and research\u000a      on music from scientific\u000a      perspectives (e.g., participating in Beautiful Noise, held at the\u000a      South Bank Centre London in June\u000a      2010, and presenting as part of the Pint of Science festival in\u000a      Cambridge in May 2013, this latter\u000a      attended by around 170 members of the public). He was guest speaker at the\u000a      46th Academia Film\u000a        Olomouc in the Czech Republic, discussing three documentary films on\u000a      scientific research into\u000a      music for public audiences of around 250 for each film. CMS members\u000a      contributed to the\u000a      University's Science Museum's Science Live event in 2011, and all\u000a      members of the Centre have\u000a      also been closely involved in the Faculty of Music's outreach programme,\u000a      holding a CMS Family\u000a        Day in 2011 and a day-long event The Mind Behind the Music\u000a      for the Cambridge Festival of Ideas\u000a      in 2012, at both of which children (mainly teenagers), teachers and\u000a      parents encountered music and\u000a      science through discussion with CMS members and by participating in\u000a      experiments (each event\u000a      involved some 150 participants). CMS members also wrote, organised and\u000a      presented Good\u000a        Vibrations, a musical show about music and maths designed for\u000a      primary school-age children,\u000a      which filled the Faculty's Concert Hall (with a capacity of 500) for both\u000a      of its performances at the\u000a      University's Festival of Ideas in 2010 and 2011.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research by Professor Ian Cross and his co-workers in the Centre for\u000a      Music and Science (CMS)\u000a      investigates the evolutionary foundations of human musicality especially\u000a      in respect of relationships\u000a      between music and language.

The Centre is also a focus for postdoctoral and graduate\u000a      research, with fifteen graduate\u000a      students at the census date, its own programme of specialist seminars, and\u000a      regular visits by\u000a      scholars based outside the UK.\u000a    Cross's research explores music from a range of perspectives, including\u000a      acoustics, archaeology,\u000a      cognitive science, computer science and linguistics; at its core is\u000a      theoretical and experimental\u000a      research concerned with understanding music as an interactive medium. This\u000a      work has resulted in\u000a      a research focus within the CMS on the exploration of the commonalities\u000a      and differences between\u000a      music and language, a focus strengthened by the arrival of Hawkins. Her\u000a      expertise is engaged with\u000a      the underpinning of collaborative experimental and theoretical work\u000a      exploring music and speech as\u000a      primary components of a broad human communicative toolkit, as well as\u000a      intelligibility of sung texts.\u000a    In over fifty publications (peer-reviewed journal articles, book chapters\u000a      and conference\u000a      proceedings, from 1999 to the present) that have generated considerable\u000a      media interest, Cross\u000a      has drawn on ethnomusicological, cognitive-behavioural and neuroscientific\u000a      evidence. He has\u000a      worked with numerous international collaborators to suggest that music and\u000a      language constitute\u000a      complementary components of the human communicative toolkit (see Section\u000a      3a). Additionally, he\u000a      has developed and explored the idea that music, across cultures, exhibits\u000a      common features that\u000a      are likely to have been evolutionarily adaptive. This work has led him to\u000a      the view that these\u000a      features suggest that music is best interpreted as a communicative medium\u000a      optimised for the\u000a      management of situations of social uncertainty (Section 3b), in part\u000a      because of the potential of\u000a      participatory music-making to enhance a sense of group solidarity.\u000a    Development of this theoretical framework underpins ongoing research in\u000a      the CMS, investigating\u000a      speech and music in action (Section 3c) as well as undertaking empirical\u000a      studies which explore the\u000a      ways in which engagement with others in music-making can influence the\u000a      cognitive, affective and\u000a      social capacities of participants. For example, a year-long study on\u000a      music-making by children\u000a      between the ages of 8 and 11 has provided strong indicative evidence that\u000a      interacting through\u000a      music in small groups on a regular basis greatly improves a child's\u000a      ability to empathise with others\u000a      (Section 3d).\u000a    Cross has been commissioned by Oxford University Press to publish\u000a      research on the state of the\u000a      art in the interdisciplinary study of language and music (Section 3e); on\u000a      current thinking on music\u000a      and evolution within the framework of theories of communication (Section\u000a      3f); and on the empirical\u000a      and theoretical foundations of the neuroscience of music (Section 3g).\u000a    The Centre has hosted international conferences and workshops on the\u000a      topic, including Language\u000a        and Music as Cognitive Systems, in 2007, SysMus10\u000a      (International Conference of Students of\u000a      Systematic Musicology ) in 2010, and a series of seminars sponsored by the\u000a      British Psychological\u000a        Society on music and language in 2010-11.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32749","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Holloway's music has had a broad and sustained social and cultural impact\u000d\u000a      through live performances, radio and television broadcasts, CD sales, and\u000d\u000a      internet download or streaming services (iTunes, eMusic, Spotify etc).\u000d\u000a      According to Jonathan Dove, his work suggests `limitless possibilities for\u000d\u000a      what music could be, how far it can go, how it can be made. It is daring,\u000d\u000a      it is reckless, it is adventurous, it is romantic, it is\u000d\u000a      extraordinary...It shines a light out towards the horizon' (Section 5a,\u000d\u000a      dated 12.XI.11). The `daring' and `recklessness' are inextricably bound up\u000d\u000a      with the allusive practices used so widely in Holloway's works: practices\u000d\u000a      which promote accessibility and reach in themselves, since listeners\u000d\u000a      familiar with the sources cited have an immediate key to interpreting the\u000d\u000a      new piece. Along with certain other composers of his generation, Holloway\u000d\u000a      has played an important role in broadening the scope of contemporary\u000d\u000a      concert music and releasing it from the straitjacket of post-war\u000d\u000a      modernism.\u000d\u000a    Gilded Goldbergs has had eight performances since 2008 in\u000d\u000a      the UK, the USA (Carnegie Hall) and Germany, as well as broadcasts on BBC\u000d\u000a      Radio 3 and New York Public Radio (WQXR). It has been issued on partial\u000d\u000a      (Dunelm DRD0243) and complete (Hyperion CDA67360) commercial recordings:\u000d\u000a      recognition of the latter, although pre-2008, as Gramophone Record\u000d\u000a      of the Month and Sunday Times Disk of the Week undoubtedly\u000d\u000a      strengthened its impact within the assessment period. Ronald Haak's Amazon\u000d\u000a      customer review of the complete CD, from 2013, illustrates the work's\u000d\u000a      enduring appeal to the non-specialist: `I get a big kick out of this\u000d\u000a      album. It uses the original score very respectfully to give us the grounds\u000d\u000a      for cavorting around and murmuring \"w-o-o-o, I didn't look for THAT to be\u000d\u000a      in there!\" while it lightens our steps around the house...Simple listening\u000d\u000a      wins me over. Lots of originality and high spirits. And the 2nd CD is\u000d\u000a      free, so it's not a terribly big gamble for breaking into responsibly\u000d\u000a      charted new territory, is it?' (Section 5b, dated 21.V.13). The German\u000d\u000a      performances post-2008 were of a ballet version of the work (choreographed\u000d\u000a      by Nacho Duata for Compania Nacional de danza de Madrid), further\u000d\u000a      broadening the impact of this work by bringing it to an audience beyond\u000d\u000a      the concert hall. Gilded Goldbergs' basis on such a famous\u000d\u000a      and canonic pillar of Western art music &#8212; and one that even amateur\u000d\u000a      pianists may access directly through playing &#8212; further enhances its reach.\u000d\u000a    Since 2008, Holloway's orchestral transcription of Debussy's two-piano\u000d\u000a      work En Blanc et Noir has been performed on seven occasions\u000d\u000a      (several of which were broadcast on the radio) by five separate orchestras\u000d\u000a      in Holland, France, Spain, the UK and the US. Reviewers' comments pinpoint\u000d\u000a      the qualities that ensure its accessibility to non-specialist listeners:\u000d\u000a      `The initial opulence of Holloway's orchestration gives way to growling\u000d\u000a      darkness, followed by an uncertain scherzo: unnerving music, beautifully\u000d\u000a      done.' (The Guardian [Section 5c], dated 3.II.12); `The British\u000d\u000a      composer has recast it with the &#233;lan of a master orchestrator...By the\u000d\u000a      time Holloway reached the extended central Lento the work's origins were\u000d\u000a      forgotten and a shining coloration had taken hold' (Classical Source\u000d\u000a      [Section 5d], dated 2.II.12).\u000d\u000a    C'est l'extase and Reliquary are\u000d\u000a      orchestrations of songs by Debussy and Schumann to which Holloway has\u000d\u000a      added linking sections for orchestra. Both received high-profile\u000d\u000a      premieres. In the case of C'est l'extase, the soloist was\u000d\u000a      Ren&#233;e Fleming, an artist whose every performance attracts huge attention,\u000d\u000a      which added significantly to the reach of this work: `Fleming captivated\u000d\u000a      from the first phrases of `C'est l'extase.'...Holloway's orchestrations\u000d\u000a      usher you in, linking the songs, illuminating the view and affording the\u000d\u000a      soloist a spacious backdrop' (Section 5e, dated 9.I.13). The San\u000d\u000a        Francisco Chronicle described the work as `a beautiful and often\u000d\u000a      imaginative treatment of familiar material...Holloway's treatment offered\u000d\u000a      a revelatory exploration of Debussy's musical style' (Section 5f, dated\u000d\u000a      11.I.13). The BBC Proms premiere of Reliquary also prompted\u000d\u000a      re-evaluation of Schumann's original song cycle: `These songs have been so\u000d\u000a      undervalued!...The song cycle appeared transformed' (Section 5g, dated\u000d\u000a      9.IX.10). This illustrates how, beyond its direct impact, Holloway's music\u000d\u000a      exercises another kind of indirect impact: it changes the way in which\u000d\u000a      familiar items of the classical repertory are experienced.\u000d\u000a    The same applied to Holloway's Fifth Concerto for Orchestra,\u000d\u000a      which references several other works, in particular Schoenberg's Five\u000d\u000a      Orchestral Pieces. Again this strongly colours listeners' perceptions of\u000d\u000a      the music: `To enter Holloway's imaginative world is to delve into an\u000d\u000a      encyclopaedia. There's a large (and acknowledged) debt to Schoenberg here,\u000d\u000a      but also echoes of Strauss, Ligeti, even Holst. Similarly, the harmonic\u000d\u000a      spectrum veers from dark atonality to perky major-chord endings' (Section\u000d\u000a      5h, dated 8.VIII.11); `The piece...relishes orchestral textures,\u000d\u000a      superimposing them in densely woven layers. Schoenberg's Five\u000d\u000a        Orchestral Pieces are an acknowledged influence. But rather than the\u000d\u000a      confrontationalism of that gritty masterpiece, the idiom is closer to the\u000d\u000a      post-impressionism of Ravel, Zemlinsky and even Bax. That makes for five\u000d\u000a      aurally beguiling studies ...a richly rewarding set of orchestral\u000d\u000a      tableaux, and a fine vehicle for the BBC Scottish to show its agility and\u000d\u000a      refinement' (Section 5i, dated 5.VIII.11).\u000d\u000a    The `Composing China' project, for which the orchestral work In China\u000d\u000a      was commissioned, was organised by the NCPA. Five composers were invited\u000d\u000a      to write new orchestral pieces in response to two weeks spent travelling\u000d\u000a      in the country. Holloway began working on his contribution immediately,\u000d\u000a      with all the material in the piece being in place by September 2012, as\u000d\u000a      well as some of the orchestration. In addition to the live performance\u000d\u000a      itself (at the prestigious closing concert of the NCPA's Spring season\u000d\u000a      2013), which was heard by around 1600 people, the screening of a two-part\u000d\u000a      television documentary bears witness to its cultural importance and\u000d\u000a      extraordinary reach: this was shown on 9.IV.12 and 7.IV.13 on Fenghuang\u000d\u000a      weishi (Phoenix TV &#8212; a network with an estimated global audience of 300\u000d\u000a      million worldwide, including 150 million in mainland China [Section 5j]).\u000d\u000a        In China formed part of a very high-profile intercultural initiative\u000d\u000a      and so had a political significance beyond the purely musical. It also had\u000d\u000a      considerable impact as the first exposure of Holloway's work and ideas to\u000d\u000a      a mass audience in a country (and beyond this, a global Chinese community)\u000d\u000a      where they had been hitherto unknown.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case study focusses on the impact of research carried out by Robin\u000d\u000a      Holloway.

Throughout his career,\u000d\u000a      Holloway's compositional creativity has been informed on the one hand by a\u000d\u000a      compendious practical knowledge of musical history and on the other by his\u000d\u000a      parallel activities as an orchestrator, writer, pianist and teacher. The\u000d\u000a      critical dialogue with the musical past in Holloway's research is\u000d\u000a      complemented and enriched by a didactic dialogue with his students, with\u000d\u000a      which it has been intrinsically linked. Thus, beyond their direct cultural\u000d\u000a      impact discussed below, his music and thought have had considerable\u000d\u000a      indirect impact through the international profiles of the many leading\u000d\u000a      composers (representing an exceptionally broad aesthetic spectrum) whom he\u000d\u000a      has taught: these include George Benjamin, Thomas Ad&#232;s, Judith Weir,\u000d\u000a      Errollyn Wallen, Jonathan Dove and Julian Anderson. Benjamin comments,\u000d\u000a      `The man's burgeoning creativity and incomparable cultural knowledge,\u000d\u000a      added to the warmth and enthusiasm with which he shares them, has been a\u000d\u000a      source of inspiration to the generations of young musicians he has\u000d\u000a      nurtured in Cambridge' (Robin Holloway&#8212;A Tribute, http:\/\/www.\u000d\u000a    robinholloway.info\/pdfs\/tribute_george_benjamin.pdf [October 2011]),\u000d\u000a      while according to Anderson, Holloway's music `has been a beacon of\u000d\u000a      inventiveness, liveliness and enlightened exploration for more than forty\u000d\u000a      years...He has continued to resist pigeonholing, uniting contradictory\u000d\u000a      impulses of neo-Romanticism and neo-modernism in unpredictable musical\u000d\u000a      canvases of complexity and beauty which remain vitally important to\u000d\u000a      British composition and culture generally' (programme booklet, Robin\u000d\u000a      Holloway 70th Birthday concert, 27.XI.13).\u000d\u000a    The neo-Romanticism to which Anderson refers is manifest in the\u000d\u000a      allusiveness of Holloway's work and in its pioneering approach to the use\u000d\u000a      of quotation &#8212; a practice which broke a longstanding contemporary music\u000d\u000a      taboo and had a profound legitimising effect on subsequent compositional\u000d\u000a      practice. Beyond this, Holloway's research has permitted a highly\u000d\u000a      sophisticated interrogation of what musical meaning might be and the\u000d\u000a      ambiguities inherent in our historical perspective. John Fallas writes\u000d\u000a      that through the use of musical found objects, Holloway's work performs\u000d\u000a      `an analysis of its chosen materials', enriching and problematising the\u000d\u000a      listener's understanding of the original works and illuminating links and\u000d\u000a      relationships between diverse repertoires: `who would have realized how\u000d\u000a      close the interlocking thirds from Elgar's \"Nimrod\" theme are to the\u000d\u000a      ostinato from The Rite of Spring, or that in turn to the opening\u000d\u000a      figure of Mahler's Ninth Symphony, without hearing how Holloway deploys\u000d\u000a      them?' ('Into the New Century: Recent Holloway and the Poetics of\u000d\u000a      Quotation', Tempo 61\/242 [2007], 3).\u000d\u000a    Holloway's approach is intensely practical; it has flourished within the\u000d\u000a      ecosystem of Cambridge's live music-making scene. As a composer, his\u000d\u000a      natural element is orchestral music, but (as for the composers of the\u000d\u000a      nineteenth century whose work he cites) this is often refracted through\u000d\u000a      the medium of piano duet. Thus work with composition students who are\u000d\u000a      competent pianists may become a laboratory in which earlier (sometimes\u000d\u000a      symphonic) repertoire is explored, approaches exchanged, and new ideas\u000d\u000a      road-tested. Gilded Goldbergs exemplifies this continuum\u000d\u000a      between teaching and research, as well as between past and present:\u000d\u000a      originally conceived as a two-piano rendering of Bach's Goldberg\u000d\u000a        Variations to facilitate an understanding of its counterpoint for\u000d\u000a      didactic purposes, the project ramified to become an original work lasting\u000d\u000a      over an hour and a half which incorporates techniques of quotation,\u000d\u000a      commentary, gloss, palimpsest, elaboration and free fantasy on Bach's\u000d\u000a      original material.\u000d\u000a    This easy conversance of Holloway's composition with music of the past\u000d\u000a      has reached a point of such fluency and virtuosity that, according to\u000d\u000a      Fallas, `the listening experience rests on an ambiguity as to whether what\u000d\u000a      one is hearing is quotation, and also at certain moments on an ambiguity\u000d\u000a      as to what is being quoted...It is a game with meaning and association'. A\u000d\u000a      continuum can be traced between, on the one hand, orchestrations of\u000d\u000a      pre-existing works (En Blanc et Noir) and, on the other,\u000d\u000a      purely original works (In China). In between these outposts\u000d\u000a      lie works which quote or invoke the Zeitgeist of earlier music (Fifth\u000a        Concerto for Orchestra), or which `set' pre-existing materials such\u000d\u000a      as songs in between freely composed linking episodes (Reliquary,\u000d\u000a      C'est l'extase). Each has had direct impact through live,\u000d\u000a      broadcast, and recorded performance, and together they evidence an\u000d\u000a      approach to musical thought whose impact is pervasive in the world of\u000d\u000a      contemporary classical music.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32750","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1835841","Name":"South Korea"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research described above has impacted performance and the\u000a      understanding of performance\u000a      in complementary ways. At one end of the spectrum it has brought to light\u000a      repertoire that lay\u000a      dormant for centuries. Rankin's work on the Winchester Troper has resulted\u000a      not only in\u000a      transcriptions of long-neglected pieces but also, crucially, in better\u000a      understanding of how they\u000a      could be performed. Since 2008 this body of knowledge has been made\u000a      available through editions,\u000a      recordings and public performances. Building on the experience gained\u000a      through Ensemble Gilles\u000a      Binchois's landmark concert in honour of Edward the Confessor (Westminster\u000a      Abbey, 2005),\u000a      Rankin has worked within the assessment period with two further\u000a      internationally renowned groups,\u000a      Dialogos and Ensemble Discantus, greatly expanding the range of the\u000a      Winchester polyphonies to\u000a      have been disseminated in concert. A recording of Winchester repertory\u000a      issued by Dialogos in\u000a      2009 (Abbo abbas; Ambronay Editions, AMY 017) was elected best\u000a      Early Music CD of 2009 by\u000a      Audio\u000a          Cl&#225;sica; Fanfare (January\/February 2010 issue; see\u000a      Section 5a) described it as `not to be\u000a      missed'. Rankin provided transcriptions for nine of the disc's twelve\u000a      pieces, only one of which had\u000a      previously been recorded. In all, this programme has now been performed in\u000a      over fifty concerts\u000a      throughout Europe and North America in venues including Harvard\u000a      University, the Sorbonne and,\u000a      most recently, the Thoronet Festival (July 2013). A further programme,\u000a      `Music for a King', first\u000a      given by Ensemble Discantus at the 2012 Ravenstein Festival, was broadcast\u000a      on France Musique\u000a      on 7.IX.12 and recorded early in 2013 for release on the aeon\u000a      label; it has already been given ten\u000a      times in concert, in venues including the Mus&#233;e de Cluny, Paris, while\u000a      extracts have been\u000a      disseminated on YouTube (Section 5b) and Facebook (Section 5c). Winchester\u000a      polyphonies have\u000a      also been the focus of a summer course (July 2012; Fondation Royaumont,\u000a      France). In each case,\u000a      Rankin devised the programmes, provided the performing materials, and used\u000a      insights gleaned\u000a      from her research to coach the groups in appropriate performance styles.\u000a      The director of one\u000a      internationally renowned early-music ensemble has written of Rankin that\u000a      `without her\u000a      transcriptions of the Winchester polyphonies and her generous work with\u000a      the performers, our\u000a      knowledge of the earliest roots of our medieval musical heritage would be\u000a      seriously incomplete,\u000a      and the concert audience in many countries would not have been able to\u000a      discover this important\u000a      musical repertoire' (Section 5d). In short, Rankin's research has\u000a      revolutionised perceptions of\u000a      early-medieval sound worlds for both performers and audiences.\u000a    Rink's research has helped change perceptions not only of how music might\u000a      be performed,\u000a      but also of the nature of performers' interpretive choices. In his case,\u000a      the focus has been on\u000a      canonic repertoire. Rink's edition of Chopin's Second Piano Concerto\u000a      presents a reliable Urtext\u000a      based on a single `best source', while offering performers variants from\u000a      other authorised sources,\u000a      along with original fingerings and expressive indications; this achieves\u000a      both fidelity to Chopin's\u000a      intentions and the freedom of choice fundamental to his performance style.\u000a      OCVE is making\u000a      available for the first time a comprehensive body of primary Chopin\u000a      sources; by highlighting\u000a      differences between sources, it enables performers and teachers to\u000a      construct their own interpretive\u000a      approaches. One eminent pianist has written: `I regularly use these\u000a      resources myself for preparing\u000a      performances, and refer to them internationally in masterclasses, as well\u000a      as hearing them referred\u000a      to in other classes by some very senior and distinguished performers'; he\u000a      adds that they result in\u000a      `informed performances [that] are increasingly heard worldwide, affecting\u000a      audience perceptions\u000a      and being passed on in turn to younger students' (Section 5e). Both the\u000a      concerto edition and\u000a      OCVE have been the focus of presentations ranging from masterclasses\u000a      (e.g., Jerusalem, 3.I.10\u000a      and 4.I.10; circa 50 in the audience [hereafter `c.50' or equivalent];\u000a      London, 25.X.10, c.75) to\u000a      lessons to schoolchildren (e.g., Singapore, 25.X.12, c.40; Cambridge,\u000a      2010-13, c.80). All of these\u000a      sessions began with a presentation on problems raised by Chopin sources;\u000a      tuition focused on\u000a      philological issues and on performance practice. Rink also employed this\u000a      research while lecturing\u000a      in China (Shanghai Conservatory, 18.III.13 and 19.III.13, c.85; Nanjing\u000a      Normal University, 22.III.13,\u000a      c.120); Madrid (Universidad Complutense, 4.V.12, c.50);\u000a      Alcal&#225; (Aula de M&#250;sica, 5.V.12 and\u000a      6.V.12, c.25); Paris (Biblioth&#232;que Polonaise, 26.XI.10, c.80); Korea\u000a      (Seoul National University,\u000a      21.X.10 to 23.X.10, c.100); and London (Purcell Room, 6.II.10, c.300).\u000a      Chopin's symbolic\u000a      importance in Poland lends particular significance to the use of Rink's\u000a      Chopin editions in a high-\u000a      profile concert in Warsaw (26.II.10; also broadcast on Polish Radio).\u000a      Details about OCVE have\u000a      also been disseminated through `The Virtual Chopin', a fifteen-minute film\u000a      produced by Cambridge\u000a      University Communications Office in 2013 and accessible on YouTube since 1\u000a      March (Section 5f).\u000a      By the end of July this had already achieved almost 8,000 hits, attracting\u000a      comments such as the\u000a      following from individual users: `Reaching out this way is very beneficial\u000a      to the large audience that\u000a      otherwise would simply remain ignorant', and `I think this is a wonderful\u000a      new departure ... Classical\u000a      music needs to attract younger generations[,] and younger people do not\u000a      have the same sort of\u000a      unquestioning reverence that older music lovers have' (comments dated\u000a      March 2013; Section 5g).\u000a    As explained on the project website (Section 5h), the research of Wickham\u000a      and Hawkins\u000a      integrates artistic practice with scientific method in order to develop\u000a      and apply cognitive\u000a      approaches to the perception of polyphonic music. Enhancing understanding\u000a      of the psychological\u000a      processes underlying both polyphony and textual comprehension, this\u000a      research aims also to inform\u000a      compositional approaches to the communication of text through music; a\u000a      highly respected\u000a      composer and blogger described it as `some of the best interaction between\u000a      music and science\u000a      I've seen in a long time' (July 2013; Section 5i). The first stage of\u000a      their work involved concerts and\u000a      presentations at Brunel (15.VI.11, c.60), Cambridge (28.X.11, c.120;\u000a      24.X.12, c.170) and\u000a      Huddersfield Universities (9.II.12, c.100). These were built round the\u000a      performance of a new\u000a      composition, Roger Go To Yellow Three, with libretto by Wickham\u000a      and music by Christopher Fox\u000a      (Brunel University). The work brings the research process into the concert\u000a      hall by systematically\u000a      manipulating performance parameters and assessing word intelligibility\u000a      through questionnaires\u000a      answered by audience members as they listen. These responses feed into the\u000a      research, while the\u000a      project enhances public engagement with scientific research through the\u000a      medium of music. The\u000a      research was featured in an interview involving Wickham, Fox and Tom\u000a      Service on Music Matters\u000a      (BBC Radio 3, 4.II.12, c.30,000). Its success led to a second Wellcome\u000a      Trust grant (Large Arts\u000a      Award, 2012-14), and a new work and tests, Tales from Babel, with\u000a      a team led by Wickham and\u000a      Hawkins. Collaboration with practising clinicians in a major hospital\u000a      centre followed a performance\u000a      presentation to the Addenbrooke's Hospital Audiology Group (24.V.13,\u000a      c.30). The Head of\u000a      Audiology described the project as `a significant contribution in public\u000a      understanding of the ability to\u000a      hear in complex auditory environments'; he added that `the insights that\u000a      they glean are going to be\u000a      of fundamental importance in designing improved interventions for hearing\u000a      impaired people', and\u000a      spoke of `an ongoing conversation out of which it is intended that we have\u000a      a particular work stream\u000a      of collaboration, using music specifically designed for the benefit and\u000a      enjoyment of hearing\u000a      impaired users of both cochlea implants and sophisticated modern hearing\u000a      aids' (Section 5j).\u000a      Related performance presentations have taken place in Manchester (Wellcome\u000a      Trust Medical\u000a      Humanities Symposium, 23.IX.12, c.120), Cambridge (14.III.13 and 5.IV.13,\u000a      c.215), London (British\u000a      Neuroscience Association; 8.IV.13, c.35), and at the Cheltenham Festival\u000a      (7.VII.13, c.120).\u000a      Subsequent performances are booked throughout the UK. These are expected\u000a      to reach a live\u000a      audience of 2,000 and a further 50,000 through broadcast media, social\u000a      networking, and online.\u000a      This process is currently being extended through a fully funded PR\u000a      campaign; the latter has\u000a      already included a discussion on In Tune (BBC Radio 3, 8.IV.13,\u000a      c.40,000).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Recent work carried out in Cambridge has brought academic research and\u000a      performance practice\u000a      into multiple relationships; the impact of this work has been far-reaching\u000a      and various.

In certain respects they are linked, while in\u000a      others they illustrate the\u000a      diversity of work in the Faculty of Music. The first and third both focus\u000a      on the compositional\u000a      practices of early music, while the second features nineteenth-century\u000a      repertoire. On the other\u000a      hand, the first two proceed from questions of notation and its\u000a      interpretation, providing musicians\u000a      with greater understanding of how to perform the repertoire in question,\u000a      while the third seeks to\u000a      apply cognitive and psycho-acoustical theory to explore and inform\u000a      polytextual performance\u000a      practice.\u000a    \u000a      The research carried out by Susan Rankin (Professor of Medieval Music\u000a        since 2005) focuses\u000a        on the musical notation used in an eleventh-century manuscript from\u000a        Winchester Cathedral,\u000a        now held by Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. This was published in\u000a        2007 as a facsimile with\u000a        a 100,000-word introduction. The Winchester source contains the earliest\u000a        repertory of\u000a        polyphony extant and, as such, has enormous historical importance.\u000a        Rankin showed how\u000a        certain notational techniques provided much clearer information about\u000a        pitch content than had\u000a        previously been realised. By combining insights into notation with a\u000a        study of the sources'\u000a        contrapuntal techniques, Rankin was able to progress much further with\u000a        transcriptions than the\u000a        principal previous study (Holschneider, 1968). In developing her ideas,\u000a        Rankin has worked\u000a        closely with several of the leading ensembles that specialise in\u000a        early-medieval music.\u000a      The research of John Rink (Professor of Musical Performance Studies\u000a        since 2009) has given\u000a        rise to two major outputs in the period since he moved to Cambridge,\u000a        both designed for use by\u000a        performers as well as scholars. The first is his edition of Chopin's\u000a        Second Piano Concerto\u000a        (2010). This is based on two key premises: (i) that variants form an\u000a        integral part of the music;\u000a        and (ii) that the conflation of multiple sources should be avoided. The\u000a        concerto was published\u000a        as part of The Complete Chopin &#8212; A New Critical Edition, of\u000a        which Rink is one of four series\u000a        editors. The second is the development of the Online Chopin Variorum\u000a          Edition (OCVE), funded\u000a        by the Mellon Foundation from 2011 to 2014. OCVE, of which Rink is\u000a        Principal Investigator,\u000a        features an archive of digitised manuscript and printed sources (c.\u000a        6,000 images to date), all of\u000a        which can be displayed in numerous formats. There are detailed\u000a        philological descriptions and\u000a        explanatory texts; personal annotation tools allow users to add their\u000a        own comments.\u000a      The research undertaken by Edward Wickham (Affiliated Lecturer since\u000a        2007) and Sarah\u000a        Hawkins (Director of Research in Speech and Music Science since 2011;\u000a        previously Professor\u000a        of Phonetic Sciences since 2003) addresses the fundamental question of\u000a        how listeners\u000a        understand sung texts in polyphonic music. Using experimental tests\u000a        built round specially\u000a        composed music, they manipulate parameters such as harmonic structure,\u000a        number of voices,\u000a        word predictability and phonetic structure: the purpose is to probe the\u000a        intelligibility of words in\u000a        sung texts, and in this way inform the practices of both performers and\u000a        composers, as well as\u000a        the experiences of listeners. At the same time, the newly composed music\u000a        and associated\u000a        texts are designed to promote understanding of the neuroscience of\u000a        hearing. Audiences' active\u000a        participation is engaged by in-concert tests of intelligibility; these\u000a        are accompanied by\u000a        explanations about the principles tested and their relevance to normal\u000a        and hearing-impaired\u000a        listeners in complex auditory environments. Like Rankin, Wickham and\u000a        Hawkins work closely\u000a        with leading performers of early music to test their hypotheses &#8212; in\u000a        this case The Clerks, who\u000a        are directed by Wickham and whose repertoire ranges from polytextual\u000a        motets to contemporary\u000a        compositions.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"34477","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Nelson's model of PaR knowledge has established impact as a model for\u000a      creating and disseminating arts-based research to both the professional\u000a      art's world and the wider general public. The impact on creative practice\u000a      is profound. Nelson's article `Practice-as-research and the Problem of\u000a      Knowledge' has been accessed by 1095 readers. [1] PaR continues to\u000a      be an MMU specialism supported by Linden and Mackenzie's innovative\u000a      approach to curating knowledge, AAC enables PaR to be developed and\u000a      disseminated. The CK methodology has had strong impact on the wider art's\u000a      practitioner field: since 2008, 48 creative practitioners have benefited\u000a      directly from residences at MMU's AAC. For example, Dogshelf Theatre\u000a      company confirms that it is `as a direct result of our time in the Open\u000a      Space that has led to an upcoming installation at CARPA\/TEAK in Helsinki'.\u000a      [A] Another high-profile contemporary artist and founder of OU\u000a      Performance, describes CK as `a unique opportunity to develop my\u000a      practice-led-research in a public yet supported context. I have had key\u000a      outcomes that were made possible because of Curating Knowledge'. [B]\u000a    Fairhall's PaR projects typify Nelson's model and have been supported by\u000a      the CK methodology. Fairhall's research articulates new insights within\u000a      the jazz musical language through the use of code-mixing jazz structures\u000a      and musical parameters, and enriches the experience of individuals and\u000a      groups. The impact is evidenced through his collaborations with leading\u000a      jazz musicians, through his engagement with key jazz platforms and through\u000a      the albums he has released.\u000a    Fairhall has played piano under acclaimed saxophonist Nat Birchall's\u000a      leadership on 4 studio albums and a session for BBC6 Music, Birchall,\u000a      commenting on Fairhall's ability to code-mix, states that:\u000a    ...importantly he is able to convincingly play in these various styles,\u000a      often blending them seamlessly into a personal amalgam which never sounds\u000a      artificial or affected in any way. This ability has meant that his contribution\u000a        to my own music cannot be overstated. [K]\u000a    Fairhall's performances on these albums have received airplay on Radio 1,\u000a      Radio 2 and Radio 3, and widespread acclaim in the music press and\u000a      broadsheet newspapers. Fairhall's contribution has been particularly\u000a      noted. He was described as `a total star' in the Independent on\u000a        Sunday's 5-star review of Birchall's album World Without Form.\u000a        [I] Second Handed Blues was played on BBC Radio 3's Jazz Line-Up\u000a      (2009) with listening figures approximating 70,000. [E]\u000a    In 2009 Fairhall was nominated by NW Jazzworks for the prestigious\u000a      Jerwood Charitable `Take Five' Edition VI artist development scheme, a\u000a      professional development scheme designed to give some of the UK's most\u000a      talented young jazz musicians the unique opportunity to develop their\u000a      craft; he won the award. [E] As a consequence of winning the\u000a      award, his work was selected for a performance at the London Jazz Festival\u000a      in 2010. Fairhall's work has thus reached the specialist jazz community\u000a      and it has had significant impact on them in terms of their perceptions of\u000a      the current condition of jazz. [C] Dave Sumner of eMusic selected\u000a      The Imaginary Delta as pick of the month and says `Fairhall ... is\u000a      vivid evidence of the strength represented by a new generation of UK jazz\u000a      musicians'. [C] Daniel Spicer writing in Jazzwise magazine gave The\u000a        Imaginary Delta 4 stars\u000a    ...Fairhall's piano is a questing, quixotic voice with a comprehensive\u000a      \"inside and out\" vocabulary that recalls some of Sun Ra's solo passage. [C]\u000a    The album was named Album of the Year by American website\u000a      Birdistheworm.com, whose critic stated: `If I had to point to one album\u000a      that exemplified the thriving state of Jazz and its undeniable hope for\u000a      the future, it would be The Imaginary Delta. [D] These\u000a      critical opinions corroborate Fairhall's success in mixing early jazz and\u000a      contemporary elements in a way that problematizes simple readings of\u000a      pastiche or parody; the Birdistheworm.com critic wrote that `Fairhall is\u000a      simultaneously forward-thinking while still tending to the roots of Jazz'\u000a      past'. [D] To date SLAM Productions report that The Imaginary\u000a        Delta has had more than 10,000 sales and downloads. [L]\u000a    The Imaginary Delta was commissioned by the Manchester Jazz\u000a      Festival (MJF) `Original's Scheme' in 2011 and brought together musicians\u000a      from both Manchester and London thus underlining the national profile and\u000a      status of the Manchester jazz scene; subsequently the project was also\u000a      performed at the London Jazz Festival 2012. MJF Artistic Director Steve\u000a      Mead wrote:\u000a    Adam's project was a natural choice for this year's festival commission &#8212;\u000a      his ambition to draw upon the early language of jazz and make it speak to\u000a      us in the 21st century is something we've not explored fully before; Adam\u000a      is proving to be a pianist and composer with ingenious talent, fascinating\u000a      ideas and an un-rivalled knowledge of jazz history ...[C]\u000a    The album also received 4-star reviews in Jazzwise [C]\u000a      and The Jazzman. [C,G]\u000a    Fairhall has been invited to speak about his research at events, namely\u000a      the `Jazz Roots + relevance Debate' at the MJF in 2011, the `Thinking in\u000a      Jazz' Symposium (Lancaster University, 2012) and the `Thinking In Jazz'\u000a      session at the Rhythm Changes International Jazz conference 2013 (Salford\u000a      University). In 2011 he gave a solo performance at The Sage as part of the\u000a      Gateshead International Jazz Festival. In 2012 he performed at the Royal\u000a      Northern College of Music.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study brings together theory-informed practitioners across\u000a      different art forms to develop and disseminate new artistic practices.

This case study focuses on the work of Dr Adam Fairhall\u000a      (MMU: 2007 - present), Senior Lecturer and jazz improviser\/pianist whose\u000a      PaR projects typify the dynamic model produced by Professor Robin Nelson\u000a      (MMU: 1987 - 2010) that formalised an articulation of the PaR process (see\u000a      Nelson, 2006 [1]). Nelson's research articulates strategies for\u000a      evidencing the research inquiry where practice remains a substantial\u000a      element of the research outcome. Fairhall's jazz projects constitute a\u000a      further praxical exemplification of Nelson's model and have been supported\u000a      by Curating Knowledge (CK), part of Axis Arts Centre (AAC), curated by Dr\u000a      Jane Linden (MMU: 1996 - present) and Neil Mackenzie (MMU: 1993 -\u000a      present), both Senior Lecturers and curators. [2,3] CK creates a\u000a      space that actively supports the development of PaR work and engages with\u000a      a wide range of creative practitioners beyond, as well as in, the HEI\u000a      sector. CK initially ran from 2008 - 2010 as a research project developed\u000a      by Linden and borrowed from Gadamar's notion of the `dialogical encounter'\u000a      (Truth and Method, [1960] 2004). CK continues to offer creative\u000a      practitioners a research and development residency in the Open Space at\u000a      MMU's AAC where they are exposed to a range of different critical\u000a      perspectives on their work. Practitioners are presented with a\u000a      multiplicity of opportunities to explore their research process:\u000a      performance, exhibition, documentation, seminar, as well as with ad hoc\u000a      encounters with people moving through the site.\u000a    Along with other colleagues in the PaR group, Fairhall has presented his\u000a      research as part of CK at AAC (2010 and 2012). Fairhall's portfolio of\u000a      research comprises two albums that offer both significant research and\u000a      impact; namely Second-Handed Blues (Fairhall: pianist and\u000a      composer; Paul Rogers: co-arranger) [4] and Imaginary Delta\u000a      (Fairhall: commissioned composer and pianist). [5] Both albums\u000a      develop methods of code-mixing, a term defined by Fairhall after George E\u000a      Lewis's use of the term 'code-switching' to describe the style-jumping of\u000a      the New York downtown musicians (in Fischlin and Heble, 2004). Fairhall\u000a      allows for more subtle forms of mixing than sequential hopping between\u000a      styles and employs the device within the emerging format of solo piano and\u000a      sampling\/production elements. The notion of code-mixing draws on the way\u000a      in which groupings of signs are culturally and historically located and,\u000a      through exploring the diachronic placing and re-placing in a synchronic\u000a      context, can be re-interpreted in a different post-structural and\u000a      intertextual manner.\u000a    Two approaches are examined in the research: firstly, differently coded\u000a      `blocks' are set against each other, either sequentially or\u000a      simultaneously; secondly, two or more individual musical parameters within\u000a      a block are coded differently, producing a more subtle integration of\u000a      idioms. [4] Imaginary Delta further develops the\u000a      investigation and establishes an aesthetic of representation that\u000a      acknowledges the constructedness of all representations of the past, while\u000a      largely avoiding the kind of parody, irony and sense of kitsch that\u000a      characterizes some appropriations of early jazz.

ACE's report [C]\u000a      identifies Fortnight as having\u000a      impact because of its `formal technological innovation'. Annie Warburton,\u000a      in her Some Kind of\u000a        Magic report on the Theatre Sandbox scheme, notes that Fortnight\u000a      demonstrated a `thirst for\u000a      discovery, a spirit of openness, deep generosity, and a meticulous quest\u000a      for excellence'; she goes\u000a      on to describe the project as having a `deep attention to and care for the\u000a      audience experience.'[D]\u000a    The project has had direct positive impact on the audience\/participants\u000a      and their individual lives:\u000a      One participant (details included in section 5) stated that `[i]t created\u000a      new lasting social networks in\u000a      my local community.'[E] Its impact has also extended to influence\u000a      enterprise: The Director of\u000a      iShed, stated that the RFID technology created in Fortnight had\u000a      `been turned into a business' by\u000a      Matter2Media. [F] The impact of the project is particularly\u000a      evident in the way in which the RFID and\u000a      QR technology was developed and applied. Matter2Media and Infolab,\u000a      collaborating creative\u000a      industries, helped realize the Proto-type technology and the founder of\u000a      Matter2Media, stated that\u000a      Petralia:\u000a    ...created a software platform that enables the triggering of experiences\u000a      when participants\u000a      touch their electronic tokens (RFID tags) to 'portals'. I have since\u000a      benefited by generalising\u000a      this platform, and have applied it commercially both in the arts and\u000a      promotional sectors. [G]\u000a    Specifically, Matter2Media has subsequently utilized the technology with\u000a      events for Ford Focus\u000a      cars and the Ledbury Poetry Festival 2012 [B]; in addition,\u000a      technological framework developed\u000a      through Fortnight has also had an impact on the arts community:\u000a      theatre company Mercurial\u000a      Wrestler are working with similar technology as a direct result of Fortnight.\u000a    A key aim of Fortnight's approach is to demystify technology and\u000a      participants engaged with RFID,\u000a      QR codes etc. as part of an immersive experience involving missions to\u000a      discover and re-discover\u000a      parts of their city; however, the engagement with technology was woven\u000a      into the fabric of the\u000a      experience and was deliberately not made too explicit. Fortnight's\u000a      Twitter and Blog platforms\u000a      enabled participants to instantly feedback on the impact of the cumulative\u000a      experience. [H,I] The\u000a      Pervasive Media Studios, a collaboration between the Watershed, University\u000a      of the West of\u000a      England and University of Bristol dedicated to showcasing the best in new\u000a      technology, selected\u000a      Fortnight to feature in their \"cookbook\", describing it as `cutting\u000a      edge practice'. [B]\u000a    To date Fortnight has resulted in a three-day and a one-week test\u000a      run in Bristol, and 4 x two-week\u000a      runs in Lancaster, Manchester, Bristol and Oxford. Total direct engagement\u000a      with participants is\u000a      close to 900 people as each of the 4 x two-week projects directly engaged\u000a      200 participants from\u000a      the local community; in addition, posters with QR codes, and an\u000a      alternative SMS address located\u000a      throughout the cities has created a database of over 1,000 individual\u000a      responses. This database\u000a      tracks the movement of participants through the host cities and also\u000a      identifies their decision-making.\u000a      Many of the posters are still up in Bristol, Lancaster and Oxford and the\u000a      impact of the\u000a      project continues to be monitored [H].\u000a    Fortnight has had an impact on arts-based audience development and\u000a      has created a sense of\u000a      place for many participants who have met new people in their communities.\u000a      In some cases,\u000a      Fortnight encouraged participants to make major changes in their\u000a      life. For example, Fortnighters,\u000a      have started to meet regularly generating art-related tasks. One\u000a      participant reconnected with a\u000a      daughter that he had not spoken to in 20 years; two people changed jobs;\u000a      one person started an\u000a      artistic practice and associated blog and another person disclosed, for\u000a      the first time, that she had\u000a      cancer. One participant commented, `[o]n an individual level it's been\u000a      like therapy. Nothing less\u000a      than transformative'. [H,I,E]. Maddy Costa from The Guardian\u000a      was a participant in the Bristol\u000a      project and described it as `absorbing, tender &#8212; and requiring no\u000a      technological skills whatsoever'.\u000a      [J] The co-director of Bristol's Mayfest, told the Assistant\u000a      Producer of Fortnight in Bristol, that:\u000a    during the project it appeared that Proto-type had accessed a nameless\u000a      `non theatre'\u000a      crowd... it seems that the ambiguity of the project created a varied\u000a      audience. [K]\u000a    She goes onto state that `A Fortnight community had developed and\u000a      was now active beyond the\u000a      limits of the planned events' [K]\u000a    As part of the original \"Sandbox\" commission, Fortnight created\u000a      links with Bristol's Old Vic Theatre\u000a      and the Pervasive Media Studio [B]; dissemination events included\u000a      three `salon' events and a final\u000a      showcase attended by 196 delegates, including technologists, funders,\u000a      venue commissioners,\u000a      journalists and theatre makers. Proto-type have subsequently been invited\u000a      to France to work with\u000a      Compagnie Derezo engaging in a European collaborative project which\u000a      continues their\u000a      investigations into `The City' and its inhabitants all of which started\u000a      with Fortnight.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study documents the initial impacts of a site-specific theatre\u000a      project: Fortnight that was\u000a      conceived and developed by Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU)\u000a      contemporary artist Peter\u000a      Petralia between 2010 and 2012.

He engages with the potential effect, affect and\u000a      impact of digital technologies\u000a      on individuals and their experience of place [1 - 4]. Fortnight\u000a      is a PaR project that develops this\u000a      approach, building research that was initially explored in the theatre\u000a      performance Whisper (2006)\u000a      [1]. Fortnight delivers a bespoke \"experience\" to\u000a      participants over a two-week period using\u000a      pervasive media technologies. Fortnight has engaged 200\u000a      participants in each of the four cities\u000a      that have hosted the event to date. Fortnight's approach means\u000a      that impact is embedded\u000a      throughout the process and therefore some of the references to impact\u000a      appear in this underpinning\u000a      research section.\u000a    The research originally stemmed from arguments that modern technologies\u000a      disengage individuals\u000a      from their surroundings by creating, what has been called, a `secure media\u000a      cocoon' (De Cauter,\u000a      The Capsular Civilization, 2004). The secure media cocoon phenomena\u000a      seeks to describe the way\u000a      that our mobile devices mediate everything about our experience of being\u000a      in a city. Fortnight set\u000a      out to explore whether engagement with pervasive digital technologies\u000a      creates experiences of\u000a      isolation or intimacy with locality, community and self, and consequently\u000a      demonstrated that it is\u000a      possible to make an art project that turns this `media cocoon' into a tool\u000a      that encourages\u000a      engagement, instead of isolation. [1 - 4]\u000a    Fortnight explores the boundaries of theatre experience using\u000a      digital technologies in a site-specific\u000a      context [3]. It uses Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) badges\u000a      and SMS, QR codes and text-based\u000a      technology to engage participants in experiences that prompt them to\u000a      rediscover local\u000a      communities and urban environments. The research exploits the notion of\u000a      the `Sandbox', a gaming\u000a      environment in which the player\/participant can roam freely and explore\u000a      without purpose, but which\u000a      can also set up \"side quests\" allowing for engagement with familiar\u000a      environments from new\u000a      perspectives.\u000a    Fortnight beat off 97 other applications to receive research and\u000a      development funding from an\u000a      annual commissioning scheme called Theatre Sandbox in 2010. Theatre\u000a        Sandbox supports\u000a      theatrical companies `to explore pioneering ideas using new technologies'\u000a      and is led by\u000a      Watershed, the UK's first dedicated media centre based in Bristol [A].\u000a      The research questions\u000a      spatial boundaries as well as boundaries of reality: it engages\u000a      participants in both virtual and\u000a      physical spaces, and tests their relationship to these spaces.\u000a    Initial research involved a three-day pilot in Lancaster 2010 with\u000a      funding support from Nuffield\u000a      Theatre Lancaster, advice from the Storey Creative Industries Centre and\u000a      volunteer `test subjects'.\u000a      The findings from the pilot led to the design of more complex technology\u000a      to enhance an\u000a      engagement with notions of place, locality and being `local' as well as\u000a      the further development of a\u000a      narrative framework.\u000a    Petralia worked in collaboration with the founder and director of\u000a      Matter2Media, a ubiquitous\u000a      computing company, who devised coding for the project in such a way that\u000a      it could easily be\u000a      adapted to different cities without new programming. He also worked with\u000a      Infolab, who provided\u000a      RFID expertise and equipment. Petralia developed a form of RFID technology\u000a      that has been\u000a      innovatively applied; as the founder of Matter2Media argues: \"Petralia has\u000a      developed a\u000a      polymorphic experience that is more creatively impactful on the\u000a      participant\".

Our project has been described as\u000d\u000a      `groundbreaking' by a notable\u000d\u000a      Australian critic who, in his letter, claimed that it impacts deeply\u000d\u000a        on the professional work of film\u000d\u000a        critics, journalists, film festival programmers and managers, art museum\u000d\u000a        curators, cultural events\u000d\u000a        organisers, and all manner of councils, boards and funding bodies\u000d\u000a        involved with the subsidizing of\u000d\u000a        festivals (doc. 2). We interact with over 150 festival practitioners\u000d\u000a      and work closely with over twenty\u000d\u000a      leading international festivals, whose response to our work has been\u000d\u000a      particularly encouraging. We\u000d\u000a      impact the galaxy of festivals by charting the diversity, by facilitating\u000d\u000a      dialogues, by foregrounding\u000d\u000a      the festivals' leverage in the system of transnational film circulation,\u000d\u000a      and by assisting the under-standing\u000d\u000a      of their global dynamics. Iordanova and Frodon use their extensive\u000d\u000a      international contacts\u000d\u000a      to take up new initiatives, in particular with prestigious French and\u000d\u000a      Asian institutions and festivals.\u000d\u000a      The importance of our work for contemporary festival operations is\u000d\u000a      evidenced by the wide range of\u000d\u000a      our global affiliates, by the widespread acceptance of our work, as well\u000d\u000a      as in the testimonies from\u000d\u000a      associates (docs. 1 - 5).

From the onset we\u000d\u000a      worked with practitioners, who\u000d\u000a      took part in discussions and contributed by writing case studies and\u000d\u000a      giving interviews highlighting\u000d\u000a      the specifics of their work to the global community of other festivals.\u000d\u000a      Major critics and\u000d\u000a      programmers use our forums to air views on key matters of festival\u000d\u000a      operation, creating dialogue\u000d\u000a      and exchange among festivals with distinct agendas and emphases. As one\u000d\u000a      influential critic and\u000d\u000a      film festival consultant writes, I am personally involved as a\u000d\u000a        consultant with Festival Directors and\u000d\u000a        Programmers in many parts of the world ... and I can vouch for the fact\u000d\u000a        that the best informed\u000d\u000a        professional workers in this field are completely 'tuned in' to this\u000d\u000a        work ... the Film Festival\u000d\u000a        Yearbooks ... are eagerly sought out and passed around within the\u000d\u000a        professional field of festival\u000d\u000a        organization. (doc. 2).\u000d\u000a    The fact that a wide range of practitioners from around the world\u000d\u000a      contribute to our volumes &#8212; from\u000d\u000a      Canada, Greece, Italy, Russia, Germany, France, Austria, Serbia, Israel,\u000d\u000a      Cuba, Chile, Kurdistan,\u000d\u000a      India, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Kazakhstan, Japan, Thailand, Qatar,\u000d\u000a      Australia, the US, the\u000d\u000a      UK and elsewhere &#8212; confirms that they see our outputs as a potent\u000d\u000a      transmitter of new knowledge\u000d\u000a      that helps deepen understanding of the festival universe. Reviews of our\u000d\u000a      work written by festival\u000d\u000a      practitioners, such as Beijing-based Shelly Kraicer (programmer of the\u000d\u000a      Vancouver IFF) in Cineaste\u000d\u000a      (New York, 2012), and the corroborating letter by the editor-in-chief at Cineaste\u000d\u000a      (doc. 3) have\u000d\u000a      attested to the fact that festivals eagerly await our assessments, learn\u000d\u000a      from our views and\u000d\u000a      implement some of the models that we have publicised, especially as we\u000d\u000a      present the views of film\u000d\u000a        festival directors and programmers, whose opinions are not always\u000d\u000a        honoured within the groves of\u000d\u000a        academe (doc. 3).\u000d\u000a    Sought out by beneficiaries. Monitoring Amazon and our own\u000d\u000a      web-shop sales, indicates that\u000d\u000a      most of our books are ordered by and shipped to international festivals.\u000d\u000a      Books are shipped to\u000d\u000a      Teluride (Colorado), Berlin, Turkey, Amsterdam etc. As word of our work\u000d\u000a      spreads, more and more\u000d\u000a      users get in touch and get involved; they see us as the most potent node\u000d\u000a      in the festival circuit. One\u000d\u000a      example is the donation of a collection of festival catalogues dating back\u000d\u000a      to the 1970s by a\u000d\u000a      Cannes-winning producer (and former Director of the Rotterdam IFF) in\u000d\u000a      2012: he felt that his\u000d\u000a      archive would have its best home with us. Another approach was from the\u000d\u000a      Deutsche\u000d\u000a      Kinemathek\/Berlinale for a project on film festival catalogues (2013).\u000d\u000a      Festival stakeholders\u000d\u000a      frequently seek us out in a consulting capacity: Frodon and Iordanova are\u000d\u000a      involved with French-based\u000d\u000a      and international festivals (e.g. Cannes, Shanghai, La Rochelle,\u000d\u000a      Berlinale, Locarno, etc.). In\u000d\u000a      2011 Iordanova worked with the director of the Paris-based festival\u000d\u000a      accreditation body FIAPF, on\u000d\u000a      matters related to policy. What comes out of this systematic work is the\u000d\u000a      recognition that the\u000d\u000a      knowledge base created by researchers is of direct use in planning and\u000d\u000a      developing further festival\u000d\u000a      operations (docs. 1 and 5).\u000d\u000a    Promotion by festivals. International film festivals &#8212; from\u000d\u000a      America to Asia &#8212; have not only\u000d\u000a      embraced our work but also sponsored its promotion. Members of the team\u000d\u000a      are regularly invited by\u000d\u000a      film festivals to present our underpinning research in talks, round\u000d\u000a      tables, and panel discussions.\u000d\u000a      Such appearances have been initiated and underwritten by the festivals to\u000d\u000a      an amount that we\u000d\u000a      estimate cumulatively at c. &#163;15,000. Each one of our publications is\u000d\u000a      launched and sold in the\u000d\u000a      context of festivals, including special events in conjunction with the\u000d\u000a      Tromso IFF (Norway 2010),\u000d\u000a      Jeonju IFF (South Korea 2011), Edinburgh IFF, 2011, Venice (Italy, 2012),\u000d\u000a      Cinema Ritrovato\u000d\u000a      (Bologna, Italy 2013), Busan IFF (South Korea, 2011; 2013 &#8212; Busan IFF's\u000d\u000a      Artistic Director is a\u000d\u000a      member of our editorial advisory board). Members of the team are invited\u000d\u000a      to present in the context\u000d\u000a      of industry training (e.g. the Film Festival Summit Amsterdam 2010 and Las\u000d\u000a      Vegas 2011 or the\u000d\u000a      Film Festival Academy, New York 2012) (See: http:\/\/www.st-andrews.ac.uk\/filmstudies\/our-involvement\/).\u000d\u000a    WITHIN SCOTLAND Our work started before Scotland's government\u000d\u000a      adopted the slogan\u000d\u000a      `Scotland Festival Nation' as a tagline for its cultural policy; yet this\u000d\u000a      adoption enhanced the\u000d\u000a      significance of our focus. Our activities in Scotland influence the work\u000d\u000a      of several film festivals, as\u000d\u000a      corroborated by Creative Scotland, who acknowledge our joint work toward\u000d\u000a      `strengthening the\u000d\u000a      Edinburgh IFF' and `enhancing understanding in the wider film industry'\u000d\u000a      (doc. 4). Iordanova has\u000d\u000a      served, since 2011, as Trustee of the of the Centre of the Moving Image,\u000d\u000a      the umbrella company of\u000d\u000a      the world's oldest continuously running film festival in Edinburgh (EIFF).\u000d\u000a      Joining the board at a\u000d\u000a      critical period for the EIFFs fortunes, she helped improve the Board's\u000d\u000a      grasp of the dynamics of the\u000d\u000a      global festival scene and of the importance of artistic curation for\u000d\u000a      future editions.

In 2011 we secured\u000d\u000a      funding that enabled us to\u000d\u000a      develop the Scottish Film Festivals Studies Network (Seehttp:\/\/www.st-andrews.ac.uk\/filmstudies\/scottish-film-festivals-studies-network-2011-2013\/)\u000d\u000a      and bring together the 60-strong community of\u000d\u000a      practitioners for events that took place in Edinburgh (November 2011) and\u000d\u000a      in Venice (September\u000d\u000a      2012). Our take on festival policy in Scotland has been publicised by The\u000d\u000a        Scotsman (e.g.\u000d\u000a      Iordanova's opinion piece `Think of the Bigger Picture on Film Festivals,\u000d\u000a      The Scotsman, 23 May\u000d\u000a      2012, available at http:\/\/www.scotsman.com\/news\/dina-iordanova-think-of-the-bigger-picture-for-film-festivals-1-23103)\u000d\u000a      and in the context of the policy events at the Edinburgh Festival since\u000d\u000a      2011.\u000d\u000a      Creative Scotland, the main arts funding body, recognised our influence on\u000d\u000a      the international circuit\u000d\u000a      by funding a special practitioners panel as part of our Venice event\u000d\u000a      (2012) (doc. 4).\u000d\u000a    CONCLUSION\u000d\u000a    The festival project has, from the outset, involved different global\u000d\u000a      users as part of an integrated\u000d\u000a      approach to festival study. Our approach and our outreach activities\u000d\u000a      allowed us to create a\u000d\u000a      multitude of frameworks, case studies and resource listings that are\u000d\u000a      recognised to be of immediate\u000d\u000a      relevance to both the practical work of festival operations. Publishing\u000d\u000a      revenues, grants, and\u000d\u000a      assistance from festivals generated income streams that ensure work can\u000d\u000a      continue and become\u000d\u000a      sustainable (&#163;267,000 total as of October, 2013). We already act as a\u000d\u000a      global hub for film festival\u000d\u000a      studies &#8212; involving academics and practitioners &#8212; and plan to continue\u000d\u000a      setting the tone within the\u000d\u000a      community. The fact that programmers and filmmakers now willingly take\u000d\u000a      part in our initiatives is a\u000d\u000a      key indicator of success: it is they who seek to associate with us. In the\u000d\u000a      next stage, we expect to\u000d\u000a      partner up with specific festivals, like those in Busan and Edinburgh, for\u000d\u000a      the delivery of focused\u000d\u000a      programmes.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The first film festival, in Venice, was established in 1932. Today, the\u000d\u000a      global festival circuit counts\u000d\u000a      10,000+ - a disparate and loosely linked galaxy of events &#8212; and it is\u000d\u000a      still growing. Yet up until\u000d\u000a      2009, when our first collection of film festival studies was published,\u000d\u000a      research into festivals was\u000d\u000a      next to non-existent.

Through\u000a      its underpinning research and outreach activities, the project has\u000a      addressed this oversight in three particular ways. In terms of impact, it\u000a      has strategically promoted the value of film locally within the town by:\u000a      1. contributing to the cultural heritage of St Andrews and its\u000a      international tourist industry, 2. influencing secondary education\u000a      pedagogy, and 3. developing film audiences through partnerships with local\u000a      venues.\u000a    Cultural Heritage\u000a    St Andrews (population of 18,000) has both a sizeable university\u000a      community (approximately 9,000), and a thriving international tourist\u000a      industry, attracting nearly 200,000 visitors annually.

These include a two-week exhibition based on the\u000a      project's research, held at the St Andrews Preservation Trust Museum in\u000a      April 2012. As noted in the letter from the Chairman of St Andrews\u000a      Preservation Trust (doc. 5.1), `the museum enjoyed a sizeable increase\u000a        in attendance with 835 visitors, which brought in &#163;425', and the\u000a      exhibition `brought new materials into the museum's permanent\u000a        collection and foregrounded the importance of the museum's often\u000a        overlooked cinematic holdings . . . this exciting collaborative project\u000a        is proving valuable for the museum's outreach to the St Andrews\u000a        community'.\u000a    The project mounted a photographic exhibition in October 2012 at the Old\u000a      Course Hotel, as part of an ongoing partnership with the annual Alfred\u000a      Dunhill international golf tournament. The exhibition targeted the town's\u000a      tourist industry, by showcasing rarely seen images of renowned film stars\u000a      on the golf courses of St Andrews. As the Dunhill's supporting letter\u000a      notes (doc. 5.2), along with local and tourist visitors, 168 amateur and\u000a      more than 40 professional golfers visited the exhibition and, through\u000a      this, `learned of the rich history of celebrity culture in St Andrews;\u000a        a culture that we continue to nurture today to the cultural and economic\u000a        benefit of the town'. Based on this success, the Dunhill is\u000a      expanding its collaboration with the project to promote, through Getty\u000a      Images, its rich photographic collection of film stars on the golf courses\u000a      of St Andrews.\u000a    As a further means of presenting and preserving the cinematic heritage of\u000a      the town, the project has established a new and growing online archive in\u000a      2011 (ref. 3.4, 5.6) that curates and contextualises digitised holdings in\u000a      partnership with, amongst others, St Andrews Museum (2011), the British\u000a      Film Institute (2012) and the Media History Digital Library (2013). The\u000a      online archive includes materials such as photographs, architectural\u000a      plans, local interviews, and newspaper clippings, all available open\u000a      access, as noted in section 2. As the editor of local magazine St\u000a        Andrews in Focus explains, the project's outreach activities, and in\u000a      particular its online archive of local history, has done `a great\u000a        service in preserving and promoting the town's film heritage at a time\u000a        when St Andrews and Scotland's creative industries are under increasing\u000a        threat' (doc. 5.3). Based upon web traffic analysis (as detailed in\u000a      3.4 and 5.6), visits to the website have grown significantly since the\u000a      site's launch, from 270 unique visitors in the last quarter of 2011, to a\u000a      projected 10,000 visitors in 2013, based on 8,000 unique visitors in the\u000a      first eight months of the year. Surges of web traffic have directly\u000a      coincided both with the project's locally staged events and with\u000a      international events connected to the project's research (the project's Chariots\u000a        of Fire research was the most read material on the website during\u000a      the 2012 Olympics).\u000a    Secondary Education Pedagogy\u000a    The project's outreach has helped shape local educational programmes.\u000a      Since 2011, it has partnered with St Leonards secondary school in St\u000a      Andrews to develop teaching programmes that deploy the underpinning\u000a      research. The trial programme (which will continue in 2013\/14) was\u000a      initially adopted across 12 classes as part of St Leonards' International\u000a      Baccalaureate in English Language and Literature and has since been\u000a      successfully incorporated more broadly across the curriculum. As a\u000a      learning resource in schools, the project provides a model for introducing\u000a      and training students to engage critically with local heritage and new\u000a      media resources. The school noted that the `project's focus on local\u000a        history has proved a particularly productive way of introducing topics\u000a        in film and media to our students'&#8212;a pedagogical approach that has\u000a      been particularly useful with overseas students less familiar with the\u000a      local culture (doc. 5.4).\u000a    Film Exhibition and Audience Development\u000a    As Creative Scotland has been actively tracking, film exhibition has\u000a      diminished in Scotland to the extent that more than 25% of the region no\u000a      longer has active film venues. Given this context, Cinema St Andrews has\u000a      used its research to cultivate local film culture by formalising\u000a      collaborative partnerships with societies (for example, Colinsburgh\u000a      Community Cinema, since 2012) and by acquiring extensive local footage.\u000a      These initiatives resulted in a series of screenings throughout the town\u000a      in existing cultural centres (a local theatre and cinema) and\u000a      non-theatrical sites (including a church and school), attracting diverse\u000a      audiences comprised of long-term local residents, tourists, school\u000a      children and university students. For example in 2013, the project ran a\u000a      film season that celebrated the town's rich cinematic heritage by curating\u000a      free film shows in historically significant local sites. These included a\u000a      performance of a silent film, with live piano accompaniment, at the Hope\u000a      Park and Martyrs Church, attended by more than 150 people &#8212; a large and\u000a      diverse audience for a film screening in St Andrews. The screening\u000a      recalled the town's first cinema, which was a converted church used from\u000a      1909. Further screenings included a historical recreation of a programme\u000a      from 1964 from the St Andrews Film Society, which at the time was one of\u000a      the strongest in the United Kingdom with 1,025 members. The related Film\u000a      Society programmes are one example of the resources digitised and made\u000a      accessible through the project's website (ref. 4). On collaborating on\u000a      these commemorative screenings with a variety of sites and local\u000a      institutions, the project has worked in the context of the town's changing\u000a      cinematic landscape to form and nurture `the personal and\u000a        institutional connections that are vital for long-term development and\u000a        sustainability' of local cultural initiatives (see Colinsburgh\u000a      reference doc. 5.5).\u000a    By illuminating the key role of film as a major part of the heritage of\u000a      St Andrews in the 20th and 21st centuries, Cinema St\u000a      Andrews has made significant progress in fostering a sustainable, local\u000a      framework for film culture, which draws on the town's past to create\u000a      impact on cultural life in the present. Where the history of film in St\u000a      Andrews had been disconnected from the larger history of the town, Cinema\u000a      St Andrews has discovered and made visible the long-standing significance\u000a      of film to the international image of St Andrews, as well as the long\u000a      history of film events and film culture associated with the town. In doing\u000a      so, the project has created partnerships among several of the town's\u000a      cultural, tourist and educational institutions, building a collaborative\u000a      network where none had existed before. Moreover, Cinema St Andrews has\u000a      developed film culture in St Andrews through a series of innovative\u000a      exhibitions and film screenings, creating impact on cultural life.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Cinema St Andrews examines and preserves the cinematic heritage of St\u000a      Andrews from the medium's origins to the present day.

Yumibe is concerned with how digital access affects the\u000a      archival circulation of film culture and capital on a global scale (ref.\u000a      3).\u000a    Since 2011, Cinema St Andrews has taken shape within a general research\u000a      paradigm widely known as local film studies, which has emerged in recent\u000a      years as a major research focus in the discipline. Leading journals and\u000a      academic presses now frequently publish studies that detail the role of\u000a      cinema in mediating local cultural and social life in relation to national\u000a      and global concerns. Cinema St Andrews advances this form of research by\u000a      detailing the role of film culture as a form of heritage, documenting and\u000a      interpreting the significance of film in local history and its key role in\u000a      developing a vivid, internationally recognized image of the town.\u000a    Based on this work, Cinema St Andrews has established a new open access\u000a        website (est. 2011, ref. 4) that makes accessible and promotes the\u000a      project's research into local cultural history as a pathway to impact. The\u000a      research focuses on, for example, the cultural impact of film productions\u000a      within the town, such as the iconic beach sequence of Chariots of Fire\u000a      (1981). Our research also explores the historical importance of film in St\u000a      Andrews. We discovered, for example, that the earliest film exhibition in\u000a      the town &#8212; the appearance of Edison's Kinetophone in August 1895 in a\u000a      University fundraiser &#8212; constituted a seminal moment in British history as\u000a      it marked the first appearance of sound film in the UK. By preserving and\u000a      presenting this historical material now, Cinema St Andrews calls attention\u000a      to the historical, cultural, and economic value of film within St Andrews,\u000a      creating impact on cultural life in order to ensure that film culture will\u000a      continue to flourish. The project team has discussed its findings in the\u000a      local and national press and is developing additional academic articles\u000a      about this research for the next REF cycle.\u000a    Across this work, which has all been carried out while in residence at St\u000a      Andrews, Martin-Jones, Rice, and Yumibe investigate the integral role of\u000a      local archival material for heritage industries. They have applied these\u000a      collective findings in order to deepen the underpinning research into film\u000a      as cultural capital, while simultaneously developing its practical\u000a      applications for a local community.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35576","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The composition and research described in section 2 led to the formation\u000a      of Hull Sinfonietta (and,\u000a      later, the Portumnus Ensemble) as a branded professional music collective\u000a      for the Humber region.\u000a      Since 2008 this collective's positive impacts on cultural life, civil\u000a      society and education have\u000a      included:\u000a    \u000a      providing opportunities for 30+ commissions\/premieres by\u000a        professional\/emerging composers.\u000a        Outcomes have included an anthology of new songs (UYMP, 2010-11), a\u000a        published performing\u000a        translation (Faber, 2012), and a work that was subsequently performed by\u000a        Tokyo Philharmonic\u000a        for the inaugural Asian Music Festival (2010), Israel Contemporary\u000a        Players (2012) and the Hong\u000a        Kong Chinese Orchestra (2012) (5.1)\u000a      developing a programme of annual, research-informed Rehearsal\u000a        Orchestra Days for schools\u000a        in association with Excellence Hub (5.2) (over 14 schools, 240 pupils);\u000a        a Young Artists\u000a        Programme; cultural exchanges with 10 Chinese artists from overseas\u000a        (5.1)\u000a      providing occasional work for musicians from across the North of\u000a        England and for local\u000a        companies e.g. hpss.co.uk.

(Ref 3.1)\u000a    The rationale for these linked compositions was `To explore the\u000a      expressive effects and narrative\u000a      perspectives derived from stylistic and technical juxtapositions within an\u000a      overarching pitch-space\u000a      concept from the perspective of the Dong in Edward Lear's The Dong\u000a        with a luminous nose'.\u000a    The events at which these compositions were premiered attracted external\u000a      public funding for\u000a      Hull Sinfonietta (Lee Tsang) subject to these new musical works being\u000a      written to incorporate\u000a      participatory elements that would engage young people from disadvantaged\u000a      communities: &#163;11260\u000a      in total was awarded from Arts Council England (Yorkshire), Hull City\u000a      Arts, Humber Mouth\u000a      Literature Festival and Artists in Schools (Nov 2004-June 2005).\u000a    The premiere performance of The Dong, involved children from\u000a      Chiltern Primary School, who\u000a      participated by providing a musical and narrative bridge between The\u000a        Jumblies and The Dong\u000a      (May\/June 2005). Reception of this approach to audience engagement with\u000a      the work was divergent\u000a      according to audience demographic. It led to questions about the\u000a      contrasting natures of audiences,\u000a      how we communicate the `expressive effects and narrative perspectives' of\u000a      Borthwick's music and\u000a      how we develop future audiences for contemporary music more generally.\u000a    As a means of finding practical solutions to the questions raised, this\u000a      underpinning research\u000a      subsequently led to:\u000a    \u000a      Hull Sinfonietta becoming fully established as a professional musical\u000a        collective dedicated to\u000a        research and engagement projects.\u000a      The development of the animated music-film Lear Settings, Hull\u000a        Sinfonietta's flagship work.\u000a        (Ref 3.2)\u000a    \u000a    Lear Settings is a Hull Sinfonietta\/Creative Partnerships film,\u000a      co-produced with Andrew Marvell\u000a      Business and Enterprise College and the Northern Film School. It attracted\u000a      external public funding\u000a      (&#163;24786 from Arts Council England Yorkshire Lottery Fund\u000a      [01\/2006-03\/2009]), much of it under an\u000a      earlier title &#8212; A Jumbly Girl. Lear Settings incorporates\u000a      the underpinning research by design.\u000a      Borthwick's The Jumblies and Dong not only provide the\u000a      music for the film, they profoundly\u000a      influenced the screenplay, images, creation of additional soundtrack\u000a      material and the film's\u000a      presentation. Whilst the film project was initially part of an engagement\u000a      strategy to increase the\u000a      dissemination and impact of Borthwick's music, it developed into a\u000a      research project in its own right\u000a      and has had numerous impacts.\u000a    The research for Lear Settings was conducted over the period 2004\u000a      to 2013, and the key\u000a      researchers were: Dr Lee Tsang, Lecturer in Music, University of Hull,\u000a      2004 to present (Principal\u000a      Investigator); Dr Alastair Borthwick, Senior Lecturer in Music, University\u000a      of Hull, 2004 to present;\u000a      Michael Fletcher, PhD student in Music and Technician, University of Hull,\u000a      2006 to 2011; Rozi\u000a      Fuller, Freelance Animator; Will Docherty, Freelance Animation\/Film\u000a      Editor, Studio Mejo; Katariina\u000a      Paakki, Freelance Animation Assistant, Compositor; Zane Whittingham,\u000a      Freelance Animator.\u000a      The project was collaborative in nature. The primary research contribution\u000a      of the animators\u000a      related to the illustration styles of Edward Lear and their use in a\u000a      contemporary context using the\u000a      latest Flash technology. All other research areas were driven by UoH,\u000a      though workshop activity\u000a      that fed into the research process included contributions by numerous\u000a      non-academics, including\u000a      children from disadvantaged backgrounds.\u000a    The project investigated and provided new insights into:(i) the process\u000a      of making an animated\u000a      music-film that bridges the gap between `high art' music and hard-to-reach\u000a      audiences; (ii) the\u000a      overall artistic and educational concept; and (iii) dissemination that\u000a      encourages active\u000a      engagement\/interaction.\u000a    The key findings were that Lear Settings, as a film and\u000a      research-engagement initiative:\u000a      develops models for democratic authorship and ownership of 'high art';\u000a      articulates the concept of\u000a      difference (challenging assumptions about sound and identity, race and\u000a      'otherness'); provides new\u000a      structures for the presentation of aspects of memory, fragmentation and\u000a      character psychology in\u000a      musical and filmic contexts; and offers flexible models for education and\u000a      group-learning contexts.\u000a      (Ref 3.2-3.6)\u000a    Each stage of engagement generated new material and ideas that\u000a      subsequently led to further\u000a      research.

It can be broadcast (implying a wide\u000a      audience) and it can be played\u000a      (implying a purposeful mode of engagement). The impact of this research\u000a      project traverses both of\u000a      these two conduits, each of which has distinctive characteristics in terms\u000a      of reach and significance.\u000a      One can reach a wide audience, numbering in the thousands, but detailed\u000a      feedback about any\u000a      effects on that audience is difficult to obtain. The other has a smaller,\u000a      more localised audience, but\u000a      produces rich feedback about the significance of that contact for each\u000a      individual. Despite these\u000a      varying qualities, when taken together, the impact of this research is an\u000a      enhanced awareness of\u000a      music production processes &#8212; how contemporary popular music is made &#8212;\u000a      which is achieved\u000a      through demonstration and explanation.\u000a    Broadcast\u000a    The music of Middlewood Sessions and Nightports has been broadcast around\u000a      the world on\u000a      specialist radio shows of varying types (FM, cable, digital, satellite,\u000a      online-only) characteristic of\u000a      contemporary patterns of music consumption.

Similarly, affiliation with multinational companies such as\u000a      Mercedes-Benz via the Mixed\u000a        Tape compilation carries the music far beyond its origins of making.\u000a    Broadcasts also provide opportunities for interviews in which the\u000a      processes of making, as explored\u000a      throughout the research project, can be explained to a wider listenership.\u000a      In April 2012, Dutch\u000a      national radio show Wicked Jazz Sounds featured an interview with Dr\u000a      Slater about the processes\u000a      of making the album (following the nomination for Jazz Album of the\u000a      Month), reaching a\u000a      listenership of c.11,000. Dr Slater also featured in an extended 20-minute\u000a      interview on Rt&#233; Pulse, a\u000a      specialist online and FM radio station based in Dublin, which explored\u000a      issues of musicianship,\u000a      sociality, technical aspects of music production and the complexities of\u000a      the contemporary music\u000a      industry. This interview reached an audience of c.13,000 across digital\u000a      and FM broadcasts,\u000a      representing around 7.8% of the national listenership in Ireland.\u000a    Pedagogy\u000a    In November 2010, Dr Slater collaborated with Music in the Round (MITR)\u000a      to provide a weekend-long\u000a      workshop for string players and sound engineers. MITR promote a\u000a      world-class series of\u000a      concerts from their home in the Crucible Studio (Sheffield) and run\u000a      innovative community\u000a      education programmes. The remit of the collaboration was to give young\u000a      players and technicians a\u000a      realistic insight into a recording session, while enriching MITR's ongoing\u000a      programme of community\u000a      education. The weekend began with a series of improvisations and practical\u000a      explorations, which\u000a      led onto a day of recording followed by a public performance in the\u000a      Crucible Studio. There were 20\u000a      participants aged 14-23 who came from a range of socio-economic\u000a      backgrounds (16 musicians\u000a      and 4 aspiring sound engineers), plus 3 professional instrumentalists and\u000a      one technical specialist\u000a      assisting.\u000a    This project links with the research described in section 2 in two ways.\u000a      First, the musical material of\u000a      the Middlewood Sessions project formed the basis of the improvisations and\u000a      performance.\u000a      Unpicking the components of the music gave participants insight into the\u000a      detailed structuring\u000a      principles of popular music.

In particular, the research focuses on the increasingly\u000a      prevalent context of the\u000a      domestic project studio, which can be thought of as representing a\u000a      proliferation of creative\u000a      practices caused by the rapid growth of increasingly powerful technologies\u000a      of decreasing cost.\u000a      Access to these technologies challenges some fundamental preconceptions\u000a      about musical\u000a      creativity: who can do it, what can be made, where it can take place and\u000a      why people do it. There\u000a      are two simultaneous strands that constitute the findings of these\u000a      projects: practical activity giving\u000a      rise to musical artefacts and theoretic-empirical constructs to account\u000a      for the nuanced operations\u000a      of musical creativity as it takes place with music technologies.\u000a    The practical projects set out to understand the relationship between\u000a      technology and collaborative\u000a      musical creativity by enacting it. Between 2009 and 2012, Middlewood\u000a      Sessions (led by Dr Slater\u000a      in collaboration with another producer, 25 musicians, a sound engineer and\u000a      a visual artist)\u000a      recorded a full-length album, which was released in February 2012 building\u000a      on earlier releases.\u000a      Since February 2011, Nightports (a collaboration between Dr Slater,\u000a      another producer and a\u000a      vocalist) have recorded and released three EPs featuring material\u000a      originally derived from a self-imposed\u000a      restriction: only sounds from a single vocalist can be used, though these\u000a      may be subject\u000a      to unlimited processes of manipulation. The music of both projects offers\u000a      a summary of the\u000a      interaction of technological, social and musical processes in the project\u000a      studio, which constitutes a\u000a      contribution to the audio culture from which the aesthetic\u000a      circumscriptions were derived:\u000a      jazz\/dance\/orchestral music and glitch\/electronica respectively.\u000a    The attached research projects were designed to capture the complex\u000a      accrual of actions,\u000a      interactions, attitudes and events that animate the grand arc of\u000a      collaborative musical creativity.\u000a      Interviews, diaries, participant observation reports, ethnographic-style\u000a      reports of performances,\u000a      textual and sonic artefacts, video footage, press reviews and radio\u000a      interview transcripts constitute a\u000a      corpus of data offering insight into the processes of the musical\u000a      collaborations as played out in the\u000a      project studio environment. No such data set previously existed.

The\u000a      research project has given\u000a      rise to findings that allow nuanced descriptions of creative processes\u000a      within a particular context\u000a      (the project studio); these findings, along with the musical material,\u000a      form the basis of the wider\u000a      impact of the research.

The project examined the importance of the historical\u000a      and political moment for the development of civic culture in Europe. The\u000a      play `Not Yet' was produced and performed by a UK student company in the\u000a      UK and in Germany: in five university and school venues in Yorkshire, and\u000a      at the Dresden &amp; Mulheim Theatre Festival (2-10 November 2009). An\u000a      accompanying workshop programme was run, predominantly for audiences of\u000a      secondary school pupils. In the UK (February-March 2009), approximately\u000a      400 students (aged 14-21) saw the play and participated in the workshops.\u000a      In Germany, approximately 300 German students (aged 11-18) participated in\u000a      the workshops. The opportunity challenged the lived experience and\u000a      understanding of the post-Communist society for both German students and\u000a      the performers from and audiences in the UK &#8212; facilitated through\u000a      near-peer learning experience provided by the workshops and, additionally,\u000a      through a screening of the film of the play in Hull City centre by BBC\u000a      Humberside on the anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall (November\u000a      2009). The interactions had a positive effect on articulating the\u000a      uniqueness of the situation and the empirical cognition it brought.\u000a    This awareness was further mediated through performances of the play and\u000a      the ensuing publications: a keynote speech at the Goethe-Institut to an\u000a      international audience (`Not Yet: The Berlin Wall &amp; the Loss of\u000a      Biography'), and in the direct application of the play to German language\u000a      tuition at A-level, as part of the `Routes to Languages' tuition project\u000a      and in a publication for Routledge: respectively, (1) Die Mauer.\u000a        Multimedia Resource for students studying AS\/A2A level German\u000a      (2011), which has at its core the DVD and script of Not Yet.

Feedback from the schools and colleges was\u000a      highly positive as the workshops enabled the students to make connections\u000a      between their own lives and the play's themes. They found them \"really\u000a      motivating... a great idea, the play helped make sense of a difficult\u000a      subject.\" and would \"really like to do it again in the near future\"\u000a      (Claudia Schmidt. Teacher. Dresden).\u000a    Not Yet was published online by the Goethe-Institut (2009) in its\u000a      original English and in a German translation by Anselm Heinrich (access\u000a      data unavailable). The play was seen by the Goethe-Institut as a success\u000a      in terms of the After The Fall Project and beyond. The forte of\u000a      the project was identified in the complexity of the themes in the play and\u000a      in the engagement of the age range at which it was aimed, both in the\u000a      performance and in the workshops in schools. The Goethe-Institut\u000a      identified the project as the \"major highlight of 2009\" and observed that\u000a      it was \"amazing how this project really took off\", stating that they were\u000a      \"full of admiration for all the work done.\" (Wolfgang Winkler.\u000a      Goethe-Institut Manchester). References to and images from the play\u000a      featured heavily in the Goethe-Institut Yearbook.\u000a    The online publication of the play by the Goethe-Institut influenced the\u000a      practice of others. This is exemplified by the fact that Not Yet\u000a      has been used by international groups such as the European Shared Voices\u000a      project (2010), the aim of which is to create a stage version that would\u000a      represent a common future for all young people in Europe.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study documents the impact of practice-as-research into\u000a      playwriting methodologies engaging multiple voices as expressive of the\u000a      instability of auto\/biography and the social\/political construction of the\u000a      self.

Ongoing research in\u000a      playwriting is one of the key research areas in Drama since Anthony\u000a      Minghella was a playwright-lecturer in the early 1990s and other\u000a      specialists and practitioners in Drama (Donald Roy, J. Michael Walton,\u000a      Keith Peacock, Richard Boon); the continuity and gained experience is\u000a      reflected upon in Dickenson 2013. The current research questions were (1)\u000a      the instability of auto\/biography and adaptation of memory; (2)\u000a      construction of the self (individual, private, social, public, political,\u000a      cultural) through a dramatic structure; (3) applied theatre and drama in\u000a      education (behavioural patterns, clashes between individuals and\u000a      community, bullying and harrassment, xenophobia, theatre as an act of\u000a      remembrance); and (4) dramatic structure: multiplicity of voices\u000a      (heteroglossia) and choric structures. The play Not Yet explores\u000a      the ways in which a multi-vocal presence may be given to those who feel\u000a      their identities have been or are being ignored, ridiculed, or both. In\u000a      the play, the stories and choric structures are manipulated to generate\u000a      the possibility of new positive narratives of identity and a\u000a      claiming\/reclaiming of a heard voice; experimenting with the adaptation of\u000a      memory and identity in choric and other structural dramatic devices is\u000a      discussed more fully in Dickenson 2010.\u000a    The commission from the Goethe-Institut in 2009 for a play to mark the 20th\u000a      anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall was taken as a convenient\u000a      opportunity to explore the research questions applied to one of the\u000a      symbolic and major political and social events in the recent political and\u000a      cultural history of Europe. Supported and facilitated by the\u000a      Goethe-Institut, interviews of former East and West Berliners from\u000a      differing socio-economic backgrounds were undertaken and the impact on\u000a      their lives of the reunification of Germany was discussed. As a\u000a      counterbalance and a way of opening the perspective to a more far-reaching\u000a      scale, workshops with the children of East European migrants in\u000a      Lincolnshire were conducted, which identified a series of key issues of\u000a      the individual experiences of a shift in cultural identity and\u000a      assimilation. The resonances between the subjects' testimonies in the two\u000a      geographical locations (Germany and the UK) were profound and revealing\u000a      and influenced the conception and implications of the play.\u000a    From the perspective of Applied Theatre, Not Yet reworks and\u000a      refines the previous playwriting research experiments with narrative and\u000a      dramatic structures in approaching, embodying and giving voice to the\u000a      adolescent\/teenage mentality as developed in The Tipping Point\u000a      (2008; published in the Journal of Adaptation in Film &amp;\u000a        Performance 3 (2011): 3, pp. 305-28). Both plays address the\u000a      de-individualised group mentalities targeting individuals, analysing the\u000a      mechanisms of bullying and harrassment as triggered by awareness of\u000a      otherness and differences in voice. Through dramatic structure and the use\u000a      of choric and rhythmic elements, Not Yet embodies the\u000a      possibilities of change in behavioural patterns through a multiplicity of\u000a      voices and responses.\u000a    This innovative and topical use of language and the articulation of young\u000a      people's concerns today have found application in language learning. This\u000a      dimension has been developed through a series of workshops at schools in\u000a      order to test hypotheses and create a text that interweaves these concerns\u000a      and a sense of topicality in the dramatic structure.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"36513","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of the underpinning research described above relates to:\u000a      first, enhanced knowledge\u000a      about how children watch theatre; second, the development of new methods\u000a      to enhance and\u000a      extend young audiences' experience of live performance. Both these\u000a      elements have changed\u000a      delivery and practice in both arts and education contexts.\u000a    1. Enhanced knowledge in theatre and education contexts\u000a    The research has had a direct impact on arts practitioners, including\u000a      artistic directors of some\u000a      of the most significant organisations working with arts and young people.\u000a      This includes Tony\u000a      Graham, Artistic Director of the Unicorn Theatre, London, who described\u000a      Reason's research as\u000a      `inspirational' and stated that The Young Audience (3.1) was\u000a      `without doubt the most important\u000a      book on theatre for young audiences for many years' (5.1). Tony Reekie,\u000a      Chief Executive of\u000a      Imaginate, described the research as:\u000a    A fantastic resource for everyone interested in children's theatre.\u000a      Reason's\u000a      groundbreaking research provides fresh insights into children's\u000a      experiences of live\u000a      theatre which are of great benefit to arts and education communities\u000a      across the world.\u000a      (5.2)\u000a    Helen Nicholson, Professor of Drama, Royal Holloway, details the impact\u000a      of Reason's research in\u000a      terms of its ability to supply:\u000a    ...the cultural sector with the elusive evidence of the impact of their\u000a      work that they often\u000a      need to justify their funding in increasingly lean times.... [Reason]\u000a      provides an excellent\u000a      argument for including live theatre as part of children's educational\u000a      experiences and\u000a      some very useful approaches to classroom practice that will undoubtedly\u000a      enhance\u000a      children's experiences (5.3).\u000a    Janet Stanford, Artistic Director of Imagination on Stage, USA, writes\u000a      that Reason's research is\u000a      `that rare example of a scholarly text that can and should have practical\u000a      application in the field'\u000a      as it `inspire others to experiment with similar techniques as they\u000a      develop post-show lesson\u000a      plans of their own' (5.4).\u000a    Examples which evidence impact include:\u000a    \u000a      Material developed by international arts festivals and organisations\u000a        which directly\u000a        acknowledge the impact of Reason's research in shaping their approaches\u000a        to young\u000a        audiences. Internationally these include the Barbaro International\u000a        Festival of Children's\u000a        Theatre, Galway, Ireland (5.5) and Teater Centrum, Copenhagen, Denmark\u000a        (5.6);\u000a      Continuing professional development workshops for teachers and\u000a        creative education\u000a        workers, conducted with Imaginate, that changed how teachers understood\u000a        the\u000a        potential of young children's aesthetic engagement with theatre;\u000a      Adoption of the research report as a key resource by organisations who\u000a        have included it\u000a        on their webpages, including: Theatre for Young Audiences UK; Young\u000a        Peoples'\u000a        Theatre, Canada; Imaginate, UK; Forsoegsstationen, Denmark.\u000a    \u000a    The international impact of the research is evidenced by Reason's\u000a      invitation to speak at an\u000a      Australian Research Council event at Sydney Opera House to an audience\u000a      including Melbourne\u000a      Theatre Company, Bell Shakespeare, Malthouse Theatre, Sydney Theatre\u000a      Company, Arena\u000a      Theatre Co and Queensland's Performing Arts Centre. Reason also delivered\u000a      a keynote address\u000a      for the Australia Council to an industry audience on engaging young\u000a      audiences (5.7). The reach of\u000a      the research is indicated by its coverage in reviews, blogs and other\u000a      media (including the Sydney\u000a        Morning Hearld and Huffington Post).\u000a    2. New Methods for Engaging Young Audiences\u000a    The second strand of impact emerges directly from the first, but\u000a      continues from knowledge of\u000a      how children watch theatre to the strategic development of methods\u000a      designed to be used by\u000a      arts practitioners and educationalists to enhance young audiences'\u000a      theatrical experiences. This\u000a      includes the development, dissemination and implementation of a range of\u000a      resources (5.8) in\u000a      cross-media platforms to national and international audiences.\u000a    `Evaluating the Performing Arts' is a downloaded resource pack that\u000a      facilitates discussion and\u000a      debate about theatre among young children. The document was written in\u000a      consultation with\u000a      Reason (who also wrote the Foreword) with specific sections on drawing and\u000a      post-show\u000a      discussions developing directly from Reason's underpinning research.\u000a    `Talking about Theatre' is an interactive online resource for schools, in\u000a      which children are\u000a      guided through an intuitive animated process of theatre criticism and\u000a      discussion. The resource\u000a      was developed through &#163;40,000 of Co-Create Arts Funding and draws upon\u000a      Reason's\u000a      underpinning research.\u000a    In prompting and shaping Imaginate's development of these resources,\u000a      Reason's research directly\u000a      impacted upon and changed the activity of a major organisation with an\u000a      international reputation for\u000a      the development of the performing arts for young people. These resources\u000a      have since had direct\u000a      and significant impact on the practices of artists working with theatre\u000a      for young audiences and\u000a      teachers working in the class room. Susanne Batchelor, of Scottish Borders\u000a      Council Art's\u000a      Development team said that the resources `Fill a gap in terms of extending\u000a      the experience back in\u000a      the classroom [and are] a very accessible and fun way of engaging pupils\u000a      in the critical evaluation\u000a      of their theatre experiences.

The research impact is underpinned by a number of\u000a      research projects and\u000a      publications, including a book The Young Audience: Exploring and\u000a        Enhancing Children's\u000a        Experiences of Theatre published in 2010 (see section 3.1 below) and\u000a      also industry and\u000a      education orientated reports and websites (see section 4). Further\u000a      underpinning research\u000a      includes publications which detail aspects of audiences' aesthetic\u000a      experience (3.2 to 3.5) and\u000a      theatre in relation to philosophy for children (3.6).\u000a    The research has been undertaken through the support of external research\u000a      funding,\u000a      particularly: the Scottish Executive Education Department (Drawing the\u000a        Theatrical Experience:\u000a        An Investigation into Children's Theatre. 2007-8. &#163;9,757) which\u000a      enabled qualitative, drawing\u000a      based research into children's theatrical experiences to be conducted in\u000a      three schools in\u000a      Edinburgh and Lothian over six months working with circa 100 participants;\u000a      the AHRC\u000a      (Watching Dance: Kinesthtic Empathy. 2008-11. &#163;526,493) the scope of which\u000a      goes beyond\u000a      the case study here but which enabled the research into young audiences to\u000a      be extended to\u000a      dance. The research has been conducted in collaboration with external\u000a      partners, particular\u000a      Imaginate, Edinburgh, and the York Theatre Royal, both of whom have\u000a      invested resources,\u000a      consultancy and project funding into the research.\u000a    Reason's research engages with the production and reception of theatre\u000a      for young audiences\u000a      and has developed specific insights into how children both receive and\u000a      interpret theatre. Its\u000a      focus is on the intrinsic experience (theatre as theatre) and on\u000a      developing supporting\u000a      methodologies to enhance young audiences' engagement in the\u000a      post-performance experience.\u000a    Reason's research utilises primary qualitative audience research to\u000a      uncover how young\u000a      audiences watch theatre. This includes new insights into what kinds of\u000a      things they notice, how\u000a      they interpret what they see and what they recall afterwards. The research\u000a      describes how\u000a      children enjoy engaging with both the theatrical illusion and the stage\u000a      reality of a performance.\u000a      It reveals that children are actively interested in and enjoy engaging\u000a      with how a theatrical\u000a      performance is put together (the craft of puppetry, of stage effects, of\u000a      acting and so on) and\u000a      that rather than spoil the `magic' of theatre, conscious engagement with\u000a      these elements can\u000a      enhance the experience.\u000a    In the context of extending the theatrical experience, the research\u000a      reveals that children have strong\u000a      theatrical literacies and the ability to decode a performance. At the same\u000a      time the research\u000a      suggests that the experience is rarely taken beyond the theatrical moment\u000a      unless actively\u000a      encouraged. The research revealed that children have an active enjoyment\u000a      in talking about their\u000a      experiences, and identified a need for post-performance opportunities to\u000a      support children to extend\u000a      their experience beyond the moment of performance. Drawing on these\u000a      underpinning research\u000a      outputs, and in conjunction with partners in theatre and education, Reason\u000a      has developed a series\u000a      of resources (including print, training-based and interactive online\u000a      outputs) designed to structure\u000a      and facilitate the enhancement of young children's engagement with\u000a      theatre.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"36514","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research presented in this case study has multiple impacts.

Arts and mental health\u000a    In the context of initiating change in the delivery and understanding of\u000a      arts and mental health services, an indicator of the significance of the\u000a      impact of Rowe's research is the sustained partnership with Leeds and York\u000a      Partnerships NHS Foundation Trust around Converge. In 2013 the Trust is\u000a      contributing a total of &#163;20,500 toward Converge practice and research,\u000a      including part- funding a PhD student to work alongside the project from\u000a      2013-17. This is an indication of recognition from a major mental health\u000a      provider that Converge is an excellent example of contemporary\u000a      recovery-orientated mental health work. The Trust also provides a senior\u000a      occupational therapist to provide clinical support, as well as funding an\u000a      occupational therapist to support service users to progress through arts\u000a      activities provided by Converge. The Trust's recent `transformation plan'\u000a      for mental health services in York includes mention of Converge as a\u000a      partner provider.\u000a    Converge has impacted through public performances undertaken by Out of\u000a      Character, a theatre company consisting of mental health users, and the\u000a      Converge Choir. These include:\u000a    \u000a      May 2010: Out of Character performance at The Living and Learning,\u000a          Learning and Teaching: Mental Health in Higher Education\u000a        Conference organised by National Mental Health in Higher Education at\u000a        Lancaster University.\u000a      July 2010: Out of Character performed Tales from Kafka at York\u000a        Theatre Royal to approximately 400 people over 4 nights.\u000a      June 2012: Out of Character performed Henry IV by Luigi\u000a        Pirandello at York Theatre Royal to approximately 300 people over 3\u000a        nights.\u000a      May 2013: Out of Character performed their autobiographical show Speaking\u000a          Ourselves at the launch of the York Early Intervention unit for\u000a        psychosis.\u000a      September 2013: Out of Character performed Speaking Ourselves\u000a        at the National Richmond Fellowship Conference in York.\u000a      May 2013: The Converge choir was invited to perform at the launch of\u000a        the York Early Intervention unit for psychosis and in September 2013 it\u000a        performed at the National Richmond Fellowship Conference in York.\u000a      October 2013: Out of Character performed to nursing students at York\u000a        University.\u000a    \u000a    Audience feedback from these events include the comment, `Inspirational,\u000a      actions are more powerful than words, which adds a creative dimension to\u000a      mental health understanding and getting a range of messages across a wide\u000a      audience.'\u000a    The second strand of impact is at the very significant level of\u000a      individuals participating in the Converge project. This has made a\u000a      significant impact on mental health service users in the York area. In\u000a      2011-12, 84 people who use mental health services completed Converge\u000a      courses and the project achieved an 82% retention rate, which indicates\u000a      the value that participants put on the experience in transforming their\u000a      mental wellbeing. As Chris Butler, Chief Executive of Leeds and York NHS\u000a      Trust writes, Converge `gives people with mental health problems the\u000a      opportunity to explore and develop their creativity. For people with\u000a      mental health problems it can be difficult to have the confidence to\u000a      explore existing strengths or to discover new abilities and talents.\u000a      Service users described how this had simply transformed their lives\u000a      enabling them to achieve goals that at one time seemed impossible to\u000a      reach' (5.1). Other corroborations of impact include that from the Joseph\u000a      Rowntree Foundation (5.2).\u000a      Through dissemination events, Rowe's research has impacted on arts and\u000a      mental health practice, informing delivery in this area. As John White,\u000a      Pacific University, USA, writes, `Participants learned about theatre work\u000a      with people who use mental health services and discussed ways to\u000a      incorporate Nick's ideas into work with other populations. The\u000a      presentation emphasized methods through which community organizations and\u000a      educational institutions can work together for the benefit of community\u000a      members and university students' (5.3). Converge has also provided a case\u000a      study for the National Co-ordinating Centre for Public Engagement\u000a        (5.4) and the International Health Humanities Network (5.5).\u000a    2. Arts in hospitals\u000a    Research conducted with the medical team at York Hospital was designed to\u000a      explore patients' perceptions of engaging in arts work in a renal dialysis\u000a      unit. The research has impacted on the development of arts practice in\u000a      York Hospital. Dr Colin Jones, consultant on the renal dialysis unit at\u000a      York Hospital reports that the research into the impact of arts in a\u000a      hospital environment has `Increased people's realisation that the project\u000a      was transformative and enabling rather than just a \"bit of pampering\" and\u000a      that it has decreased cynicism amongst key players in the hospital and\u000a      helped with funding bids.' The development of art work at the Colon-rectal\u000a      unit is evidence of wider acceptance of arts approaches for in-patients at\u000a      the Hospital (5.6).\u000a    3. Performing personal stories in playback theatre\u000a    In the context of Playback theatre, the original publication Playing\u000a        the Other, also translated into Korean and Arabic, is a key text\u000a      used significantly beyond the HE sector for drama practitioners,\u000a      dramatherapists and health workers using drama in therapeutic settings. In\u000a      a review in Theater Journal, Linda Park-Fuller writes:\u000a    `With this book, Nick Rowe substantially addresses two lines of scrutiny\u000a      facing those who work with improvisational, audience-interactive, or\u000a      auto\/biographical theatre: (1) the need to theorize the work's theatrical\u000a      values, and (2) obligations for the ethical deployment of materials that\u000a      come raw from everyday life. He does this by rigorously testing, then\u000a      blurring the binaries that undergird these dual demands. To illustrate\u000a      requires a review of playback theatre (PT) and an introduction to Rowe's\u000a      background and purpose'. (5.7)\u000a    The impact of the work is also evidenced through a range of `playback\u000a      theatre' dissemination activities given across a range of beneficiaries.\u000a      Specific examples include:\u000a    a) Presentation at the Developing Partnerships Conference, Middlesbrough\u000a      (2009)\u000a    b) Playback Theatre in the Young Persons' Detention Centre, Wetherby,\u000a      Yorkshire (2008)\u000a    c) Playback theatre in the Asylum Seekers' Centre, Middlesbrough (2009)\u000a    d) Playback Theatre performance for General Practitioner trainers in the\u000a      North of England (2011).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study describes the impact of practice-led research in health\u000a      and social care settings.

His work addresses the following questions:\u000a    a) How do we document and measure the effectiveness of arts and health\u000a      interventions?\u000a    b) What constitutes safe and ethical practice in arts and health\u000a      practice?\u000a    c) What are the demonstrable benefits of arts and health practice?\u000a      Specifically relating to the three areas of impact described above:\u000a    1. Arts and mental health\u000a    A major ongoing practice-led research project directed by Rowe is\u000a      Converge, which since 2008 has offered education opportunities in the arts\u000a      (specifically theatre, music and dance) to people who use mental health\u000a      services. The research seeks to locate reflective practice alongside the\u000a      development of person centred methodologies that utilise `distance\u000a      travelled' to map the impact of arts participation (particularly over\u000a      time) on mental health service users. Converge operates in close\u000a      collaboration with Leeds and York Partnership NHS Trust with mental health\u000a      service users participating as students and artists within a university\u000a      context. Research into the impact and efficacy of this practice describes\u000a      how such arts projects can challenge the corrosive effect of the mental\u000a      illness label. Rowe's research also analyses how sustained contact with\u000a      mental health service users in a theatre context reduces discrimination\u000a      (see section 3.2, 3.3, 3.6 below). Recent work looks at the students'\u000a      attitudes toward mental illness and how this may be influenced by contact\u000a      in Converge (3.6)\u000a    2. Arts in a hospital environment\u000a    `Forgetting the Machine' (3.4) presents research conducted with the\u000a      medical team at York Hospital and was designed to explore patients'\u000a      perceptions of engaging in art work in a renal dialysis unit. The research\u000a      found that while `absorbed' in art making, patients are for a time able to\u000a      `forget the dialysis machine' and the reality of their illness. The study\u000a      finds that engagement in artwork is more than just a distraction from the\u000a      uncomfortable experience of dialysis. Art making engages patients\u000a      intellectually, creatively and socially. It gives purpose to the time on\u000a      dialysis, a sense of contributing to a joint task and promotes social\u000a      interaction.\u000a    3. The performance of personal stories through playback theatre\u000a    Rowe's research in Playback Theatre interrogates key ethical questions\u000a      within the practice of telling, representing and bearing witness to\u000a      autobiographical narratives. His research developed new understandings of\u000a      the conditions in which Playback Theatre can be conducted in a manner that\u000a      is both ethically `safe' and valuable to its audience. This research\u000a      relates to the use of Playback both with individuals in particular social\u000a      contexts (for instance in hospital with mental health service users) and\u000a      more generally.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38044","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Professor Herbert's research has decisively influenced professional and\u000d\u000a      amateur musicians, the heritage industry, and print and broadcast media\u000d\u000a      around the world. It has provided a more sophisticated and nuanced\u000d\u000a      understanding of the conventions of historical performance of brass\u000d\u000a      instruments than previously existed, and that knowledge continues to\u000d\u000a      inspire new forms of artistic expression in modern performance.\u000d\u000a    Herbert's long and distinguished career as a performer at the highest\u000d\u000a      level of the music profession has provided him with an intimacy with the\u000d\u000a      practical problems that performers face in interpreting musical texts and\u000d\u000a      a familiarity with many of the world's leading players and ensembles. A\u000d\u000a      great deal of the advice he provides is to individual performers: for\u000d\u000a      example, he has advised members of the Welsh National Opera, the Royal\u000d\u000a      Opera House and Glyndebourne Opera on the instruments that should be used\u000d\u000a      for the performance of nineteenth-century Italian opera &#8212; particularly the\u000d\u000a      type of instruments that should be used: valve or slide instruments; wide\u000d\u000a      or narrow bore instruments and the type of instrument that should be\u000d\u000a      properly deployed for the bass parts labelled `cimbasso'. He has also\u000d\u000a      advised museums, including the National Museum of Wales, on the provenance\u000d\u000a      and description of instruments. His advice is seen as important because it\u000d\u000a      is known to be based on a forensic examination of a wide range of primary\u000d\u000a      sources [5.10].\u000d\u000a    The depth of influence on the international music community of Professor\u000d\u000a      Herbert's portfolio of research and its relevance to musical practice is\u000d\u000a      perhaps best demonstrated in the continued success of Music in Words:\u000d\u000a        A Guide to Researching and Writing About Music.

It is built on scholarly investigation and on his\u000d\u000a      experience of performance with most major UK orchestras, opera companies,\u000d\u000a      chamber ensembles and period instrument groups. The research is unique\u000d\u000a      because it has been directed at key questions concerning the way brass\u000d\u000a      instruments have been understood and used over a wide chronological\u000d\u000a      period. Through a series of projects since 2003 the research has sought to\u000d\u000a      enhance the music community's understanding of repertoires that include\u000d\u000a      brass instruments even where the notated music does not indicate their\u000d\u000a      use, how performance techniques and conventions have changed, and how\u000d\u000a      historic brass instruments designs have impacted on the sound balance of\u000d\u000a      ensembles more generally.\u000d\u000a    The research has ranged from sixteenth-century court music to Victorian\u000d\u000a      amateur brass bands, early New Orleans jazz and the avant-garde. A\u000d\u000a      sustained theme of the work has been an exploration of the way the musical\u000d\u000a      practices of the lower social orders have informed more elite musical\u000d\u000a      repertoires and performance styles. The work has a particular\u000d\u000a      distinctiveness because the point of departure has usually been a minute\u000d\u000a      examination of the experiences of performers rather than the more usual\u000d\u000a      starting point of examining written repertoires. In The British Brass\u000d\u000a        Band: A Musical and Social History [3.3] Herbert explained for the\u000d\u000a      first time how such bands originated, how and what they played, and how\u000d\u000a      the new virtuosity of amateurs influenced the writing of modernist\u000d\u000a      composers.\u000d\u000a    In other publications, but especially in his book The Trombone\u000d\u000a      [3.4], Herbert (Professor in Music) explained the origin of the trombone\u000d\u000a      in the fifteenth century, how and in what circumstances it was used by\u000d\u000a      trombone players in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (a period when\u000d\u000a      players of the instrument were ubiquitous but it was almost invisible in\u000d\u000a      musical sources), and what the repertoire was. The book then explained the\u000d\u000a      role of the valve trombone in orchestral music and jazz in the nineteenth\u000d\u000a      and early twentieth century, giving new insights into the circumstances in\u000d\u000a      which these instruments should be properly deployed. Ideas about the\u000d\u000a      accurate deployment of instruments and performance techniques are the\u000d\u000a      source of the most significant impact of the research.\u000d\u000a    Perhaps the most vivid example is the Cyfarthfa project [3.1], in which\u000d\u000a      Professor Herbert discovered, reconstructed and recorded the repertoire of\u000d\u000a      a mid-nineteenth century brass band, using period instruments and the\u000d\u000a      handwritten scores from which the original performers played. The project\u000d\u000a      was the subject of a much-repeated BBC TV documentary (Mr Crawshay's\u000d\u000a      Private Band).\u000d\u000a    More recently, under the auspices of the Arts and Humanities Research\u000d\u000a      Council (AHRC), Herbert has applied similar research questions to military\u000d\u000a      music in the long nineteenth century (c.1770-1911), revealing key\u000d\u000a      relationships between military music and musical practices more generally\u000d\u000a      in Britain and the Empire.\u000d\u000a    Each of these projects has implicitly and explicitly exemplified links\u000d\u000a      between scholarly research and musical performance in the modern world. It\u000d\u000a      was precisely because of this that the world's largest music performance\u000d\u000a      examination organisation (the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of\u000d\u000a      Music (ABRSM)) commissioned Herbert to write Music in Words: A Guide\u000d\u000a        to Researching and Writing About Music [3.6], which is now widely\u000d\u000a      used by performing musicians and teachers throughout the world.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38429","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This case study focuses on children as creative users and content\u000d\u000a      designers, while\u000d\u000a      simultaneously creating opportunities for collaboration between\u000d\u000a      researchers and young\u000d\u000a      children.\u000d\u000a    It places emphasis on empowering young listeners to lead projects\u000d\u000a      informed by current\u000d\u000a      research in the sonic arts.

They also provided a central point for allowing\u000d\u000a      participants to organize\u000d\u000a      outside activities and share materials for the exhibition. Participants\u000d\u000a      gained listening skills as well\u000d\u000a      as a vocabulary for describing listening experiences.

The paper refers to work developed by three PhD students under\u000d\u000a      Rebelo's\u000d\u000a      supervision (Chaves, Hollerweger and Green) and provides a framework for\u000d\u000a      active listening\u000d\u000a      in\u000d\u000a      an everyday context.

Two concert events have been the focus of this 365) included\u000a      Hellawell's A White Room for four young players and the\u000a      world premiere of his new piece for very young musicians, Hide In\u000a          The Attic; ii) on 9 March 2013 the latter piece was given\u000a      again, by another team of young players, from Forest School, as part of\u000a      events curated by The Schubert Ensemble at King's Place, London (420\u000a      seats). The main circle of impact from Hellawell's work has been on the\u000a      young players themselves: \"On stage it was amazing, because the actual\u000a        concert hall had a great atmosphere and I felt like I was a proper\u000a        musician. That will be a life time memory for all of us.\" Angelo\u000a      Donovan-Maddix, Year 5\u000a    The core of the impact was to widen the children's experience of what\u000a      musical material can offer and their expertise in performing it: as they\u000a      responded to the interactive environment of small ensemble work, they used\u000a      their instruments for material that was timbral, percussive or semi-\u000a      improvised for the first time. The research in these pieces opened the\u000a      children to the many different constructions taken by music &#8212; a revelation\u000a      usually given (when at all) to more advanced learners. \"My favourite\u000a        part of the piece is my improvisation section at the end.\" Danny\u000a      Drennan, Year 6\u000a    In 2010 Hide In The Attic was studied by 8-year-olds from\u000a      Hampstead GS Junior School, before they gave its world premiere at the\u000a      concert. Teacher Sarah-Jane Gibson reports: \"As an educator I observed\u000a        them change from young girls who enjoyed playing their instruments into\u000a        young performers, and the memory of that still warms my heart today.\u000a        Soon after the event one of the young girls returned to Japan. Last\u000a        year, I received a brief message from her through a friend who had been\u000a        to visit her. She said that she still remembered her experience at the\u000a        Southbank Centre.\"\u000a    A White Room had been workshopped in 2010 at both King's\u000a      College School, Cambridge and at the Junior Royal Academy of Music, London\u000a      with members of the Lawson Trio, and was then performed by the King's\u000a      group at the concert. Teacher Simon Brown (KC School) reported: \"I\u000a        liked the way in which every instrument had to \"lead\" from time to time\u000a        - it was an excellent piece for teaching the reality of balance within a\u000a        mixed chamber group.\" The young players were thus highly receptive\u000a      to their encounter with new materials; these mixed standard (coordinated)\u000a      time-keeping for four diverse individual parts with more experimental\u000a      sections. Even the younger age-group of Hide In The Attic\u000a      responded to these new techniques: \"The syncopated rhythm kept\u000a        changing so required the utmost concentration. I was nervous when I got\u000a        on stage but when we started it was fine and flew by.\" Will Telling,\u000a      Year 5\u000a    Beyond the immediate circle of impact on these young musicians a wider\u000a      legacy has been delivered to other performing groups, since, by the time\u000a      of the February 2010 London showcase, the work had already reached as far\u000a      away as Boston, U.S.A., where (in 2009) Rodney Lister wrote \"I teach\u000a        at the New England Conservatory. I have a little chamber music group\u000a        that I coach. They're all nine years old. They just played (25-1-2009)\u000a        at the NEC Prep School Chamber Music Festival and, a week later, at its\u000a        contemporary music festival, A White Room by\u000a        Piers Hellawell.\"\u000a    Positive impact from this research reached beyond the young generation of\u000a      musicians via the context of these performances; these were heard by a\u000a      large adult audience with many players and composers from the scheme\u000a      present &#8212; both those acting as workshop facilitators in this project and\u000a      those engaged in writing themselves &#8212; to whom Hellawell's achievements\u000a      demonstrated what is possible in this simple framework. Indeed his works\u000a      have become canonic as instruction on the scheme: founder William Howard\u000a      wrote \"We play A White Room ourselves whenever\u000a        we do a seminar for composers about CM2000. The last time was Sept 25th\u000a        (2012) at Birmingham Conservatoire, where we were launching a CM2000\u000a        project for composition students.\"\u000a\u0009\u0009Bernard Hughes, reviewing the\u000a      2010 event at http:\/\/www.bernardhughes.co.uk\/?tag=chamber-music-2000, wrote\u000a    \"The composer who has contributed most to Chamber Music 2000 is Piers\u000a        Hellawell, and he was represented by two pieces for students and two\u000a        full-scale concert works.... Hide In The Attic was\u000a        the most successful of the pieces for students, played with impressive\u000a        self-possession by a very young quartet from GSJ School in London. The\u000a        piece cleverly mixed notated and aleatoric passages without the joins\u000a        showing, and the young pianist Mina Masuda gave a brilliantly assured\u000a        performance.\"\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The case study shows how short chamber compositions by composer Piers\u000a      Hellawell have transformed the musical experience of young musicians\u000a      within the on-going Chamber Music 2000 project in England. Circles of\u000a      impact radiate from his provision of practicable new chamber work for\u000a      ensembles: children from 8 to 16 have explored the challenging demands of\u000a      performing contemporary music created for them in an individual and\u000a      exciting idiom.

Much contemporary\u000a      instrumental writing is highly specialized and virtuosic and so outside\u000a      the reach of most young players; the research embodied in works like\u000a      Hellawell's Hide in The Attic connects young ensemble\u000a      players to the fulfilment of being involved in creative practice &#8212;\u000a      involved in the interpretation of new artistic work.\u000a    This research are concentrated in a series of four projects commissioned\u000a      for the scheme since 1998, the first being Hall Of Mirrors\u000a      (1998); this was followed by A White Room (1999), Tidy\u000a          Your Room (2006) and Hide In The Attic (2009),\u000a      first played at the Purcell Room, London by primary school children from\u000a      Hampstead Garden School in February 2010 and again presented live at Kings\u000a      Place, London, by youngsters from Forest School, in March 2013.\u000a    Hide In The Attic was a radical experiment, seeking to\u000a      engage younger children than any involved previously; in this sense the\u000a      undertaking was itself a miniature research project on the back of the\u000a      previous work, to find material suitable for genuine ensemble playing\u000a      among the youngest age- group.\u000a    The core of the research was to evolve the composer's mature musical\u000a      materials into simple identities with authentic expressive potential\u000a      suitable for young players; this process (to `distil' rather than just\u000a      `simplify' the composer's style) included seeking the freshest timbral\u000a      combinations (Tidy Your Room, opening: unpitched string\u000a      cluster glissandi) and sharpest rhythmic characterizations (Hide In\u000a          The Attic, opening: repeated motif), within restrictions of\u000a      register and of metre. The simplest level of non-thematic and improvised\u000a      materials increased the sense of active creative input from young\u000a      musicians (A White Room, cello pizz. glissandi\u000a      and unpitched ostinati beyond the bridge; Hide In The Attic,\u000a      piano ad lib. figuration in coda ). To contextualize this\u000a      within Hellawell's work, the means found in Hide In The Attic have\u000a      clear antecedents in Hellawell's clarinet concerto Agricolas\u000a      (2008), finished the previous year. This work's four tightly-drawn\u000a      `Bridge' interludes use alternate cluster chord iterations that generated\u000a      the shifting chords of bb11-22 in Hide In The Attic; the fade-out\u000a      of the piano improvised cadenza, meanwhile, derives from the long\u000a      diminuendo effects of Agricolas' main movement II, with its ad\u000a        lib. marimba sticks and flute whistle- tones. It is common for small\u000a      works to be fertile ground for larger expansions, but here the small work\u000a      acts instead as a distillation of the larger one.\u000a    These research materials take young players outside their musical\u000a      learning environment, whose conventional melodic and harmonic bounds\u000a      usually exclude much stimulus in extended sounds or improvised materials\u000a      such as are provided in these works. The sum of this series of short works\u000a      is an expertise in devising music of freshness and challenge for musical\u000a      children; the circles of impact of this research are detailed in 4.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38432","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of David Robb's research can be measured particularly with his\u000a      recent 1848 `Liederlexikon' project, which has been used by teachers\u000a      within political education in Germany.\u000a    A wider public interest in Robb's research dates back to his monograph on\u000a      Wenzel and Mensching which was launched at the Leipzig Book Fair by the\u000a      commercial publisher Ch. Links in March 1998 (references 1 and 2). The\u000a      many reviews included one in the Deutsche Lehrerzeitung (Teachers'\u000a      Paper), which praised Robb's raising of the profile of East German\u000a      identity, which was perceived as being marginalised by the mainstream\u000a      media (reference 3). Further impact was shown by the inclusion of his\u000a      essay as a `special feature' of Wenzel and Mensching's DVD Latest from\u000a        the Da-\u000a        Da-R, which had its international release in 2009 (reference 4).\u000a    Robb's second book Protest Song (2007) was widely commended for\u000a      increasing awareness of the German political song phenomenon in the\u000a      English speaking world, for example in the Times Literary Supplement\u000a      (7 March 2008) and in World Music, which described it as `simply\u000a      peerless [...] indisputably the best account on the subject in English\u000a      [...] a wonderful book' (27 May 2008, reference 5). Further impact was\u000a      demonstrated by Robb's radio interview on `PRI's The World' for a\u000a      documentary `Protest Songs' on 9 November 2009 for the 20th anniversary of\u000a      the fall of the Berlin Wall.\u000a    Robb's impact can best be measured with regard to his current on-line\u000a      project `Songs of the 1848 Revolution' (with Eckhard John). The interest\u000a      in their work is documented by the positive feedback in emails from people\u000a      who use their 1848 website in their work, for example, Christian Souchon\u000a      who used an excerpt from their work on his homepage `Jakobite Songs'\u000a      (reference 6) and Bernd Hans G&#246;hrig who requested permission to reprint\u000a      one of their commentaries in his magazine Querblick (reference 7).\u000a    Robb's research has been given a prestigious public platform at the\u000a      Rudolstadt Folk Festival, the largest festival of its kind in Germany. On\u000a      3 July 2010 he presented his work on Burns' `For a' that' within a\u000a      colloquium led by cabaret artist Dieter Beckert \" for the 200th\u000a      anniversary of the birth of the song's translator Ferdinand Freiligrath.\u000a      The Folker journalist Reinhard St&#228;nder wrote how the show cast a\u000a      new light on the relationship between German and Scottish folk music\u000a      (reference 2). Beckert wrote how the revelation of this connection\u000a      inspired his new cabaret production featuring the character Findlater\u000a      based on a Scottish Earl, resident in Saxony in the Romantic period. It\u000a      also resulted in an annual Burns Supper in the Albrechtsburg Castle\u000a      (reference 8).\u000a    Robb's workshop, `Historical Political Songs in the 21st Century', took\u000a      place at the Rudolstadt Festival on 7 July 2013. He and John presented\u000a      their research in front of a 50-strong audience comprising teachers\u000a      (Music, History, Politics or German), social workers, musicians,\u000a      translators and journalists. This was followed by a discussion entitled\u000a      `New Perspectives for School and Political Education' featuring guests\u000a      from the worlds of folk music (J&#252;rgen Wolff), political song (Heinz Ratz),\u000a      the media (Michael Kleff) and the Centre for Political Education of\u000a      Thuringia (Peter Reif- Spirek). 22 participants filled in questionnaires\u000a      (reference 9) and discussed how the research could be used in their\u000a      professions (reference 10). The questions were:\u000a    \u000a      What relationship do you have to songs of the 1848 Revolution and how\u000a        did you come across the theme?\u000a      Why does a theme such as this belong to a folk festival?\u000a      Can you use the research results presented here in your own work? If\u000a        so, in what area?\u000a      Have these research results cast a new light on the subject? If so, in\u000a        what respect?\u000a    \u000a    Summary of questionnaire answers:\u000a    Haupert and Kr&#246;ger (reference 9) and Melchior (reference 10) indicated\u000a      they already used the `Liederlexikon' in school teaching. Several other\u000a      teachers said they would use it. It was praised as a useful resource for:\u000a    \u000a      the origins of songs and their process of transformation, for example,\u000a        in the adaptations and parodies (Brock). Meijer (translator, singer)\u000a        stated that the research illustrated how `the path a song takes is just\u000a        as important as the song itself'.

It has focused on how songs of\u000a      revolutionary periods were revived particularly in the post-World War II\u000a      period, in order to re-establish lines of `democratic' cultural heritage\u000a      which had been broken by the Nazis. In this respect Robb has actively\u000a      connected with the movements (represented by musicians, festivals and\u000a      academics) in both East and West Germany since the Second World War that\u000a      have nurtured the democratic tradition of folk songs on a public level.\u000a    Robb's monograph on the `Song-Theatre' of the clowning duo Wenzel and\u000a      Mensching (Zwei Clowns 1998) looked at the creative appropriation\u000a      of political song tradition in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), also\u000a      exploring performance techniques used to circumvent censorship under the\u000a      communist regime. The work was published almost ten years after the fall\u000a      of the Berlin Wall, a significant point in the public discourse\u000a      surrounding the topical theme of `coming to terms with' the communist\u000a      past. One of the crucial points Robb was making was the redundancy of the\u000a      post-unification assumption that separated GDR performers into distinct\u000a      categories of either regime conformers or political dissidents.\u000a    The publication of Robb's next book Protest Song in East and West\u000a        Germany (2007) confirmed him as a leading international researcher\u000a      in the field. It resulted in an invitation to collaborate with Eckhard\u000a      John of the German Folk Song Archive and subsequently to the British\u000a      Academy and AHRC\/DFG grants which have funded him since 2008. During this\u000a      period Robb and John have worked on the `History of Reception of Songs of\u000a      the German 1848 Revolution', published as a project within the Historisch-Kritisches\u000a      Liederlexikon (www.liederlexikon.de).\u000a      The last significant research on this subject was undertaken by Wolfgang\u000a      Steinitz in the GDR in 1962. Twenty years after the end of the Cold War it\u000a      was felt that a reassessment was due. Robb and John's approach is novel in\u000a      its interdisciplinary combination of literary, musical and historical\u000a      analyses within the framework of commentaries and critical scholarly\u000a      editions. Via archival and internet research they have located new sources\u000a      of song reception, revealing new information about authors, composers,\u000a      melodies, the milieus in which these songs circulated and how they\u000a      shaped\/reflected social identities in 1848 and thereafter up till the\u000a      present. One of the main findings lies in Robb and John's pinpointing of\u000a      the change of function, which songs can undergo in the course of their\u000a      history. Correspondingly they have exposed the myths, which can emerge\u000a      during a process of historical reception which is often ideologically\u000a      motivated.\u000a    In summary the research has led to the most up-to-date findings on a\u000a      subject which has had song publications and, above all, in political\u000a      education in the promotion of democratic culture and consciousness in\u000a      Germany since 1945. Robb's work can be seen as a continuation of this\u000a      impact, as section 4 will illustrate.\u000a    Since January 1999 Robb has been a Lecturer (Senior Lecturer since 2004)\u000a      in the School of Languages, Literatures and Performing Arts and since 2011\u000a      in the School of Creative Arts at the Queen's University Belfast.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38907","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Through contribution to the ongoing development of SuperCollider\u000d\u000a      program and particularly the production of the accompanying book in 2011,\u000d\u000a      Wilson's research is contributing to new methods of creative practice\u000d\u000a        and the methods and practices of composers and performers throughout the\u000d\u000a        world. Downloads of the program since 2008 are currently at 230,285\u000d\u000a      from 177 countries, with sales of the book at 3090 [see source 1 below].\u000d\u000a      The book has received a very positive response from the SuperCollider\u000d\u000a      community, in addition to being favourably reviewed in academic journals\u000d\u000a      [source 2-4]. Wilson also maintains the two user group discussion lists\u000d\u000a      (which are very active, with between 20-60 messages per day), and so has a\u000d\u000a      direct impact on its members in this way. The extremely heterogeneous\u000d\u000a      membership of the lists, which includes academics, popular musicians\u000d\u000a      working in a variety of genres, music educators, researchers in related\u000d\u000a      fields such as psychoacoustics or data sonification, sound artists,\u000d\u000a      speculative music theorists, and experts in the history and culture of\u000d\u000a      computer programming, gives some idea of the spread of interest in the\u000d\u000a      program.\u000d\u000a    The program was the first to allow a great degree of flexibility in terms\u000d\u000a      of the ability to modify musical algorithms in a straightforward way while\u000d\u000a      they are running. It is used by both amateur and professional composers\u000d\u000a      and performers of electronic music, and is both flexible enough and\u000d\u000a      provides enough genre related features to be applicable to a variety of\u000d\u000a      uses. This is particularly evident in the SuperCollider Symposia held\u000d\u000a      since 2006 (when the first Symposium, arranged by Wilson, was held at\u000d\u000a      Birmingham), and on four occasions since 2008; Middletown, Connecticut\u000d\u000a      (2009, at Wesleyan University); Berlin (2010); London (2012), and Boulder,\u000d\u000a      Colorado (2013). The Symposia, arranged by various members of the\u000d\u000a      community not limited to academics, bring together users to discuss and\u000d\u000a      perform using the SuperCollider program. They are international events,\u000d\u000a      attracting over 100 people including performers and composers, as well as\u000d\u000a      students, academics, and concert goers. Future events have been proposed\u000d\u000a      for Tokyo, Japan, Mexico, and other locations [source 7, 8].\u000d\u000a    Since 2006, Wilson has developed the BEASTmulch extensions to the\u000d\u000a      SuperCollider language. (This was initially an AHRC funded project with\u000d\u000a      Professor Harrison as Co-Investigator.) These provide a class library,\u000d\u000a      BEASTmulchLib, which provides facilities for building applications which\u000d\u000a      specify and control large or small scale multichannel systems. It also\u000d\u000a      brought some new spatialisation techniques (most notably Vector Base\u000d\u000a      Amplitude Panning) to SC for the first time. A standalone application\u000d\u000a      based on the library, BEASTmulch System, is now the concert software for\u000d\u000a      BEAST, and has been used by BEAST in over 70 concerts in the UK and around\u000d\u000a      Europe (Basel, Berlin, Copenhagen, etc.). It has also been downloaded\u000d\u000a      numerous times and used for concerts and other purposes internationally\u000d\u000a      (e.g. Canada, Germany, Mexico and around the UK) [source 5]. Some of the\u000d\u000a      new approaches to and strategies for multichannel electronic music\u000d\u000a      composition made possible by BEASTmulch are discussed in a general fashion\u000d\u000a      in [source 4], thus exposing these ideas to a wider audience and raising\u000d\u000a      the possibility of similar developments being added to other software and\u000d\u000a      programming environments.\u000d\u000a    Since 2011, Wilson has developed another aspect of his SuperCollider\u000d\u000a      research, as the organiser of a laptop computer ensemble - Birmingham\u000a        Ensemble for Electroacoustic Research (BEER) - which performs\u000d\u000a      regularly in Britain and demonstrates in a practical way the smaller-scale\u000d\u000a      uses of SuperCollider [source 6]. BEER has performed in a variety of\u000d\u000a      different contexts, ranging from bars and nightclubs, to a concert in the\u000d\u000a      Bramall Music Festival, reaching audiences which include electronica fans,\u000d\u000a      classical `new music' listeners, and the scholars attending the Alan\u000d\u000a      Turing congress recently hosted in Birmingham. In this way Wilson's\u000d\u000a      research is having a direct impact on the members of the ensemble and the\u000d\u000a      audiences performed to. Wilson's activities with BEER have recently led to\u000d\u000a      the development of a new SuperCollider library for networked music\u000d\u000a      applications, tentatively called Utopia. This work helps interested SC\u000d\u000a      users to make music with each other over wired and wireless computer\u000d\u000a      networks [source 9].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The public domain computer program SuperCollider is used by a\u000d\u000a      large and active community of composers and performers of electronic music\u000d\u000a      worldwide.

Because of the latter ability, it can be used not only\u000d\u000a      by composers, but also by performers who use the computer as a musical\u000d\u000a      instrument. The program, first released in 1996 by James McCartney, is now\u000d\u000a      in the public domain and may be freely downloaded.\u000d\u000a    The development of the program is an evolutionary process and has\u000d\u000a      therefore been continuous since its first release (it is now in Version\u000d\u000a      3.6). Dr. Scott Wilson, Reader at the University of Birmingham is an\u000d\u000a      active developer of the program, and has been working on it since 2003\u000d\u000a      (joining Birmingham as lecturer in 2004). His contributions have been in a\u000d\u000a      variety of areas, including reworking and optimising SuperCollider's\u000d\u000a      facilities for responding to external communication in the form of Open\u000d\u000a      Sound Control messages or MIDI input, reworking and restructuring\u000d\u000a      documentation (including the initial conversion of the documentation to\u000d\u000a      HTML), embedding the Quartz Composer environment within SuperCollider,\u000d\u000a      serving for a time as the most active maintainer of the Mac OSX SC client\u000d\u000a      (numerous additions to SC's Cocoa GUI kit, etc.), and various other\u000d\u000a      contributions too numerous to mention.

Proof of their lack of historical foundation opened\u000a      up possibilities for more\u000a      interactive modes of engagement that have resonances also for modern\u000a      society. The breadth and\u000a      depth of engagement with Hamilton's findings suggest that he has realised\u000a      a widely felt need for a\u000a      fresh approach to the repertory it addresses.\u000a    One significant area of impact has been the changed approaches of\u000a        concert pianists. Between\u000a      2008 and July 2013 a number of top-flight pianists have taken on practices\u000a      based on Hamilton's\u000a      research in their concert performances and writings. Prominent among these\u000a      is Vladimir Feltsman,\u000a      who, having read the book, began to introduce linking improvisations\u000a      between conventionally\u000a      discreet items of his concert programmes. It was reported to Hamilton that\u000a      as a result of his book,\u000a      Feltsman had been `been making a habit of preluding... [he] did so [at a\u000a      Carnegie Hall concert in\u000a      December, 2008], with no pause between the two Liszt-arranged Schubert\u000a      songs or between\u000a      [Schubert's] Wohin and the [Liszt] Sonata' (see source 1 below).\u000a      Both Malcolm Bilson and\u000a      Stephen Hough have referred to the book in their own writings (Hough\u000a      example in source 2).\u000a      Hough and Steven Osborne (both international concert artists) have also\u000a      consulted Hamilton\u000a      personally to discuss the direct application of his research to their\u000a      playing, and have informed him\u000a      of their application of it in their concerts since 2008.\u000a    Cultural impact on public awareness and understanding of the original\u000a        performance\u000a        traditions of Romantic concert music is indicated primarily by the\u000a      book's high level of sales, far\u000a      beyond that normally expected for an academic work (source 1). Following\u000a      an extensive leading\u000a      feature in the Arts Section of The New York Times early in 2008,\u000a      entitled \"Concertgoers: Please\u000a      Clap, Shout or Talk At Any Time\", After the Golden Age became for\u000a      a period one of the best-selling\u000a      music titles in the United States.

Between January 2008\u000a      and July 2013\u000a      various music critics referred to Hamilton's research in reference to the\u000a      assessment of classical\u000a      music performances (for example Martin Kettle reviewing Daniel Barenboim\u000a      in Prospect Magazine\u000a      in February 2008, and Alexandra Alter on new approaches to classical\u000a      improvisation in the Wall\u000a        Street Journal in November 2008, the latter written after a\u000a      telephone interview with Hamilton &#8212; sources\u000a      3 and 4).

In\u000a      the UK, it was a Daily Telegraph `Book of the Year' for 2008 ('the\u000a      most irresistible music book I\u000a      read this year\", according to Damian Thompson). In 2008, reviews appeared\u000a      in an extensive range\u000a      of non-academic publications in addition to The New York Times,\u000a      including the The Guardian, The\u000a        Independent, The Birmingham Post, The Times Literary Supplement,\u000a        The Wall Street Journal, The\u000a        New Yorker, The Toronto Star, The Buffalo News, the Frankfurter\u000a        Allgemeine Zeitung, The\u000a        Gramophone, Classic FM Magazine, Symphony Magazine, Chamber Music\u000a        Magazine, The Oldie,\u000a        Wholenote Magazine, La scena musicale, Piano Magazine, The Arts\u000a        Journal, Netherlands Radio 4,\u000a        Piano Journal and Commentary Magazine. In July 2010,\u000a      material from the book was extensively\u000a      featured in a heated debate on the future of Classical Music between\u000a      journalists Heather\u000a      Macdonald and Greg Sandow, carried on in the pages of the New York City\u000a        Journal and the US\u000a      Arts Journal. Indeed, the initial City Journal article by\u000a      Heather Macdonald (\"Classical Music's New\u000a      Golden Age\") was partly catalysed by Hamilton's book, which she called \"a\u000a      mesmerizing study\".\u000a      Hamilton was consulted by Macdonald before the publication of this\u000a      article, and he gave her further\u000a      supporting historical information (source 7).\u000a    Since the publication of the book, Hamilton has been interviewed about\u000a      the significance of his work\u000a      for the transformation of current concert-giving practices by radio\u000a      stations in the UK (Radio 3),\u000a      Canada (CBC), the US (WQXR: New York Public Radio), Singapore (Radio\u000a      Singapore\u000a      International) and Australia (ABC, repeated a year after its first\u000a      airing). He has also himself\u000a      appeared as a pianist and presenter on the Deutsche Welle\u000a      television Channel (2009) in a\u000a      broadcast syndicated in both Europe and the US, and on Turkish Television.\u000a    Cultural impact produced by Hamilton's book has thus been channelled\u000a      through both print and\u000a      broadcast media, aided by specific and directed knowledge-transfer\u000a      activity when he was working\u000a      in the University of Birmingham Music Department (until October 2012).\u000a      Hamilton gave regular\u000a      lecture-recitals in the Barber Institute of Fine Arts by means of which he\u000a      presented his research to\u000a      a broad public. He repeated some of these lecture-recitals at music\u000a      festivals throughout the world.\u000a      In the 2008-2013 period, these included the \"Beethoven Unwrapped\" Festival\u000a      in London's King's\u000a      Place Concert Hall and the International Chopin and Liszt Forums in\u000a      London's Purcell Room (2010\u000a      and 2011). Hamilton has performed in the Esplanade, Singapore (the\u000a      country's main concert\u000a      venue), every year since 2005, which has led to repeated coverage in the\u000a      Far East of both his\u000a      academic and practical work, most notably in the Singapore Straits\u000a        Times, on Singapore Radio,\u000a      and even in the China Times. These concerts included practical\u000a      demonstrations of the art of\u000a      preluding and transitioning described in After the Golden Age&#8212;indeed,\u000a      one of the Straits Times\u000a      reviews drew specific attention to this. Hamilton additionally made a\u000a      number of international\u000a      appearances, for example: the world premieres (2009) of Hamilton's\u000a      reconstructed edition of\u000a      Liszt's Hexameron for piano and orchestra in Philadelphia with the\u000a      Philadelphia Classical\u000a      Symphony; and of the original (manuscript) version of Liszt's Sextet for\u000a      Piano and Strings (2009).\u000a      The versions of the pieces played in these concerts had been reconstructed\u000a      in the light of the\u000a      research in After the Golden Age.\u000a    The research has informed teaching and students in the Higher\u000a        Education sector through\u000a      Hamilton's invitations to give guest lectures, lecture-recitals and\u000a      masterclasses since the\u000a      publication of the book. Audiences on these occasions have comprised not\u000a      only pianists, and\u000a      indeed not only music students, but also a large cross-section of the\u000a      substantial music-loving\u000a      public familiar with the kind of repertoire on which Hamilton's research\u000a      bears. Events of this nature\u000a      took place at such institutions as the Royal Academy of Music in London\u000a      (annually since 2010),\u000a      The Royal Northern College of Music (29\/2\/12), Bath Spa University\u000a      (1\/12\/10), Middlesex\u000a      University (14\/10\/9), Goldsmiths' College, London (1\/5\/12), Royal\u000a      Holloway, London (7\/2\/12),\u000a      Kings College, London (18\/1\/12), Yonsei University in Seoul, Korea\u000a      815\/11\/11), the Singapore\u000a      Teachers' Academy for the Arts (STAR) (4-5\/4\/12), the New England\u000a      Conservatory, Boston, US\u000a      (9\/711), Brown University, Providence, US (4\/11\/11), the University of\u000a      Minho, Portugal (26\/3\/12),\u000a      Musikeon Conservatory, Valencia, Spain (12-14\/5\/10), and other\u000a      institutions worldwide.\u000a    In summary, then, Hamilton's study and the events that have\u000a      emerged from it have made, and\u000a      continue to make, an impact across the HE sector, on professional\u000a      practitioners and critics, and on\u000a      general public awareness of a centrally popular sector of the classical\u000a      concert repertoire.

It opens up to\u000a      pianists and audiences many possibilities concerning the performance and\u000a      reception of piano\u000a      music, and its presentation in concert, that had to a large extent been\u000a      lost in modern performance\u000a      practice.\u000a    Hamilton's research has, for example, demonstrated that improvisation &#8212;\u000a      particularly the custom of\u000a      playing extempore `preludes' and transitions between pieces &#8212; was a vital\u000a      part of classical concert\u000a      giving well into the 20th century, and therefore for nearly one\u000a      hundred years longer than was\u000a      previously thought. Moreover, it shows that the interaction between\u000a      performers and audiences\u000a      remained unlike that prevalent today for much longer than previously\u000a      assumed. For example, the\u000a      customs of sitting in complete silence throughout a classical concert, and\u000a      refraining from all\u000a      applause except at the end of a piece, are proved (in contrast to hitherto\u000a      received opinion) to be\u000a      surprisingly late developments, dating in many countries from the 1930s or\u000a      later.\u000a    After the Golden Age has therefore given a new historical\u000a      foundation to the arguments of some\u000a      musicians and cultural commentators in favour of a more liberated and\u000a      accessible style of classical\u000a      music making than is customary today. It has also (see below) prompted\u000a      professional pianists to\u000a      adopt a freer, more improvisatory, and less text-obsessed attitude to the\u000a      performance of the\u000a      standard repertoire. Evidence cited in the book includes contemporary\u000a      treatises, early recordings\u000a      and piano rolls, memoirs of masterclasses, and concert reviews. The\u000a      monograph has, additionally,\u000a      documented and discussed in detail the methodology and technique of\u000a      several specific aspects of\u000a      19th and early 20th century piano playing, such as\u000a      the role of arpeggiation of chords,\u000a      asynchronisation of the hands, syncopated pedalling, and attitudes to tone\u000a      production, all with a\u000a      view to the judicious reintroduction of these to modern\u000a      performance-practice.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38909","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The Pool Game was written by Tomlin, funded by Arts Council\u000d\u000a      England, and supported in\u000d\u000a      development by mac Birmingham and Point Blank Theatre (Sheffield).

The Pool Game\u000d\u000a      generated new ways of thinking in\u000d\u000a      its successful fusion of a dramatic (narrative fictional world\/character\u000d\u000a      based\/linear) within a\u000d\u000a      postdramatic framework (direct address\/ real-time eventness\/episodic\u000d\u000a      montage). Additionally, this\u000d\u000a      new model opened up the possibilities of combining the\u000d\u000a      `complete\/pre-rehearsed' dramatic\u000d\u000a      narrative with the postdramatic emphasis on unknowability and present time\u000d\u000a      action, by establishing\u000d\u000a      the central conceit of a dramatic narrative which is ultimately driven by\u000d\u000a      a live game of pool with an\u000d\u000a      indeterminate conclusion (see source 1 below).\u000d\u000a    How was this achieved?\u000d\u000a      The audience took part in a game of killer pool at the beginning, with one\u000d\u000a      of the actors working as\u000d\u000a      host and compere, utilising the contemporary trend for participation in\u000d\u000a      postdramatic practice in\u000d\u000a      which the audience are fully acknowledged in the time and space of the\u000d\u000a      performance event (rather\u000d\u000a      than being spectators of a dramatic fiction), and are involved in the\u000d\u000a      action with actors (rather than\u000d\u000a      characters). However, the piece succeeded in fusing this with a\u000d\u000a      predominantly dramatic and\u000d\u000a      character-based narrative model. By positioning the audience throughout\u000d\u000a      both as audience\u000d\u000a      (postdramatic event) and jurors (within the dramatic fiction); the\u000d\u000a      performance was able to work\u000d\u000a      simultaneously on both dramatic and postdramatic levels; and the\u000d\u000a      performers were able to exist\u000d\u000a      simultaneously in both their dramatic and character-based roles within the\u000d\u000a      fiction and their roles as\u000d\u000a      performers speaking to a watching audience. Both were effectively made\u000d\u000a      interchangeable by the\u000d\u000a      script, which fused audience\/jurors as one, in order to induce reflection\u000d\u000a      on the passivity of both\u000d\u000a      (and so transmit from their `fictional' role to their `real' one) in\u000d\u000a      relation to acts of theatre and acts of\u000d\u000a      political resistance in the world beyond.\u000d\u000a    How did this impact on the professional artists?\u000d\u000a      This required the performers to create their own strategies for dealing\u000d\u000a      with the duality of the\u000d\u000a      audience as both `real' and `fictional'; and balancing the determinacy of\u000d\u000a      the dramatic text against\u000d\u000a      the indeterminacy of the pool game.\u000d\u000a    \"Due to the fluid nature of the movement of the balls on the table, there\u000d\u000a      could be no\u000d\u000a      solid 'blocking' of the action, speeches, altercations and revelations\u000d\u000a      could happen in a\u000d\u000a      different place every performance, Stage Left or Right, in front or behind\u000d\u000a      the table, we\u000d\u000a      were where the game dictated we needed to be, this could very easily have\u000d\u000a      an impact\u000d\u000a      on the power and effectiveness of a moment.

This\u000d\u000a      encourages artists and companies to position themselves within one or the\u000d\u000a      other, a tendency\u000d\u000a      which was until very recently encouraged by industry support systems\u000d\u000a      characterised by their\u000d\u000a      support either of playwrights and plays, or of devised ensemble practice\u000d\u000a      not driven by text.\u000d\u000a    Tomlin's research undermines the binary between the two models: notably\u000d\u000a      in her article `And their\u000d\u000a      stories' (see output R2 below), her foreword `Dramatic Developments' (R4)\u000d\u000a      and her monograph\u000d\u000a      Acts and Apparitions (R1).\u000d\u000a    Her article `Make a Map' (R3) also argues that we need to erase the\u000d\u000a      binary distinctions between\u000d\u000a      the dramatic and postdramatic to enable a new kind of making process:\u000d\u000a      `contextual dramaturgies'.\u000d\u000a      Drawing on the theories of Giles Deleuze and Felix Guittari, Tomlin argues\u000d\u000a      that the process of\u000d\u000a      each individual piece of work depends on a shifting set of artistic rules\u000d\u000a      which is unique to that piece\u000d\u000a      of work, and remains wholly provisional at each point in the process. She\u000d\u000a      advocates the possibility\u000d\u000a      of work that evolves using both dramatic and postdramatic strategies,\u000d\u000a      rather than being limited by\u000d\u000a      an either\/or binary choice.\u000d\u000a    Some artists already apply this way of working, but Tomlin brings a\u000d\u000a      powerful theorisation to the\u000d\u000a      practice in terms that can change the way that dramaturgical work is\u000d\u000a      taught both within the\u000d\u000a      academy and within the professional theatre. This can help make the\u000d\u000a      practice more available to\u000d\u000a      emerging and existing artists. Her own application of this theory in the\u000d\u000a      case study outlined below\u000d\u000a      offers a practice-based dissemination that has directly impacted on the\u000d\u000a      working processes of the\u000d\u000a      artists involved and is communicated in the rehearsal room via the\u000d\u000a      language of practice.\u000d\u000a    It is very complex in this mode of dissemination to attach specific\u000d\u000a      impacts to specific research\u000d\u000a      insights; in the rehearsal space you draw on a bank of theoretical\u000d\u000a      knowledge to respond to the\u000d\u000a      particular problems and issues that arise, rather than imposing specific\u000d\u000a      theoretical insights onto the\u000d\u000a      working process. However, the research focus that has informed the impact\u000d\u000a      here can be\u000d\u000a      summarised as exploring the theatrical\/political potential of the\u000d\u000a      interplay between the fictional world\u000d\u000a      of the drama and the `real time' event of the postdramatic performance,\u000d\u000a      when both, apparently\u000d\u000a      contradictory, frameworks co-exist.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38910","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2960313","Name":"Luxembourg"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    (a) Informing the practice of actors and directors in rehearsal, and\u000a        providing cultural\u000a        enrichment for audiences through print and other media connected with\u000a        productions.\u000a    Jackson's work in the theatre typically involves attendance at the\u000a      whole of the first week of\u000a      rehearsals, during which the groundwork on text and a rough outline of the\u000a      performance is\u000a      reached, and at subsequent rehearsals and run-throughs as appropriate into\u000a      the final period of\u000a      technical and dress rehearsals and previews, including additional\u000a      preparatory work on text with\u000a      individual actors. Beginning in the 2008-9 season, Jackson acted as text\u000a      consultant on five\u000a      productions of Shakespeare plays directed by Michael Grandage at the\u000a      Donmar Warehouse in the\u000a      West end and on tour. The Donmar productions in question were Othello,\u000a      Twelfth Night, and\u000a      Hamlet (2008-9); King Lear (2010-11); and Richard II\u000a      (2012-13). Othello and Richard II each\u000a      played for three months at the Donmar Warehouse (which seats 250) and Twelfth\u000a        Night and\u000a      Hamlet played at Wyndham's Theatre (seats 956) in London. Hamlet\u000a      also ran on Broadway from\u000a      12 September to 6 December 2009. King Lear, after a run of three\u000a      months at the Donmar, had a\u000a      national tour in the UK before transferring to the Harvey Lichtenstein\u000a      Theater at Brooklyn Academy\u000a      of Music (seats 874) in June 2011. All productions played to capacity or\u000a      near-capacity audiences in\u000a      London and on tour. Lear was broadcast internationally in HD: its\u000a      total audience was calculated\u000a        by the company at 180,000 (see source 1 below). Othello was\u000a      recorded for radio by the BBC and\u000a      distributed on CD in 2009. In the 2013-14 season Jackson has worked in the\u000a      same capacity on\u000a      productions of A Midsummer Night's Dream and Henry V in\u000a      the Michael Grandage Company's\u000a      season at the Noel Coward Theatre.\u000a    Michael Grandage is clear about the impact of Jackon's research on his\u000a      work, he states that\u000a      through productions detailed above Jackson `has offered invaluable\u000a        textual support to myself\u000a        and the actors during rehearsals as well as performance. ... During\u000a      my time at the Donmar the\u000a      many Shakespeare productions that I worked on all involved Russell Jackson\u000a      and all of them were\u000a      a critical success that took the theatre's standing to a new level.

David Walliams\u000a      summarises Jackson's position in relation to cast and director as\u000a      providing `help in understanding\u000a      the bollocks that Shakespeare wrote' (source 4).\u000a    In May-July 2013 Jackson worked in the same capacity with Kenneth Branagh\u000a      and Rob Ashford on\u000a      Macbeth. This production played for 18 performances in a 280-seat\u000a      venue in Manchester as part of\u000a      the Manchester International Festival, a sold-out event seen live by an\u000a      audience of approximately\u000a      5000). Reviews included enthusiastic endorsement by the New York Times\u000a      critic Ben Brantley (8\u000a      July 2013) and acclaim from British reviewers (source 5). The production\u000a      was also relayed locally\u000a      as a `big screen' event and nationally and internationally in the NT's HD\u000a      broadcast. (Specific\u000a      audience figures are not available, but National Theatre Live broadcasts\u000a      play to 23 countries,\u000a      including 250 cinemas and performing arts venues in the UK alone). An\u000a      essay by Jackson\u000a      appeared in the print programme and its online version. The production\u000a      will be revived in New York\u000a      in June 2014 as part of the Lincoln Center Festival.

For The Magistrate,\u000a      22,000 programmes have been\u000a      printed (as of January 2013) and a second run included a number that sent\u000a      out to cinemas for the\u000a      NT Live showing.\u000a    Jackson has also engaged widely with audiences for Shakespeare by giving\u000a      talks and `in\u000a      conversation' sessions with non-academic bodies in the UK and\u000a      internationally, including the\u000a      Shakespeare Guild (New York) and the English-speaking Union (Arts Club,\u000a      New York and Cosmos\u000a      Club, Washington DC), and a `talkback' session for Theatre for a New\u000a      Audience (New York) for\u000a      Peter Brook's adaptation of sonnets by Shakespeare. In 2009 he gave the\u000a      annual Shakespeare's\u000a      Birthday lecture at the Folger Shakespeare Library. His research-informed\u000a      contribution to an OU\u000a      programme on film versions of Othello has been made available to\u000a      wider audiences in education\u000a      and beyond on DVD. In 2012 Jackson shared his research with a range of\u000a      audiences by giving a\u000a      pre-performance talk for a production of The Taming of the Shrew\u000a      at the Derby Theatre,\u000a      introducing three film screenings in the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust's\u000a      `Shakespeare on Screen'\u000a      festival, and taking part with Stanley Wells and Paul Edmondson in a\u000a      webinar sponsored by the\u000a      SBT and Cambridge University Press.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Jackson has provided professional enhancement for directors and\u000a      actors by bringing his\u000a      research-led insight into the texts and acting traditions of\u000a        Shakespearean theatre to bear on\u000a      the preparation of scripts for performances.

All these have focussed in one way or another on\u000a      the relationship\u000a      between rehearsal and production process and performance, with attention\u000a      as appropriate to their\u000a      historical and cultural contexts. The research typically involves\u000a      extensive original exploration and\u000a      analysis of theatrical archive material, including script materials, and\u000a      of other documents and film\u000a      and TV productions. The recent research cited in the present case study\u000a      also builds on Jackson's\u000a      much longer career of publishing academic research in this area, with an\u000a      emphasis on the\u000a      exploration of the range and variety of possible interpretations (and\u000a      performances) of dramatic\u000a      texts. His ten years of substantial (approximately 10,000 word) annual\u000a      reviews of seasons at\u000a      Stratford-upon-Avon in Shakespeare Quarterly has directly informed\u000a      both research and practice.\u000a    Jackson's essays `Actor-Managers and the Spectacular' and\u000a      `Shakespeare in opposition: from the\u000a      1950s to the 1990s' in The Oxford Illustrated History of\u000a          Shakespeare on Stage (co-edited by\u000a      Jackson) explore theatrical performances and responses to them in\u000a      the context of the culture of\u000a      the period, both theatrical and general. This line of critical and\u000a      historical enquiry is given fuller\u000a      scope in Shakespeare at Stratford: Romeo and Juliet,\u000a      a study, informed by extensive archival\u000a      research, of Romeo and Juliet productions at Stratford since 1945.\u000a      This draws on promptbooks,\u000a      reviews and other documents to examine the variety of interpretations in\u000a      productions over a long\u000a      period, and analyses their place in the general policies of successive\u000a      artistic regimes as well as the\u000a      `climate' of the time, ranging from the post-war revival of the theatre to\u000a      its reconstruction of the\u000a      RSC as a subsidized company in the 1960s, and subsequent developments.\u000a      Here, as in other\u000a      research, the priorities and achievements of performance are measured\u000a      against (literary) critical\u000a      approaches of the period(s) in question. The study of film adaptations\u000a      is represented by the\u000a      monograph Shakespeare Films in the Making, a detailed\u000a      analysis of five major films, drawing on\u000a      studio files, script drafts, reviews and publicity materials; articles on\u000a      a 1910-11 silent version of\u000a      Richard III filmed on stage at Stratford-upon Avon; and on a\u000a      TV production and film project on\u000a      Richard II by the American actor\/director Maurice Evans.\u000a      Jackson's edited collection The\u000a          Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare on Film, featuring his\u000a      introduction and essay, offers an\u000a      overview of important aspects of this field. His monograph Theatres\u000a          on Film: How the Cinema\u000a          Imagines the Stage carries Jackson's work on film and its\u000a      relationship with theatre into a related\u000a      but wider area of study, again combining analysis of performance choices\u000a      with discussion of their\u000a      artistic and social context in film and theatre history.\u000a    Research of this kind is also a two-way process, in which academic\u000a        research, with an emphasis\u000a      on archival investigation, has informed Jackson's practical experience\u000a      in theatre and film,\u000a      leading in turn to consolidation and enrichment of the academic work. In\u000a      the rehearsal room,\u000a      Jackson's research in performance history and in the interpretation of the\u000a      texts is brought to bear\u000a      on solo and group work with actors, and in a relationship with directors\u000a      that shares some of the\u000a      functions of an assistant director.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39119","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"1605651","Name":"Thailand"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Enriching appreciation and preserving the heritage of British Asian\u000a        theatre.

The\u000a      Project Conference brought together academics and cultural workers,\u000a      attracting artists from leading British Asian companies and producing\u000a      organisations in the UK.\u000a    These activities brought Anuradha Kapur, (director) and Girish Karnad\u000a      (playwright) from India, established dialogue between Teesri Duniya\u000a      Theatre, a South Asian company in Canada and British Asian practitioners,\u000a      and led to an Arts Council commissioned funded public performance by\u000a      Kuljit Bhamra and Shamshad Khan, Exeter Phoenix.

This project included three seminars (London,\u000a      Birmingham and Leeds, 2010), with a brief to assess strengths and\u000a      historical failings of British Asian theatre and to consider future\u000a      directions. Ley was invited to bring `invaluable' historical\u000a        context and `insights' from the research into these discussions\u000a      (5.1). He compiled a report on each seminar and a final summary, available\u000a      online (Beyond\u000a        British Asian Theatre http:\/\/ebookbrowse.com\/beyond-british-asian-theatre-1-arcola-final-rtf-d110909430).\u000a      These were carried forward as contributions to the diversity debate, in\u000a      discussions held by the Arts Council (2011).\u000a    According to the Arts Council: `The concluding position statement that\u000a        Graham produced will play a key role in strengthening the British Asian\u000a        sector in the coming period' (5.2).\u000a    Ley was also invited to a symposium on theatre and migration, attended by\u000a      German theatre administrators and practitioners in Cologne, 2010. He was\u000a      asked to discuss the relationship between managed arts funding and\u000a      diaspora theatre in Britain, providing the symposium with a wider context\u000a      for discussing the German situation. This was considered `truly\u000a        insightful to the practitioners present' providing `inspiring resources\u000a        for practitioners here' (5.3). His presentation was included in a\u000a      subsequent publication: Wolfgang Schneider (ed), Theater und\u000a        Migration: Herausforderungen f&#252;r Kulturpolitik und Theaterpraxis,\u000a      (transcript Verlag, Bielefeld, 2011).\u000a    Deepening public understanding of British Asian heritage in Southall.\u000a      The British Asian project led to Daboo becoming a partner of The Southall\u000a      Story organisation, supporting the promotion and sustainability of British\u000a      Asian culture. This partnership led to significant public engagement,\u000a      which has proved `invaluably nurturing, healing and transformational\u000a        for the community' (5.5) The project has included:\u000a    Public exhibition of Ammy Phull's photographs (Exeter 2009) curated by\u000a      Daboo as part of Black History Month and One World Week, including a\u000a        specially-commissioned public performance by Bhamra and Maan.\u000a    Southall Story Exhibition at the Southbank Centre, London (2010). Daboo\u000a      was consultant and wrote the section on theatre. The opening event\u000a      attracted an audience of 1500 (Southbank Centre figures). The exhibition\u000a      was re-mounted at the Dominion Centre in Southall (2011). The opening\u000a      event (introduced and hosted by Daboo) included talks and performances by\u000a      local practitioners represented (5.5).\u000a    Daboo and the project's three consultants (Bhamra, Maan and Phull) ran a\u000a      six month oral history project (2011) in Featherstone High School,\u000a      Southall, first with the whole school, then with students from year 9, who\u000a      created a website of school findings. This work has now been embedded into\u000a      the curriculum for GCSE History. In 2012, there were two further\u000a      workshops. These activities gave students skills in research, oral\u000a      history, art and design, and IT, while enhancing their sense of identity\u000a      and cultural heritage. This has resulted in the Southall Story becoming an\u000a      established part of the History curriculum in the school, with Bhamra,\u000a      Phull and Daboo being invited back to give workshops and set up projects\u000a      annually. A teacher comments that `the students greatly benefitted from\u000a        the fresh ideas and knowledge of external professionals from a creative\u000a        field' (5.6).\u000a    A workshop was held at the Royal Geographical Society, July 2012, with\u000a      invited students from Punjabi and Somali backgrounds. This workshop\u000a      concerned tracing patterns of migration in their families and has led to\u000a      further projects relating to immigration that has given greater\u000a      understanding and relationship to family origins, as well as bringing\u000a      communities together. This was further strengthened by an arts event led\u000a      by Daboo in association with the Southall Community Alliance which created\u000a      new links between the Punjabi and Tamil communities, which has been built\u000a      since on by the SCA since to help bridge difficult issues between the\u000a      communities. The impact of Daboo's work here is that this approach using\u000a      arts events will be used by the SCA in future conduct of such community\u000a      negotiations.\u000a    Daboo and the project's research assistant, Sukhwant Dhaliwal presented a\u000a      special radio broadcast on Desi Radio in Southall, July 2012, with phone\u000a      contributions from the community. This led to members of the community\u000a      both phoning in and coming in person to the radio station to express how\u000a      much they appreciated the history of their town being told in this way.\u000a    In consultation with Daboo and her team, the important and previously\u000a      unpublished archive of the National Association of Asian Youth, from\u000a      archives held by Ravi Jain, is being digitized by the SCA. When complete,\u000a      this will make accessible significant material about a little-known\u000a      history, enhancing the study of British Asian culture, performance, and\u000a      activism. The archive will be mirrored by EDA in Exeter.\u000a    Daboo has produced a film about the Southall Black Sisters (SBS)\u000a      organisation, which is directed by project consultant, and award winning\u000a      film-maker, Shakila Maan, who has also been a case worker for SBS. The\u000a      documentary film showcases the work of the SBS, and will be distributed to\u000a      community groups, educational organisations, and at conferences and\u000a      events. This will further the Maan's own career, as well as giving long\u000a      term impact to the SBS through the film, which they have wanted to make\u000a      for some time. The film-maker says: `This video will act as an archive\u000a        of the work that SBS does, forming an important part of the\u000a        documentation of this organisation's prolific output of challenging and\u000a        ground-breaking work.'\u000a    Further long-term impact will be generated through touring the\u000a      Southall Story exhibition to the India International Centre in Delhi in\u000a      November 2013. Daboo will be attending, along with the three artistic\u000a      consultants, and running a Festival of British Asian Culture including a\u000a      film festival, concert, and workshops. This will give international reach\u000a      to the project, as well as benefitting the work of the three consultants,\u000a      and the other British Asian artists whose work will be shown as part of\u000a      the Festival. Following this, Daboo and the three consultants will travel\u000a      to Bangkok as guests of Chulalongkorn University, to undertake an oral\u000a      history project with the diasporic Indian communities in Bangkok, as well\u000a      as to show The Southall Story.\u000a    The digital archive from the Southall project will be placed in the\u000a      Dominion Arts and Education Centre in Southall for public access in\u000a      January 2014, with a copy lodged with Exeter Digital Archive. This will\u000a      benefit the communities through having this history available to them, as\u000a      well as giving economic impact to the town by having additional visitors\u000a      coming to the access the archive.\u000a    Daboo is also consultant on a Heritage Lottery project that is conducting\u000a      an oral history of first generation Zoroastrians in Britain, which led to\u000a      an exhibition that toured around the UK, the first such project to\u000a      document this history, thus giving long term visibility about this history\u000a      for the first time.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The British Asian Theatre Project (2004-2009), involved researchers from\u000a      the Centre for Performance Histories and Cultures.

The underpinning research worked within a number\u000a      of theoretical frames (contemporary performance practice, imperial and\u000a      post-colonial theory, revisionist historiography) to establish the\u000a      position of British Asian performance within British and diasporic\u000a      national performance practices, and to identify, collate, and preserve the\u000a      archival records of these performance practices. The quality of this\u000a      research is evidenced by the award of three peer-reviewed AHRC grants for\u000a      aspects of the work over the REF period, with publication of results in\u000a      peer-reviewed journals and with a scholarly press.\u000a    Professor Graham Ley (1995-) is the lead scholar in the\u000a      underpinning research for this case study; his most recent research from\u000a      the project is returned at REF2. Ley's work on Tara Arts (Theatre\u000a      of Migration and the Search for a Multicultural Aesthetic: Twenty Years of\u000a      Tara Arts, New Theatre Quarterly, 1997) established a sound\u000a      theoretical basis for a re-evaluation of the achievements of this company\u000a      in the context of diasporic South Asian culture. Ley used his research\u000a      expertise in classical Greek theatre as a starting point from which to\u000a      explore continuities between western and oriental traditions, culminating\u000a      in a ground-breaking article (`Aristotle's Poetics, Bharatamuni's\u000a      Natyasastra, and Zeami's Treatises: Theory as Discourse,' Asian\u000a        Theatre Journal (17:2) Fall 2000) which established the critical\u000a      grounds for a comparative study of Greek, Sanskrit and Japanese aesthetic\u000a      performance theories.\u000a    The AHRC-funded British Asian Theatre Project (&#163;262k, 2004-9, PI Ley)\u000a      was hosted by Drama's Centre for Performance Histories and Cultures. The\u000a      project addressed the under-representation of British-Asian theatre in\u000a      records of British performance, and provided documentation and critical\u000a      analysis of British Asian theatre since its establishment in the\u000a      mid-1970s, with an associated historical investigation of the presence and\u000a      roles of Asian performers in the British theatre before 1975.\u000a    Dr Jerri Daboo (2004-), as CI on the British Asian Theatre\u000a      project, published research from 2005 drawn from the project. Her\u000a      peer-reviewed articles concerned the teaching of Asian forms of\u000a      performance in Higher Education (Contemporary Theatre Review, Studies\u000a        in Theatre and Performance). She has also written a chapter for Ley\u000a      and Dadswell (2012). Her involvement in impact activities includes\u000a      collaborations with Asian cultural workers (Ammy Phull, Kuljit Bhamra,\u000a      Shakila Maan) and with the Southall Story organisation, such as the\u000a      large-scale exhibition of The Southall Story as part of the Alchemy\u000a      festival at the Southbank Centre, London (2010) and later at the Dominion\u000a      Centre, Southall (2011). These initial pilot projects relating to Southall\u000a      have led to\u000a    Daboo becoming PI on a 27-month research project funded by the\u000a      AHRC entitled 'The Southall Story: a cultural history of Britain's \"Little\u000a      India\" from 1979' (2011-2013). The research undertaken in this project\u000a      spans cultural, social and political organisations and events, as well as\u000a      the lives and careers of key performance practitioners within the\u000a      community. The project continues to 2013. A public engagement project to\u000a      extend the impact of this work is funded through the AHRC Follow-on\u000a      Funding scheme July-December, 2013.\u000a    Stephen Hodge (1995-), Senior Lecturer, programmes performance and\u000a      dance at Exeter Phoenix and was also co-investigator on the project.

A second\u000d\u000a      work, The Echo Chamber, was created with Arts Council Funding, in\u000d\u000a      Cardiff, 2012. The award-winning series of Beckett productions, The\u000d\u000a        Beckett Project (3.2) toured to the Malta Arts Festival in 2012 and\u000d\u000a      continued in Cork with Play+ in collaboration with Gaitkrash at\u000d\u000a      the Cork Sculpture Factory (2011) and Cork Opera House (2012).\u000d\u000a    Loukes co-created and performed in the award-winning, critically\u000d\u000a      acclaimed (5.4) production The Idiot Colony (3.4) with her\u000d\u000a      company, RedCape Theatre, which entertained audiences at 92 public\u000d\u000a      performances at significant UK venues.

Theoretical questions\u000d\u000a      and developments of best practice are part of our research infrastructure.\u000d\u000a      The work of Senior Research Fellow Peter Hulton in archiving and\u000d\u000a      documentation is practice-based research in its experimental and practical\u000d\u000a      investigations into appropriate modes of documentation. Hulton's work on\u000d\u000a      Exeter Digital Archives (EDA), founded in 2004, is to create an\u000d\u000a      international spread of archives, brought together under one imprint in\u000d\u000a      order to acknowledge the dynamic range of contemporary performance\u000d\u000a      practice; these are available as a resource for performance practice\u000d\u000a      research. Hulton has pioneered methods of documenting and annotating\u000d\u000a      performance, and has provided DVDs to accompany publications, pioneering\u000d\u000a      such use of audio-visual material. His work is facilitated by dedicated\u000d\u000a      Drama Technical manager and technicians, employed full-time to support\u000d\u000a      uses of IT in the Department's research and teaching.\u000d\u000a    Hulton is 'One of the only people to attempt to document\u000d\u000a        performance practice on a systematic basis' and his `indispensible' work\u000d\u000a        at Exeter Digital Archives (5.6) has been seminal to a recent shift\u000d\u000a      within British publishing towards the distribution of audio-visual\u000d\u000a      material related to performing arts (conversations with Routledge\u000d\u000a      `inspired [the editor] to look seriously at the idea of creating [their]\u000d\u000a      own archive') (5.6). Hulton was invited to join this editorial\u000d\u000a      board, and several of his recordings will be released in new editions in\u000d\u000a      the series. Similarly, his involvement with Methuen publishing informs\u000d\u000a      their new audio-visual releases. Further independent ventures have made\u000d\u000a      work of companies available internationally. Echo Arts (Cyprus) note that\u000d\u000a      `All these projects added to the history of Echo Arts in international\u000d\u000a        exchange and further to our existing work on art across the divide and\u000d\u000a        art beyond borders.' (5. 7) For example, four DVD-ROMs in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with EDA (2003, 2006) have raised the profiles of Theatre\u000d\u000a      Alibi and Foursight Theatre internationally.

Zarrilli's research draws on his own lifelong training in Asian\u000d\u000a      cultural practices, e.g. mastery of Indian and Chinese martial arts (kalarippayattu\u000d\u000a      and taiqiquan), and extensive practical experience with noh\u000d\u000a      and kathakali. Zarrilli's workload is balanced so as to allow him\u000d\u000a      appropriate periods of time during the year when these professional impact\u000d\u000a      activities can be carried out. Since the mid 1990s he has taught and\u000d\u000a      applied his training methods worldwide. In 2001 he established the first\u000d\u000a      'traditional' earth-floor Kalari outside India&#8212;the Tyn y parc CVN\u000d\u000a      Kalari\/Studio in West Wales&#8212;recognized by the CVN Kalari Sangham. In 2000\u000d\u000a      he also established The Llanarth Group, an international association of\u000d\u000a      theatre\/performance artists whose work utilizes Zarrilli's psychophysical\u000d\u000a      actor training.\u000d\u000a    At Exeter since 2003, Rebecca Loukes' research into the\u000d\u000a      methodologies of Elsa Gindler and intercultural training (particularly\u000d\u000a      through the yogic and kalaripayattu traditions) has been key to\u000d\u000a      the work of her company, RedCape Theatre, founded in 2008, and has also\u000d\u000a      informed workshops for audience members. Her recent publications and\u000d\u000a      practical research have explored approaches to contemporary physical\u000d\u000a      theatre training. RedCape has produced three productions to date (2008 and\u000d\u000a      two in 2011), gaining substantial funding, two awards (finalising in three\u000d\u000a      others) and critical acclaim. Loukes' publications have also helped to\u000d\u000a      disseminate and raise the profile of Gindler's work internationally.\u000d\u000a    The excellence of Zarrilli's and Loukes' research is\u000d\u000a      evidenced by external grant awards to support their research (ACE, AHRC),\u000d\u000a      and publication in a peer-reviewed journals and leading international\u000d\u000a      scholarly publishers (Routledge).

This test-bed production received the following\u000d\u000a      awards: Southern Region Health and Social Care Mental Health Award\u000d\u000a      (2005) National Institute of Mental Health in England (NIMHE) Positive\u000a        Practice Award (2005), NIMHE Service User Involvement Award\u000d\u000a      (2005).\u000d\u000a    Somers' publications and papers have detailed the findings of the\u000d\u000a      research and helped to disseminate these discoveries further in\u000d\u000a      peer-reviewed publications (3.1-5).\u000d\u000a    Somers' development of community theatre has also been innovative,\u000d\u000a      including twelve theatre projects and the foundation of a community\u000d\u000a      theatre school in Payhembury, East Devon. This work is distinctive in\u000d\u000a      identifying ways to widen the skills base in the community and to improve\u000d\u000a      levels of engagement and participation in theatre activity through\u000d\u000a      targeted training, informing publications (e.g. 3.2).\u000d\u000a    In addition, Somers founded the journal Research in Drama\u000d\u000a        Education, the leading international journal in the\u000d\u000a    field, and is founding director of a related triennial international\u000d\u000a    research conference that attracted researchers from thirty-two countries in\u000d\u000a    2008 (its sixth meeting) and which has become the premier international\u000d\u000a    research event in Applied Drama. Prior to awards made within the impact\u000d\u000a    period (4), Somers' gained an American Alliance of Theatre and Education\u000d\u000a      Special Recognition Award (2003).\u000d\u000a    Somers' establishment of Applied Theatre as a major research field in\u000d\u000a      both publication and practice has established a strong grounding for\u000d\u000a      developing theatre's impact on wellbeing, healthcare and medicine in the\u000d\u000a      Drama department at Exeter. Our Centre for Performance, Sciences, and\u000d\u000a      Community has been formed to support this work. At present, there are\u000d\u000a      ongoing funded projects being undertaken by Harpin (2010-), Goldingay\u000d\u000a        (2010-), Milling (1995-), and Schaefer (2007-) which will\u000d\u000a      lead to further impact in this important field.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39425","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    What's Going On? (WGO) was the basis of an ongoing 10-year\u000d\u000a      investment of &#163;97.5m from the Scottish Government for the Youth Music\u000d\u000a      Initiative (YMI), managed initially by the Scottish Arts Council and\u000d\u000a      latterly by Creative Scotland. It was highly influential in shaping and\u000d\u000a      informing successive Scottish governments' policies towards to youth music\u000d\u000a      and remains a foundation for policy, planning and funding of youth music\u000d\u000a      across Scotland.\u000d\u000a    Since 2005-6, &#163;10m has been disbursed each year by the YMI, &#163;8m by means\u000d\u000a      of the formula designed by the research team of WGO to Scottish local\u000d\u000a      authorities, and a further &#163;2m through individual awards made by Creative\u000d\u000a      Scotland.\u000d\u000a    A key recommendation of WGO was that there should be advocacy for `youth\u000d\u000a      music opportunities, as an entitlement, for all young people in Scotland'\u000d\u000a      and that `ways of targeting support to Primary schools' should be sought.\u000d\u000a      The YMI took this up, with the principal target that every child in\u000d\u000a      Scotland would receive a year's free music tuition by the end of Primary 6\u000d\u000a      (the so-called `P6 target'). According to Creative Scotland's data, this\u000d\u000a      has been achieved. &#163;8m per annum is now spent to sustain this target\u000d\u000a        year on year.\u000d\u000a    WGO recommended the foundation of funding schemes `to support strategic\u000d\u000a      priorities within the informal sectors'. &#163;2m per annum is disbursed to\u000d\u000a        a wide range of organisations and individuals for these `informal'\u000d\u000a      activities, which take place outwith the context of formal education. WGO\u000d\u000a      argued for the establishment of `different levels of funding schemes\u000d\u000a      including easy-to-access awards schemes for smaller projects and\u000d\u000a      longer-term schemes for sustaining successful existing projects'. This\u000d\u000a      approach was taken up in the YMI: as of May 2013, there had been 379\u000d\u000a      successful awards to the Access to Music Making \/ Small &amp; Large Grant\u000d\u000a      funds, totalling &#163;5.93m and leveraging &#163;3.76m in partnership funding (of\u000d\u000a      which &#163;2.37m has been in cash contributions).\u000d\u000a    WGO recommended `work with strategic partners ... to raise awareness of\u000d\u000a      participatory music', and the YMI has worked with, and disbursed\u000d\u000a      significant sums to, a number of partners to achieve this. These include\u000d\u000a      The Scottish Brass Band Association, the Scottish Premier League Trust's\u000d\u000a      Music Box and the Scottish Music Centre. Singing emerged as a particularly\u000d\u000a      weak aspect of Scottish youth music in WGO, and the YMI has worked closely\u000d\u000a      with the National Youth Choir of Scotland since its inception, broadening\u000d\u000a      its remit and significantly increasing its reach across Scotland.\u000d\u000a    WGO highlighted that early years music was a major gap in provision in\u000d\u000a      2002. The YMI's response to this finding in funding the Scottish Book\u000d\u000a      Trust's Bookbug Rhymetimes initiative provides a good illustration of the\u000d\u000a      reach and significance of the impact of the YMI, which has supported these\u000d\u000a      music and language sessions for the very young (usually held in local\u000d\u000a      libraries) since 2007; since 2008 over 900 Bookbug Session Leaders have\u000d\u000a      been trained across all 32 Scottish local authorities, resulting in more\u000d\u000a      than a million attendances at Bookbug sessions.\u000d\u000a    WGO highlighted the lack of funding opportunities for young rock and pop\u000d\u000a      musicians in 2002. The YMI responded to this by developing schemes to\u000d\u000a      support burgeoning stars: In 2012-13 it funded opportunities for 73 young\u000d\u000a      bands to record their first demo in a professional environment, taking the\u000d\u000a      total number of young bands to benefit from this programme to 396.\u000d\u000a    The number of young people on whom the YMI has had an impact is very\u000d\u000a      large: Creative Scotland report that there were over 1.7 million recorded\u000d\u000a      attendances at YMI funded programmes between the 2003-4 and 2010-11 (when\u000d\u000a      detailed monitoring of this kind ceased). The effect on the employment\u000d\u000a      context for music leaders has been similarly significant, with (for\u000d\u000a      example) 194.94 FTE staff (586 individuals) employed by local authorities\u000d\u000a      through YMI funding in 2007-8.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    In 2003, the publication of What's Going On? was greeted by a\u000d\u000a      banner headline on the front page of The Herald newspaper,\u000d\u000a      reporting one of its findings: `100,000 children denied access to music\u000d\u000a      tuition'.

In the assessment period, however, John Tiffany and\u000a      Lorne Campbell have specifically\u000a      commented on the impact that Steen's work has had on them as directors.\u000a      Tiffany focuses on the\u000a      communicative power of a fully embodied voice:\u000a    I came to work at the National Theatre of Scotland and the second show I\u000a      did was Black Watch, which\u000a      Ros and I worked on, and because I met those boys very, very soon after\u000a      they had come back from\u000a      Iraq and we interviewed a lot of them, I felt it a real duty to get their\u000a      voice right because this was their\u000a      story.\u000a    It is during the time of the National Theatre of Scotland that I have\u000a      been privileged to work with Ros\u000a      [...] and have started to do all the voice work that Ros has been doing\u000a      from Roy Hart through to\u000a      Nadine George.

Following his work with Steen,\u000a      Campbell received a bursary from the Scottish Arts Council to further\u000a      explore `how, within the structures and\u000a      practice of British Theatre, a director can develop a non-intellectual\u000a      language for directing actors and\u000a      creating performance . . . based around precepts of variation rather than\u000a      rehearsed repetition'.\u000a    Moving beyond Earthing the Electric, Steen's collaborators have\u000a      included Nicholas Bone (Magnetic North),\u000a      who has commented on the heightened integration of text and actor that\u000a      Steen's approach facilitates, noting\u000a      its transformative impact on him:\u000a    I was intrigued by the way [Steen's approach] seemed to connect the\u000a      actors to the text so well and I\u000a      asked Ros to work on a production of a Linda McLean play called Word\u000a        for Word with my own\u000a      company, Magnetic North. Again, I was conscious of the connection the work\u000a      seemed to build\u000a      between the actor and the text. I was also astonished by the extraordinary\u000a      sounds the actors\u000a      produced: several times I literally felt the resonances of an actor\u000a      standing next to me as they worked\u000a      up and down the octaves with Ros ... once you have uncovered the\u000a      possibilities of the voice it is\u000a      impossible to step back from that knowledge. (ed. Steen, R. Growing\u000a        Voices (Glasgow: Royal\u000a      Conservatoire of Scotland, 2013), 40.)\u000a    Likewise, playwright Linda McLean has reflected on the impact of Steen's\u000a      approach to her own development\u000a      and, in particular, the development of the first production of her play Sex\u000a        and God.\u000a    The voice work that we did before rehearsals was so much more than a\u000a      vocal warm-up. It's quite\u000a      hard to describe what happens in the room ... Some power and energy that\u000a      hides in the crevices of\u000a      the body is liberated and the air in the room literally trammels with it.\u000a      When they speak the lines of\u000a      dialogue they are enlivened, and not by some actorly technique but by a\u000a      focus and breath you\u000a      equate with a fine instrument. (ibid., 53.)\u000a    Nicola McCartney &#8212; playwright, director, dramaturg and Lecturer in\u000a      Writing for Performance at the University\u000a      of Edinburgh explains how participation in Steen's research has changed\u000a      her practice:\u000a    Ros's unique approach ... has had a profound impact on my own writing ...\u000a      It has deepened my\u000a      understanding of the necessity of dialogue having a physical impulse in\u000a      the body of the writer, an\u000a      energy; of the written script being almost like a type of musical notation\u000a      which the actor then plays\u000a      through the instrument of their own energy, voice and body ... I have come\u000a      to view the creative\u000a      process of the playwright and the actor as the same but in reverse: the\u000a      dramatist finds the words to\u000a      express the impulse; the actors work back from the words to find the\u000a      impulse which originally was\u000a      born in the body of the playwright. (ibid., 42.)\u000a    The impact of Steen's research on the writer A. L. Kennedy is\u000a      specifically reflected in the latter's essay `Proof\u000a      of Life' in her collection On Writing (A.L. Kennedy, On\u000a        Writing (London: Jonathan Cape, 2013), 311-338).\u000a    Impact on audiences\u000a    Black Watch is the single most important production of the\u000a      National Theatre of Scotland, playing to over\u000a      200,000 people worldwide and garnering multiple awards and commendations;\u000a      it has been in continuous\u000a      production throughout the assessment period (AP). The reviews that have\u000a      accompanied other work, such as\u000a      John Tiffany's Macbeth (with Alan Cumming) and Nicholas Bone's\u000a      production of Sex and God by Linda\u000a      MacLean (both of which have been substantially shaped in development by\u000a      Steen's approach), give a strong\u000a      indication of the mediated impact of Steen's research on audiences through\u000a      work that has been first\u000a      mounted in since 2008. In reviews of these pieces, the voice work and its\u000a      impact is a prominent theme:\u000a    Macbeth\u000a    As he shifts between the major (and some minor) characters of the play,\u000a      Cumming is as compelling\u000a      in crazed dialogue as in soliloquy ... It is a performance of\u000a      extraordinary vocal dexterity and physical\u000a      energy ... Deserving of its standing ovation on opening night, this\u000a      Macbeth is, surely, guaranteed\u000a      success when it transfers to New York next month.

This method may impact on key interpretative decisions (as Macbeth)\u000a      or on the building of an\u000a      ensemble (as in Black Watch); and it results in a radical\u000a      realignment of rehearsal room hierarchies.\u000a    Building on the work of Nadine George, Steen uses the notion of four\u000a      qualities in the voice (conventionally\u000a      described as the high and low `male' and `female' qualities) to realise\u000a      the maximal exploration of an\u000a      individual's vocal potential. By reaching the outer limits of\u000a      expressivity, a deep emotional connection is\u000a      formed between the voice, text and actor, and this, in turn, illuminates\u000a      new insights and interpretative turns in\u000a      the development of a performance.\u000a    Steen's initial innovation came in 1997, when she worked as voice\u000a      director (then, an unusual role) with Philip\u000a      Howard on Knives in Hens by David Harrower, using the Nadine\u000a      George voice technique on a daily basis as\u000a      the main rehearsal strategy. An AHRB award in 2000 (`New Directions for\u000a      the Voice Specialist in Theatre')\u000a      allowed her to systematize this innovative professional practice in a\u000a      research context. As part of that\u000a      process, she co-directed a new Scots translation of Solemn Mass for a\u000a        Full Moon in Summer with Howard\u000a      (2000, Traverse Theatre, Edinburgh and Barbican Centre, London), which led\u000a      to further insights into how the\u000a      expressive capacities of the individual and ensemble voice could extend\u000a      directorial and vocal practice.\u000a    Steen further pursued her research in a practice-led project for\u000a      directors, funded by the National Theatre of\u000a      Scotland: in Earthing the Electric (phase one, 2008), she worked\u000a      with the participants to explore the\u000a      connection between their own voice and their creativity. Those taking part\u000a      were all key members of the\u000a      theatrical profession in Scotland: John Tiffany (Black Watch, Once,\u000a      Macbeth), Dominic Hill, Jemima Levick\u000a      and Lorne Campbell. The initial research question was: how could vocal\u000a      techniques developed from the\u000a      Wolfsohn-Hart-George tradition resource the directors' own voices and\u000a      vocabulary as individuals and\u000a      collaborative artists, thereby enriching their physical and emotional\u000a      understanding of acting, text and\u000a      performance? Crucially, directors would feel the expressive\u000a      connection between their own embodied voice\u000a      and the audience. As Steen explains:\u000a    By repositioning the director as speaker, an embodied understanding of\u000a      this vibration between actor\u000a      and audience can complete what might otherwise remain only partially\u000a      comprehended.

Actors and\u000a      directors worked together through the\u000a      whole of the physical and vocal process, jointly exploring their voices\u000a      and developing a shared embodied\u000a      vocabulary, while also disrupting the traditional hierarchies of the\u000a      production process.\u000a    Steen's work blurs the boundaries between practice-based research and\u000a      professional practice: her research\u000a      insights are often developed through her collaboration in top-flight\u000a      professional productions, and some of\u000a      these productions communicate her insights so comprehensively\u000a      in-and-through the production that they\u000a      may legitimately be regarded as Steen's research `outputs': two such\u000a      examples are included in this REF\u000a      submission. On the other hand, she has also interrogated her practice in a\u000a      series of text publications that set\u000a      out her findings for a wider audience, both professional specialist and\u000a      academic. The integration of\u000a      embodied understanding and critical reflection that Steen fosters in the\u000a      rehearsal room is modelled in her\u000a      holistic approach to the research.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39829","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Murjas has developed a distinctive practice-led, community-based\u000d\u000a      methodology that has engaged her own diasporic Polish-British community,\u000d\u000a      which is now the second largest immigrant community in the UK, in a\u000d\u000a      sustained dialogue, through her collaboration with the Polish Cultural\u000d\u000a      Centre, London (POSK), the UK national centre for the promotion and\u000d\u000a      dissemination of Polish culture (http:\/\/www.posk.org\/).\u000d\u000a      Informing and influencing the teaching of Polish Saturday Schools also\u000d\u000a      falls under POSK's remit.

The Report on the 2010 AQA GCE Polish\u000d\u000a      Examination states that \"There were very many essays on Moralnos&#263; Pani\u000d\u000a        Dulskiej [The Morality of Mrs Dulska]\" and that it \"was the\u000d\u000a      most often discussed\". Murjas' analysis of the work is studied alongside\u000d\u000a      the original Polish text as a learning and teaching resource to assist\u000d\u000a      A-level learning on this text.\u000d\u000a    ii) Thorpe's practice-as-research with the London Jing Kun Opera\u000d\u000a      Association has led to performances of traditional Chinese theatre for\u000d\u000a      non-academic audiences, including the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum,\u000d\u000a      London, 31 January 2011, Firth Hall, Sheffield, 4 May 2010,\u000d\u000a      Waterfront Theatre, Belfast, 19 June 2009, and Northern Music\u000d\u000a      Centre, Carlisle, 25 January 2008. Several of these programmes included\u000d\u000a      workshops on Chinese theatre with school children.\u000d\u000a    Cultural enrichment and enhanced access to cultural heritage:\u000d\u000a    i) Over the REF period, Murjas's productions in Reading and London have\u000d\u000a      attracted audiences of around 1000 (23 public performances in total with\u000d\u000a      approx. 50 attendees per performance). Media and web coverage have\u000d\u000a      extended the reach of these productions.\u000d\u000a    Documentation and discussion of the performance of Miss Malicewska\u000d\u000a      and its impact on UK Polish diasporic community by CTV company TV Polonia\u000d\u000a      (aimed at the global Polish diaspora) stating its significance as the\u000d\u000a      first English translation of the play (April 2008). An extract from the\u000d\u000a      performance is still available on YouTube http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=u1h5VJy3rJI\u000d\u000a      (over 500 views).\u000d\u000a    The Polish Weekly (which is the weekend paper under the banner of\u000d\u000a      The Polish Daily) commented about Murjas's production of Ashanti:\u000d\u000a      `This effort is valued all the more by Polish communities, because it is\u000d\u000a      connected with the translation and production of Polish dramatic texts\u000d\u000a      into English... Praise and acknowledgement should perhaps above all be\u000d\u000a      given to the translator and director, thanks to whom English readers and\u000d\u000a      theatre goers can get to know Polish art and culture, along with the\u000d\u000a      Polish community'. (31st January 2010)\u000d\u000a    ii) Thorpe's research production of Lady Precious Stream was the\u000d\u000a      subject of a seven-minute `in focus' news report for the Chinese News\u000d\u000a      Channel transmitted across Europe (7th January 2012) and\u000d\u000a      included interviews with the playwright's family. A public talk about the\u000d\u000a      project, held at SOAS, was covered by the UK newspaper China Daily\u000d\u000a      (9th November 2012). This media interest indicates substantial\u000d\u000a      renewed interest in the play amongst the Chinese and Chinese-British\u000d\u000a      communities produced by the production.\u000d\u000a    Testimony from audiences\u000d\u000a    Feedback from Murjas's research production, Surviving Objects\u000d\u000a      (June 2013), includes audience questionnaires and a film of a post-show\u000d\u000a      discussion involving UK-based survivors of the Soviet deportations from\u000d\u000a      Poland and their families. They discuss the personal significance of the\u000d\u000a      performance, and its importance in relation to diasporic cultural memory\u000d\u000a      and therapeutic self-expression. The international Kresy-Siberia\u000d\u000a      Foundation, which supports survivors, disseminates their stories and\u000d\u000a      manages an extensive website that acts as a repository for survivor\u000d\u000a      testimonies, advertised the performance and the director took part in the\u000d\u000a      post-show discussion. Feedback forms from other non-academic audience\u000d\u000a      members, and interviews with them, attest to a previous lack of awareness\u000d\u000a      of this strand of Polish diasporic and British colonial history, and to a\u000d\u000a      renewed interest in memory and history. Comments from members of the\u000d\u000a      general public included the following:\u000d\u000a    `Didn't know about Polish camps in S. Africa during WWII i.e. that were\u000d\u000a      placed there... may get out old items with relatives'.\u000d\u000a    `a subject I know very little about...

She staged an\u000d\u000a      interdisciplinary devised piece, Surviving Objects, in June 2013\u000d\u000a      at the Minghella Building, University of Reading, with a series of\u000d\u000a      post-show discussions. Surviving Objects focuses on Soviet\u000d\u000a      deportations from Eastern Poland in 1940\/1, and, specifically, on Murjas\u000d\u000a      family history. The British-Polish diasporic community includes a\u000d\u000a      significant number of survivors of this atrocity and their descendants,\u000d\u000a      several of whom attended the production. Surviving Objects, told\u000d\u000a      from a survivor's perspective, articulates this little known aspect of\u000d\u000a      World War II history in theatrical form for the first time.\u000d\u000a    Independently, Thorpe has been studying traditional Chinese theatre\u000d\u000a      through archival, textual and practical modes of research, disseminated\u000d\u000a      through publication and workshops\/ conferences for both British Chinese\u000d\u000a      communities, schoolchildren and the general public.

He became interested\u000a      in the team's work through awareness of its published results and its\u000a      web-based research dissemination. Roach's dialogues with the group\u000a      enlarged his conceptual and historical understanding of the role of the TV\u000a      producer in the UK in comparison to the USA, to assist him in developing\u000a      his current career as a `showrunner' (creative producer) in the UK TV\u000a      industry and to develop plans for an academia-industry network around this\u000a      subject. In 2013, he completed a 3,000-word chapter for a second edition\u000a      of the ground-breaking academia-industry volume British Television\u000a        Drama (2000), co-edited by Bignell, reflecting on his role as\u000a      Executive Producer of BBC series Waterloo Road.

They included staff from BBC Information &amp; Archives, the\u000a      British Film Institute (BFI), the National Public Broadcasting Archives\u000a      (USA) and the Netherlands Institute of Sound and Vision. This involvement\u000a      led to collaborations and the seeking of expert advice from the research\u000a      team.\u000a    For example, the research has played a key role in defining the selection\u000a      of historic TV drama programmes in preparation for a season of screenings\u000a      in early 2014 at the BFI in London, representing the changing aesthetics\u000a      of British TV drama.

There are many appreciative comments for\u000a      the new insight provided by Smart's (Reading researcher) interview with\u000a      the TV director Darrol Blake. The interview was conducted for the AHRC\u000a      \"Spaces of TV\" research project and impacts members of the public who\u000a      engage with Reading research and gain new knowledge about historic TV\u000a      programmes they are interested in.\u000a     &#8226; Impacts on business\u000a    1) Thanks to the insights acquired through the research, in 2010-12\u000a      Bignell acted as an expert witness in a legal dispute about the\u000a      interpretation of a television contract. A TV drama scheduled for\u000a      broadcast was removed from the TV schedule until this dispute was\u000a      resolved, and this depended on crucial wording about the types of TV\u000a      production technologies used for making drama &#8212; a major area of the\u000a      University of Reading's research. Bignell wrote a 12-page report to the\u000a      court about the uses of different kinds of TV production technologies and\u000a      this had a significant impact. A partner in the law firm concerned wrote:\u000a      \"As a result of your report, our barrister has prepared a defence to\u000a      [deleted party's name] claim, which needs to be filed at [the High] Court\u000a      next Monday.

The settlement of the case and the subsequent\u000a      division of revenues for broadcast, DVD release and overseas exploitation\u000a      of the TV programme were profoundly influenced by Bignell's report.\u000a    2) In 2012, Bignell worked for the TalkTalk telecoms company via its PR\u000a      agency Good Relations, to plan and provide expert content on historically\u000a      significant TV moments for the launch of TalkTalk's new YouView TV\u000a      service.

Impact on the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse. The reconstruction of\u000a      the open-air Globe\u000a      playhouse was opened in 1997, and from its inception the plan was to\u000a      create an indoor playhouse\u000a      to stand alongside it, replicating the original Globe-Blackfriars venues\u000a      owned by Shakespeare's\u000a      company, the King's Men. Although the shell of the indoor playhouse was\u000a      built, funding did not\u000a      allow completion of its interior at that time. However, in 2009 the Globe\u000a      Trustees decided to\u000a      complete the indoor project and began to raise the necessary funding.\u000a      Research at the Globe is\u000a      led by the Architecture Research Group (ARG), which is made up of theatre\u000a      professionals, theatre\u000a      historians, experts in d&#233;cor and architects. White has been a member of\u000a      this group for over a\u000a      decade, was its chair for some years, and in the past four years has been\u000a      in constant dialogue with\u000a      the Globe about the issues surrounding the lighting of the indoor\u000a      playhouse.\u000a    The question of the evidence on which to base the design was a crucial\u000a      first step. When the\u000a      shell was built in 1997 it seemed certain that the Worcester College\u000a      drawings were by Inigo Jones,\u000a      could be dated around 1617-18 and identified with the Cockpit playhouse\u000a      built in that year in Drury\u000a      Lane. During the following decade, however, the auspices, date and\u000a      identification were challenged,\u000a      and the drawings were believed by some scholars to be by John Webb (Jones'\u000a      pupil, whose\u000a      papers are also held at Worcester College) and potentially dated later in\u000a      the century. The basis for\u000a      these arguments are explored on the DVD [2], in a discussion between\u000a      Martin White and the\u000a      leading drawings expert, Dr Gordon Higgott, filmed in the Worcester\u000a      College library. Consequently,\u000a      White was a key participant in the decision that resulted in a\u000a      recommendation by the ARG to the\u000a      Globe's Trustees that they continue to use the drawings as the basic model\u000a      for the reconstruction,\u000a      given that they remain the only extant drawings of the interior of a\u000a      Jacobean playhouse, match\u000a      every known feature of those playhouses and, importantly, had been tested\u000a      in practice by White's\u000a      research project and by his productions on reconstructed stages over a\u000a      number of years. The\u000a      Trustees accepted the ARG recommendation. [a, b].\u000a    Attention now turned to the key issue of how to light the SWP. A core\u000a      aspect of the Globe's\u000a      policy is to explore `original practices', but each theatrical decision\u000a      has to be underpinned by viable\u000a      research [4], and White's work has been fundamental in providing such\u000a      evidence. It had been\u000a      generally assumed that it would be necessary to perform using electric\u000a      candles (as is the case at\u000a      the reconstructed Blackfriars indoor playhouse in Staunton, Virginia, USA)\u000a      as opposed to real\u000a      candle-light, on the grounds that it was very unlikely that permission\u000a      would be granted to perform\u000a      publicly using candles to light the theatre. It became central to\u000a      White's work to overcome this\u000a      assumption. On 21 June 2011, a group of 30 from the Globe, including the\u000a      CEO and Artistic\u000a      Director, architects, advisors, actors, designers, etc., travelled to\u000a      Bristol to work with White and the\u000a      Drama Department's reconstruction that was put up in the Wickham Theatre\u000a      for the occasion.\u000a      Three scenes were performed using three different kinds of lighting\u000a      (candles, artificial candles and\u000a      conventional stage-lighting) followed by detailed analysis of the results\u000a      which confirmed the\u000a      preference for real candles, and the Artistic Director asked White to\u000a      return to the question of the\u000a      number of candles used and the resulting light levels. [b] As a result of\u000a      the workshop, the Globe\u000a      moved the Bristol reconstruction to London with the intention of erecting\u000a      it in the shell of the new\u000a      building to provide a template against which to test decision-making.\u000a    Clearly, live flame has a number of safety implications, and one of the\u000a      major ways in which\u000a      White has been able to make an impact is to emphasise the importance and\u000a      the unique experience\u000a      that candlelight represents, and to explain this view to the London Fire\u000a      Service and the Globe's\u000a      insurers. [b,d,e] `There has been considerable work undertaken on this\u000a      subject by Professor Martin\u000a      White at the University of Bristol. This includes the number and location\u000a      of candles, the type of wax\u000a      used in 16th century candle-making and how the candles were\u000a      operated by the stage assistants\u000a      and the actors on stage' (Fire Strategy Report, July 2012, p. 69). [e] It\u000a      is reasonable to claim that\u000a      these presentations overcame initially held doubts and helped clear the\u000a      way for the playhouse to\u000a      operate as imagined. [b, d, e] Subsequently, White's work and knowledge\u000a      has been constantly\u000a      drawn on as the fine detail of the lighting (equipment and operation) has\u000a      been finalised. [a, b, e]\u000a      With no precedents to turn to, White has advised on the positioning of the\u000a      chandeliers above the\u000a      stage and, most crucially, the height at which they should be hung (which\u000a      challenges previously\u000a      held assumptions); the composition, size and number of candles (which\u000a      White's research has\u000a      completely rethought) and the crucial but often over-looked choice of\u000a      wicks; the range and nature\u000a      of hand-held lighting instruments; and related issues such as the effect\u000a      of the paint scheme on the\u000a      candlelight and vice versa, a key decision where only practical\u000a      investigation can verify ideas drawn\u000a      from contemporary references. [c, e]\u000a    In November 2011 White was invited to visit the Court Theatre (an opera\u000a      house built in\u000a      1766 and now a World Heritage site) at Drottningholm, in Stockholm, to\u000a      work with a group of\u000a      international scholars and theatre practitioners on the question of\u000a      lighting this unique building. In\u000a      November 2012 he spent time at the Baroque Theatre Institute based in the\u000a      eighteenth century\u000a      theatre in Cesky Krumlov in the Czech Republic to test out ideas related\u000a      to the Globe project. Both\u000a      theatres are now lit by electric candles, but retain vital information\u000a      about their original candle\u000a      lighting in the form of documents, decoration and artefacts. In July 2013\u000a      the Globe sent White and\u000a      the company's Production Manager on a further visit to Cesky Krumlov, and\u000a      the combination of\u000a      these visits and White's own research have further influenced specific\u000a      decisions at the SWP. For\u000a      example, `candle torches' are frequently referred to in early modern\u000a      documents, but it was not until\u000a      White came across one at Cesky Krumlov that it has been possible to\u000a      reconstruct one for the\u000a      SWP, solving a previously puzzling problem of exactly what kind of torches\u000a      could be employed\u000a      indoors. Other key areas that White's research there has helped solve\u000a      include the design of the\u000a      chandeliers, the auditorium lighting, the paint scheme, and possible\u000a      illumination of scenic\u000a      elements, [a, b, c, d] while his contacts have resulted in developing an\u000a      ongoing relationship\u000a      between himself, the Globe and Cesky Krumlov.\u000a    There is no doubt that the prospect of working with candlelight, and its\u000a      successful\u000a      employment at the SWP, has been entered into with a confidence derived\u000a      from White's research\u000a      work. [a, b, c, d] But while the aesthetic impact of a candle lit theatre\u000a      is undeniable, Shakespeare's\u000a      Globe is a commercial organisation that receives no state funding\u000a      whatsoever, and the fact that all\u000a      available tickets for the SWP first season (opening January 2014) sold out\u000a      almost immediately is\u000a      clear evidence of the financial impact of the new playhouse and its\u000a      distinctive lighting.\u000a    2. Impact on teaching in the UK and internationally. White has\u000a      given many presentations to A-level\u000a      students in schools in Bristol on the importance of understanding the\u000a      nature of indoor playing\u000a      (not least lighting) when studying appropriate play texts. The DVD too has\u000a      been influential: `This\u000a      extraordinary and innovative DVD . . . is the closest we can come to the\u000a      intensity and subtlety of\u000a      the candlelit Jacobean playhouse. Ingenious multiple-angle shooting allows\u000a      the viewer to\u000a      experience the intimacy of the theatre from a variety of viewpoints.\u000a      Martin White's gripping and\u000a      enthusiastic introduction and interviews with historians, costume and\u000a      makeup artists make this an\u000a      invaluable resource for A level and Undergraduate students of Literature\u000a      and Drama, and shows\u000a      the possibilities of recreation for making theatre new.' [h]. The DVD\u000a      provides an `interactive and\u000a      vividly visual view of Jacobean indoor theatres. . . . A rich diachronic\u000a      dialogue between early\u000a      modern and twentieth-century performance practices . . . is the sort of\u000a      work that White excels in, as\u000a      is . . . evident from his Chamber of Demonstrations . . . that\u000a      allows the viewer to see the lighting\u000a      conditions and staging possibilities'. [g]\u000a    3. Impact on audiences beyond academia. Although it has sold to\u000a      university libraries around the\u000a      world and to individual lecturers and school teachers, the DVD is also\u000a      sold via non-academic\u000a      outlets including Amazon, French's Bookshop, the bookshops at\u000a      Shakespeare's Globe and the\u000a      National Theatre as well as via chamberofdemonstrations.com. In all, some\u000a      750 copies have been\u000a      sold. [i] It has also been disseminated to non-academic audiences through,\u000a      for example, its\u000a      inclusion in the exhibition, `Painted Pomp' at the Holburne Museum, Bath\u000a      (January-May 2013);\u000a      White's presentations to a general audience at the Globe's Annual Seminar\u000a      (February 2013) [f], the\u000a      Society for Theatre Research's `Annual Address' (May 2013) and the public\u000a      lecture at the Victoria\u000a      and Albert Museum [6] (July 2013), as part of the AHRC-funded\u000a      `Shakespearean London Theatres'\u000a      project (ShaLT): a video of White's lecture and a filmed interview on\u000a      indoor playing are available at\u000a      http:\/\/shalt.org.uk\/downloads;\u000a      the interview is also available on YouTube.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The unique and most defining feature of the indoor Jacobean playhouses\u000a      was that they gave their\u000a      performances by candlelight.

Although candle\u000a      light was an integral and\u000a      central aspect of early modern performances &#8212; influencing how plays were\u000a      written, acted and\u000a      received &#8212; there has been surprisingly little written about it and prior\u000a      to this project, no\u000a      practical\/performance-led investigation whatsoever.\u000a    The research has been carried out in four incremental phases, the fourth\u000a      of which ran\u000a      concurrently and was closely intertwined with the Globe's development of\u000a      the SWP. The first\u000a      phase, commencing in the early 1990s, comprised a programme of productions\u000a      of early modern\u000a      plays written specifically for indoor performance. The second phase\u000a      (1995-8) involved staging\u000a      selected plays in the Wickham Theatre at the Department of Drama at the\u000a      University of Bristol on a\u000a      skeleton reconstruction of an indoor playhouse. This research was further\u000a      developed in 1997 using\u000a      a more extended reconstruction thanks to a University award to Professor\u000a      White for Excellence in\u000a      Teaching and Learning. (Findings from this phase were published in White's\u000a      monograph,\u000a      Renaissance Drama in Action, Routledge, 1998.) The third phase\u000a      (2006-7) was a research project\u000a      [1] using a full-scale, fully decorated reconstructed stage and auditorium\u000a      based on seventeenth\u000a      century drawings held in the library of Worcester College, Oxford (the\u000a      drawings currently providing\u000a      the basis of the SWP), and culminating in the publication of an\u000a      interactive DVD [2] with an\u000a      associated website [3]. From the start, this phase was conceived of as a\u000a      collaboration between\u000a      academic research and the theatre industry. Core funding was provided by a\u000a      major award from the\u000a      AHRC [1], with additional significant support in kind from Shakespeare's\u000a      Globe (costume and\u000a      weaponry), the Royal Shakespeare Company (properties), and with Jenny\u000a      Tiramani and Dr Farah\u000a      Karim-Cooper [f] from the Globe, world authorities respectively on early\u000a      modern dress and make-up,\u000a      as part of the research team. The texts were performed by professional\u000a      actors with experience\u000a      of early modern plays at either the RSC or Globe, directed by Martin\u000a      White. The research sought\u000a      not only to understand the operation and effect of candlelight in all its\u000a      modes but also, on the DVD,\u000a      to demonstrate for the first time its impact on performance, using\u000a      five exemplary plays specifically\u000a      designed by their authors for indoor performance, with selected extracts\u000a      chosen to explore the\u000a      flexibility of the general stage lighting (chandeliers and wall brackets\u000a      or sconces), hand-held\u000a      candles, lanterns and torches.\u000a    The discoveries were revelatory, proving that the candles provided a\u000a      satisfactory level of\u000a      illumination (while underlining the benefits of the seats closest to the\u000a      stage) and that it was\u000a      possible to create lighting changes by extinguishing candles near the\u000a      stage and altering the height\u000a      of the chandeliers above the stage. The research also clarified\u000a      contemporary ideas of the effect of\u000a      candle light on the colour of costumes and decoration, and revealed the\u000a      different relationship\u000a      between seeing and hearing from that experienced in modern theatres or,\u000a      indeed, the open-air\u000a      Globe reconstruction. Particularly striking was the discovery (later\u000a      corroborated by White's\u000a      research contacts at Cesky Krumlov; see below) that the candles, even\u000a      those made of tallow, did\u000a      not smoke or smell when lit anywhere near as much as is often claimed in\u000a      theatre history books.\u000a    A pressing question was how to document and disseminate these major\u000a      findings. Fortunately,\u000a      this coincided with the emergence of High-Definition video recording\u000a      capability that allowed the\u000a      work to be filmed in the low light levels provided by the candles. This\u000a      was undertaken by a\u000a      commercial film production company, Ignition Films, [i] and shot on four\u000a      linked HD cameras under\u000a      the control of Director of Photography Terry Flaxton. The DVD also\u000a      introduced the capacity for the\u000a      viewer to select viewing positions in the auditorium with no interruption\u000a      of sound or the flow of\u000a      action, both significant innovations in the documentation of performance.\u000a      The fourth phase (2009-2013)\u000a      followed the decision by the Globe Trustees to complete the indoor\u000a      playhouse and was\u000a      divided into two main areas. The first, focusing on documentary sources\u000a      and the experience of\u000a      White's practical research, was to confirm that the Worcester College\u000a      drawings would remain the\u000a      template for the reconstruction; the second was for White to focus on\u000a      further investigation into\u000a      material choices, such as between beeswax, tallow and modern alternatives,\u000a      the nature of the\u000a      wicks (more important than had previously been realised), and undertake a\u000a      detailed numerical\u000a      analysis of contemporary records to determine the number of candles that\u000a      were used to illuminate\u000a      the indoor theatres, challenging previously held assumptions [5, 6]. In\u000a      these matters, and\u000a      throughout the whole period, White has worked closely and collaboratively\u000a      with all those closely\u000a      involved in the project as the candle lighting affects virtually all\u000a      decisions.

Feedback has\u000a      been entirely positive,\u000a      enriching practising artists understanding of live art, with one\u000a      contributing artist thanking the team:\u000a      `for your work in constructing and safeguarding this special archive [...]\u000a      [I]t's brilliant that [the\u000a      resource is] interactive and so will continue to be live.'\u000a    P2: The curatorial workshop, Conserving and Archiving\u000a        Ephemeral Artworks (2008), involved 24\u000a      invited participants from significant cultural institutions, e.g. Bristol\u000a      Museum, FACT, the V&amp;A.\u000a      Digital Documentation and Performance (2009) comprised three days\u000a      of workshops\/seminars for\u000a      37 researchers, artists, curators, archivists and collection managers. The\u000a      events shared findings\u000a      and exchanged best practice for archiving and digitizing [1], with\u000a      attendees stating: `On a practical\u000a      level, Bristol's approach to the digitization of analogue videotapes fed\u000a      into the Library's then-\u000a      nascent policy in this area.'

Visited by 150,000 people, `The show\u000a      pushes at the\u000a      boundaries of conventional gallery experience and will create, we hope,\u000a      fresh insights into this\u000a      singular figure from art history.'

A new archive\u000a      was created of audiences' memories of theatre and made publicly accessible\u000a      in situ. The software\u000a      innovations made it possible for Calvium to `offer this solution to other\u000a      customers interested in an\u000a      indoor location-aware app.' MAYK director wrote: `We are excited by the\u000a      potential of the project to\u000a      transfer to other heritage contexts and developing the business model for\u000a      how this might happen.'\u000a    P1-P4: Presentations disseminated findings [1-5] to\u000a      wide-ranging audiences of arts professionals,\u000a      archivists and researchers: Jones at NRLA (Glasgow 2009), the Digital\u000a        Echoes symposium on\u000a      online archives (2013), attended by organizations including V&amp;A and\u000a      BBC; and Clarke\u000a      `Remembering Performance' (NRLA 2010), re.act.feminism, Berlin\u000a      (2009), Archiv\/Praxis,\u000a      Tanzarchiv Leipzig (2009), School of the Art Institute Chicago (2009).\u000a    P4: Clarke worked with collaborators from PRS on Group Show,\u000a      and Jones with Bodies in Flight\u000a      on Do The Wild Thing! Redux, producing performances and an\u000a      installation (Arnolfini 2012) inspired\u000a      by archival documents [6]. These were conducted in dialogue with\u000a      professional artists from Every\u000a      House has a Door and Blast Theory, who produced their own new works, 9\u000a        Beginnings (two\u000a      performances) and Jog Shuttler (installation), which 3,463 people\u000a      saw. Arnolfini's curator of\u000a      performance wrote: `The project successfully brought unique debate,\u000a      discourse and performance\u000a      commissions to Arnolfini that would not have happened otherwise, bringing\u000a      many stimulating ideas\u000a      to the table that will go on to resonate with the artistic and curatorial\u000a      performance community.'\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Two strands of research were developed within the Performing the\u000a        Archive portfolio of projects,\u000a      focusing on conservation, accessibility and the creative use of culturally\u000a      significant and unique\u000a      archives of live art and performance.

This research into the conservation of fragile analogue\u000a      videotapes, some of which were\u000a      becoming unplayable, led to innovative approaches to storage, ensuring\u000a      that no data was lost from\u000a      the original recordings and securing their long-term preservation. P3\u000a      completed the preservation of\u000a      the entire archive and made it accessible online to registered users\u000a      through a website, which\u000a      integrated the Performance Art Data Structure (PADS) and Semantic Tools\u000a      for Arts Research\u000a      (STARS) [5]. PADS had been developed in P1 by Stephen Gray\u000a      (technical lead on the digitisation\u000a      project, now Research Fellow and Senior Data Librarian) and Paul Clarke\u000a      (Research Fellow on\u000a      Performing the Archive (P2) and now Lecturer in Performance) as a\u000a      way of structuring, cataloguing\u000a      and describing data designed specifically for performance archives [1].\u000a      STARS, created in earlier\u000a      JISC- and AHRC-funded projects hosted by the University, were further\u000a      developed by ILRT (the\u000a      research and development division of Bristol's IT Services) and Angela\u000a      Piccini (Senior Lecturer in\u000a      Screen) to produce an online workspace for users, including new tools for\u000a      adding descriptions,\u000a      annotating videos and making and visualising links between works, both\u000a      within and beyond the\u000a      digital archive. Case studies, made available through the website, detail\u000a      models of best practice for\u000a      documenting performance and conserving and managing its digital\u000a      documentation. These case\u000a      studies also contain findings on the online accessibility of performance\u000a      documents and how digital\u000a      archives can facilitate the research and re-use of such documents [5].\u000a    Creative re-use: Two further projects (see P2 and P4\u000a      below) focused on how to engage as a\u000a      creator or curator with these performance archives, modelled through\u000a      dialogues and workshops\u000a      with professional practitioners, curators and researchers. For P2, artists\u000a      (Franko B, Robin Deacon,\u000a      Mike Pearson and Martha Wilson) were invited to screen material from the\u000a      archives in public\u000a      dialogues.

Findings resulted in\u000a      articles [3&amp;4], public talks, performances, installations [2],\u000a      exhibitions, symposia (September and\u000a      December 2012) and a conference (April 2013), producing the first\u000a      systematic consideration of the\u000a      theoretical, methodological and curatorial implications of these questions\u000a      around creative use and\u000a      re-use of archival material.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40339","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    In describing the impact of the research since January 2008, the\u000d\u000a      following narrative makes passing reference to impacts occurring between\u000d\u000a      October 2005 and December 2007 in order to contextualise the claim of the\u000d\u000a      two pieces to `classic' status within the genre.\u000d\u000a    The Gaia Symphony was composed piecemeal over a period of more\u000d\u000a      than ten years, though the bulk of the work took place between 2001 and\u000d\u000a      2004. All four movements were premi&#232;red separately by the NYBBW as part of\u000d\u000a      their summer courses, so the impact on young players (aged 13-18) was\u000d\u000a      in-built from the start. The composer and conductor Philip Harper,\u000d\u000a      latterly Musical Director of the Cory Band, participated in some of the\u000d\u000a      early performances and considers the impact of the experience to have\u000d\u000a      played a key role in his decision to become a professional musician: `I\u000d\u000a      first discovered John Pickard's music aged 18 and playing with the Sun\u000d\u000a      Life Band in Bristol when we performed Men of Stone at the BBC\u000d\u000a      Festival of Brass. Such multi-dimensional music had a profound impact on\u000d\u000a      my development, and I was fascinated to hear the textural and rhythmic\u000d\u000a      possibilities of the brass band, as demonstrated in this work. My own\u000d\u000a      compositions began to develop as a result of further study of John's\u000d\u000a      music, and I'm glad now to be in a position as a professional freelance\u000d\u000a      conductor where I perform John's work regularly, and continue to benefit\u000d\u000a      from further study of the scores.' [c]\u000d\u000a    Pickard's residency with the Cory Band made the music a central part of\u000d\u000a      their musical lives as they worked on sections of the piece while it was\u000d\u000a      being composed. Separate movements have continued to be performed; for\u000d\u000a      example, Part Four, Men of Stone, was given by the Cory Band at\u000d\u000a      the 2011 Royal Northern College of Music Festival of Brass (one of the\u000d\u000a      world's premier brass festivals) and Part Two, Wildfire, was\u000d\u000a      played by the National Youth Band of Great Britain at the 2012 Proms\u000d\u000a      (though impact is not being claimed in this case, for reasons explained in\u000d\u000a      section 2). Though the separate movements were not originally intended as\u000d\u000a      test pieces, Men of Stone was used for this purpose at the South\u000d\u000a      Australian Band Championships in 2002[d]. Because of its size and unusual\u000d\u000a      complexity as a complete work, the symphony requires extended and detailed\u000d\u000a      preparation to mount it in its entirety. In September 2011,\u000d\u000a      Eikanger-Bj&#248;rsvik Band of Bergen, Norway, became the first non-UK band to\u000d\u000a      perform the complete work in public, an event covered in part of a\u000d\u000a      documentary about the band, Korpsfiksert, broadcast by NRK\u000d\u000a      Norwegian television [e]. The same ensemble repeated it in March 2013,\u000d\u000a      while preparing the work's second commercial CD recording. The recording\u000d\u000a      took place on 14-16 June 2013 in Bergen with the major classical label BIS\u000d\u000a      Records. A double impact was therefore achieved: the work gave the band an\u000d\u000a      opportunity to record with an internationally renowned label and BIS\u000d\u000a      Records extended its repertoire since, of the 2000-plus recordings it has\u000d\u000a      so far issued, this is the first to feature a brass band (as opposed to a\u000d\u000a      symphonic brass ensemble). The project attracted funding of &#163;10,000 from\u000d\u000a      an anonymous benefactor, thereby bringing financial benefit to the band\u000d\u000a      and to the record company.\u000d\u000a    Since its premi&#232;re, Eden has received many performances and has\u000d\u000a      become a staple of the Championship Section of the brass band repertoire.\u000d\u000a      Paul Hindmarsh of the Brass Band Heritage Trust comments that `once the\u000d\u000a      work became more familiar, it became admired for the quality of the\u000d\u000a      invention, concept and execution. Eden remains a very taxing piece\u000d\u000a      in the repertoire &#8212; especially in its rhythmic structure. It has been used\u000d\u000a      as a contest piece on a number of occasions since 2005 and is recognised\u000d\u000a      as one of the modern Everests of the medium.' [f] Eden has been\u000d\u000a      programmed as the compulsory test piece at the Danish National\u000d\u000a      Championship (2006), the Belgian National Championship (2009) and the\u000d\u000a      English National Championship (2010). In the European Championship, it was\u000d\u000a      the `own choice' work of two bands in 2006 and one in 2009 and has been\u000d\u000a      played four times at the Norwegian National Championship (2006,'07, '08,\u000d\u000a      '10). [g]\u000d\u000a    Eden has also had a vigorous performance life beyond the world of\u000d\u000a      the brass band contest and is regularly played in public concerts.\u000d\u000a      Following its inclusion in a retrospective of Pickard's music for brass\u000d\u000a      band at Royal Northern College of Music Festival of Brass a study day was\u000d\u000a      devoted to it at the University of Durham in 2007 as part of a\u000d\u000a      postgraduate course for brass band conductors. In 2009 Pickard was invited\u000d\u000a      to give a day-long workshop on the piece in Brussels, prior to its\u000d\u000a      performance in the Belgian National Brass Band Championship. The piece has\u000d\u000a      been issued commercially in five different CD recordings: by the Leyland\u000d\u000a      Band, Black Dyke Band, BTM Band, the Stavanger Band (Norway) and\u000d\u000a      Sandefjord Brass Symposium (Norway). All recordings have been commercially\u000d\u000a      available since January 2008. A sixth commercial recording of Eden\u000d\u000a      was made by the Cory Band in May 2013 and a seventh by the\u000d\u000a      Eikanger-Bj&#248;rsvik Band in June 2013 for inclusion with BIS Records' disc\u000d\u000a      of Gaia Symphony (see above).\u000d\u000a    Although new pieces for brass band are not uncommon, both the Gaia\u000d\u000a      Symphony and Eden have been praised for setting new standards of\u000d\u000a      artistic endeavour within the medium. Consequently, they have received\u000d\u000a      unusually wide coverage within the brass band press and have managed to\u000d\u000a      spread beyond the narrow confines of the contesting circuit, penetrating\u000d\u000a      more mainstream musical events. This particular impact is corroborated by\u000d\u000a      the conductor Dr Robert Childs, who described it as `a wonderful work [. .\u000d\u000a      .] I believe it represents a turning point in brass band composition. John\u000d\u000a      Pickard has found sounds in the band that haven't been heard before and\u000d\u000a      this will be a revelation for the competition.' [h]\u000d\u000a    Eden breaks new technical ground for the medium, through its use\u000d\u000a      of complex rhythmic devices that are more frequently encountered in works\u000d\u000a      for specialist contemporary music ensembles. Musicians from both the Cory\u000d\u000a      and Eikanger-Bj&#248;rsvik bands attest to the positive effect these challenges\u000d\u000a      have had upon their musicianship: `Dr Pickard has written technically\u000d\u000a      challenging passages that have, even after 30 years playing at highest\u000d\u000a      level of brass banding, required me to extend my technique still further';\u000d\u000a      `[Eden] has made me more aware that sometimes you need to go beyond\u000d\u000a      the traditional techniques and think more outside the box'; `Eden has\u000d\u000a      developed my ability to understand and perform contemporary music.' [i]\u000d\u000a    The musical challenges these innovations present are particularly\u000d\u000a      significant since the British brass band movement remains entirely amateur\u000d\u000a      and largely associated with some of the most socially and economically\u000d\u000a      deprived areas of the UK: the South Wales Valleys; industrial East\u000d\u000a      Lancashire; South Yorkshire; the North-East. The educational element of\u000d\u000a      these challenges is therefore significant, since they expose amateur\u000d\u000a      musicians (some of them of school age) to musical innovation in a manner\u000d\u000a      that nevertheless respects the traditions of the brass band movement. That\u000d\u000a      tradition is embodied in the `narrative' underpinning of Eden,\u000d\u000a      together with allusions to the classic works of the repertoire that are\u000d\u000a      familiar to all bandsmen and women. Ray Farr, conductor of the Vardy Band\u000d\u000a      in Durham, attests not only to the work's impact on performers and\u000d\u000a      listeners, but to its contribution to developing the technique of\u000d\u000a      conductors: `The musical language, form, structure [of Eden] has\u000d\u000a      an engaging quality which is instantly appealing to musicians and\u000d\u000a      listeners. This helps a great deal to overcome the technical challenges in\u000d\u000a      performance...My performance, from the Royal Albert Hall was video\u000d\u000a      recorded, and I have used it several times to demonstrate advanced\u000d\u000a      conducting techniques in my lectures.... Both pieces [Gaia and Eden]\u000d\u000a      are massively important as they take brass band repertory a step forward'\u000d\u000a      [j]\u000d\u000a    The technical complexities of Eden have been addressed in two\u000d\u000a      web-based instructional videos created by the Cory Band between January\u000d\u000a      and May 2013 and presented on their YouTube channel. The videos\u000d\u000a      (complementing a third video featuring a complete performance) are\u000d\u000a      designed for use by ensembles that are in the process of preparing the\u000d\u000a      work.[j] Impacts from this initiative are still in the early stages, but\u000d\u000a      the videos were viewed by members of the Eikanger-Bj&#248;rsvik Band in\u000d\u000a      preparation for their CD recording, one player commenting that `Seeing the\u000d\u000a      YouTube video of Cory was really helpful for preparing this\u000d\u000a      [recording].'[k]\u000d\u000a    Eden has therefore benefited musicians outside the UK. Luc\u000d\u000a      Vertommen, conductor of the Buizingen Band in Brussels, states that: `The\u000d\u000a      band playing Eden and John commenting on the playing and giving\u000d\u000a      insight in the construction and ideas behind the piece &#8212; very worthwhile\u000d\u000a      for us... Everybody involved in this workshop was extremely please[d] with\u000d\u000a      John's background information.... Gaia is a landmark in modern day\u000d\u000a      brass band writing mainly because it's length [sic] but also because of\u000d\u000a      its great musical quality. The same can be said about Eden &#8212; a\u000d\u000a      modern classic in brass band repertoire' [l]\u000d\u000a    The standard brass band has 28 musicians, so 560 musicians worked almost\u000d\u000a      exclusively for several months to prepare the first 20 performances at the\u000d\u000a      Royal Albert Hall in 2005. Anticipation of the event was considerable,\u000d\u000a      with British Bandsman (established in 1887 and the most respected\u000d\u000a      of the numerous brass band journals) devoting a four-page cover-article to\u000d\u000a      the composer and the work in the week of the contest. In his analytical\u000d\u000a      article on the piece, Professor Philip Wilby commented that `it is vital\u000d\u000a      that the movement seeks to encourage new works from composers such as\u000d\u000a      Pickard. They refresh our repertoire, build up our wider credibility and\u000d\u000a      keep us all in touch with new trends in contemporary music'. [m] At the\u000d\u000a      premi&#232;re, the audience numbered approximately 4,000 and the winning\u000d\u000a      performances were broadcast nationally.\u000d\u000a    Though smaller in scale, a similar pattern pertains for the later\u000d\u000a      appearances of the work in contests. The five commercial CD releases (with\u000d\u000a      a further two recorded for release outside the review period) have spread\u000d\u000a      the work's reputation worldwide and Eden continues to be performed\u000d\u000a      in contests and concerts in the UK and abroad.\u000d\u000a    In 2006 Eden was shortlisted in the British Composer Awards [n]\u000d\u000a      and the reputation of both works and its composer has also influenced\u000d\u000a      several current students in their choice of Bristol University as their\u000d\u000a      study destination for degrees ranging from BA to PhD.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Professor John Pickard's brass band compositions, Gaia Symphony\u000d\u000a      and Eden, have been performed, broadcast and recorded nationally\u000d\u000a      and internationally. Written respectively for performance by young\u000d\u000a      musicians and high-level amateurs, the success of the Gaia\u000d\u000a      Symphony led to the commissioning of Eden as the test piece for\u000d\u000a      the final of the 2005 National Brass Band Championships of Great Britain.\u000d\u000a      Through a combination of technical challenge and distinguished musical\u000d\u000a      content, Gaia Symphony and Eden have brought to many of\u000d\u000a      these performing groups innovative musical techniques and fresh ways of\u000d\u000a      thinking about the medium, while brass band audiences in Britain and\u000d\u000a      overseas have gained a new awareness of musical structures and devices\u000d\u000a      more usually encountered in the `classical' concert tradition.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Bristol\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Bristol (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Bristol","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South West","UKPRN":10007786}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"3161732","Name":"Bergen"},{"GeoNamesId":"2800867","Name":"Bruxelles-Capitale"},{"GeoNamesId":"3140390","Name":"Sandefjord"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a[1] Gaia Symphony (Duration:62 minutes)\u000d\u000a      Commissioned by: National Youth Brass Band of Wales\/Cory Band\u000d\u000a      First performance: Cheltenham Music Festival by the Cory Band cond.

While Wildfire's\u000a      impact as an independent work has been significant, it is not being\u000d\u000a      submitted as part of the present Case Study.\u000d\u000a    The intellectual seriousness with which the Gaia Symphony treats\u000d\u000a      a medium that is often more associated with light entertainment was\u000d\u000a      recognised in The Guardian newspaper's description of the 2004\u000d\u000a      premi&#232;re as `a virtuoso performance that broke various barriers of\u000d\u000a      perception'. [a]\u000d\u000a    On the strength of the work completed with the Cory Band, Pickard was\u000d\u000a      commissioned by the Brass Band Heritage Trust to compose Eden as a\u000d\u000a      test piece for the 2005 National Brass Band Championships final at the\u000d\u000a      Royal Albert Hall, London. A test piece is a musical work that is\u000d\u000a      performed by each competing band in a contest. The composition itself is\u000d\u000a      designed to challenge the performers' individual and collective\u000d\u000a      virtuosity. Performances are given consecutively and anonymously, to a\u000d\u000a      jury whose view of the bands is shielded in order to ensure fair practice.\u000d\u000a      Aware that the Cory Band would be competing in the contest, Pickard\u000d\u000a      demitted his residency with them prior to composing the work.\u000d\u000a      Nevertheless, the experience of working closely with such outstanding\u000d\u000a      musicians was of seminal importance in terms of the confidence and\u000d\u000a      virtuosity with which the medium is handled in the piece. The title, while\u000d\u000a      playing on a long-established tradition of predicating brass band\u000d\u000a      compositions on biblical themes, also references ecological and humanistic\u000d\u000a      concerns symbolised by the Eden Project at St. Austell in Cornwall. The\u000d\u000a      local St Austell Band gave the world premi&#232;re, since they happened to play\u000d\u000a      first at the contest for which the music was written (a process determined\u000d\u000a      by drawing lots). This was the first, and so far the only, time in their\u000d\u000a      history that the band had reached the national final. Reference to the\u000d\u000a      work on the band's website attests to the continued impact of the\u000d\u000a      composition on these performers. [b]\u000d\u000a    Both Gaia Symphony and Eden have been performed\u000d\u000a      internationally during the review period. They have also been broadcast\u000d\u000a      and received multiple commercial recordings. Eden is firmly\u000d\u000a      established within the brass band repertoire, having been selected as a\u000d\u000a      test piece in the finals of the Belgian, English, Norwegian and European\u000d\u000a      Championships. It has been commercially recorded five times (an unusual\u000d\u000a      achievement for a recent `classical' composition) and has been the subject\u000d\u000a      of a study day at the University of Durham and of journal articles.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40340","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Research findings were initially demonstrated and communicated through a\u000a      series of events (outlined below) within in the AHRC\/ESRC Religion and\u000a      Society Grant. At them, Emma Hornby explored the theological content and\u000a      musical aesthetic of Old Hispanic chant, and gave audiences the\u000a      opportunity to sing some of the pitch-readable chants. Each event was\u000a      designed to appeal to a different constituency in order systematically to\u000a      open out the research to a wider audience, concentrated primarily around\u000a      Bristol. The University of Bristol Music Department Schola Cantorum\u000a      participated in all the events.\u000a    The first public lecture-recital at the Victoria Rooms, Bristol was\u000a      advertised through the Music Department's events brochure (February 2010).\u000a      It was attended by a conventional audience for activities in this\u000a      discipline: university students and staff plus members of the public who\u000a      regularly attend departmental events (35-40 in total). The event piloted a\u000a      lecture-recital format which was subsequently tailored to maximise\u000a      accessibility for hard-to-reach audiences.\u000a    The programme continued with a public workshop and meditation on Old\u000a      Hispanic chant at St Mary Redcliffe Church, Bristol (March 2010; sponsored\u000a      by AHRC\/ESRC). About 40 singers and 45-50 congregation members attended\u000a      including early music enthusiasts from across the region and local\u000a      parishioners. The Reverend Dr Simon Taylor, Priest-in-Charge, explained\u000a      that the event enriched participants' worship: \"the meditation was always\u000a      envisaged as an act of worship, which is the fundamental business of St\u000a      Mary Redcliffe. [It] was designed to fit within the liturgical calendar of\u000a      the church... I know from conversations with parishioners that it made an\u000a      important contribution to their exploration of worship at Lent.\" Taylor\u000a      also commented \"This has been a great piece of work enabling us to open up\u000a      this time of reflection and preparation to a wider group of people ...\u000a      Were you ever able to put on an event like this again, we would be\u000a      overjoyed to host and contribute liturgically.\" [a]\u000a    This repeat invitation demonstrates the potential for a sustained\u000a      engagement with that specific audience, especially given that Hornby and\u000a      Schola Cantorum had previously performed at St Mary Redcliffe (November\u000a      2008). The feedback from participants also indicated a more general\u000a      spiritual impact: \"I found it a deeply spiritual and moving experience. It\u000a      is proof that the fruit of your research can have a profound effect on\u000a      people today, 1000+ years on, and what better reason to pursue it can\u000a      there be?\" [b]\u000a    A workshop with local schools at the Victoria Rooms, Bristol (March 2010;\u000a      sponsored by AHRC\/ESRC; 18 visitors) was designed to expose teenagers to\u000a      research-led teaching at university level, and to enhance their technical\u000a      skills. The workshop also promoted wider participation in higher\u000a      education. One of the teachers in attendance commented, \"The students were\u000a      interested to get a taste of a university at work and to take part in a\u000a      challenging musical activity. ... The workshop [was] pitched at the right\u000a      level to challenge the students while keeping them fully on board. ...\u000a      Sean has now taken Grade 8 singing and is going to Bath Spa to read\u000a      Music.\" [c]\u000a    These initial events demonstrated clear impact in terms of influencing\u000a      the worship practices, developing musical practice and exposing new\u000a      audiences to the repertoire.

The audience of over 200\u000a        included more than 100 members of the public, broadening the spectrum of\u000a        participation significantly: many of the non-university attendees were\u000a        entirely new to university research-led events.

Most of this project was undertaken\u000a      in 2009-10, with Dr Emma Hornby as Principal Investigator (PI) and\u000a      Professor Rebecca Maloy of the University of Colorado at Boulder as\u000a      Co-Investigator (CI). Hornby was appointed as Lecturer in Music at the\u000a      University of Bristol in 2007, and promoted to Senior Lecturer in 2011.\u000a    The research project culminated in a monograph [3], which was jointly\u000a      conceived from the outset, with both Hornby and Maloy contributing equally\u000a      to the research, generation of ideas, and drafting. This monograph\u000a      explores text\/music relations, musical aesthetics, compositional planning\u000a      and relationships with wider western traditions in a set of Lenten Mass\u000a      Proper chants. Underlying this was the pioneering nature of the work in\u000a      addressing analytical questions which have previously been considered\u000a      unanswerable for this repertoire. The authors' aim was to present material\u000a      that is both relevant to chant specialists (invigorating a very\u000a      under-explored research field) and accessible to medievalists,\u000a      theologians, musicologists and church historians more generally.\u000a    The research aimed to explore the Old Hispanic chant tradition in a way\u000a      that takes seriously the musical notation, despite it being\u000a      un-pitchreadable. Hornby and Maloy were able to identify recurring note\u000a      patterns in idiomelic chants (that is, where the melodies do not generally\u000a      repeat). Combining these note patterns with the textual syntax enabled\u000a      them to identify cadence placement, and hence the primary building block\u000a      of textual articulation and pacing. Hornby and Maloy also looked at\u000a      melodic density (the number of notes per syllable) and found that the\u000a      words most lingered over tend to be those that are theologically key to\u000a      Old Hispanic Lent, recurring frequently in different chants. This idea of\u000a      examining the melodic pacing as a clue to how the music `reads' the text\u000a      was almost immediately adopted by chant scholars internationally.\u000a    This work makes it possible to understand something of how the chant\u000a      texts and melodies interact and makes the Old Hispanic chant's aesthetic\u000a      newly accessible to modern scholars. The close examination of the chant\u000a      texts reveals sophisticated liturgical planning within Old Hispanic Lent.\u000a    Hornby and Maloy's work has also exposed hitherto unsuspected melodic\u000a      connections between the Old Hispanic tradition characteristic of the\u000a      northern Christian kingdoms (for example, Le&#243;n) and that found only in\u000a      some of the Mozarabic parishes of Toledo [2]. While the Toledan\u000a      manuscripts preserving the variant tradition have previously been\u000a      considered as late aberrations, corruptions or even forgeries, this\u000a      project's melodic and textual analysis reveals that they preserve a\u000a      genuine medieval tradition that is musically connected to that of the\u000a      northern kingdoms.\u000a    It was central to the project's conception that it should transcend\u000a      abstruse dialogue between chant specialists. This is reflected not only in\u000a      the tone of the monograph but also in the integral illustrated lectures,\u000a      concerts and participatory workshops. Involving the University of Bristol\u000a      Music Department's Schola Cantorum, these presented the few transcribable\u000a      Old Hispanic chants, together with cognates in other European traditions.\u000a      These events were aimed at the wider community in Bristol and beyond,\u000a      introducing many people to this sound world, its medieval liturgical\u000a      context and its theological meaning. The events modelled the practical\u000a      application of scholarship.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40351","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3190538","Name":"Slovenia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    The composition \"Eight Bells\" (2011) was the result of a collaboration\u000d      with marine scientists based at Newcastle University's Dove Marine\u000d      Laboratory.

A Sign in Space's impact also prompted the Durham\u000d      Cathedral authorities to host another of the researcher's works (Book of\u000d      Bells), and the compositional methodology employed therein was\u000d      subsequently showcased in the BBC2 TV film \"Compose Yourself\", a programme\u000d      directed at primary school teachers in which young people were led by the\u000d      researcher through a creative process that involved responding to, and\u000d      'reading', the inflections of a geographical location (see ref 7. below).\u000d    The installation, Book of Bells (2013), also achieved high attendance\u000d      numbers (4,500) when it was installed in the Monk's Dormitory Library of\u000d      Durham Cathedral as part of the Lindisfarne Gospels Exhibition in July\u000d      2013. With an almost unanimously glowing batch of responses from the\u000d      general public (see ref 8. below), this sound installation was created\u000d      with funds from Durham County Council (&#163;4800) and was covered in the\u000d      national magazine The Wire. The work's bell-inspired premise (and the\u000d      wider inquiry it embodies) formed the basis of a CPD workshop developed\u000d      for Durham &amp; Darlington Creative Hub (see ref 9. below) and currently\u000d      underpins not only the direction of that initiative's music-related\u000d      content, but also its interdisciplinary and speculative emphasis.\u000d    The research's discourse about the nature of the sacred-secular divide\u000d      has also made an impact on musicological debate. \"Thimio's House\" (Perfect\u000d      Edge, 2013), for instance, is a recently published book ose content forms\u000d      the subject of a forthcoming paper presentation at the 2014 International\u000d      Word and Music Conference in Slovenia (see ref 10. below). The text\u000d      represents a 'hybrid' linguistic approach to musicological exegesis, and\u000d      this was detailed in a seminar given at the International Centre for\u000d      Musical Studies at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne in 2011 and a\u000d      paper presentation given at the International Baltic Musicology Conference\u000d      in Riga the year before. Thimio's House will be the subject of lecture to\u000d      be given by the researcher on 2nd April 2014 as part of the B&amp;D\u000d      Studios public lecture series.

It does so by (i) exploring the\u000d      relationship between music, sound and language, and (ii) problematising\u000d      the sacred-secular divide in pursuing musical\/performative strategies that\u000d      would re-configure the cultural signature and experiential tenor of\u000d      everyday 'social' spaces and environments. Out of novel configurations of\u000d      music, language, narrative, dramaturgy and 'place' (libraries, sports\u000d      centres, cinemas, bridges, churches, prisons, power stations, museums)\u000d      come insights that relate to the development of new\/alternative approaches\u000d      to musical interpretation, presentation and reception. These are arrived\u000d      at by making connections between composed music and everyday places,\u000d      communities and circumstances. The results of this work have entered the\u000d      public domain in the form of (a) site-specific operas (b) site-specific\u000d      music\/sound installations (c) composer residencies and (c) associated\u000d      writings.\u000d    The first research trajectory ((i) above) is exemplified in writings that\u000d      co-opt literary-poetic forms for musicological puposes. The short story\u000d      \"WKD2\" (Friction, 2010) and the book length fiction \"Thimio's House\"\u000d      (Perfect Edge, 2013), for instance, explore, on the one hand, music's\u000d      presence and audibility in language, and on the other, language's\u000d      musicality. The conflation of sacred-versus-secular themes within these\u000d      stories feeds into the development of outputs that relate to the second\u000d      research trajectory (ii) above), which is perhaps best exemplified by\u000d      \"Beyond Belief\", a 2001-2003 project commissioned by a consortium of local\u000d      authority agencies in West Cumbria. This operatic cycle was devised in\u000d      response to the Cumbrian foot-and-mouth crisis and was conceived for four\u000d      everyday cultural spaces. he first performance of this four-hour work\u000d      brought together a large number of beneficiaries (stakeholders,\u000d      participating individuals\/agencies\/organisations and audiences) in a novel\u000d      cohesion that crossed aesthetic boundaries. The individual works\u000d      themselves (Icon of the Nativity, Passion, Testament and Creation)\u000d      comprised a mix of live, recorded and digital sound, spoken text,\u000d      instrumental and vocal music, projected video and live action. These were\u000d      disseminated to\/via local communities in the form of live performances.\u000d      Beyond Belief also gained regional and national press coverage (Times\u000d      Educational Supplement, BBC Radio and TV), with impact accruing in terms\u000d      of public debate (and some controversy) in terms of the way bereavement\u000d      and death should be represented.\u000d    More recent projects along these lines include publicly funded works\u000d      conducted in association with Durham Cathedral (A Sign in Space, 2012 and\u000d      Book of Bells, 2013), the Dove Marine Science Laboratory (Eight Bells\u000d      2011), HM Prison Frankland (Brass Trax 2012) and the medical charity\u000d      Diabetes UK (Glucose 2012).

Through the implementation and\u000a      ongoing refinement of\u000a      the insights gained through their research, these choirs have led to\u000a      substantive health and\u000a      wellbeing benefits to individuals with long-term conditions, their\u000a      families and communities, as well\u000a      as further promoting and evidencing the health and wellbeing benefits of\u000a      singing.\u000a    These choirs include Skylarks, a network of Singing for\u000a      Parkinson's singing groups established in\u000a      2010 by Hancox in collaboration with local Parkinson's Society\u000a      support groups. There are currently\u000a      choirs in Canterbury, Folkestone and Whitfield, with over 80 people with\u000a      Parkinson's and carers\u000a      participating in a fortnightly programme of singing designed to help\u000a      maintain and improve voice\u000a      quality, and sense of wellbeing. The choirs have performed at two\u000a      international conferences and\u000a      were featured in a BBC breakfast news report. Data establishing the health\u000a      and wellbeing impacts\u000a      has been captured through reflective blogs, video media, and carers'\u000a      testimony (eg \"My Mum was\u000a        diagnosed with Parkinson's eight years ago and suffers from acute\u000a        anxiety, especially in public\u000a        situations. To say the singing group was a triumph would be an ENORMOUS\u000a        understatement. It\u000a        was the first time she has felt comfortable enough to stay for an entire\u000a        group event in a very long\u000a        time. She was literally buzzing on the way home, as was I\"). A\u000a      protocol for a controlled research\u000a      study has been designed and funding is being pursued. The East Kent\u000a        Singing for Mental Health\u000a        Network of singing groups was established in 2009 by Vella-Burrows\u000a      and others in collaboration\u000a      with Eastern and Coastal Kent PCT and Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care\u000a      Partnership Trust\u000a      to provide opportunities for singing and support for over 100 people with\u000a      mental health needs. A\u000a      clinically significant improvement in mental wellbeing was found using a\u000a      validated clinical measure\u000a      (CORE). Findings from the evaluation have shown statistically significant\u000a      improvements,\u000a      suggesting that regular group singing promotes wellbeing (Clift and\u000a      Morrison 2011). Qualitative\u000a      data from participants (and professionals' testimonies 5 and 6\u000a      below) point to marked\u000a      improvements in mental wellbeing for people with a range of enduring\u000a      mental health issues. The\u000a      network has featured on BBC World Service (September 2011), and been\u000a      awarded &#163;140k further\u000a      NHS funding to extend into West Kent and Medway.\u000a    The East Kent Singing and COPD Network of singing groups was\u000a      established by Vella-Burrows\u000a      and others for research purposes in September 2011 with funding from the\u000a      Dunhill Medical Trust,\u000a      and in collaboration with Eastern and Coastal Kent Community Health Trust\u000a      and the British Lung\u000a      Foundation. Over 100 people with COPD were recruited into the study and\u000a      met weekly to\u000a      participate in a programme of singing designed to promote better\u000a      breathing. Six of the singing\u000a      groups have continued, are self supporting, and attended by over 100\u000a      people following the end of\u000a      the research phase. The research has demonstrated evidence of significant\u000a      improvement in\u000a      measures of lung function (FVC improved from 2430ml to 2540 ml over the\u000a      ten months of the\u000a      study) and health-related quality of life for participants in the singing\u000a      groups, as well as social,\u000a      psychological and physical health benefits from taking part. Testimonies\u000a      from participants include\u000a      \"This group has been extremely helpful in many ways, physically and\u000a        psychologically. I just don't\u000a        have to worry about breathing any more. I am much calmer now and my\u000a        sleep has improved\" and\u000a      \"I go to the group with a tight chest, and leave feeling I can breathe\u000a        again. The nurse measured my\u000a        lung capacity: it improved through the singing classes!\" Vella-Burrows\u000a      has also created a number\u000a      of Singing for Health clubs for people and family carers living with the\u000a      effects of dementia, for\u000a      example Seaview Singers, which was established in 2008 and still\u000a      has approximately 30\u000a      participants. Partners of dementia patients have spoken of the profound\u000a      impact these groups have\u000a      on the patients' alertness, posture and ability to engage with others.\u000a    As a direct result of their engagement with the work of the Unit's\u000a      researchers, a number of external\u000a      organisations have themselves established singing groups in order to\u000a      implement the outcomes of\u000a      this research. Brighton and Hove PCT, for example, now provide\u000a      singing groups for people with\u000a      dementia as a direct consequence of research on singing and dementia\u000a      conducted by Vella-Burrows\u000a      and other SDHRC staff. Connors House care home established a\u000a      partnership with the\u000a      SDHRC in 2006 to provide inter-generational musical and singing activity\u000a      for elderly residents, and\u000a      to date over 150 residents and care staff have participated.\u000a    The independent charity Sing For Your Life was established in\u000a      2005 by Hancox and Vella-Burrows\u000a      (and others) specifically to transfer the research findings of the SDHRC\u000a      into practice.\u000a      Sing For Your Life runs over 40 singing groups for older people across the\u000a      South East of England\u000a      and elsewhere in the country reaching over 1,000 older people in community\u000a      and care settings\u000a      every month. Singing groups have also been established in Canada, Finland\u000a      and Italy following the\u000a      same model, and building directly on the Unit's research. Qualitative\u000a      evaluation, surveys and a\u000a      pragmatic community based RCT funded by NIHR (the project ran in 2010-11\u000a      with findings\u000a      published in 2012) have provided clear evidence of significant effects of\u000a      regular group singing\u000a      facilitated through Sing For Your Life on the mental wellbeing of older\u000a      people. Sing For Your Life\u000a      are now focusing on delivering singing in residential care settings, thus\u000a      widening the reach and\u000a      impact of the singing for health model (www.singforyourlife.org.uk).\u000a    The Unit's researchers have also sought to maximise the impact of their\u000a      research into singing and\u000a      health through disseminating their findings at conferences and seminars\u000a      attended by practitioners\u000a      and policy makers, thereby encouraging and supporting the adoption and\u000a      application of their\u000a      findings elsewhere. These include three international conferences\u000a      organised by Shipton for\u000a      SDHRC: Music and Health: Current Developments in Research and Practice\u000a      (9-10\/9\/08; 110\u000a      delegates); SEMPRE Conference on Music Health and Wellbeing: 'Striking\u000a        a Chord' (9-10\/9\/11;\u000a      125 delegates); SEMPRE Conference 'Setting the Tempo' : The need for a\u000a        progressive research\u000a        programme on Music Health and Wellbeing (19-20\/4\/13; 80 delegates).\u000a      Practitioners from across\u000a      the UK and beyond have taken up these interventions. For example, Pauline\u000a      Waugh, a Lead\u000a      Practice Nurse in Edinburgh writes: \"I have been trying to emulate\u000a        your success with your singing\u000a        groups for patients with COPD [...] We now have both ethics approval and\u000a        funding for our project\u000a        called `Singing for COPD &#8212; Take a Breath' and we officially start this\u000a        Monday (7th Oct) [...] We are\u000a        running a study similar to your original one in order to determine if\u000a        this type of singing group could\u000a        be rolled out across Edinburgh in the first instance\".\u000a    The Unit's researchers have also made a particularly distinctive\u000a      contribution to maximising the\u000a      impact of their research through offering training to those interested in\u000a      developing skills and\u000a      careers in leading singing groups for those with long-term health\u000a      conditions. Staff carers have been\u000a      trained at Connors House (a residential care home), at six care homes run\u000a      by Abbeyfield, Kent,\u000a      and at others including Avanti Care Homes. Training has been provided to\u000a      Kent County Council,\u000a      both in schools and in older people's services. Partnerships have been\u000a      formed with arts venues\u000a      (e.g. Turner Contemporary), and support provided to other professionals\u000a      (e.g. the Ladder to the\u000a      Moon Theatre Company). The most significant output from the Unit's\u000a      training work built around its\u000a      research has been the publication in 2012 of four Singing for Health\u000a        Guides, focusing on Dementia\u000a      (Vella-Burrows), Mental Health (Clift, Morrison), Parkinson's (Hancox,\u000a        Vella-Burrows) and\u000a      COPD (Clift, Morrison), and an associated programme of training. To date,\u000a      80 health professionals\u000a      and volunteers have attended these training days led by SDHRC since\u000a      September 2012, making a\u000a      substantial contribution to the development of a singing for health\u000a      network. In addition, an\u000a      International Journal for Arts and Health (published by Taylor and\u000a      Francis) was launched in 2009\u000a      as a direct result of the work of the Sidney De Haan Research Centre.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study outlines the impacts arising from research conducted\u000a      since 2001 by members of\u000a      the UoA working in the Sidney De Haan Research Centre for Arts and Health\u000a      (SDHRC), into the\u000a      health and wellbeing benefits of group singing.

Even\u000d\u000a        with synthetic sounds in the mix, the piece evoked a wind-swept,\u000d\u000a        spirit-haunted expanse, an effect bolstered by Gobi images projected and\u000d\u000a        altered on two video screens.\" The Chamber Music Today website\u000d\u000a        (20\/04\/10) stated \"The work is a fluid and immersive environment [...]\u000d\u000a        [an] imaginative musical meditation about the future of the natural\u000d\u000a        world, faced with the challenges of human population and global\u000d\u000a        development.\"\u000d\u000a    Wright's sound design for the Inside \/ Outside project created a\u000d\u000a        distinctive dialogue between acoustic Vietnamese instruments\u000d\u000a          and a multichannel sonic art installation. Le Huong wrote\u000d\u000a        in the Viet Nam News (\"Artists explore gender identity\" (08\/11\/12))\u000d\u000a        \"When the audience move through the space, reflections from the glass\u000d\u000a        create a perception of being both inside and outside the boxes, and\u000d\u000a        there is a constant shifting of instrumental and electronic sounds [...]\u000d\u000a        Next to the glass boxes there are headphones through which audience\u000d\u000a        members can listen to the music being played in each individual box.\u000d\u000a        Through these layers of sound, the audience can explore yet another\u000d\u000a        facet of how inside and outside is created.\"\u000d\u000a    The international reach of Wright's work, and its dissemination\u000d\u000a        through both traditional and non-traditional modes of musical\u000d\u000a        presentation have allowed it to achieve a substantive impact upon the\u000a          public understanding and appreciation of new forms of contemporary\u000d\u000a          music. Totem for Den Haag, for example, was commissioned by\u000d\u000a        Ensemble Klang and was chosen by the artistic directors of three\u000d\u000a        European music festivals to represent the UK in an initiative between\u000d\u000a        the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival, The Transit Festival\u000d\u000a        (Leuven, Belgium) and The November Music Festival (Den Bosch, Holland).\u000d\u000a        It was subsequently presented at the Transit Festival (23\/10\/10), at The\u000d\u000a        November Music Festival (13\/11\/10) and to a sold out audience at the\u000d\u000a        Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival (27\/11\/10). In addition, that\u000d\u000a        work was chosen by artistic director Tino Haenan to open the Listen to\u000d\u000a        This concert series at the prestigious Muziekgebouw aan`t Ij in\u000d\u000a        Amsterdam (16\/09\/11). Before commissioning Totem for Sydney, the\u000d\u000a        Australian Ensemble Offspring chose an earlier work of Wright's\u000d\u000a        (Breakdown, 2006) to represent the UK within a concert of radical new\u000d\u000a        works at the Sydney Opera House (30\/03\/12). Following this connection to\u000d\u000a        Australia, Wright's research became the subject of a two-hour radio show\u000d\u000a        broadcast on ABC Classic FM (Off the Record 01\/12\/12).\u000d\u000a    In total, Wright's practice-based compositional research undertaken\u000d\u000a      within the UoA has led to 135 live performances of his work between\u000d\u000a      01\/01\/08 and 31\/07\/13, reaching an estimated live audience of 7,500. His\u000d\u000a      CD created with Ensemble Klang, `Music at The Edge of Collapse' has sold\u000d\u000a      approximately 150 copies, contributing approximately 2,250EUR of sales to\u000d\u000a      Ensemble Klang, whilst the works have been streamed from the website\u000d\u000a      approximately 4,000 times. In relation to that album, the Instant Jazz\u000d\u000a      Website (17\/01\/2011) claimed that \"the recently released collaboration [of\u000d\u000a      Ensemble Klang] with Matthew Wright (Music\u000a          At The Edge Of Collapse) [...] combines contemporary\u000d\u000a      sound art with electronics into something wholly modern. It may not be\u000d\u000a      jazz, but these artists are creating cutting edge music that ensures a\u000d\u000a      unique aural experience, introducing new ways of dealing with\u000d\u000a      composing\/playing, fusing the familiar with the aesthetically challenging\u000d\u000a      and taking the listener straight into the future.

In 2009 for instance,\u000a      Williamon collaborated with\u000a      staff of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama to design Body\u000a        Matters, a module based on\u000a      evidence-informed health initiatives at the RCM and since delivered to\u000a      approximately 30 UG and\u000a      PG students annually [S1]. Similarly in 2013, the Conservatorio della\u000a      Svizzera Italiana (Switzerland)\u000a      launched a module on musicians' health and fitness, designed by Williamon\u000a      and delivered by\u000a      performance scientists at the Conservatorio to over 50 UG students thus\u000a      far [S2]. Since 2000,\u000a      several health-related curriculum initiatives have emerged across the UK\u000a      conservatoire sector,\u000a      including those at the RNCM, RWCMD and Trinity Laban, informed by (and\u000a      often mirroring) those\u000a      instituted by the CPS within the RCM's own programmes. The CPS has also\u000a      partnered with the\u000a      UCL School of Medicine, British Association of Performing Arts Medicine\u000a      (BAPAM) and Trinity\u000a      Laban's Department of Dance Science to offer the world's first MSc in\u000a      Performing Arts Medicine.\u000a      Based at UCL and run in parallel with the RCM's MSc in Performance\u000a      Science, the programme\u000a      trains health professionals to identify and treat injuries and ill-health\u000a      experienced by performing\u000a      artists [S3]. Since 2011, over 20 health professionals have received\u000a      training, supplying the next\u000a      generation of doctors, physiotherapists, counsellors and so on to work\u000a      within BAPAM and other\u000a      international performing arts medicine clinics.\u000a    The impact of the CPS on the occupational health of professional\u000a      musicians continues to be\u000a      significant. Williamon is a founder member of BAPAM's Education and\u000a      Training Advisory Group\u000a      (2009); the Group's activities, which has included a nation-wide health\u000a      promotion seminar series\u000a      for music teachers and an online Health Advice Resources Area, has been\u000a      directly informed by\u000a      CPS research [S4]. Williamon also worked in an advisory capacity in the\u000a      establishment of the\u000a      Portuguese Association for Performing Arts Medicine, launched in 2010.\u000a      Setting the agenda for the\u000a      next decade, the CPS unveiled two major initiatives in 2013. Musical\u000a        Impact, the largest study of its\u000a      kind worldwide, is a four-year AHRC-funded project (awarded February 2013)\u000a      that seeks to\u000a      generate new knowledge of chronic and acute health problems of musicians\u000a      and to test effective\u000a      solutions [G2]. Creative Practice as Mutual Recovery, a five-year\u000a      AHRC-funded project with the\u000a      University of Nottingham Institute of Mental Health (awarded February\u000a      2013), builds upon the\u000a      growing body of evidence showing that learning to make music can offer\u000a      significant mental health\u000a      benefits for NHS service users and older adults; less is known, however,\u000a      about the benefits for the\u000a      musicians who facilitate such work. This project directly examines the\u000a      hypothesis that musicians\u000a      and their learners can, through shared musical experiences,\u000a      mutually enhance wellbeing and\u000a      develop more meaningful and resilient lives [G3].\u000a    Protecting musicians' hearing\u000a    Arising from the health promotion research, the CPS has collaborated\u000a      since 2008 with the UCL Ear\u000a      Institute and the engineering firm Audio3 to conduct comprehensive hearing\u000a      screening\u000a      programmes for student and professional musicians and to develop noise\u000a      monitoring procedures\u000a      for beneficiaries including the Royal Opera House. The hearing research\u000a      has informed the design\u000a      of Audio3's SoundScreener, a new low-cost touchscreen audiometer\u000a      tested in a first phase with\u000a      10,000 people through Deafness Research UK and now being tested in phase 2\u000a      exclusively with\u000a      RCM musicians, prior to a planned roll-out across member institutions of\u000a      Conservatoires UK in\u000a      2015. In addition, the noise monitoring research was the catalyst for the\u000a      development of Audio3's\u000a      SoundBadge, the world's smallest wearable noise dosimeter and sound\u000a      level meter system [S5].\u000a    Addressing performance-related stress\u000a    Acknowledging the high incidence and profound effect of performance\u000a      anxiety among musicians,\u000a      the CPS collaborated with Imperial College Department of Bioengineering\u000a      and the Royal Academy\u000a      of Engineering in Virtuoso Stress (June 2008), an interactive\u000a      concert at the Science Museum's\u000a      Dana Centre featuring a live experiment using bioengineering equipment to\u000a      measure musicians'\u000a      heart rate, breathing rate and stress response as they performed [S6]. In\u000a      2012, the CPS unveiled\u000a      its Performance Simulator; built in collaboration with the\u000a      creative design firm Studiohead [S7], the\u000a      simulator offers musicians a realistic space in which to `practise'\u000a      performing in front of an\u000a      interactive, virtual audience or audition panel. The simulator was\u000a      featured in a 30-minute\u000a      documentary, `The scalpel and the bow', broadcast as part of the BBC Radio\u000a      3 series Between the\u000a        Ears (January 2013), and on Radio 3's Music Matters (April\u000a      2013) [S9]. In July 2013, it was\u000a      transported to the Cheltenham Music Festival and showcased as part of What's\u000a        it Like to be a\u000a        Performer?, where members of the public were able perform `on stage'\u000a      in front of the simulated\u000a      audience [S9].\u000a    Developing dialogue\u000a    CPS research into musicians' health and wellbeing has been disseminated\u000a      widely via the\u000a      International Symposium on Performance Science (ISPS) and its\u000a      associated published\u000a      Proceedings. Founded by Williamon in 2007, in part to spark dialogue and\u000a      debate on the very\u000a      latest findings into musicians' health, the first ISPS was convened at\u000a      Porto's iconic Casa da\u000a        M&#250;sica, with subsequent conferences in Auckland (2009), Toronto\u000a      (2011) and Vienna (2013), all of\u000a      which have been co-chaired by Williamon. Thus far, over 700 delegates from\u000a      more than 30\u000a      countries have attended the conferences, a majority of whom are themselves\u000a      performers, teachers\u000a      or otherwise engaged in portfolio musical careers. At least one keynote\u000a      speech at each event has\u000a      addressed musicians' health, and through the many spoken papers, posters\u000a      and workshops\u000a      devoted to this topic, delegates have gained: (i) an increased awareness\u000a      of the state of the art in\u000a      the field, (ii) a forum for sharing and building good practice, drawn from\u000a      international perspectives,\u000a      and (iii) an online repository of research papers, freely available at www.performancescience.org.\u000a    It is common for research from the symposia to capture public attention,\u000a      as evidenced with the\u000a      recent 25-minute summary of ISPS 2013, Performance Science: Die\u000a        Wissenschaft entdeckt das\u000a        Musizieren, broadcast on Austrian Radio 1 (&#214;1) [S10]. The\u000a      forthcoming ISPS will be convened in\u000a      Kyoto in 2015.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Physical and mental health can shape how musicians pursue their art and\u000a      the pleasure they take\u000a      from it. The results of recent research, however, suggest that pain and\u000a      ill health are widespread\u000a      among musicians and that healthy approaches to making and working in music\u000a      are far from\u000a      uniform throughout the profession.

While evidence for the robust and transformative impact of these\u000a      interventions for\u000a      musicians is well-documented (see Chapters 9-12 of Williamon's Musical\u000a        Excellence, Oxford\u000a      2004), the research also revealed widespread health problems among music\u000a      students. They\u000a      commonly reported performance-related pain and discomfort, performance\u000a      anxiety and\u000a      occupational stress, all of which were experienced as significant barriers\u000a      to achieving successful\u000a      careers in music.\u000a    Consequently in 2003, Williamon and Sam Thompson (RCM Research Associate\u000a      2000-04)\u000a      conducted a large-scale survey of the incidence and severity of music\u000a      students' performance-\u000a      related physical and mental health problems [1]. The findings confirmed\u000a      that pain and discomfort\u000a      relating to posture and excessive practising were frequent, as was\u000a      performance anxiety.\u000a      Furthermore, students showed a predilection to turn first to their\u000a      instrumental teachers for guidance\u000a      on health problems before seeking advice (if at all) from qualified health\u000a      professionals.\u000a    Given the degree of problems documented, the focus of research shifted to\u000a      explore the extent to\u000a      which musicians promote their health in daily life. In collaboration with\u000a      Jane Ginsborg (RNCM) and\u000a      Gunter Kreutz (Oldenburg University), Williamon collected responses from\u000a      approximately 300\u000a      musicians on inventories measuring the frequency and type of\u000a      health-promoting behaviours and\u000a      performance-related musculoskeletal problems [2]. Compared with\u000a      age-matched non-musicians,\u000a      the musicians scored significantly lower on three key health promoting\u000a      factors: health\u000a      responsibility, physical activity and spiritual growth. Moreover, they\u000a      rated their overall health lower\u000a      than non-musicians and reported a wider range of pain and fatigue\u000a      symptoms, which they also\u000a      rated as more severe.\u000a    Faced with this rather bleak picture of the state of musicians' health,\u000a      the CPS has since embarked\u000a      on an ambitious programme of applied research aimed at enhancing\u000a      musicians' physical and\u000a      psychosocial wellbeing. Recent studies have, for instance:\u000a    i. demonstrated how short interventions of proprioceptive training can\u000a      help restore the brain's\u000a      sensorimotor organisation in pianists with focal dystonia (Williamon and\u000a      Karin Rosenkranz, RCM\u000a      Research Fellow 2007-08, with UCL Institute of Neurology) [3],\u000a    ii. pioneered new avenues for analysing physiological stress signatures\u000a      when musicians perform\u000a      under pressure in public (Williamon and Lisa Aufegger, RCM PhD Student\u000a      2012- , with Imperial\u000a      College Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering) [4],\u000a    iii. implemented a comprehensive hearing screening programme for student\u000a      and professional\u000a      musicians (Williamon, with UCL Ear Institute) [5],\u000a    iv. examined the value and feasibility of implementing health promotion\u000a      and physical fitness\u000a      programmes for musicians in educational and professional contexts\u000a      (Williamon and RCM\u000a      Research Fellows Tania Lisboa and Rosie Perkins, with University of\u000a      Calgary Department of\u000a      Clinical Neurosciences and Cardiff Metropolitan University School of\u000a      Sport) [6].\u000a    Across this body of research, the CPS has set out to generate new\u000a      knowledge of musicians' health\u000a      and wellbeing, broadly defined. Contributions have been both conceptual\u000a      and methodological,\u000a      distinguished by an imperative to engage directly with issues of practical\u000a      relevance to musicians\u000a      and enabled by the RCM's vibrant musical environment. The CPS continues to\u000a      exert its leadership\u000a      in the field, as evidenced by two major AHRC-funded projects announced in\u000a      2013: Musical Impact\u000a      [G2] and Creative Practice as Mutual Recovery [G3] (see Section\u000a      4).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40571","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Each of the study days in the Focus on Style [5.3] series,\u000d\u000a      included a historical introduction on the selected school,\u000d\u000a      followed by a master class for young professionals, in which distinctive\u000d\u000a      features of each national `style' were explored practically.\u000d\u000a    As the scholar\/choreographic expert in charge of the study day on the\u000d\u000a      Italian school, Dr Poesio was faced with the problem that little or\u000d\u000a      nothing was known until recently of that particular dance tradition. In\u000d\u000a      agreement with the Artistic Director of the Royal Ballet School, it was\u000d\u000a      thus proposed to revise the given structure of each study day by including\u000d\u000a      practical sections in the historical introduction, in line with the\u000d\u000a      choreological historiography methodological approach Dr Poesio had used\u000d\u000a      for both the reconstruction\/revival of the 1890 Sleeping Beauty\u000d\u000a      and the 1886 Italian ballet Amor. The purpose of such inclusions,\u000d\u000a      namely never seen before extracts from a duet from Amor, was\u000d\u000a      twofold. On the one hand, the reconstructed dance substantiated the\u000d\u000a      historical narrative researched and expounded by Dr Poesio, by showing\u000d\u000a      practical rendition of unique features of the Italian school, relating to\u000d\u000a      both training and dance making. More significantly, the practical\u000d\u000a      demonstrations highlighted the already mentioned triangulation process\u000d\u000a      (see section 2) that Dr Poesio formulated when reconstructing or reviving\u000d\u000a      dance works. Each section was thus performed first in its entirety and\u000d\u000a      then divided and performed again in sub-sections, to be examined in\u000d\u000a      detail, thus allowing the audience to partake in the proposed\u000d\u000a      historiographical process. As such, the danced sections highlighted a\u000d\u000a      number of issues that had been long overlooked by dance scholars, as well\u000d\u000a      as exposing commonplaces that have long underpinned Western ballet\u000d\u000a      history. Particularly significant, in this sense, was the way the duet's\u000d\u000a      structure and compared to what is erroneously believed to be the standard\u000d\u000a      composition of the ballet duet in the second half of the 19th\u000d\u000a      century &#8212; an aspect that was later to become central to the final Ballet\u000d\u000a        Evolves performance lecture discussed below. Similarly,\u000d\u000a      well-established notions of gender in ballet were challenged by the\u000d\u000a      reconstruction of the long-lost duet and its historicisation, thus opening\u000d\u000a      new possibilities for research at international level. Both prompted a\u000d\u000a      vibrant, audience-centred debate, which followed the showing of the duet.\u000d\u000a    The audience of the Focus on Style study day included 7 dance\u000d\u000a      choreographers\/reconstructors (1 from France, 1 from Sweden and the rest\u000d\u000a      from the UK), 5 dance scholars from the UK, 45 dance teachers from diverse\u000d\u000a      European countries (32 from the UK, 7 from Italy, 4 from France), 6 dance\u000d\u000a      journalists and writers (1 from Germany, 1 from Italy and 4 from the UK),\u000d\u000a      three company directors (the Royal Ballet, English National Ballet and\u000d\u000a      Florence Opera House Ballet Company), two dance festival directors from\u000d\u000a      Italy, 25 dance students and 27 dance goers [5.3] Such an audience of\u000d\u000a      specialists and professionals was then invited to further explore issues\u000d\u000a      relating the Italian school by attending\/participating into a master class\u000d\u000a      that occupied the second half of the study day. Dr Poesio in collaboration\u000d\u000a      with Cara Drower, MA &#8212; Director of the Cecchetti Centre in London and\u000d\u000a      internationally renowned ballet mistress &#8212; devised the class in line with\u000d\u000a      the principles explored in the earlier section; as such it\u000d\u000a      contained explicit references to the choreographic elements highlighted by\u000d\u000a      reconstructed duet, which were thus offered to the participants to\u000d\u000a      experiment with.\u000d\u000a    The outcome of the event was thus three-fold as remarked by dance writer\u000d\u000a      Patricia Linton [5.4] in the international magazine Dancing Times.\u000d\u000a      Firstly, the event validated a particular approach to dealing with past\u000d\u000a      choreographic traditions, which, unlike other forms of reconstruction,\u000d\u000a      goes beyond the mere use of notated sources and\/or other choreographic\u000d\u000a      documentation. Secondly, it cast light on an area of dance history that\u000d\u000a      has long remained in the shadows, in spite of it conventionally\u000d\u000a      being deemed by most dance historians as a truly significant one. Finally,\u000d\u000a      it proposed a model for a fertile cross-disciplinary collaboration between\u000d\u000a      scholars and the industry, aimed at filling that gap that remains to date\u000d\u000a      a problematic aspect of contemporary dance culture.\u000d\u000a    Focus on Style informed the Ballet Evolved\u000d\u000a      performance-lectures series organised by the Education Department of the\u000d\u000a      Royal Opera House in London, presented in October, January and June 2013.\u000d\u000a      These performance-lectures too draw upon the collaboration between\u000d\u000a      scholarly research &#8212; represented by Dr Poesio &#8212; and the industry &#8212;\u000d\u000a      represented by Ursula Hageli, ballet mistress for the Royal Ballet &#8212; and\u000d\u000a      dancers from the company. Aimed at re-assessing dance history the Ballet\u000d\u000a        Evolved series was performed to a live audience (between 120 and 200\u000d\u000a      people each time); it was also filmed and posted via 7 videos on both the\u000d\u000a      Royal Opera House website and YouTube, where it has been seen to date by\u000d\u000a      103, 481 viewers [5.6].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Dance research has frequently suffered from the divide between historical\u000d\u000a      investigation and performance making.

These practice-based investigations were finalized to public\u000d\u000a      performance-lectures, grouped under the title Focus on Style and\u000d\u000a      held at the Royal Ballet School in London between October 2012 and March\u000d\u000a      2013. The invite stemmed from knowledge of Dr Poesio's findings in the\u000d\u000a      fields of dance reconstruction and dance history [3.2, 3.3] and, more\u000d\u000a      significantly, of his specifically devised practice-based\u000d\u000a      historiographical methods. These were first presented in Dr Poesio's\u000d\u000a      paper\/demonstration at the 1998 Society for Dance History Scholars\u000d\u000a      conference in Oregon [3.1], which prompted the invitation to contribute as\u000d\u000a      `historical consultant and reconstructor' to the 1998 reconstruction of\u000d\u000a      the 1890 production of the ballet Sleeping Beauty by the Kirov\u000d\u000a      Ballet in St Petersburg. The production, which premiered in New\u000d\u000a      York, saw Dr Poesio's contribution praised in the international dance\u000d\u000a      press [5.1]. What started as a tentative mode of practice-based\u000d\u000a      investigation soon developed into a method of revisiting past\u000d\u000a      choreographic practices which informed the revival of the 1886 Italian\u000d\u000a      ballet Amor, commissioned in 2007 to Dr Poesio by the Italian\u000d\u000a      Ministry of Culture for the centenary of composer Romualdo Marenco. The\u000d\u000a      finished work, Amor 2007, premiered in Rome in June 2008 and was\u000d\u000a      subsequently televised and broadcast by SKY later on in Italy, France and\u000d\u000a      Germany [3.4] attracting the praise of the specialist press [5.2)].\u000d\u000a    Methods\u000d\u000a      Although Dr Poesio's interest in formulating potentially new approaches to\u000d\u000a      reviving movement dance from the past started in 1998, it was only in the\u000d\u000a      academic year 2007\/8 that his research concentrated on the formulation of\u000d\u000a      a practice-led approach to choreological historiography, following the choreographic\u000d\u000a      commission mentioned above. The 2011 appointment at the University of\u000d\u000a      Bedfordshire proved instrumental in refining such formulation, thanks to\u000d\u000a      the university's supporting research strategies and culture. Poesio's\u000d\u000a      approach relies on a triangulation of data relating to both the\u000d\u000a      performance in question and, more significantly, aspects of performance\u000d\u000a      tradition that Poesio, as a dance historian, uncovered. Central to the\u000d\u000a      investigation of the named performance tradition is both a\u000d\u000a      historiographical and a practice-based study of theatrical solutions that\u000d\u000a      transcends the mere and traditionally employed diachronic analysis of a\u000d\u000a      specific ballet schools and styles, and considers other, and often\u000d\u000a      overlooked, factors derived from an in-depth study of performing contexts\u000d\u000a      of the time. Key to this approach is the practice led and based\u000d\u000a      experimentation that goes beyond the boundaries of the more traditional\u000d\u000a      and historically well-established text based approach to dance\u000d\u000a      reconstruction &#8212; whether the text be dance notation or written records.\u000d\u000a      This approach found an ideal context in the practice-based research\u000d\u000a      narrative that characterizes the MDDPA culture at the University of\u000d\u000a      Bedfordshire.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40581","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The compositions that have resulted from this research project exploit\u000a      the techniques and notational strategies developed through the exploration\u000a      of resonance.

It took its departure from\u000a      exploring new techniques and approaches to playing the guitar (such as\u000a      composing a piece for two guitars to be played simultaneously by one\u000a      player) and developing new notational strategies to clarify the musical\u000a      intentions. From here, the project went on to explore, through projects on\u000a      the solo guitar, specific aspects of guitar resonance, which are at the\u000a      heart of the presented case study. Research investigated the use of\u000a      resonance in various Chinese and Japanese forms of traditional music, or\u000a      ways of simulating, through idiomatic guitar writing, the effect of the\u000a      sostenuto pedal of the piano on the guitar. This research has been\u000a      undertaken through practice-based projects &#8212; compositions and concerts &#8212; which continue to further the understanding of this new approach to\u000a      resonance, through music scores, articles, papers and academic writing.\u000a      Several of these pieces feature guitar in a chamber music setting where\u000a      the sound of the guitar's resonance is coloured by other instruments in\u000a      the ensemble, thereby developing a new approach to guitar writing within\u000a      specific chamber music settings. Techniques developed through this\u000a      research are specifically in the areas of campanella, laissez vibrer\u000a      textures, scordatura, slurs, innovative right hand fingering patterns and\u000a      extended rasguaedo techniques. A recent project (The Flower of Cities)\u000a      explored the possibilities of using these new techniques in the combined\u000a      resonance of two guitars, within the context of a mixed chamber group (3).\u000a    To date, the innovative research in guitar composition undertaken at\u000a      Surrey has been referred to in a number of Masters, DMA, and PhD\u000a      submissions, in the UK and the US (Colorado State University, Arizona\u000a      State University, California State University, Royal Northern College of\u000a      Music, City University London, Peabody Institute Baltimore).\u000a    As an example, the Portuguese guitarist Rui Mourinho completed a Master's\u000a      degree at Escola Superior de M&#250;sica de Lisboa in 2011 focussing on the\u000a      subject of resonance in the solo guitar pieces, El Llanto de los\u000a        Suenos, The Chinese Garden and Sonata.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40583","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The digital dance projects have started the development of technological\u000d\u000a      innovation that allows for dynamic exploration of archives in digital\u000d\u000a      format.

The edition of Le Duc d'Albe\u000d\u000a      had a complicated genesis. The Donizetti\u000d\u000a      Edizione critica was approached by the Intendant of Vlaamse Opera\u000d\u000a      (in 2007) with the idea of\u000d\u000a      producing a first-ever French-language edition of Le Duc, an opera\u000d\u000a      that Donizetti had written for\u000d\u000a      Paris in 1839 but left unfinished at his death. Parker took on the project\u000d\u000a      in 2008, gained grant\u000d\u000a      funding of &#163;4000 from LCASE in order to employ a graduate assistant,\u000d\u000a      obtained the autograph\u000d\u000a      materials from the Ricordi archives in Milan, located further materials in\u000d\u000a      various other archives, and\u000d\u000a      completed the edition in 2009. As the opera is unfinished, Vlaamse Opera\u000d\u000a      and Ricordi agreed to\u000d\u000a      commission the Italian composer Giorgio Battistelli to complete two\u000d\u000a      numbers left particularly\u000d\u000a      incomplete (Parker himself supplied various other missing portions, and\u000d\u000a      supplied some missing\u000d\u000a      orchestration). Parker then collaborated with Battistelli, supplying him\u000d\u000a      with transcriptions of all\u000d\u000a      Donizetti's sketches and the original libretto. The eventual edition was\u000d\u000a      produced by Ricordi, in full\u000d\u000a      score, vocal score and orchestral parts.

All passages not\u000d\u000a      written by Donizetti himself (he left much of the orchestration of later\u000d\u000a      sections of the opera\u000d\u000a      incomplete) are in grey-scale on the orchestral score, thus allowing\u000d\u000a      conductors and scholars to see\u000d\u000a      immediately&#8212;without recourse to a Critical Commentary&#8212;what is by the\u000d\u000a      composer and what has\u000d\u000a      been added by others.

But it is clear from the\u000d\u000a      subsequent reception and\u000d\u000a      dissemination that the audience for this event was much larger. There is a\u000d\u000a      complete video on\u000d\u000a      YouTube; there were numerous reviews of the production in the local,\u000d\u000a      national and international\u000d\u000a      press; the performance was broadcast on Belgian radio. What is more, this\u000d\u000a      first performance will\u000d\u000a      doubtless stimulate others. A potent indication of its larger impact is\u000d\u000a      the fact that Opera Rara, the\u000d\u000a      major international recording company, has now programmed a commercial\u000d\u000a      recording of this\u000d\u000a      edition of Le Duc d'Albe, to be conducted by Sir Mark Elder, with\u000d\u000a      the Orchestra of the Age of\u000d\u000a      Enlightenment; this will take place in 2014.\u000d\u000a    Details of the nature of the impact. As mentioned about, before\u000d\u000a      the appearance of Parker's\u000d\u000a      edition, Donizetti's Le Duc d'Albe has never (even in the\u000d\u000a      composer's lifetime) been performed, or\u000d\u000a      indeed been made available in score. Because of this, a huge amount of\u000d\u000a      misinformation has\u000d\u000a      circulated about precisely what Donizetti was responsible for in the\u000d\u000a      score, and what had been the\u000d\u000a      work of others. In finally clarifying these matters, the present edition\u000d\u000a      allows scholars and opera\u000d\u000a      lovers to understand anew the nature of Donizetti's achievement at this\u000d\u000a      crucial period in his life.\u000d\u000a    Evidence or indicators of the extent of the impact. The major\u000d\u000a      evidence of impact can be found\u000d\u000a      in the various reviews that emerged in the wake of the performance (some\u000d\u000a      of the most important\u000d\u000a      listed below). Also critical, however, is the fact that a major recording\u000d\u000a      company has now planned a\u000d\u000a      studio recording of the opera.\u000d\u000a    Dates.

The majority of connections come from commercial rather than\u000d\u000a      academic IPs, and most referrals are from Google rather than academic\u000d\u000a      pages.

The AHRC Research Centre for the\u000d\u000a      History and Analysis of Recorded Music (CHARM), funded from 2004 to 2009,\u000d\u000a      involved King's, Royal Holloway and Sheffield universities, and aimed to\u000d\u000a      facilitate and encourage research on music as performance, as a first step\u000d\u000a      using recordings (especially early recordings) as evidence. CHARM took\u000d\u000a      three approaches. First it provided access to recordings so as to make\u000d\u000a      them much easier to find and to study. This was achieved at King's i) by\u000d\u000a      assembling the first online discography of the largest of the pre-War\u000d\u000a      record companies, the Gramophone Company (later EMI), supplemented by\u000d\u000a      discographies of many smaller labels; ii) by digitising ca. 5,000 78rpm\u000d\u000a      recordings and making them available via an intuitive sound file search,\u000d\u000a      thus providing recordings for researchers to work with and for other\u000d\u000a      listeners to enjoy; iii) by commissioning musicological tools for new\u000d\u000a      software for analysing recorded music (the software written at QMUL, the\u000d\u000a      tools specified jointly by King's and Royal Holloway, their development\u000d\u000a      led by and funded within the King's strand of CHARM). All the above were\u000d\u000a      generated under the direction of Professor Daniel Leech-Wilkinson.\u000d\u000a      Secondly, CHARM ran a series of symposia\/conferences and other events,\u000d\u000a      bringing together experts in recordings from beyond academia to inform and\u000d\u000a      disseminate our work. Thirdly, we ran four major research projects\u000d\u000a      developing approaches to the study of music as performance, evaluating and\u000d\u000a      using recordings as evidence.\u000d\u000a    The King's research project, on expressivity in Schubert song\u000d\u000a      performance, published in a book and six articles by Leech-Wilkinson and\u000d\u000a      three articles by Renee Timmers (our project RA), used evidence from\u000d\u000a      recordings to show how performance style has changed since 1900, and\u000d\u000a      offered a range of ways of understanding these changes, drawing arguments\u000d\u000a      from them about the nature of music; the relationship between score and\u000d\u000a      performance; the ways musicians, drawing on tacit knowledge, use sound to\u000d\u000a      suggest meaning; how that process depends on changes in society; and how,\u000d\u000a      in turn, writing on music is influenced by changes in its performance.\u000d\u000a    The software, Sonic Visualiser, freely available via the King's CHARM\u000d\u000a      website, supported by text and video tutorials by Leech-Wilkinson, has\u000d\u000a      become an important tool for those working on recorded performance since\u000d\u000a      it allows accurate data collection and visualisation of musical sound\u000d\u000a      including tempo, rubato, vibrato, portamento, dynamics, melody, harmony\u000d\u000a      and timbre. The discography and sound-file search allow users to trace and\u000d\u000a      acquire recordings, free of charge, for use as research materials or for\u000d\u000a      the wider community's education and pleasure.\u000d\u000a    The website also provides studies, authored or commissioned by\u000d\u000a      Leech-Wilkinson, of the history of recording, as well as essays with sound\u000d\u000a      illustrations on forgotten aspects of the history of performance,\u000d\u000a      newly-discovered recordings preserved at King's, and a variety of tools\u000d\u000a      for analysing recorded performances, all of interest far beyond the\u000d\u000a      confines of academia.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41312","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Vincendeau has long been a well-known voice on French film in the UK,\u000a      with her research on La Haine and her work on stardom attracting\u000a      great interest among the cinema-going public. In the current cycle, the\u000a      work on the New Wave has expanded the already wide scope of her research.\u000a      As a result of this increasing breadth of expertise and because of her\u000a      continuing passion for and advocacy of both popular and art house French\u000a      cinema, Vincendeau has become in the current impact period increasingly\u000a      influential in informing the critical and cultural contexts through which\u000a      the full range of French cinema in the UK is perceived. The impact of\u000a      Vincendeau's research on French cinema described here has taken three main\u000a      channels: (i) research on stardom and on the New Wave has underpinned work\u000a      at the BFI, informing programming choices and setting the critical context\u000a      for BFI audiences; (ii) this body of research has also underpinned\u000a      extensive and energetic work in journalism and the media (including DVD\u000a      filmed introductions and printed essays); and (iii) research related to La\u000a        Haine has had influence on secondary education in the UK and also on\u000a      cultural life through its impact on a theatrical production. As such the\u000a      full range of Vincendeau's recent research has informed the appreciation\u000a      of French film in the UK and beyond.\u000a    Work with BFI Southbank\u000a    As a result of the key channels of her research on popular French cinema,\u000a      French stardom, and the New Wave evidenced in section 3, Vincendeau\u000a      collaborated with BFI programming on the retrospective of the films of:\u000a      Juliette Binoche (2008, attendance 3,494), Marcel Carn&#233; and Jacques\u000a      Pr&#233;vert (2009, attendance 2,709), Agn&#232;s Varda (2009, attendance 2,874),\u000a      Fran&#231;ois Truffaut (2011, attendance 5,960), Jean Gabin (2012, attendance\u000a      3,937), and Jean Gr&#233;millon (2013, attendance 1,712). Through Cin&#233;-Lumi&#232;re,\u000a      she collaborated on the 2009 BFI New Wave celebration as a result of her\u000a      new work on this era of French cinema (3.1). These collaborations involved\u000a      discussing programming (her research into stardom was decisive in\u000a      particular screening choices, such as Lady Killer starring Jean\u000a      Gabin), writing programme documentation given to the audience and\u000a      providing a variety of talks (from extended introductions to launch\u000a      series, to introductions and Q&amp;A sessions and public lectures, one of\u000a      which, on Gabin, was part of the King's@BFI Key Scholars series).\u000a      Vincendeau's research across all outputs listed in section 3 was a key\u000a      contributor to every aspect of the impact of these seasons, from their\u000a      composition to the emphasis placed on new aspects of the works (through\u000a      accompanying materials) (5.2 and 5.8). The Education Curator of Public\u000a      Programmes at BFI Southbank notes that Vincendeau's appearances at BFI\u000a      Southbank `have been a crucial element in our efforts to contextualise and\u000a      interpret our film programme for audiences, with a specific aim of\u000a      encouraging new audiences, giving them the tools with which to engage with\u000a      our seasons' (5.8). In this respect she has become since her arrival at\u000a      King's the first `port of call' for the BFI concerning aspects of French\u000a      cinema related particularly to her research specialisms outlined above. To\u000a      illustrate the popular reach of such events and Vincendeau's central role\u000a      in the aforementioned impact, the restaurant chain Chez Gerard used the\u000a      occasion of the Gabin retrospective to run a competition about the actor\u000a      in 2011, the prize for which was Vincendeau's 2000 book on stars and\u000a      stardom in France (5.1).\u000a    In addition, Vincendeau's research interests in the New Wave in\u000a      particular (3.1 and 3.2) have inspired three public courses taught at the\u000a      BFI by Vincendeau and King's Film Studies colleagues: `Revisiting the\u000a      French New Wave' (six week course; Easter 2009); `Varda and Her Sisters'\u000a      (four week course; Summer 2010); `Truffaut in Focus' (four week course;\u000a      Spring 2011). All drew in a diverse cohort of attendees from A-level\u000a      students to older film enthusiasts. Course attendees also went to the\u000a      associated film seasons, and all three courses have been intricately\u000a      entwined with programming choices at the BFI (5.8). A further course, on\u000a      Louis Malle, is under discussion for Spring 2014.\u000a    The above dates are the key moments when impact occurred, although given\u000a      that the nature of the impact is the creation of a critical audience, such\u000a      impact is a slow-burning formative process that only begins on the date of\u000a      the first viewing encounter. For example, one attendee of Vincendeau's\u000a      talk on Gabin wrote to her to tell her how the event had stimulated his\u000a      curiosity and motivated him to seek out her other publications (5.2). In\u000a      general, interventions with BFI education and BFI programming have\u000a      uniquely informed the public perception and reception of French film,\u000a      `drawing on [Vincendeau's] insight and expertise to benefit our audiences,\u000a      helping to increase their appreciation and understanding of various\u000a      elements of film culture and history' (Education Curator of Public\u000a      Programmes, BFI; 5.8).\u000a    Reaching a cine-literate mainstream audience via Sight\u000a          &amp; Sound, talks, radio, DVD supplements, and beyond\u000a    Since 1992 Vincendeau has been a key contributor to Sight &amp; Sound,\u000a      with an average monthly worldwide circulation of 20,000 since 2005. Since\u000a      January 2008 she has written twenty-seven film reviews and short pieces\u000a      and eight feature articles on French cinema. The Editor of Sight &amp;\u000a        Sound notes that Vincendeau has been `central to cultivating [the\u000a      journal] readership's in-depth understanding of French cinema' (5.8). This\u000a      brings her research on stardom and genre filmmaking, as well as her\u000a      interest in gender, to bear on contemporary French cinema. As a result,\u000a      she took part in 2012 in the influential `Top Ten' poll of films and\u000a      directors conducted by the journal every ten years. Vincendeau's research\u000a      has also reached cine-enthusiasts through her prominent role in\u000a      contextualising DVD releases. Over the impact period, she has contributed\u000a      seventeen introductions, feature-length commentaries and written essays as\u000a      supplements to DVD\/Blu-ray editions of French films for British, US and\u000a      French companies (including the prestigious Criterion and StudioCanal)\u000a      (5.5); several sold over 8,000 copies worldwide (and one over 10,000). Her\u000a      research on films such as La Haine, on star Jean Gabin (La\u000a        Grande illusion), as well as the New Wave (La Pointe courte)\u000a      has therefore been made readily available to and informs audiences who\u000a      view these releases (5.6).\u000a    Vincendeau has during the impact period continued to be a well-known\u000a      voice on BBC radio. A BBC radio presenter and producer notes how her\u000a      `contributions to BBC radio cultural programmes have greatly enriched\u000a      [...] coverage of European cinema. She has tailored her detailed knowledge\u000a      gracefully to the level of the general listener on Front Row, to\u000a      the film enthusiast for The Film Programme (both on Radio 4) and\u000a      to the more intellectual approach of Nightwaves on Radio 3 [...]\u000a      She brings humanity alongside scholarship to engage an audience that might\u000a      be intimidated by the formality of film studies' (5.8). Average figures\u000a      for Nightwaves are 175,000 listeners per episode and The Film\u000a        Programme has a regular audience of 1.3 million. She has given talks\u000a      in a wide range of non-academic venues, including cinemas in London and\u000a      the regions (in addition to the BFI), the Victoria and Albert Museum, and\u000a      the Budleigh Salterton literary festival. All of these appearances in\u000a      different media have contributed to the impact of her research on a\u000a      mainstream audience, as can be seen from email evidence of members of the\u000a      general public contacting Vincendeau to discuss how her work has inspired\u000a      them. For instance, one man describes how viewing a DVD commentary by\u000a      Vincendeau led him to read more of her `outstanding' research; another\u000a      suggests her 2012 introduction to La Grande illusion (drawing out\u000a      from 3.6) furthered his understanding of the film and has inspired him to\u000a      seek out more Francophone films mentioned in her text (5.7). Vincendeau's\u000a      work is also cited by amateur reviewers on the internet, one of whom\u000a      describes her published research on French stardom and Brigitte Bardot\u000a      (3.3) as `really informative and enjoyable,' continuing, `Ginette\u000a      Vincendeau is a really good writer on French film. She has the\u000a      understanding on the culture surrounding the cinema [...] One can usually\u000a      find her in the extra bonus stuff on Melville DVD's. Very impressive!'\u000a      (5.7).\u000a    La Haine: Theatre and Education\u000a    Vincendeau's research interest in Kassovitz's 1995 film La Haine\u000a      (3.4) has had a strong influence on a wide public through various\u000a      channels. Her research is the inspiration behind Dutch theatre director\u000a      Teunkie van der Sluijs, who described her work as `very insightful and\u000a      indeed very helpful [...] in the process of adapting the film for the\u000a      stage' (5.8). Van der Sluijs is a London-based Dutch theatre director, who\u000a      runs an Anglo-British company Studio Dubbelagent. In 2008, he started a\u000a      trilogy of new works on violence and exclusion which re-imagines classic\u000a      European texts. Hate is the final part of the trilogy. The\u000a      production opened at the Rozentheater, Amsterdam's primary new writing\u000a      theatre, on 17 January 2012, before touring the Netherlands.\u000a    In the UK, Vincendeau's research into La Haine is routinely used\u000a      to teach the film in schools, where her book on the film is an A-level set\u000a      text for some exam boards (5.3). She has received numerous invitations to\u000a      speak at schools on the basis of her expertise on the film, further\u000a      allowing her continuing research expertise in this area (3.4) to enthuse\u000a      and inspire schoolchildren to engage with film through the national\u000a      curriculum. For example, a French teacher at King's School, Worcester\u000a      reports that `[the pupils] were inspired by [Professor Vincendeau's] talk'\u000a      and the Head of French at Abingdon School, Oxfordshire, states that `the\u000a      boys' motivation and enthusiasm have increased as a result of Professor\u000a      Vincendeau's teaching' (5.8).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study is devoted to the impact of Ginette Vincendeau's\u000a      research, which has influenced cultural life through the creation of more\u000a      critically-informed audiences for French cinema.

Deriving from this wider field, Vincendeau's\u000a      research since she joined King's as Professor in Film Studies in 2006 has\u000a      given rise to two major and multi-faceted projects: Revising the history\u000a      of the French New Wave and Popular French cinema: stars, genres,\u000a      directors.\u000a    Revising the history of the French New Wave\u000a    On the 50th anniversary of the New Wave in 2009, Vincendeau\u000a      published an important collection on the movement (3.1) to which she\u000a      contributed a seminal long essay. She also commissioned, and wrote in, a\u000a      dossier of articles on the topic for the leading US academic publication,\u000a      Cinema Journal. These pieces significantly re-appraised and\u000a      challenged existing historiography, re-situating the New Wave within the\u000a      continuum of mainstream French cinema as opposed to the dominant view that\u000a      sees it as a discrete movement in opposition to it. This revisionist\u000a      approach also underpinned a further substantial article on the New Wave\u000a      film La Pointe courte (3.2) which appears in the Criterion\u000a      collection box-set on Agn&#232;s Varda.\u000a    Popular French cinema: stars, genres, directors\u000a    Building on her reputation for pioneering work on French film stardom (on\u000a      which she wrote the first academic book in 2000), Vincendeau published the\u000a      first academic monograph on Brigitte Bardot (3.3). This book, which has\u000a      been shortlisted for the SCMS Kovacs book award, for the first time\u000a      explores the entire career of the star and re-appraises her celebrity &#8212;\u000a      arguing that Bardot is the `first French mass media star'.\u000a    Her earlier interest in French film noir led to further research on La\u000a        Haine (3.4), a 1995 film on which she published a book in 2005, now\u000a      in its third reprint. Her research moved in new directions; as she\u000a      witnessed first-hand the Parisian suburban unrest which took place as the\u000a      book appeared she was able to combine her personal and academic knowledge\u000a      of the French suburbs to offer new insights (3.4). This research has\u000a      continued to have a strong impact in the school classroom, the theatre,\u000a      and on DVD (see section 5).\u000a    Finally, building on her seminal work on the 1930s, Vincendeau continued\u000a      to explore the history of classical French cinema by re-examining the work\u000a      of key French directors (Marcel Carn&#233;, Jean Gr&#233;millon, Marcel Pagnol, and\u000a      Jean Renoir), establishing in particular how these exceptional figures\u000a      were also part of the continuum of popular genres, using stars and\u000a      addressing popular audiences. The most sustained pieces of research (i)\u000a      challenged views of Pagnol's work during the war as `collaborationist'\u000a      (3.5) and (ii) reappraised Renoir. In the co-edited, authoritative large\u000a      volume A Companion to Jean Renoir (3.6), Vincendeau's piece on French\u000a        Cancan precisely rehabilitates Renoir's work in the popular genre of\u000a      the musical, against prevailing views of that film, while specifically\u000a      looking at its representation of women.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41313","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The main impact of Wheatley's research expertise into spectatorship,\u000d\u000a      audiences, and film criticism\u000d\u000a      comes through her publishing relationship with Sight &amp; Sound.\u000d\u000a      The Editor of the journal terms her\u000d\u000a      `a key contributor to Sight &amp; Sound's understanding of\u000d\u000a      contemporary cinema' (5.7). The consumer\u000d\u000a      magazine reaches a large audience of cine-enthusiasts (as well as an\u000d\u000a      academic readership) and\u000d\u000a      sells approximately 20,000 copies internationally per year, giving\u000d\u000a      Wheatley's research-led writing a\u000d\u000a      huge reach (5.5). It reaches the public consciousness in particular\u000d\u000a      through its lists of the greatest\u000d\u000a      films of all time, which are produced every ten years. Most of Wheatley's\u000d\u000a      contributions to the\u000d\u000a      magazine are also available online and her writing contributes to an\u000d\u000a      on-going cultural debate\u000d\u000a      across blogs and amongst other critics (5.5; 5.2). Her research into how\u000d\u000a      critics affect the films that\u000d\u000a      they write about, and the manner in which they can influence cinema\u000d\u000a      audiences is instrumental in\u000d\u000a      equipping her for the role of critic and the inspirational impact that she\u000d\u000a      has had on new female\u000d\u000a      talent, referred to below. Her public-facing work encourages both her\u000d\u000a      readers and other critics to\u000d\u000a      reflect upon the practices of film criticism and film viewing, and on the\u000d\u000a      most appropriate methods to\u000d\u000a      create an informed film-going public.\u000d\u000a    Wheatley has been writing an average of two reviews of European films per\u000d\u000a      month since 2005 (an\u000d\u000a      approximate number of 72 reviews since arriving at King's) (5.5), which\u000d\u000a      relate to her research\u000d\u000a      referenced in sections 2 and 3 in varying ways. For example, a May 2012\u000d\u000a      review of Delicacy\u000d\u000a      argues that since the film is based on a novel that is celebrated in\u000d\u000a      France but little known to\u000d\u000a      international audiences, it appeals to different knowledge frameworks for\u000d\u000a      international viewers (the\u000d\u000a      film's casting and use of the romcom's genre conventions) than for\u000d\u000a      domestic spectators, for whom\u000d\u000a      the film's authorship is the primary reference point. This reading,\u000d\u000a      informed by Wheatley's research\u000d\u000a      into global audiences, was discussed on the website The Case for\u000d\u000a        Global Film (5.2). Her July 2012\u000d\u000a      review of Polisse &#8212; which discussed the manner in which the film's\u000d\u000a      admixture of serious subject\u000d\u000a      matter and comedic tone is highly problematic for spectators &#8212; was\u000d\u000a      likewise debated on the\u000d\u000a      website Philmology, in a piece on the relationship between empathy\u000d\u000a      and exploitation (5.2).\u000d\u000a      Wheatley also produces longer pieces directly based on her research\u000d\u000a      interests: for example, the\u000d\u000a      interview piece ``Tis a Pity She's A Whore', (Sight &amp; Sound,\u000d\u000a      vol. 22, i.2, February 2012), with\u000d\u000a      French director Bertrand Bonello, is heavily informed by Wheatley's\u000d\u000a      research into spectatorship\u000d\u000a      and the `New Extremism' (5.2).\u000d\u000a    In 2011, the arts charity IdeasTap wrote that Wheatley is one of several\u000d\u000a      `powerful female writers'\u000d\u000a      spearheading a move against male dominance of the industry (5.2). As a\u000d\u000a      result of her research\u000d\u000a      interests in film criticism and work for Sight &amp; Sound\u000d\u000a      outlined above, Wheatley was involved that\u000d\u000a      year in running and judging a competition to find new female talent for\u000d\u000a      the magazine, geared\u000d\u000a      towards encouraging more women to write about film in an informed manner\u000d\u000a      (5.1). The competition\u000d\u000a      fielded 106 entries from a total of fifteen different countries and the\u000d\u000a      website received 17,000 unique\u000d\u000a      hits (5.1). The winning writer was awarded a year's mentoring with\u000d\u000a      Wheatley, drawing on her\u000d\u000a      research expertise into how criticism frames film and affects audience\u000d\u000a      perceptions. The two\u000d\u000a      runners-up also received remote coaching (5.7). The winning writer has\u000d\u000a      gone on to have several of\u000d\u000a      her reviews published in Sight &amp; Sound: the online editor\u000d\u000a      writes that `thanks to Catherine's good\u000d\u000a      counsel and attention', she (the winning writer) has become `a firm and\u000d\u000a      valued contributor'. The\u000d\u000a      winning writer described Wheatley's mentorship as `a practical and\u000d\u000a      constructive initiation into the\u000d\u000a      world of film criticism', stating that she was `grateful to have been\u000d\u000a      paired with a critic whose work\u000d\u000a      was an inspiration to [her]' (5.7). Wheatley has thus influenced the\u000d\u000a      practice of film criticism through\u000d\u000a      nurturing a new generation of women critics, and this will reap further\u000d\u000a      impact in time.\u000d\u000a    Wheatley's work with young female writers builds on her own commitment to\u000d\u000a      bridging the gap\u000d\u000a      between popular and academic writing. Whenever possible, she parlays her\u000d\u000a      academic interests\u000d\u000a      into reviews or features for popular media. In October 2012, for example,\u000d\u000a      she reviewed the director\u000d\u000a      Michael Haneke's Amour for Sight &amp; Sound and alongside\u000d\u000a      the Independent film critic Jonathan\u000d\u000a      Romney for Radio 4's The Film Programme, in both cases focusing in\u000d\u000a      particular on why the\u000d\u000a      director is so revered by critics, building on the research for her\u000d\u000a      monograph on Hidden (5.6). The\u000d\u000a      live programme had an estimated total of 1,230,000 listeners and the\u000d\u000a      programme has been\u000d\u000a      downloaded from the BBC website 12,761 times. The programme was ranked 113th\u000d\u000a      in the UK's\u000d\u000a      podcast chart in June 2013 with a total of 25,319 downloads. In December\u000d\u000a      2012 she appeared on\u000d\u000a      the Today programme to discuss the impact of technological\u000d\u000a      innovations in cinema on how films\u000d\u000a      are received by their audiences in different historical eras and cultural\u000d\u000a      contexts (5.6). In March\u000d\u000a      2013 she revisited the programme to discuss the particular popular appeal\u000d\u000a      of character actors, and\u000d\u000a      how audiences relate to these figures differently from how they might\u000d\u000a      relate to better-known stars\u000d\u000a      (5.6). As a result of these radio appearances Wheatley's research ideas\u000d\u000a      have reached millions of\u000d\u000a      people and informed cultural debate around perceptions of cinema on a very\u000d\u000a      broad level: the\u000d\u000a      estimated total number of listeners for the Today programme is\u000d\u000a      10,754,000 (5.6).\u000d\u000a    Wheatley's work with BFI publishing has also allowed her to build on and\u000d\u000a      develop the department's\u000d\u000a      existing relationship with BFI Southbank. As part of the BFI's Hitchcock\u000d\u000a      season, she contributed to\u000d\u000a      a panel event on `Hitchcock and the Critics', alongside Laura Mulvey,\u000d\u000a      Henry Miller, and Geoff\u000d\u000a      Andrew, attended by 193 members of the public (5.3). Here she discussed\u000d\u000a      the manner in which\u000d\u000a      international audiences have had their relationship to Hitchcock's films\u000d\u000a      mediated by the critical\u000d\u000a      climate within which they have viewed and re-viewed them. Similarly,\u000d\u000a      following the publication of\u000d\u000a      Wheatley's short guide to Michael Haneke's film, Cach&#233; (3.1)\u000d\u000a      (international sales of 882 copies), in\u000d\u000a      February 2013, she presented an early film of Haneke's (Benny's Video\u000d\u000a      (1995)) as part of the BFI's\u000d\u000a      Philosophical Screens series, to a capacity audience of 103, introducing\u000d\u000a      the film and leading the\u000d\u000a      ninety-minute discussion that followed with the general public (5.3; 5.4).\u000d\u000a      In this context, her\u000d\u000a      research comes full circle, as she is able to share information about who\u000d\u000a      Haneke's film viewers\u000d\u000a      are, and how they receive and understand his films.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case study examines the impact of Catherine Wheatley's research into\u000d\u000a      spectatorship,\u000d\u000a      audiences, and critical contexts through engagement with the popular press\u000d\u000a      and public-facing\u000d\u000a      media institutions.

Wheatley's continued interest in the film-criticism interface\u000d\u000a      led to the\u000d\u000a      publication, in 2012, of a short chapter (`The Reputation') on Alfred\u000d\u000a      Hitchcock's reputation in the\u000d\u000a      BFI book 39 Steps to the Genius of Alfred Hitchcock: A BFI Compendium\u000d\u000a      (3.3). This chapter\u000d\u000a      examined the director's role in the construction of his own critical\u000d\u000a      reputation, as well as charting the\u000d\u000a      shifts in the popular critical and academic assessments of Hitchcock's\u000d\u000a      work over a period of nearly\u000d\u000a      100 years.\u000d\u000a    This strand of Wheatley's work was developed further in her research into\u000d\u000a      French cinema's\u000d\u000a      exhibition, distribution, marketing, and reception in Great Britain, which\u000d\u000a      paid particular attention to\u000d\u000a      the manners in which critical discourses shape notions of film. The\u000d\u000a      resulting monograph, co-authored\u000d\u000a      with Lucy Mazdon (Southampton University) was published in 2013 (3.2).\u000d\u000a      Matters of\u000d\u000a      audience expectation and response also converge in several articles\u000d\u000a      written by Wheatley and\u000d\u000a      published in journals and books. Her contribution to Tina Kendall and\u000d\u000a      Tanya Horeck's The New\u000d\u000a        Extremism considered the peculiarly uncomfortable experience for\u000d\u000a      viewers of a body of cinema\u000d\u000a      that is known for its graphic depictions of sex and violence (3.4).\u000d\u000a      Wheatley has also written on the\u000d\u000a      evocation of ad hoc families in the works of Claire Denis, a director\u000d\u000a      whose films, Wheatley argues,\u000d\u000a      are aimed at forging an analogous relationship of community or `family'\u000d\u000a      amongst Denis's\u000d\u000a      spectators through their aesthetic approach to audiences (3.5).\u000d\u000a    In 2012 Wheatley published a monograph on Haneke's internationally\u000d\u000a      renowned film\u000d\u000a      Cach&#233;\/Hidden (3.1). The 2005 film won the Best Director prize at\u000d\u000a      Cannes in the year of its release,\u000d\u000a      and has gone on to become one of the most financially successful\u000d\u000a      French-language films at the UK\u000d\u000a      Box Office of the past ten years. Looking at the various frameworks\u000d\u000a      through which the film has\u000d\u000a      been discussed in the popular press, Wheatley asks why it appeals to such\u000d\u000a      a wide range of film\u000d\u000a      viewers. She argues that Hidden's multiple thematics allow it to\u000d\u000a      be read and responded to in a very\u000d\u000a      wide variety of ways by a wide variety of international audiences, and\u000d\u000a      that this plurality of meaning\u000d\u000a      accounts precisely for its popularity.\u000d\u000a    Wheatley continues to explore these central questions of spectatorship\u000d\u000a      and film audiences in her\u000d\u000a      current research on the relationship between iterations of Christianity in\u000d\u000a      contemporary European\u000d\u000a      film and attitudes towards religion in today's Western society. A\u000d\u000a      significant focal point within this\u000d\u000a      research is what spectatorial and critical responses to films featuring\u000d\u000a      Christian references might\u000d\u000a      suggest about broader societal trends, but also how the shape of the\u000d\u000a      critical establishment within\u000d\u000a      the West might sculpt existing attitudes towards Christianity.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41314","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Dyer had collaborated with the BFI on topics related to Rota before this\u000a      REF impact cycle. In 2004,\u000a      he curated the Federico Fellini season at the BFI and in the previous year\u000a      had given a talk there on\u000a      Rota and Visconti. He was also commissioned to write a piece on Rota for\u000a      the magazine, Sight &amp;\u000a        Sound (14:9 NS, 2004), on the occasion of Rota's topping their poll\u000a      of best film music composers.\u000a      Dyer published his book on Nino Rota (3.1) with BFI publications in 2010\u000a      and his research in this\u000a      area and his close relationship with the BFI led to his curating the Nino\u000a      Rota season of films, which\u000a      took place in September 2010.\u000a    The Rota season (attendance 3,272) (5.10) showcased sixteen movies with\u000a      scores by Rota,\u000a      including Visconti's White Nights (1957), The Leopard\u000a      (1963) and Rocco and his Brothers (1960),\u000a      Fellini's I vitelloni (1953), La Strada (1954), Il\u000a        bidone (1955), Nights of Cabiria (1956), La dolce vita\u000a      (1960), Eight and a Half (1963) and Amarcord (1973), as\u000a      well as popular Italian comedies (&#200;\u000a        primavera (1949), Anni facili (1953), a queer melodrama (Amici\u000a        per la pelle (1955)), a British\u000a      (Obsession (1949)) and a French (Plein soleil (1959))\u000a      thriller, Zeffirelli's The Taming of the Shrew\u000a      (1966) and the blockbuster The Godfather Part II (1974). Thus\u000a      well-loved movies were showcased\u000a      alongside lesser-known movies and audiences had the opportunity to focus\u000a      on these scores as\u000a      part of a cinematic experience and understand and appreciate Rota's often\u000a      famous and familiar\u000a      music in its original context. One cine-enthusiast who saw The Leopard\u000a      at the BFI blogged\u000a      enthusiastically about the experience: `Nino Rota's score, which is\u000a      elegiac and almost wondrous in\u000a      its melodramatic but melancholic tones, is superb ... (cinematographer)\u000a      Rotunno and Rota are the\u000a      true stars of this picture' (thatonefilmblog (5.1)).\u000a    Film music is often not noticed: the brochure and programme notes enabled\u000a      audiences to `hear'\u000a      what often goes unheard, as did a public lecture Dyer gave on 1 September\u000a      2010 to introduce the\u000a      season. This used a wide range of examples, carefully introduced with\u000a      reference to what is going\u000a      on in the music in the clip, to illustrate the very special way Rota has\u000a      with a film score. This was\u000a      held in NFT1, the largest auditorium at the BFI Southbank, indicating the\u000a      BFI's confidence in\u000a      Dyer's appeal to the cinema public. Alongside this high-profile series,\u000a      Dyer appeared in the media\u000a      discussing Nino Rota and his importance, participating in a feature on\u000a      Rota in Music Matters on\u000a      BBC Radio 3 (5.2) in September 2010, which made the case for why Rota's\u000a      music is important,\u000a      and then being interviewed about Rota on In Tune on BBC Radio 3, 2\u000a      October 2013, as part of\u000a      their `Sound of Cinema' series. Average audience figures in the quarter of\u000a      2010 in which Dyer\u000a      appeared on Music Matters were 95,000. In addition, on 21\u000a      September he gave a (different) lecture\u000a      on Rota to the Italian Society at Heythrop College. He had also earlier\u000a      given a public lecture on\u000a      Rota as a gay composer as part of the `Queer Up North' festival in\u000a      Manchester on 27 May 2010\u000a      (120 attendees). A video presentation by Dyer on a closely related topic,\u000a      `The Wind in Fellini'\u000a      (Rota's most celebrated collaborator), has been made by the\u000a      Internationales Kolleg f&#252;r\u000a      Kulturtechnikforschung und Medienphilosophie in Weimar, available on line,\u000a      which has been\u000a      commended as `simply one of the best Film Studies lectures\u000a      currently available on the internet' by\u000a      `Film Studies for Free' (5.9). This has had 754 views.\u000a    Dyer also curated for the BFI the two-month Vincente Minnelli season in\u000a      April-May 2012. Again,\u000a      this arose as a result of Dyer's research. On 17 March 2010, Dyer had\u000a      lectured on Lena Horne at\u000a      the BFI (the first in the King's@BFI Key Scholars series), a topic that\u000a      formed the basis of one of\u000a      the chapters later published in In the Space of a Song (2012)\u000a      (3.2). As a result of this talk and his\u000a      research on song, Dyer was asked to publish an article on Meet Me in\u000a        St Louis for Sight &amp; Sound\u000a      (January 2012) to coincide with BFI Southbank's MGM musicals season. The\u000a      appearance of this\u000a      article on Minnelli's great musical in turn led to his being invited to\u000a      curate the Minnelli season at the\u000a      BFI in April-May 2012. Dyer gave a lecture on 3 April 2012 to open the\u000a      season &#8212; again in NFT1 &#8212;\u000a      on the notion of `the number' (musical and otherwise) across all\u000a      Minnelli's work (part of which was\u000a      posted at http:\/\/www.bfi.org.uk\/live\/video\/950).\u000a      Tony Paley, in his Capital Celluloid blog, featured\u000a      this lecture in his daily guide of cinema life in London: `Okay, it's not\u000a      a film but this is guaranteed to\u000a      be an eye-opener. Richard Dyer, one of our foremost film writers and the\u000a      curator of the Minnelli\u000a      season at BFI Southbank, introduces the two-month extravaganza with a look\u000a      at the great\u000a      Hollywood director's masterful use of the set piece' (Capital Celluloid).\u000a      The season gave Dyer the\u000a      opportunity to showcase thirty-four movies to a wider public, a complete\u000a      retrospective of Minnelli's\u000a      work, presenting the public with a possibly once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\u000a      to see the full range of the\u000a      director's output on the big screen. Audiences are now perhaps most\u000a      familiar with Minnelli's\u000a      musicals; this season enabled them to put these side by side with his\u000a      melodramas and comedies,\u000a      the brochure and programme notes bringing out their similarities and\u000a      differences and the\u000a      development of his work over thirty years. The attendance figure for this\u000a      season was 6,005 (5.10).\u000a      This series attracted attention in the press and on the internet,\u000a      including a Gay Times blog feature\u000a      (`The Other Minnelli'): `With recognisable icons (as well as plenty of\u000a      faces that us whippersnappers\u000a      will still be to learn) and a healthy dose of cinemagraphic culture, the\u000a      showcase proves the\u000a      importance of classics in film. What's more, while Liza needn't worry\u000a      about her throne just yet, it's\u000a      never hurt to learn a little of the family history either'. Reviewers also\u000a      wrote about individual movies\u000a      shown in the series, including `rarely seen but frequently referenced'\u000a      films such as The Bad and\u000a        the Beautiful (Lee Cassanelli (5.5)). And theartsdesk.com discussed,\u000a      in the light of this\u000a      retrospective, whether Minnelli had the claim of being an auteur\u000a      (Ronald Bergan (5.6)).\u000a      Newspapers too used the retrospective as an opportunity to bring\u000a      Minnelli's work closer to the\u000a      public, with The Independent (29 March 2012 (5.7)) offering a\u000a      `Guide to: Vincente Minnelli's\u000a      Season at BFI Southbank', with its internet site offering a photographic\u000a      guide to ten of the director's\u000a      movies.\u000a    In this assessment period, the BFI has, therefore, taken the initiative\u000a      to stage two series of high-profile\u000a      screenings and events as a direct result of Dyer's research (and their\u000a      confidence in the\u000a      public's interest in this). Dyer, in turn, has collaborated productively\u000a      with the BFI to shape film\u000a      seasons based on his expertise and research interests. Of Dyer's work on\u000a      the Rota and Minnelli\u000a      seasons, Head of Film Programming, BFI Southbank, writes: `in both\u000a      instances (and as with\u000a      Richard's previous collaborations with us), we found his work excellent in\u000a      every respect; and I\u000a      know from feedback that our audiences did too, so that we certainly hope\u000a      to make use of his\u000a      expertise again in the future' (5.10).\u000a    Dyer's research into Rota and Minnelli, the song and musicals intersects\u000a      with his long-standing\u000a      research interests in queer film and culture. Dyer has had continued\u000a      impact in this area during the\u000a      assessment period. Most notably, his gay-related work in the period saw\u000a      his involvement in the\u000a      `Gay Icons' exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery (2 July-18 October\u000a      2009) (3.4), including\u000a      giving a presentation jointly with the comedian Sandi Toksvig on 23 July\u000a      2009 and co-leading with\u000a      artist Sadie Lee a tour of some of the related portraits in the gallery\u000a      itself (2 July; 110 tickets sold).\u000a      The Director of the National Portrait Gallery testifies to the importance\u000a      of Richard's work: `First, his\u000a      essay contribution to the catalogue demonstrated his wide-ranging\u000a      contextual knowledge of the\u000a      subject of gay iconography. His essay was also of great interest to those\u000a      who bought the\u000a      publication and in the discussions around the exhibition. Secondly, his\u000a      contribution to the public\u000a      discussion with Sandi Toksvig, was very important in terms of allowing\u000a      wider debate to flow from\u000a      the exhibition, and the combination of an academic and a prominent\u000a      broadcaster made a\u000a      significant contribution to the public programme of the National Portrait\u000a      Gallery' (5.10). Dyer also\u000a      gave a talk on curating the exhibition at a London Metropolitan Archives\u000a      study day (5 December\u000a      2009; 64 attendees). Dyer was an interviewee for a film about Rock Hudson\u000a      as a queer star (Rock\u000a        Hudson &#8212; Dark And Handsome Stranger, directed by Andrew Davies and\u000a      Andr&#233; Sch&#228;fer and\u000a      premiered at the Berlin Film Festival in 2010). He gave talks on this\u000a      topic before performances of\u000a      the play Rock, by Tim Fountain, at Unity Theatre Liverpool (part\u000a      of the Homotopia festival; 66\u000a      tickets sold) on 17 May 2008 and Oval House Theatre, London, on 14 June\u000a      2008 (40 attendees in\u000a      the upstairs theatre which seats 50). He also co-presented on issues of\u000a      queer cinema with Ruby\u000a      Rich at the Cornerhouse cinema on 12 May 2008 (110 attendees), and for the\u000a      2010 Sexuality\u000a      Summer School he co-ran with Jackie Stacey a workshop on `Textual\u000a      Intimacy' on 25 May.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study focuses on the impact that Richard Dyer's research on\u000a      music, film, and culture has\u000a      had in the area of cultural life and the presentation of cultural\u000a      heritage. At the centre of this is his\u000a      work on the composer Nino Rota, which relates in one direction to his work\u000a      on the use of song in\u000a      film and on the other to his work on lesbian and gay culture.

The first, Nino Rota: Music, Film and\u000a        Feeling (3.1), is the most\u000a      recent example of Dyer's longstanding specialist engagement with European\u000a      cinema, especially in\u000a      its popular forms, and considers Rota's collaborations in major genres\u000a      (especially melodrama and\u000a      comedy) and with leading directors (including Visconti and Fellini). It is\u000a      an original study of\u000a      soundtracks that resonate across Italian cinema and beyond (e.g. The Godfather\u000a      films), and which\u000a      are, for the general public, perhaps among the most memorable in cinema.\u000a      Dyer's analyses bring\u000a      out the special quality of `ironic attachment' (as opposed to detachment)\u000a      across Rota's work. In\u000a      2011, emerging from the same research activity, Dyer also published `The\u000a      Ending of 8&#189;' in Brown\u000a      and Walters, eds., Moments in Film (3.3) (not one of his four REF\u000a      outputs), which discusses Rota's\u000a      music. In the Rota book, in addition to giving an account of Rota's\u000a      specific aesthetic, Dyer attends\u000a      to the issue of gay cultural production and notions of `gay music', thus\u000a      tying his most recent work to\u000a      his other specialist interests in queer culture and film.\u000a    In the second book, In the Space of a Song (3.2), Dyer considers,\u000a      through a series of case studies\u000a      from classical Hollywood musicals to Italian and Hindi cinema, what\u000a      happens when a song is heard\u000a      and, importantly, seen in film, the way songs take off from the space-time\u000a      of the story, the\u000a      significance of where songs take place and what singers look like singing.\u000a      The ideological\u000a      relationships negotiated through song with regard to gender, race, and\u000a      sexuality in this text\u000a      continue his research in identity politics. Sight &amp; Sound\u000a      commissioned an extended article on\u000a      Minnelli's Meet Me in St. Louis upon the publication of In the\u000a        Space of a Song, and, as with his\u000a      scholarship on Rota, this research, in turn, brought Dyer once again to\u000a      the attention of the BFI.\u000a    More recently Dyer has published other peer-reviewed articles related to\u000a      song in film, which extend\u000a      his aforementioned research interests in music, race, and European cinema:\u000a      `White Enough' in\u000a      Tzioumakis and Lincoln, eds., The Time of Our Lives: Dirty Dancing and\u000a        Popular Culture (3.5) and\u000a      `The Pervasiveness of Song in Italian Cinema' in Bayman and Rigoletto,\u000a      eds., Popular Italian\u000a        Cinema (3.6).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41441","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3202326","Name":"Croatia"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The work of Dr. Lena Simic and her collaborators Jennifer Verson (artist\u000d\u000a      and Research Associate for the Archbishop Desmond Tutu Centre for War and\u000d\u000a      Peace Studies), Dr. Gary Anderson, Dr. Niamh Malone, Ms Carmel Cleary as\u000d\u000a      well as a number of participating artists in the Cartographies of Justice\u000d\u000a      project (Sai Murai, Natasha Davis, Katherina Radeva, Zodwa Nyoni etc.)\u000d\u000a      have all had an impact on changing perception of migrants in the community\u000d\u000a      as well as bettering the lives of a select number of Merseyside Refugee\u000d\u000a      and Asylum Seekers pre and post Natal Group women in Liverpool.

The piece (including its\u000d\u000a      documentation\/marketing material) was seen by approximately 1000 audience\u000d\u000a      members. The performance's message was about motherhood and migration, and\u000d\u000a      audiences were given an opportunity to reflect on how migrants (as\u000d\u000a      mothers) are perceived. In addition to performances, Simic offered\u000d\u000a      workshops and\/or artist talks. Simic's research work focused on migration\u000d\u000a      and motherhood throughout her academic career at Liverpool Hope (from\u000d\u000a      2006).\u000d\u000a    In 2011 Simic developed ACE funded Becoming British workshops and\u000d\u000a      Blood &amp; Soil performance at the West Everton Community Council.\u000d\u000a      The workshops were attended by a group of Liverpool's migrant artists as\u000d\u000a      well as ESOL students from Blackburn House (35 participants overall). The\u000d\u000a      performance was seen by 50 people and through its subsequent tour at\u000d\u000a      Lantern Theatre, and three conferences, by 150 more. Thinking critically\u000d\u000a      about citizenship and questioning how citizenship is portrayed by\u000d\u000a      neoliberal governmental policies has been one of the agendas at the\u000d\u000a      creative workshops which tackled the compulsory test for British\u000d\u000a      citizenship `Life in the UK'.

At the occasion Simic and Verson performed\u000d\u000a      `Betting on Being British' (a version of Blood &amp; Soil).\u000d\u000a      Migrant Artists Mutual Aid also staged Vagina Monologues in 2012\u000d\u000a      (as a part of V-day campaign to end violence against women and girls and\u000d\u000a      which runs every February) in order to raise awareness about FGM and fight\u000d\u000a      the real battle for a survivor and her young daughter.

With Blood &amp;\u000d\u000a        Soil: we were always meant to meet... performance event (and then Betting\u000d\u000a        on Being British) we were able to explore the performative and\u000d\u000a      social impact of the work for different audiences that included,\u000d\u000a      academics, artists, refugees and asylum seekers. The publication Blood\u000d\u000a        &amp; Soil: we were always meant to meet... served as a theoretical\u000d\u000a      document and a legacy that extends the impact of the work. One of the\u000d\u000a      results of the collaboration has been the founding of Migrant Artists\u000d\u000a      Mutual Aid which embeds the possibilities of the social impact of\u000d\u000a      contemporary performance into the lives of Migrants living in Liverpool.\u000d\u000a      Key principles of embedding contemporary performance authentically into\u000d\u000a      social justice work were developed through Blood &amp; Soil.\u000d\u000a    Cartographies of Justice creative event was an example of\u000d\u000a      innovative best practice in how performance and performative environments\u000d\u000a      can have positive social impacts. It merged authentic solidarity with\u000d\u000a      Migrants in crisis through professional development, resource sharing, and\u000d\u000a      friendship with a performative historical exploration of migration. My\u000d\u000a      current work exploring contemporary performance and peace building is a\u000d\u000a      direct result of the creative and theoretical research that I have\u000d\u000a      undertaken with Lena.\u000d\u000a    &#8226; Testimonial from exiled journalist from Gambia\u000d\u000a    Performance With Lena Simic &amp; Its Impact On Me\u000d\u000a      I first met Lena Simic in late 2010, immediately after I was released from\u000d\u000a      the Oakington Immigration Detention Centre in UK. This was when I found\u000d\u000a      myself in total confusion about my asylum in the UK and barely lost my\u000d\u000a      conscience. I can say that I was psychologically affected in one way or\u000d\u000a      the other. Soon after my release from the detention, I had to stand with\u000d\u000a      my two feet in collaboration with friends and kind hearted people to raise\u000d\u000a      fund for my legal fee, when I was only an asylum seeker and had no\u000d\u000a      permission to take employment in the UK. This was the time when I was\u000d\u000a      invited by Dr. Lena Simic to join her project on \"How To Become British\".\u000d\u000a      This invitation not only gave me courage to speak out about my ordeal in\u000d\u000a      an open forum, but it also gave me opportunity to meet other people, may\u000d\u000a      be, in similar situation and, as a result contributed a lot in making me\u000d\u000a      who am I today.\u000d\u000a    \"How to Become British\" project also increased my knowledge about UK\u000d\u000a      through Lena's performance in recognising all the importance dates in this\u000d\u000a      country. I will say that this project has also given me opportunity to\u000d\u000a      meet many friends who, in one way or the other, impacted positively in my\u000d\u000a      life and my work as an exiled journalist in the UK. So to sum it all, I\u000d\u000a      will say this event was very inspirational and motivational to give me\u000d\u000a      strength in my quest for a safer place.\u000d\u000a    \"Blood &amp; Soil\" (We are always meant to meet... ) also contributed a\u000d\u000a      lot in my life and work. This phrase keeps ringing bell in my mind even\u000d\u000a      today as I was meant to meet Lena and Jennifer in this project. I\u000d\u000a      remembered standing on the hill of Everton Brow, while narrating my\u000d\u000a      stories. It also gave me courage to face the reality of the bureaucracy in\u000d\u000a      the West as I kept on waiting for somebody to decide my fate. I have a\u000d\u000a      strong conviction that people meet for a reason and I would always meet\u000d\u000a      people I meant to meet. I never thought of meeting such people when I was\u000d\u000a      escaping from persecution to flee to an unknown place, but this was just\u000d\u000a      consequences of my circumstance and choice of the situation. So I will\u000d\u000a      loudly say it once again, that my involvement in this project has created\u000d\u000a      a positive impact in my life for the courage to stand and narrate my story\u000d\u000a      with the hope that one day all this would be a thing of the past. I was\u000d\u000a      first confused how can I narrate my story through performance, but this\u000d\u000a      project had turned that doubt into a reality.\u000d\u000a    Through Dr. Lena, I was also able to associate myself with the Migrant\u000d\u000a      Artists Mutual Aids in Liverpool. As it name, this project contributes a\u000d\u000a      lot on my work as an exiled journalist and it is today helping a member\u000d\u000a      who has fallen in similar situation of cultural persecution.\u000d\u000a    I recently join the first ever migrant slam, dubbed Cartographies of\u000d\u000a      justice by the Liverpool Hope University organised by Dr. Lena and co.\u000d\u000a      This also created a positive impact on my work as a slammer, poet and\u000d\u000a      story teller. Not only contributed to this project as a slammer, but I was\u000d\u000a      able to secure a little funding for my radio project, Gambiankolu Media\u000d\u000a      and African Radio as moral boost.

The Institute's work is firmly situated\u000d\u000a      within this framework of DIY\u000d\u000a      artist led initiatives. According to Lois Keidan `Artist led initiatives\u000d\u000a      are the lifeblood of Live Art.\u000d\u000a      Working beyond the restrictions of the museum, the gallery or the theatre\u000d\u000a      they are not dependent\u000d\u000a      on the permissions of others and do what they want, how they want, when\u000d\u000a      they want, and where\u000d\u000a      they want. Driven by passion, generosity and energy, and responsible only\u000d\u000a      to themselves, their\u000d\u000a      collaborators and their constituents, they are the spaces where different\u000d\u000a      kinds of questions about\u000d\u000a      the role of art and artists are asked, and where new ways of working are\u000d\u000a      tried and tested. They are\u000d\u000a      critical and essential catalysts for action and for change, and the\u000d\u000a      Institute has, since 2007, been\u000d\u000a      one of the most critical and essential we have.' Cathy Butterworth, Live\u000d\u000a      Art Producer in Liverpool\u000d\u000a      writes: `One of the key and most important qualities of the Institute is\u000d\u000a      its longevity and\u000d\u000a      sustainability. The Institute is a blueprint, not only for artist led\u000d\u000a      initiatives, but also for all arts\u000d\u000a      organisations that aim to present, foster, support and develop radical\u000d\u000a      practice. In my experience\u000d\u000a      there are many arts organisations that could learn many vital lessons from\u000d\u000a      the Institute: how to\u000d\u000a      genuinely and meaningfully collaborate; how to consistently innovate and\u000d\u000a      develop forward thinking,\u000d\u000a      relevant and powerful projects; how to communicate and disseminate ideas\u000d\u000a      and strategies; how to\u000d\u000a      inspire and how to continue to be inspired.'

Their work has been\u000d\u000a      commissioned for Two Degree\u000d\u000a      festivals organized by Artsadmin (2009, 2011, 2013), PLATFORM's exhibition\u000d\u000a      `C Words: Carbon\u000d\u000a      Climate Capital Culture' (Arnolfini 2009), The Ashden Directory (2010).\u000d\u000a      The Institute have also\u000d\u000a      been hosts to Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping during their\u000d\u000a      UK tours in 2009, 2011\u000d\u000a      and 2013, which focused on sustainability and climate change.\u000d\u000a    According to Judith Knight, director of Artsadmin `Through our programmes\u000d\u000a      on art and activism we\u000d\u000a      try to have an impact on our wider sector in the UK and Europe, to be part\u000d\u000a      of a wider movement of\u000d\u000a      artists, venues, and festivals who are confronting the politics of climate\u000d\u000a      change and social change.\u000d\u000a      We think that the Institute are a great example of how to do this, and\u000d\u000a      will continue to invite them\u000d\u000a      back to London. We are currently trying to support them to take their work\u000d\u000a      and ideas across\u000d\u000a      Europe, through the Imagine 2020 Network of European arts organisations\u000d\u000a      who present work\u000d\u000a      about climate change, to give their model of working an even greater\u000d\u000a      impact' (full testimonial\u000d\u000a      available). Reverend Billy, one of the world's leading art activists from\u000d\u000a      New York, states: `Lena and\u000d\u000a      Gary will lead us to the artists who should have been and now will be our\u000d\u000a      influences, while\u000d\u000a      simultaneously bringing neighborhood mothers into their living room to\u000d\u000a      discuss climate change' (full\u000d\u000a      testimonial available).\u000d\u000a    Financial transparency and support\u000d\u000a      The Institute's work is furthermore activist and political &#8212; financial\u000d\u000a      resources have been diverted\u000d\u000a      from the family income (10%) to support activist practices. This has\u000d\u000a      impact on live art economies,\u000d\u000a      as referenced by Lyn Garnder in the Guardian (2009). In addition to\u000d\u000a      creating its own art activist\u000d\u000a      practice of family performances, the Institute is facilitating artist\u000d\u000a      residencies and providing an\u000d\u000a      alternative space for cultural activism in the city of Liverpool post\u000d\u000a      Liverpool08, European Capital of\u000d\u000a      Culture year.

The initiative\u000d\u000a      is financed by 10% of the\u000d\u000a      family's income (salaries, child benefit, freelance work). As part of a\u000d\u000a      reflexive methodology which\u000d\u000a      focuses on the lived experience and blurring of boundaries of the private\u000d\u000a      and the public (in line with\u000d\u000a      feminist and Marxist theoretical frameworks) Anderson and Simic have\u000d\u000a      combined their professional\u000d\u000a      and domestic life through this innovative research-informed performance\u000d\u000a      practice. The Institute\u000d\u000a      runs a series of events (performances, artist residencies, roundtable\u000d\u000a      discussions, reading groups).\u000d\u000a      Substantial documentation of the Institute's activities can be found on\u000d\u000a      the website\u000d\u000a      (www.twoaddthree.org). Some of\u000d\u000a      the Institute's activities have been framed as practice-based\u000d\u000a      research projects focussing on the politicisation of family life,\u000d\u000a      heteronormativity, complicity in\u000d\u000a      consumer capitalism, financial transparency and the environment. These\u000d\u000a      have been submitted as\u000d\u000a      practice-based research outputs by Dr Gary Anderson and Dr Lena Simic.\u000d\u000a    The Institute's practice-based research `Performing Family' and\u000d\u000a      `Performing Environments'\u000d\u000a      underpin this impact case study. `Performing Family' consists of\u000d\u000a      innovative performance making\u000d\u000a      methodology in the form of family picnics and interruptions through which\u000d\u000a      heteronormative family\u000d\u000a      constructions are exposed and critiqued (the father makes political\u000d\u000a      speeches, the mother takes\u000d\u000a      care of the food and children). `Performing Environments' practice-based\u000d\u000a      research utilizes the\u000d\u000a      already developed family performance making methodology and tackles issues\u000d\u000a      of climate change\u000d\u000a      and sustainability. Furthermore, this practice-based research involves\u000d\u000a      `slow travel performances'\u000d\u000a      and home movies. The Institute's particular performance making methodology\u000d\u000a      was presented at\u000d\u000a      various venues and festivals across the UK (Artsadmin, Arnolfini, the\u000d\u000a      Bluecoat, Live Art\u000d\u000a      Development Agency, Hazard) and abroad (Kunstraum Lakeside, Klagenfurt,\u000d\u000a      Austria).\u000d\u000a    Both examples of practice-based research are theorized and contextualized\u000d\u000a      in relevant\u000d\u000a      academic and artistic peer-reviewed publications (see references to\u000d\u000a      research section). `Negotiating\u000d\u000a      a Domestic: Cultural Agency and the Institute for the Art and Practice of\u000d\u000a      Dissent at Home' attempts\u000d\u000a      to deconstruct the artworld's signifiers of value (`regional', `national'\u000d\u000a      and `international') and situate\u000d\u000a      the work of the family `at home' arguing for internationally significant\u000d\u000a      domestic agency. `Live Art\u000d\u000a      and the Domestic: Abusing the Monogamous Heteronormative Nuclear Family\u000d\u000a      Unit' in\u000d\u000a      Contemporary Theatre Review looks at the nuclear family unit's\u000d\u000a      position within larger civil society\u000d\u000a      and seeks to identify political agency in refusing that position and\u000d\u000a      building an alternative to the\u000d\u000a      heteronormative nuclear unit. `The Hazardous Conversation: The Practice of\u000d\u000a      Intimacy in\u000d\u000a      Performance at the Institute for the Art and Practice of Dissent at Home'\u000d\u000a      explores the theoretical\u000d\u000a      constructions of the public and the private through the lens of the\u000d\u000a      familial as a performance script.\u000d\u000a      `Mum, is this all we came here for?' in Research in Drama Education\u000d\u000a      reflects on family's activist trip\u000d\u000a      to COP15 in Copenhagen whilst `Anti BP Song' in Not If But When:\u000d\u000a        Culture Beyond Oil contextualizes\u000d\u000a      the work of the Institute amongst other artists concerned with ecological\u000d\u000a      matters and climate change.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42125","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Capel: The Lights Are On presented cultural heritage through new\u000d\u000a      artistic expression to people with learning disabilities, academics,\u000d\u000a      farmers, artists, residents of Bronant and other parts of Ceredigion,\u000d\u000a      Welsh and non-Welsh speakers . It opened a former site of collective\u000d\u000a      identity and foregrounded the capacity of an individual to develop an\u000d\u000a      aesthetic and a continuing relationship with his culture (Evidence 5.1).\u000d\u000a      The work was developed by Adrian Jones, working for one hour a week over\u000d\u000a      nine months. Fourteen people participated in the making of the work. With\u000d\u000a      indirect involvement from families, the professional support framework as\u000d\u000a      well as key local individuals, around 100 people were involved. The\u000d\u000a      marginal position of people with learning disability in relation to those\u000d\u000a      without is both implicitly and, through the performances, explicitly\u000d\u000a      critiqued and adjusted.\u000d\u000a    The researcher proposed an approach that ordered the site with the\u000d\u000a      material. Rehearsals on site were conducted over two weekends and the week\u000d\u000a      of the performances. Moving the company outside of the studio where work\u000d\u000a      is usually performed opened the communities of Ceredigion to innovative\u000d\u000a      theatre practice that these audiences would not usually engage with.\u000d\u000a      Evidence states that the work was: `a creative and innovative combination\u000d\u000a      that would almost certainly have been outside of the experience of most\u000d\u000a      members of the audience' (Evidence 5.1). The appearance of performers with\u000d\u000a      disabilities alongside trained dancers, athletes, mixed ages and those\u000d\u000a      with no training provoked audiences to consider disability and ability,\u000d\u000a      theatre and community in rural Wales (Evidence 5.2 DVD 1 58:28 - 59:27).\u000d\u000a      New ways of thinking about equality and creative practice were generated.\u000d\u000a      From the evidence the following is stated: `...at the end of the day they\u000d\u000a      are people and have exactly the same talents as everyone else'(evidence\u000d\u000a      5.2 DVD 2 49:12 - 50.18 and DVD 3 21:58 - 24:00 ).\u000d\u000a      Further evidence offers the following: `In this context performance art,\u000d\u000a      which is often perceived in rural cultures as an intrusive fad, a cultural\u000d\u000a      imposition, came into its own as the legitimate medium for investigating\u000d\u000a      the way in which individual identity flows around and within cultural and\u000d\u000a      concrete constructs' (Evidence 5.1) and: `Cyrff Ystwyth is a group\u000d\u000a      which deals with everyone in the same way. Everyone is treated the same\u000d\u000a      way because of the discipline which is in the dance, and people, disabled\u000d\u000a      people, able bodied people, people learn so much from disabled people and\u000d\u000a      vice versa' (Evidence 5.2 DVD1 4:49 - 5:22). The cultural precedents of\u000d\u000a      these communities were remembered and current discourses of `belonging'\u000d\u000a      and action were questioned as the company engaged in rehearsal on site.\u000d\u000a      Who is cared for by whom, who makes authoritative statements and what\u000d\u000a      bodies and capabilities carry our cultural memories were questions\u000d\u000a      provoked by performance and the presence of the company at work in the\u000d\u000a      village.\u000d\u000a    The output exemplifies new approaches to site specific dance that\u000d\u000a      contribute to wider public understanding of the importance of place and\u000d\u000a      history in the present (Evidence 5.2 DVD1 43:26 43:52) as well as making\u000d\u000a      explicit the creative capacities of learning disabled people in\u000d\u000a      contributing to the community's understanding of itself (Evidence 5.1, 5.3\u000d\u000a      ,5.4, 5.5,). Evidence states that: `Their action in re-entering and\u000d\u000a      repossessing the Chapel during the period of performance challenged not\u000d\u000a      only the contemporary culture of marginalisation and impotence, but also\u000d\u000a      the limitations and restrictions which operated in the past' (Evidence\u000d\u000a      5.1). The site, closed since the early 1980s was no longer activated by\u000d\u000a      community practices. The output produced a renewed connection with the\u000d\u000a      chapel. The performances opened the various aspects of the place and at\u000d\u000a      the same time revealed the surrounding village. Bronant hosted audiences\u000d\u000a      from other places. Rather than a sense of loss, people reported that\u000d\u000a      familiar yet long since forgotten emotions emerged and a sense of\u000d\u000a      belonging and a removal of barriers between site and between people.\u000d\u000a      Evidence offers: `The place which I thought was Adrian's also belonged to\u000d\u000a      me' (Evidence 5.4 and evidence 5.2 DVD 3 18:00 - 21:56 and 51:31 - 53:02).\u000d\u000a    Beneficiaries include the participants in Cyrff Ystwyth and their\u000d\u000a      families and support workers. Testimony evidenced positive impact on their\u000d\u000a      daily life such as increased confidence and pride, particularly amongst\u000d\u000a      performers (Evidence 5.3). Key users of the research such as the Calvinist\u000d\u000a      Methodist congregation of Chapel Bronant who witnessed a re-engagement\u000d\u000a      with their chapel were consulted throughout the process via conversations\u000d\u000a      between the Deacon and the researcher\u000d\u000a      (Evidence 5.4). The opening of the redundant chapel was facilitated\u000d\u000a      through this disabled artist's practice. Evidence states: `Bringing him\u000d\u000a      out of the institutional enclosure back into his own community and giving\u000d\u000a      him the power to comment on, and in his own terms, analyse, the\u000d\u000a      disjunctions from which all his neighbours suffer, was in itself a\u000d\u000a      dramatic challenge to a prevailing malaise'(Evidence 5.1). Former social\u000d\u000a      practices were evident in the choreography by Jones as he responded to the\u000d\u000a      themes. Evidence 5.4 states: `It was felt that the performances created a\u000d\u000a      very strong link between place and belonging and this link was powerfully\u000d\u000a      conveyed with passion and feeling by members of the performing cast, this\u000d\u000a      being particularly poignant for chapel members in the case of Adrian\u000d\u000a      Jones, one of the disabled performers, as he himself is a chapel member'\u000d\u000a      and (Evidence 5.2 DVD 1 57:33 - 58:20 DVD 3 17:3 - 18:56). Challenges to\u000d\u000a      perceptions of learning disability are evidenced in the interviews with\u000d\u000a      participants (Evidence 5.2). Presenting cultural heritage is evidenced in\u000d\u000a      letters, for example: `Historically the Nonconformist Chapel was the\u000d\u000a      cultural and religious centre of these communities...'

The management and staff at the Centre have agreed to\u000d\u000a      carry out the Informed Consent to Participate in Research process on\u000d\u000a      behalf of the researcher and as a way into developing this critical aspect\u000d\u000a      of research engagement invited the researcher into a closed discussion\u000d\u000a      group with staff and service users. Issues of consent and refusal were\u000d\u000a      discussed over several meetings and the researcher compiled a discussion\u000d\u000a      document for staff training at the end of the series of weekly meetings.\u000d\u000a      This has since been used by centre staff and has helped in addressing\u000d\u000a      their requirements for understanding the dynamics of informed consent.\u000d\u000a      This was made possible through a Strategic Insight Programme Project that\u000d\u000a      Ames applied for entitled `Investigating the Requirements towards an\u000d\u000a      Assessment Method to Demonstrate Informed Consent'.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The site-specific performance Capel: The Lights are On increased\u000d\u000a      public understanding of the importance of place and belonging and\u000d\u000a      empowered people with learning disability to articulate cultural capital\u000d\u000a      and heritage through creative intervention.

The research\u000d\u000a      asks how the particularity of a site can be opened by performance that\u000d\u000a      produces highly personalised responses from a disabled artist. The\u000d\u000a      research shows that the resonances of former social practices can be\u000d\u000a      recovered and interpreted creatively, challenging assumptions about\u000d\u000a      learning disability, such as the notion that people with learning\u000d\u000a      disabilities are unable to understand what happens around them and unable\u000d\u000a      to contribute meaningfully to society as dependence on others signifies\u000d\u000a      inability and social problem rather than social contributor. [3.2; 3.3;\u000d\u000a      3.4; 3.5; 3.6; 3.7]. The research shows how this work contributes to\u000d\u000a      mainstream theatrical practice and challenges a perception of the demise\u000d\u000a      of communities.\u000d\u000a    The research process focuses on an annually self-selected member of the\u000d\u000a      group Cyrff Ystwyth who offers a theme for devising performance.\u000d\u000a      As verbal language is often not readily available to a person with\u000d\u000a      learning disabilities, movement is usually the primary mode of explanation\u000d\u000a      for the lead member's ideas. This person then works as the choreographer\u000d\u000a      whilst the researcher takes a dual role, bringing into play a directorial\u000d\u000a      function in order to both learn how the leader is working and to co-create\u000d\u000a      a public performance. The research then looks at what kind of performance\u000d\u000a      is made by choreographers with learning disabilities and what such\u000d\u000a      performances might offer mainstream theatre and dance and contribute to\u000d\u000a      understandings of disability, place, and identity. The performances serve\u000d\u000a      as a medium of direct communication with diverse audiences in Ceredigion\u000d\u000a      and contribute to greater understanding of life ways and personal\u000d\u000a      experiences amongst people who do not usually take public roles. Issues of\u000d\u000a      autonomy, responsibility, creative opportunities that are extremely\u000d\u000a      challenging and collaborative practice are inherent in the process. The\u000d\u000a      researcher disseminates information further by presenting at academic\u000d\u000a      conferences and publishing in academic journals. The research is outward\u000d\u000a      facing and all participants are informed about, and engaged in the\u000d\u000a      research. Cyrff Ystwyth engaged in this research as industry\u000d\u000a      partners with Ames acting as director and Co-Investigator. Other industry\u000d\u000a      partners are Half Moon Young People's Theatre in London and Oldham\u000a        Theatre Workshop. Dissemination is still underway at the time of\u000d\u000a      writing.The research is rooted in Ames' previous engagement with diverse\u000d\u000a      sections of the population across west Wales. During 2004 - 2007 Ames\u000d\u000a      worked throughout the three counties of the west of Wales in primary\u000d\u000a      schools, with youth groups, in day care settings and other public and\u000d\u000a      community contexts developing performance and performative responses to\u000d\u000a      specific issues with specific groups and individuals and mentoring school\u000d\u000a      teachers in the delivery of dance on the National Curriculum. The current\u000d\u000a      research seeks ways to develop a practice that enhances the quality of\u000d\u000a      individual and community life and civil society. Since 2005 two learning\u000d\u000a      disabled authors have created six full length works examining themes of\u000d\u000a      rural Welsh life. The focus is on how work made by learning disabled\u000d\u000a      people might contribute to and develop notions of skill in performance\u000d\u000a      [3.3; 3.4; 3.5; 3.6; 3.7]. In peripheral social contexts the research\u000d\u000a      produces a voice that demonstrates an alternative interpretation of\u000d\u000a      community arts practice. [3.2]. Cyrff Ystwyth's output is created\u000d\u000a      by people with learning disabilities. The research generates new ways of\u000d\u000a      thinking that influence creative practice and cultural life and is in turn\u000d\u000a      informed by people with learning disabilities as well as the academic\u000d\u000a      research community. [3.2; 3.3; 3.4; 3.5; 3.6; 3.7]. Thus the research\u000d\u000a      contributes to personal development and supports new forms of artistic\u000d\u000a      expression that contributes to the cultural life and civic society of this\u000d\u000a      area.\u000d\u000a    Cyrff Ystwyth has been making work with Ames since 1988. Adrian\u000d\u000a      Jones, a person with learning disabilities is author of Capel: The\u000d\u000a        Lights are On and has been in the company from the beginning. The\u000d\u000a      longevity of the work underpins this output. The endurance of the research\u000d\u000a      has afforded participants developmental opportunities as artists and\u000d\u000a      shifted roles and perceptions within their communities. All company\u000d\u000a      members self-select to join and all bring complex personal histories and\u000d\u000a      reasons for their involvement. Whilst many are people with learning\u000d\u000a      disabilities many have been and are working as carers. The work presents\u000d\u000a      alternative experiences for, and relationships between, people who are\u000d\u000a      cared for and carers. Cyrff Ystwyth is embedded within the\u000d\u000a      cultural fabric of Ceredigion through the personal experiences of its\u000d\u000a      participants and audiences over 25 years. This commitment to a community\u000d\u000a      and a practice presents deep layers of narrative, history and expression\u000d\u000a      that offer a view of a particular way of life expressed through theatre\u000d\u000a      over time.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42126","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Impact on cultural life: enriching public appreciation, understanding\u000d\u000a        and imagination.\u000d\u000a      Both productions revealed and demonstrated the aesthetic and\u000d\u000a      presentational possibilities of the\u000d\u000a      hybridisation of devised performance, dramatic stage practices and media;\u000d\u000a      and &#8212; in the\u000d\u000a      combination of contentious site and ground-breaking production &#8212; the\u000d\u000a      opportunity to offer original\u000d\u000a      artistic and intellectual experiences to contemporary audiences in a\u000d\u000a      theatrically sophisticated\u000d\u000a      manner [5.1] Both productions sold out, though audiences were\u000d\u000a      inevitably limited by the\u000d\u000a      restricted nature of their sites: The Persians: 8 x 120\u000d\u000a      spectators; Coriolan\/us: 8 x 350 spectators.\u000d\u000a      They were extensively previewed &#8212; including BBC Radio 4 Front Row\u000d\u000a      (11 August 2010)[5.2] &#8212;\u000d\u000a      and enthusiastically reviewed, in the Welsh and UK press.

Located in a replica village constructed to\u000d\u000a      enable the Army to train in\u000d\u000a      urban warfare, The Persians required extended and detailed\u000d\u000a      negotiations and practical\u000d\u000a      collaboration with Defence Estates and its agency Landmark to address and\u000d\u000a      settle complex site\u000d\u000a      management issues: the planning, scheduling and implementation of\u000d\u000a      scenographic construction;\u000d\u000a      the organisation and execution of effective public access; and the\u000d\u000a      successful realisation of\u000d\u000a      rehearsals and performances in extreme circumstances, through the\u000d\u000a      provision of access to existing\u000d\u000a      infrastructures and resources. During final rehearsals, performers and\u000d\u000a      crew lived in Army barracks\u000d\u000a      in Sennybridge and ate in the mess.\u000d\u000a    The Persians was staged in an isolated, rural location and was\u000d\u000a      produced by NTW in partnership\u000d\u000a      with Theatr Brycheiniog, Brecon. It demonstrated that work of high\u000d\u000a      standard can be created at site\u000d\u000a      with the participation of local organisations and operatives, both\u000d\u000a      professional and amateur: it\u000d\u000a      involved ten volunteer stewards from the local area for each performance,\u000d\u000a      contacted through\u000d\u000a      existing infrastructures and via the NTW on-line community. It\u000d\u000a      necessitated the detailed planning\u000d\u000a      and implementation of procedures for the processing, marshalling and\u000d\u000a      transportation of audiences.\u000d\u000a      `It is this ability to negotiate partnerships with seemingly intractable\u000d\u000a      establishments, as well as\u000d\u000a      gain the trust and support from local communities, that has helped the\u000d\u000a      company establish itself.'\u000d\u000a      (South East Wales, 18 January 2011).\u000d\u000a    As a direct result of the success of The Persians, Pearson,\u000d\u000a      Brookes and Banham were invited to\u000d\u000a      create a site-specific version of Coriolan\/us as NTW's major\u000d\u000a      contribution to the World\u000d\u000a      Shakespeare Festival\/London 2012 [5.12], with a total production\u000d\u000a      budget of &#163;200,000 from public\u000d\u000a      funding. It was produced in collaboration with the Royal Shakespeare\u000d\u000a      Company (RSC) and\u000d\u000a      staged in a large hanger at RAF St Athan in South Wales.

In addition to the expected outcomes at the end\u000a      of the two year period (mapping the research results and making\u000a      recommendations), the project also &#8212; uniquely &#8212; generated significant\u000a      impacts during the course of the project, specifically relating to\u000a      programming form\/content, modes of audience interaction, and strategic\u000a      development.\u000a    The project placed Boomerang+ in a unique position, because none of its\u000a      competitors had undertaken an audience study of this scale or rigour\u000a      (Source 5.1, p. 4; Sources 5.2 and 5.3); the insights generated by the\u000a      project gave the company a marked `edge', enabling them to ground and\u000a      justify their market position by drawing on concrete and current audience\u000a      data (Source 5.1, p. 5).\u000a    Impacts during the research process\u000a    The impact of the project on practitioners was instantly meaningful to\u000a      the company's creative outputs and played a positive role in the\u000a      development of current programmes. Throughout the research project, the\u000a      company pro-actively responded to feedback from the target audience and\u000a      (where appropriate) made agile, innovative and immediate adjustments to\u000a      their production work. Examples of the project's impact on creative\u000a      practice included:\u000a    \u000a      Adjustments to the form and content of continuity links: The research\u000a        revealed that audience members often had strong opinions about the\u000a        presentation styles of the on-air talent and the content of continuity\u000a        links (also referred to as the `wrap-around' service that the company\u000a        provides for S4C), so the company was able to quickly respond by making\u000a        subtle changes to scripts\/tone (See: Source 5.1, pp. 6-7; Source 5.2).\u000a      Adjustments to existing methods of audience interaction and the\u000a        introduction of new innovations: Boomerang+ often invited text message\u000a        participation during their continuity links and live Saturday-morning\u000a        broadcasts, but the research revealed that the target audience preferred\u000a        the more tangible sense of interaction created by phone-ins. The\u000a        research also generated valuable feedback on competitions (especially in\u000a        relation to prizes) and indicated enthusiasm for `dual-screen' formats.\u000a        The company responded by making appropriate changes to their modes of\u000a        audience engagement (cf. Sources 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3).\u000a      Underpinning decision-making, strategic development and new content\u000a        ideas: Boomerang+ was able to use the KTP as a means to gauge audience\u000a        response to its `tween' provision. The research revealed that the\u000a        company's newly launched programme, Stwnsh ar y Ffordd, was\u000a        favourably received. The first series had focused on primary schools,\u000a        because the company had predicted that the content would appeal mostly\u000a        to younger audiences. However, the appeal was broader than anticipated,\u000a        with unexpectedly enthusiastic responses from 11- to 13-year-old\u000a        children. So, Boomerang+ decided that the second series should involve\u000a        both primary and secondary schools, and adjusted the filming schedule\u000a        accordingly (cf. Sources 5.1 and 5.2).\u000a    \u000a    These illustrative examples indicate the importance of the KTP project\u000a      findings, in terms of scaffolding and enhancing the company's broader\u000a      understandings of their target audience, and helping to shape their\u000a      abilities to recognise and respond to the needs of their viewers within a\u000a      unique socio-cultural, minority language community.\u000a    Longer-term impact: Economic benefit &amp; influence on\u000a        practice\u000a    Whilst the short-term benefits were clear during the course of the\u000a      project, Boomerang+ also anticipated a longer-term positive impact (See:\u000a      Sources 5.1 and 5.2). The three-year S4C contract period within which the\u000a      research was conducted, worth in the region of &#163;4.8m per annum to the\u000a      company, was due for tender in April 2013. The company have since had that\u000a      contract extended until April 2014. Boomerang+ estimates that 20% of any\u000a      new contract would be directly attributed to the KTP project results,\u000a      representing a significant economic contribution to the company\u000a      specifically and the Welsh economy more generally. Further, the company\u000a      estimates that, over three years, their turnover will increase by &#163;1m as a\u000a      direct result of the KTP (Source 5.1, p. 8).\u000a    More subtly, the company regarded the KTP project as having longer-term\u000a      benefits in relation to building their Welsh-language children's content\u000a      production business, increasing sales to network broadcasters of\u000a      children's programmes (in the region of &#163;0.5m), generating &#163;40k through\u000a      syndication, and improving general operations (Source 5.1, p. 8).\u000a      `Facilitation' became a key word, in terms of developing creative ideas\u000a      into production concepts, re-directing existing creative production\u000a      practices, and improving the management, analysis and distribution of\u000a      knowledge and information relating to cultural trends. The impact of the\u000a      KTP exceeded the company's expectations in this respect (Source 5.1, p.\u000a      13).\u000a    General benefits of the research\u000a    The future availability of contracts for the production of children's\u000a      television content may be limited, mainly as a result of the UK\u000a      government's Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) which saw significant\u000a      reductions in expenditure and a new funding regime for S4C (Source 5.1, p.\u000a      6). Since children's programming is one of the largest single S4C\u000a      contracts held by Boomerang+, and accounts for 200 jobs, it is\u000a      economically imperative that the company continues to secure work.\u000a    As a direct result of the project, Boomerang+ enjoyed the benefit of\u000a      being able to test its creative ideas in a low-risk context before\u000a      pitching to S4C and\/or broadcasting live, and gauging the reception of\u000a      current programming. As indicated in Source 5.1 (p. 10 and p. 12), the KTP\u000a      project has enhanced the company's credibility and reputation within the\u000a      creative industries sector in Wales (also see: Sources 5.2 and 5.3), by\u000a      demonstrating their commitment to producing the highest possible quality\u000a      content.\u000a    More recently, on September 25th 2013, Boom Pictures' Children's\u000a      Department hosted a Royal Television Society special event &#8212; ``Not in\u000a      front of the Children': Can Quality and Originality Survive?' &#8212; focusing\u000a      on the future of children's television in the context of increased\u000a      competition and decreased funding. The event included presentations from\u000a      S4C's Commissioner of Children's Content, a producer from CBeebies (BBC),\u000a      a managing director from the independent production company Ho Ho\u000a      Entertainment, and Head of Boom Plant (who was also Company Supervisor of\u000a      the KTP project). The results of the KTP research featured prominently\u000a      throughout the event, as `evidence' of the target audience's current\u000a      characteristics and a key source of information in thinking about future\u000a      strategies for those working within children's television production. As\u000a      such, the project is continuing to `impact' on the industry.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The impact generated by the project outlined in this case study &#8212; a\u000a      Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) project between Aberystwyth\u000a      University and Boomerang+ (now Boom Pictures) &#8212; relates specifically to\u000a      issues of economic prosperity and cultural life in Wales,\u000a      in the context of the media industries (especially television production)\u000a      and the artefacts\/texts they create for specific target audiences.\u000a    The project, which focused on 7- to 13-year-old (`tween') Welsh\u000a      children's media preferences and practices, helped to inform and shape the\u000a      company's outputs by adding `authority' to decision-making processes and\u000a      enabling `smarter' ways to tender for future contracts with their main\u000a      client, S4C, the nation's Welsh-language broadcaster. This proved crucial\u000a      for the company in economic terms, in a climate of significant budget-cuts\u000a      and intensifying competition across the sector.

The research methodologies\u000a      included an interactive online questionnaire, participatory\u000a      performance\/drama and art workshops, and focus groups. Emphasis was placed\u000a      on issues of language, form and content, and multi-media engagement. The\u000a      project had a Wales-wide scope, involved over 1000 children in schools\u000a      across the country, and represented the first ever data-gathering exercise\u000a      of its kind to be conducted with Welsh-speaking children. The emergent\u000a      findings from various `encounters' with the audience members produced a\u000a      `snap shot' of contemporary childhood in Wales (capturing issues of\u000a      cultural life that were important to the children) and of the media's\u000a      place within it, and was of direct relevance to Boomerang+'s creative\u000a      practices and future strategic development (Reference 3.3).\u000a    The research was conducted within two frameworks. The first was the\u000a      Department's ongoing research and engagement with the cultural industries\u000a      in Wales. Professor Tom O'Malley (Reference 3.1) and Dr Jamie Medhurst\u000a      (Reference 3.6) both specialise in research on the media in Wales,\u000a      Professor Martin Barker has a strong track-record of influential audience\u000a      research, whilst Professor Elan Closs Stephens was formerly Chair of S4C\u000a      (1998-2006) and is currently Chair of the BBC Trust (2010-present).\u000a      Expertise in minority language media is exemplified by the work of the\u000a      Mercator Media Centre, which is based in the Department. More broadly,\u000a      Professors O'Malley, Pearson and Stephens are on the Editorial Board of Cyfrwng\u000a      (Media Wales Journal). Finally, the Department's Stakeholder Advisory\u000a      Board includes key members of the media industries in Wales, such as Peter\u000a      Edwards (Film Agency for Wales), Huw Eurig (Boom Pictures), Tim Hartley\u000a      (S4C), Keith Jones (BBC), Elis Owen (BBC), and Mark Reid (BFI). This\u000a      distinctive, Department-specific research environment prompted the\u000a      establishment of a strategic partnership with Boomerang+, which was\u000a      launched in 2008. In turn, the KTP project outlined in this document grew\u000a      out of this partnership, and ran from April 2010-12.\u000a    The second, project-specific framework relates to Dr Merris Griffiths'\u000a      work in the broad field of children's media and her expertise in\u000a      media-related audience research with children, which provided a `good\u000a      match' for the company's specific needs in wanting to better understand\u000a      their target audience. The KTP offered Boomerang+ a timely opportunity to\u000a      further strengthen their industry position as one of the main producers of\u000a      original children's television content in the UK (Source 5.1, p. 5), by\u000a      generating new data on children's media preferences and practices that\u000a      could be tailored to the company's requirements.\u000a    Griffiths has published research on a range of relevant issues, including\u000a      advertising to children (Reference 3.5), cross-cultural analysis of\u000a      children's everyday lives (References 3.2 and 3.4), media literacy policy\u000a      and practice in Wales, local audience reception of film production in\u000a      Wales, and media-related audience research. Further, she is a board member\u000a      of the Wales Media Literacy Network (co-founded by Ofcom and Niace Dysgu\u000a      Cymru), on the Editorial Board for Participations: Journal of Audience\u000a        &amp; Reception Studies, and a peer reviewer for Children &amp;\u000a        Society.\u000a    In terms of the KTP specifically, Griffiths' (References 3.2, 3.4 and\u000a      3.5) innovative approaches to developing multi-mode audience research\u000a      methods suitable for work with (bilingual) children, which she has\u000a      developed over a period of about fourteen years, was of central importance\u000a      to the project. The `knowledge transfer' that occurred as a result of the\u000a      KTP project related primarily to methodology, but was also anchored in\u000a      Griffiths' considerable knowledge of the children's media landscape more\u000a      generally.\u000a    Without Griffiths' input, Boomerang+ would not have had the knowledge or\u000a      capacity to design and implement such an extensive and complex\u000a      data-gathering exercise using a range of interlocking approaches. The\u000a      research was designed in such a way as to build a range of datasets that\u000a      could be compared, in order to highlight and `test' various emergent\u000a      patterns of audience response. As such, Griffiths' expertise &#8212; as arguably\u000a      the only person in Wales conducting this kind of research &#8212; fed directly\u000a      into the KTP and enabled a raft of impacts and benefits to be generated.\u000a    The KTP enabled the company to avoid the pit-falls and concerns often\u000a      associated with child-related research (in terms of ethical\u000a      considerations, research design, and access to participants), radically\u000a      enhancing their capacity to undertake such work, and the project became a\u000a      crucial link between the company and its intended target audience.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42128","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The most significant and sustained impact that What's Welsh for\u000d\u000a        Performance?

In\u000d\u000a      response, a number of the artists (or their families) have been inspired\u000d\u000a      to undertake their own investigations into this history, often leading to\u000d\u000a      new creative works. These have included reunion performance events (eg.\u000d\u000a      Memorial for Ian Hinchliffe at London's Beaconsfield Gallery, 2011); the\u000d\u000a      exhibition of performance documentation (eg. by Ivor Davies at London's\u000d\u000a      Laure Genillard Gallery 2013); and the commissioning of younger artists\u000d\u000a      (John Gingell Award, g39 Gallery Cardiff, 2012-13). [Source 5.7]\u000d\u000a    In addition, WsWfP has made a particular effort to build\u000d\u000a      relationships with young artists engaged in live art in Wales (eg. Rowan\u000d\u000a      O'Neill, the Showroom collective, Kathryn Ashill, Sam Hasler) and to\u000d\u000a      familiarize them with the local history of their practice. The Arts\u000d\u000a      Council of Wales's Arts Director has praised the project for providing\u000d\u000a      `the encouraging context for a new generation to see this work as possible\u000d\u000a      and realisable in Wales'. [Source 5.4] Several of these artists\u000d\u000a      have created works that have drawn for inspiration on the resources that\u000d\u000a      the project has made available. [Source 5.8]\u000d\u000a    The momentum created by WsWfP's public events has led to further\u000d\u000a      activities through which the reach of the research has been significantly\u000d\u000a      increased. Several media outlets in Wales have covered the research:\u000d\u000a      including BBC Radio Wales' weekly Art Show (which ran two\u000d\u000a      features) [Source 5.2]; Pitch art show on Radio Cardiff;\u000d\u000a      the online arts platform Culture Colony; Wales's leading literary\u000d\u000a      magazine, New Welsh Review; and the British Council-published Platfform\u000d\u000a      magazine. A number of Welsh bloggists have reviewed the project, including\u000d\u000a      Anthony Brockway [Babylon Wales], who advised readers that Roms\u000d\u000a      `has discovered an avant-garde we never previously knew existed. Be sure\u000d\u000a      to check out her brilliantly researched archive'. [Source 5.3]\u000d\u000a      Roms has been invited to lecture extensively on the research to general\u000d\u000a      (non-academic) audiences &#8212; between January 2008 and July 2013, she gave 18\u000d\u000a      public talks on various aspects of the history of performance art in\u000d\u000a      Wales, hosted by high-profile cultural organisations in Wales, the UK and\u000d\u000a      Europe. These have included the National Library of Wales, the National\u000d\u000a      Museum of Wales, Chapter (Cardiff) and Aberystwyth Arts Centre, Artes\u000d\u000a      Mundi, Axis, National Review of Live Art (Glasgow), The Institute of\u000d\u000a      Contemporary Arts ICA and Live Art Development Agency (both London), the\u000d\u000a      European Performance Art Festival (Warsaw) and Akademie der K&#252;nste\u000d\u000a      (Berlin). Their geographical and institutional spread is testimony to the\u000d\u000a      extent to which WsWfP has succeeded in building national and\u000d\u000a      international recognition for Welsh performance art among cultural\u000d\u000a      institutions and in promoting an attention to marginalized performance\u000d\u000a      histories.\u000d\u000a    In consequence, WsWfP has managed to enhance significantly the\u000d\u000a      public awareness of and engagement with performance history in Wales, and\u000d\u000a      to encourage an appreciation of the important contribution that the\u000d\u000a      artform has made to cultural life in the country, as well as to grow our\u000d\u000a      under-standing of Wales as a place of longstanding, vibrant and\u000d\u000a      internationally relevant artistic activity. As a result Roms is now\u000d\u000a      regularly invited to consult on aspects of Welsh artistic history, and\u000d\u000a      performance work is routinely considered for exhibitions, publications and\u000d\u000a      media coverage devoted to Welsh contemporary art on a national and\u000d\u000a      international platform. The Arts Council of Wales's Arts Director has\u000d\u000a      stressed how Roms's research has `stimulated public institutions to engage\u000d\u000a      in important new exhibitions and presentation of material in the public\u000d\u000a      domain'. [Source 5.4] To provide examples: WsWfP was\u000d\u000a      consulted by BBC Wales on late 20th century art in Wales for\u000d\u000a      its series Picturing the Century, 2010; WsWfP informed the\u000d\u000a      exhibition of John Cale by Wales at the Venice Biennale 2009 by\u000d\u000a      helping to connect the avant-garde activities of emigrated Welsh artists\u000d\u000a      such as Cale with those based in Wales; WsWfP provided the\u000d\u000a      National Eisteddfod's Visual Arts Committee with information on past\u000d\u000a      performance activities in Wrexham (for its Lle Celf exhibition, Eisteddfod\u000d\u000a      2011) and Barry (Eisteddfod 2012); and WsWfP contributed\u000d\u000a      documentary material and expertise to the Vale of Glamorgan Council's\u000d\u000a      exhibition on the history of Barry Summer School (2012). Outside of Wales,\u000d\u000a      WsWfP was invited in 2012 by Tate's Collection Care Department to\u000d\u000a      advise on oral history-based methodologies for the preservation of the\u000d\u000a      work of Tino Seghal. And a major European 50th anniversary\u000d\u000a      exhibition of the influential international art movement of Fluxus\u000d\u000a      features Roms's research on Fluxus in Wales (2012, and still touring). [Source\u000a        5.9]\u000d\u000a    Out of these activities have arisen three ongoing partnerships with major\u000d\u000a      stakeholders that allow WsWfP to inform more directly how\u000d\u000a      performance art in Wales today is funded, administered, exhibited and\u000d\u000a      conserved. The National Museum Wales Amgueddfa Cymru (NMW-AC) first worked\u000d\u000a      with WsWfP on the inaugural displays for its new National Museum\u000d\u000a      of Art in 2011, which, as NMW-AC's Curator for Contemporary Art confirms,\u000d\u000a      was informed directly by Roms's research. [Source 5.5] It\u000d\u000a      exhibited documentation of two performance pieces which WsWfP had\u000d\u000a      made available. Roms was invited to co-curate a public event on Joseph\u000d\u000a      Beuys's work in Wales to accompany a NMW-AC's exhibition (2011); and\u000d\u000a      NMW-AC and WsWfP currently collaborate on a major retro-spective\u000d\u000a      of Ivor Davies's performance in the context of Destruction in Art,\u000d\u000a      supported by an AHRC-funded Collaborative Doctoral Award (CDA, 2013-16).\u000d\u000a      NMW-AC's Head of Contemporary Art has called the partnership `a model for\u000d\u000a      the way academic research can reach wider audiences'. [Source 5.5]\u000d\u000a      In response to the research the Museum has also begun to consider how it\u000d\u000a      will collect and conserve Wales's performance legacy. WsWfP\u000d\u000a      collaborates on a further AHRC-CDA (2012-2015) with Chapter Arts Centre,\u000d\u000a      which is informing the art centre's directions in audience development and\u000d\u000a      innovative programming through a re-evaluation of its early history in the\u000d\u000a      1970s.

The ACW has furthermore taken an active interest in the\u000d\u000a      project through the presence of its Arts Director on WsWfP's\u000d\u000a      steering group.

And secondly, it has\u000d\u000a      enhanced our understanding of how performance art emerged and developed\u000d\u000a      outside the world's art capitals. By focusing on long-term developments in\u000d\u000a      a defined area, the research has brought to light several neglected\u000d\u000a      features of the early history of performance art in Wales (and Britain\u000d\u000a      generally): the activities of neo-avant-garde networks; the emergence of\u000d\u000a      innovative teaching approaches; the role of university patronage; the\u000d\u000a      formation of a support system of venues, festivals, platforms and funding\u000d\u000a      schemes. WsWfP is thereby making a significant contribution to the\u000d\u000a      recent `historical turn' in performance studies, which is shifting\u000d\u000a      scholarly attention from a close reading of selected canonical works to\u000d\u000a      the study of the wider scenes and infrastructures that helped to generate\u000d\u000a      a diversity of performance practices.

[database hosted on project\u000d\u000a      website; Ref. 3.1] The archival research is complemented by an\u000d\u000a      extensive oral history programme, featuring to date fifty interviews with\u000d\u000a      artists, administrators and past audience members. For these WsWfP\u000d\u000a      has pioneered innovative performative approaches: including group and\u000d\u000a      `in-situ' oral history conversations, and participatory memory\u000d\u000a      installations and re-enactment formats. A number of these research events\u000d\u000a      has been staged publicly, aiming to enable different communities of\u000d\u000a      interest (artists, art sector professionals, and general audiences of\u000d\u000a      contemporary art in Wales) to witness the research in action and to\u000d\u000a      contribute directly to it. WsWfP's fourteen public research events\u000d\u000a      to date include: a) publicly staged oral history conversations with\u000d\u000a      protagonists of Welsh performance history (2006-2012, funded by an Arts\u000d\u000a      Council of Wales\/National Lottery grant; supported by Chapter and Trace\u000d\u000a      Artspace, Cardiff); b) participatory events around audience's performance\u000d\u000a      memories (eg. Mapping Performance Art in &gt;Cardiff, 2008; How\u000a        to Build an Arts Centre? &#8212; An audio-guide of Chapter, 2011; both\u000d\u000a      commissioned by Experimentica Festival, Cardiff); and c)\u000d\u000a      re-enactments of historical performances (eg. restaging the Aberystwyth Fluxconcert\u000d\u000a      1968, 2008).

Roms's accompanying historiographic writings\u000d\u000a      on performance archiving, performing memory and performative evidence [Ref.\u000a        3.3, 3.4] offer new insights into key debates in performance studies\u000d\u000a      and have been cited by scholars interested in documentation, marginalised\u000d\u000a      performance histories and applied performance, but also by oral\u000d\u000a      historians, art archivists and scholars with an interest in practice-based\u000d\u000a      research methodologies.\u000d\u000a    Between 2008 and 2013, the research generated a book, ten book chapters\u000d\u000a      and peer-reviewed journal essays (one translated into German and Slovene),\u000d\u000a      a bilingual website and online database (logging the relevant holdings of\u000d\u000a      fifty-six archives and collections), fifty oral-history recordings, and\u000d\u000a      ten exhibitions, performances and workshops. [Ref. 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4,\u000d\u000a        3.5] During the same period Roms gave sixty scholarly keynotes and\u000d\u000a      papers on the research, at conferences and research seminars in the UK,\u000d\u000a      Europe and the US.

These themes are informed particularly by his research\u000d      into the theology underlying Messiaen's oeuvre, though also by his\u000d      interest in the work of P&#228;rt.\u000d    Sholl's work led him in February 2008 to convene Contemporary Music\u000d        and Spirituality, an international conference held at Southbank\u000d      Centre in February 2008 under the aegis of the University of West London\u000d      and the Royal Musicological Association. The conference included keynote\u000d      lectures by James MacMillan, the late Jonathan Harvey and Francis Pott, as\u000d      well as a lecture by Sholl himself. It was succeeded by a further\u000d      conference at the same venue on Boulez, in October 2011. The proceedings\u000d      of the first conference are due for publication in 2014 [Ashgate]. A\u000d      chapter by Pott examines his own intentions in The Cloud of Unknowing,\u000d      while one by Sholl articulates a thematics of spirituality (embodiment and\u000d      presence\/absence in works by Adams, Birtwistle, Ferneyhough, Feldman,\u000d      Tavener and Arvo P&#228;rt). Collaboration between Sholl and Pott has also\u000d      extended into performance, with Sholl performing organ works by Pott on a\u000d      number of occasions and in significant venues, including St Paul's\u000d      Cathedral in December 2011. Sholl has also performed music by composers\u000d      within his research focus and is currently preparing the complete oeuvre\u000d      of Messiaen for commercial recording on the Deux-Elles label.\u000d    Pott has acquired a reputation mainly as a composer of organ and\u000d      sacred choral music, but has moved gradually to a broadly agnostic,\u000d      humanist position. He has found value in viewing the Crucifixion in an\u000d      emblematic light, as a symbolic phenomenon perpetuated in the human\u000d      atrocities and man-made tragedies of successive ages and conflicts. This\u000d      has afforded a prism for contemplating the state of the modern world,\u000d      rather than meditating on the possibility of another beyond. That\u000d      preoccupation is demonstrated at length in his oratorio The Cloud of\u000d        Unknowing, submitted for RAE 2005. Currently realigning himself as a\u000d      composer through increasing outputs of chamber and orchestral music, Pott\u000d      has already produced a succession of substantial choral works (both\u000d      accompanied and a cappella).\u000d    A particular concern is interrogating in practice how far 16th-century\u000d      polyphonic technique can adapt to a modern idiom with an expanded\u000d      harmonic\/tonal frame of reference. This informed his 12-minute motet for\u000d      double chorus, When David heard that Absalom was slain (2008),\u000d      commissioned by the St Louis Chamber Chorus as part of its commitment to\u000d      perform modern and ancient settings of the same texts alongside one\u000d      another. It was carried further in his Mass for eight parts\u000d      (2011), in which hocketing, cantus firmus technique, antiphonal homophony\u000d      and sustained imitative motivic counterpoint co-exist with cyclical\u000d      concerns relating to the 20th century. The transmuting of ancient into\u000d      contemporary represents common ground with Sholl's pursuit of modernity\u000d      and tradition. Present activity sits within a department with a widely\u000d      varied focus, the history of which is expanded within REF 5.\u000d    Pott was a nominated finalist in the choral section of the annual\u000d      BASCA\/BBC Composer Awards in both 2006 and 2011, the latter occasion\u000d      concerning his Mass for eight parts, returned for REF 2014. Winner\u000d      of national and international composition awards including the Prokofiev\u000d      Competition, Moscow 1997, in 2004 he received Honorable Mention for two\u000d      major choral works in the Barlow Competition, USA, placed 2nd\u000d      in a worldwide field of 362 professional composers behind the British\u000d      composer Judith Bingham: the first time in the award's history when any\u000d      British composer had been recognized. His work has become known to a wide\u000d      audience on commercial CD (some twenty separate releases) and has been\u000d      broadcast widely, including simultaneous broadcasts to 22 separate\u000d      countries and the Vatican by BBC Radio 3 and separate transmissions in\u000d      many further nations. Major artists in nearly 40 countries have given\u000d      performances worldwide. Critical reception has been widespread and\u000d      positive, noting both the subject matter's preoccupations and the\u000d      revisiting of received techniques with new ends in mind. In 1992 Musical\u000a        Opinion cited Christus, Pott's Passion Symphony for organ\u000d      solo, as `clearly one of the most important organ works in our\u000d      [the 20th] century'. The Times described the work in\u000d      April 2001 as `Not a work beholden to any other: rather, an\u000d        astonishingly original composition, compelling in its structural logic\u000d        and exhilarating in performance'. In November 2007 Pott's oratorio The\u000a        Cloud of Unknowing was described in International Record Review\u000d      as `[a] passionate and apocalyptic masterpiece, ...a tour de force',\u000d      a view echoed across the national and parts of the international press.\u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    Impact consists in engaging with faith communities, performers and arts\u000d      bodies, academe, consumers and wider society to contribute to public\u000d      understanding or perception of how art informs, interrogates, and nurtures\u000d      spiritual awareness in a secular age; and in developing \/ enhancing\u000d      insight into specific musical repertoire and its contextual place in the\u000d      20th or 21st century.

Key contributors are Professor Francis Pott (Chair\u000d      of Composition) and Dr Robert Sholl (Reader in Music).\u000d    Sholl's specialisation in the oeuvre of Olivier Messiaen sits\u000d      within a wider interrogation of how aesthetics, philosophy and theology\u000d      meet through particular musics. It embraces the theology of Catholicism,\u000d      but also the thinking of Adorno and others. Sholl is concerned with a\u000d      cultural anthropology of the music that embraces critical and analytical\u000d      discourses, including more recently the discourse of embodiment. Pott's\u000d      sacred choral music and organ works, heard in nearly forty countries\u000d      worldwide, seek to align a contemporary aesthetic with rigorous testing of\u000d      how far sixteenth-century polyphonic techniques can be imported into\u000d      modern compositional exercise. He has also used large-scale commissions to\u000d      explore the interaction of `local' responsiveness to text and image with\u000d      broader structural imperatives rooted in the canon of 19th- and\u000d      20th-century chamber and orchestral music. His oratorio The\u000d        Cloud of Unknowing [2005] has been succeeded by Mass for 8 parts\u000d      [2011] and Word [2012], commissioned for the Merton Choirbook\u000d      Project, 2014, a 30-minute choral\/organ meditation on the Gospel in the 21st\u000d      century, cross-cutting verses from St John's Prologue (NRSV) with five\u000d      poems of R.S.Thomas. Pott's music has been widely recorded and published.\u000d      In October 2013 he signed an exclusive contract with Edition Peters for\u000d      publication of his future sacred choral and organ music and of his\u000d      unpublished back-catalogue in both areas.\u000d    Sholl has produced a succession of important papers at international\u000d      conferences, including London [2013; HEA funding awarded], Yale [2013],\u000d      Hong Kong [2012], Harvard [2011], Boston [2010], Birmingham [2008] and the\u000d      Southbank Centre, London, where he organised 2 conferences [2008 and\u000d      2011]; also chapters towards multi-authored books for Cambridge University\u000d      Press [2012], Grand Rapids: Eerdmans [2011] and Ashgate [2010]; and\u000d      peer-reviewed articles for Music and Letters [2012, x 2].

Sholl's work critically contextualises Messiaen\u000d      alongside such diverse composers as Tournemire and P&#228;rt. Its focus on the\u000d      nature of spirituality itself, and on locating the beautiful within\u000d      modernity, finds practical expression through Sholl's profile as an\u000d      organist, and a natural foil in Pott's preoccupations as a composer (some\u000d      of whose organ works he has performed).\u000d    LCM's wider profile of creative practice has included work for film and\u000d      concert hall by Simon Lambros and Paul Robinson.

SZT has been invited to give guest lectures on The Musicology of\u000d\u000a      Record Production and Analysis of Recorded Popular Music in UK, Germany\u000d\u000a      and USA, and to examine research degrees that cite his research in UK, NZ\u000d\u000a      and Denmark. In 2010 he was invited to teach a postgraduate summer school\u000d\u000a      in Osnabr&#252;ck based on his research with students from Germany, France, UK,\u000d\u000a      USA, Brazil, Argentina, Canada, Poland and Finland. SZT's current visiting\u000d\u000a      fellowship at Cambridge on Performance in the Studio involves working with\u000d\u000a      undergraduate students from RCM, GSMD &amp; Tech Music School to develop\u000d\u000a      pedagogical tools. These will help a wider range of students and teaching\u000d\u000a      staff in further HEIs to prepare a new generation of performers for work\u000d\u000a      in the studio or concert hall.

The highly\u000d\u000a      vocational nature of the academic subject and the fact that research\u000d\u000a      underpins the pedagogy means that LCM's research has a profound impact on\u000d\u000a      professional practice. This comes from two directions. Firstly, this\u000d\u000a      research has become central to pedagogy on record production in higher\u000d\u000a      education around the world and is thus helping to shape the mind-set of\u000d\u000a      the new wave of professional practitioners who are graduating from these\u000d\u000a      courses. Secondly, the high level of engagement with the Art of Record\u000d\u000a      Production projects by existing professionals, many of whom are now\u000d\u000a      developing dual careers in academia, and their trade organisations means\u000d\u000a      that they are engaging with, and even helping to shape, the research.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    UNIVERSITY of WEST LONDON\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"West London (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of West London","PeerGroup":"E","Region":"London","UKPRN":10006566}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2174003","Name":"Brisbane"},{"GeoNamesId":"2856883","Name":"Osnabrück"},{"GeoNamesId":"6325494","Name":"Québec"},{"GeoNamesId":"6254926","Name":"Massachusetts"},{"GeoNamesId":"5391959","Name":"San Francisco"},{"GeoNamesId":"2618425","Name":"Copenhagen"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a&#8226; Book: Allan F.

The development of theoretical work on the topic has always been\u000d\u000a      very closely tied to industry practice and research insights into the way\u000d\u000a      recorded music is created, listened to and interpreted have both informed\u000d\u000a      and been informed by the way professionals think and act. Allan Moore\u000d\u000a      developed the notion of the sound box to describe the perception\u000d\u000a      of spatialisation in stereo-recorded music in the early 1990s and\u000d\u000a      developed the concept both during and after his time at LCM (then part of\u000d\u000a      TVU). Between 2003 and the present Simon Zagorski-Thomas (SZT) has\u000d\u000a      produced work on various aspects of staging in recorded music\u000d\u000a      which expands on Moore's work (and William Moylan and Serge Lacasse in\u000d\u000a      North America) as well as performance in the studio and, more generally,\u000d\u000a      on the way to incorporate recording practice and recorded music into\u000d\u000a      musicology. In addition, Justin Paterson presented his work on audio\u000d\u000a      processing directly to current and aspiring industry professionals at the\u000d\u000a      AES's annual convention.\u000d\u000a    SZT has been a pivotal figure in the development of theoretical work\u000d\u000a      underpinning the pedagogy of Record Production in higher education around\u000d\u000a      the world. In 2005 he established the Art of Record Production\u000d\u000a      Conference. He has remained one of the conference's two permanent\u000d\u000a      directors. The event, which attracts a mixture of industry professionals\u000d\u000a      and academics, has been held in London, Edinburgh, Brisbane, Lowell\u000d\u000a      (Massachusetts), Cardiff, Leeds, San Francisco and Qu&#233;bec City. The 2013\u000d\u000a      conference will be held in Oslo. In 2006 he co-founded the Journal on the\u000d\u000a      Art of Record Production and was editor for three years. In 2009 he\u000d\u000a      co-founded the Association for the Study of the Art of Record Production\u000d\u000a      of which he is currently co-chair.\u000d\u000a    Alongside SZT and Justin Paterson's published outputs, eight other\u000d\u000a      members of LCM staff (Paul Borg, Steve D'Agostino, Mike Howlett, Mark\u000d\u000a      Irwin, Katia Isakoff, Paul Ramshaw, Larry Whelan and Pip Williams) have\u000d\u000a      contributed paper presentations, panel discussions and journal articles to\u000d\u000a      the Art of Record Production conference and journal, interweaving\u000d\u000a      their professional experience and research for presentation to a similarly\u000d\u000a      mixed audience. There is a similar intermingling of practice and research\u000d\u000a      at the Audio Engineering Society conventions where Katia Isakoff, Justin\u000d\u000a      Paterson and Simon Zagorski-Thomas have all made presentations. Most of\u000d\u000a      the department's staff engages in practice as research, much of it\u000d\u000a      involving record production.\u000d\u000a    SZT's publications between 2008 and the present, and his central position\u000d\u000a      in developing the international research community (and its disciplinary\u000d\u000a      agenda), have been instrumental in developing a theoretical and analytical\u000d\u000a      framework for examining the nature of recording practice and recorded\u000d\u000a      music alongside existing historical research in the field. Moore and SZT\u000d\u000a      continue to collaborate on elaborating the nature of recorded music,\u000d\u000a      relating to spatial perception, the schematic nature of recorded music and\u000d\u000a      cognitive processes informing its creation and interpretation. Moore\u000d\u000a      edited the special issue of Popular Music Journal in which SZT's 2010\u000d\u000a      article appeared. He also contributed a chapter to Frith and SZT's\u000d\u000a      2012-edited collection. SZT has also been researching how performance\u000d\u000a      practice and the recording process inform one another. His 2010 book\u000d\u000a      chapter led to a current AHRC-funded research network producing a range of\u000d\u000a      outputs.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42635","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"4566966","Name":"Puerto Rico"},{"GeoNamesId":"2264397","Name":"Portugal"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    These outcomes support the achievement of Article 31 of the International\u000a        Human Rights Convention: Rights of the Child, which expresses the\u000d      right of children to participate fully in cultural life.

The second of the two\u000d      events, focussing on methodologies for working with children with profound\u000d      disability has been particularly influential, with a range of new\u000d      performance and process methodologies being adopted by companies including\u000d      Replay, Northern Ireland; Eclectico Internacional, Puerto Rico; Teatro do\u000d      Biombo, Portugal; Peplum Cactus, France; and Commotion Dance, SE UK.\u000d      Moreover, the research outcomes are underpinning new teaching practice in\u000d      special schools in Ashford, Newcastle Under Lyme, Leicester and Inner\u000d      London.\u000d    The benefits of the TYA Centre's work can be seen also in the impact it\u000d      has had on the national TYA landscape. TYAUK, the UK Branch of ASSITEJ,\u000d      has collaborated on a number of projects and are now working with RBC to\u000d      create a new postgraduate qualification for established practitioners.\u000d      Drawing on the body of research outlined above, this will become an\u000d      important means of developing the TYA sector both in the UK and\u000d      internationally; of raising standards and quality, a strategic ambition of\u000d      ACE, expressed in its guidelines on theatre for, by and with children and\u000d      young people.\u000d    It should be noted that there is very little published research in this\u000d      area internationally, and next to nothing on practice in the UK. TYA has\u000d      been largely viewed as a subset of Applied Theatre. By focussing on it as\u000d      a performance practice RBC is pioneering the dissemination and exploration\u000d      of UK practice. The range of outcomes underpinned by this work has had\u000d      impact on established professional practice, the work of emerging artists,\u000d      students and academics (see sections 2, 3 and 5).\u000d    It is evident that the research has directly influenced practice within\u000d      the UKTYA sector, in particular through a number of RBC graduate\u000d      companies, some of which are now receiving ACE funding. It is clear that\u000d      their approach is informed by the methodologies resulting from the\u000d      research, using them as an impulse for original work which is reaching new\u000d      audiences and garnering critical acclaim.\u000d    The companies are itemised in 5.7 below.

The majority came from\u000d\u000a      the European\u000d\u000a      Commission, but other matched funding came from the Arts Council of\u000d\u000a      England, the National\u000d\u000a      Theatre, the City of Mons, The City of Enghien-les-Bains and The\u000d\u000a      Brussels-Wallonia Federation.\u000d\u000a    Project 2: danceroom Spectroscopy\u000d\u000a    1) Impact on audiences. To date, over 20,000 people have attended danceroom\u000d\u000a        Spectroscopy\u000d\u000a      and Hidden Fields events. Web statistics show over 40,000 hits for\u000d\u000a      related content, and Googling\u000d\u000a      `danceroom spectroscopy' gives more than 200 pages of hits. Notable live\u000d\u000a      events include:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Shambala Arts Festival (27-28 August 2011)\u000d\u000a      Bristol's Arnolfini (21-22 July 2012)\u000d\u000a      London 2012 Cultural Olympiad, Weymouth (4-5 August 2012)\u000d\u000a      London's Barbican Arts Centre (3-4 November 2012)\u000d\u000a      London's Big Bang science\/engineering fair (14-17 March 2012)\u000d\u000a      Watershed danceroom Spectroscopy festival, Old Passenger Shed, Bristol\u000d\u000a        Temple Meads (24-26\u000d\u000a        October 2013)\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    A recently awarded grant from the Arts Council of England, along with\u000d\u000a      additional funding from\u000d\u000a      NVIDIA will facilitate further development and a Europe-wide tour from\u000d\u000a      Autumn 2013 to Spring\u000d\u000a      2014. Confirmed dates include the Barbican (01-02.03.14) and the Zentrum\u000d\u000a      f&#252;r Kunst und\u000d\u000a      Medientechnologie (Karlsruhe, 04.01.14).\u000d\u000a    2) Education. Both the Centre de Arts and the National Theatre had\u000d\u000a      extensive school visit\u000d\u000a      programmes, covering all age groups. The Big Bang fair has an explicitly\u000d\u000a      educational role.\u000d\u000a      3) Impact on other practitioners. danceroom Spectroscopy and Hidden\u000d\u000a        Fields have had substantial\u000d\u000a      impact on our non-academic collaborators. Laura Kriefman (choreographer)\u000d\u000a      has enjoyed\u000d\u000a      significant exposure, with invitations to conduct workshops with\u000d\u000a      institutions including the Royal\u000d\u000a      Academy of Dance (London) and Northern Ballet. Phill Tew (programmer) has\u000d\u000a      boosted his\u000d\u000a      international reputation as a generative digital artist. He was awarded a\u000d\u000a      Watershed Pervasive\u000d\u000a      Media Studio residency, which led to his participation in other high\u000d\u000a      profile projects such as the\u000d\u000a      REACT project The Secret Lives of Books. Nathan Hughes and Jacob Parish\u000d\u000a      (film-makers)\u000d\u000a      produced a series of documentaries on the project. One of these was\u000d\u000a      shortlisted for a $100,000\u000d\u000a      Forward Focus prize sponsored by GE. The five dancers have gained valuable\u000d\u000a      experience at the\u000d\u000a      collaborative frontiers of art and science, and learnt strategies for\u000d\u000a      incorporating technology into arts\u000d\u000a      practice.\u000d\u000a    4) Technical innovation. danceroom Spectroscopy represents the\u000d\u000a      first ever real-time 360&#176;, 3D\u000d\u000a      depth-capture system, and has yielded a state-of-the-art GPU accelerated\u000d\u000a      framework for carrying\u000d\u000a      out quantum molecular dynamics. The latter has attracted interest from\u000d\u000a      science and computing\u000d\u000a      communities, indicated by a sponsorship relationship with leading\u000d\u000a      graphics-card manufacture\u000d\u000a      NVIDIA.\u000d\u000a    5) Commercial impact. On the basis of the technical innovations developed\u000d\u000a      through this project,\u000d\u000a      David Glowacki, Phill Tew and and Laura Kriefman have formed a spin-off\u000d\u000a      company, Interactive\u000d\u000a      Scientific Ltd. with a projected turnover of &#163;100k during 2013 - 2014.\u000d\u000a    6) Broader cultural impact. danceroom Spectroscopy was\u000d\u000a      highlighted by the newly appointed Arts\u000d\u000a      Council England chair, Sir Peter Bazalgette, during his inaugural lecture\u000d\u000a      in March 2013. The\u000d\u000a      project's impact has been strengthened considerably through connections to\u000d\u000a      Bristol's Pervasive\u000d\u000a      Media Studio (Watershed) and Arnolfini Art Gallery. The Watershed has used\u000d\u000a      danceroom\u000d\u000a      Spectroscopy as a Talent Development Case Study detailing successful\u000d\u000a      examples of cross-\u000d\u000a      fertilization between media organisations and the academic sector, and\u000d\u000a      built their 2013 showcase\u000d\u000a      event around it.\u000d\u000a    Indicators\u000d\u000a      Awards\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Royal Television Society 2012 `Best Digital Innovation'.\u000d\u000a      Mention, Prix Ars Electronica (Hybrid Arts category), May 2012.\u000d\u000a      University of Bristol 2013 public engagement award.\u000d\u000a      On the basis of his work on danceroom Spectroscopy, Glowacki won a\u000d\u000a        nine-year Royal Society\u000d\u000a        Kohn Award `for excellence in engaging the public with science',\u000d\u000a        starting October 2013.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Selected Press\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Chemistry World: http:\/\/www.rsc.org\/chemistryworld\/News\/2012\/March\/danceroom-spectroscopy-video-science-art-visualisation.asp\u000d\u000a        (readership 45,000)\u000d\u000a      Physics World: http:\/\/physicsworld.com\/cws\/article\/multimedia\/2011\/nov\/01\/dancing-in-the-quantum-world\u000d\u000a        (readership 110,000)\u000d\u000a      Spark Salon: http:\/\/spark.qualcomm.com\/salon\/escaping-uncanny-valley\u000a\u000d\u000a      Newsletter of the Society for Applied Spectroscopy: http:\/\/danceroom-spec.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/03\/SAS-Feb2012.pdf\u000a\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Funding\u000d\u000a      Orr-Ewing, Ashfold, et al, New Horizons in Chemical and Photochemical\u000d\u000a      Dynamics, EPSRC\u000d\u000a      EP\/G00224X\/1, 2008-13, &#163;5,934,426\u000d\u000a      Glowacki, Ashfold, et al., danceroom Spectroscopy: collectively generating\u000d\u000a      music from movement,\u000d\u000a      EPSRC, EP\/I017623\/1 &#163;20,000\u000d\u000a      Glowacki, EPSRC Pathways to Impact Funding, University of Bristol, &#163;37,000\u000d\u000a      Glowacki, Arts Council England, &#163;57,234\u000d\u000a      Glowacki, NVIDIA Academic Partnership Grant, &#163;10,000\u000d\u000a      Glowacki, Artist residency from Bristol Arnolfini, &#163;19,500\u000d\u000a      Glowacki, New Talent Residency from Bristol's Pervasive Media Studio,\u000d\u000a      &#163;17,500\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Professor Joseph Hyde's research explores the role of music and sound in\u000d\u000a      a broader\u000d\u000a      performing\/digital arts context, through installation and performance\u000d\u000a      works using interactive\u000d\u000a      technologies.

In addition to producing the sonification for the\u000d\u000a      installation, Hyde acted as a\u000d\u000a      mentor in exploring the artistic possibilities of the project and the\u000d\u000a      `placing' of it within the digital\u000d\u000a      arts\/music world, starting with a week-long workshop for 20 invited\u000d\u000a      artists which he led at the\u000d\u000a      Arnolfini in June 2011. He also proposed and drove the expansion of the\u000d\u000a      installation into a large-\u000d\u000a      scale dome format using six channels of HD video and 8-channel audio. He\u000d\u000a      facilitated the\u000d\u000a      partnering of Glowacki with choreographer Laura Kriefman and a corps of\u000d\u000a      five professional\u000d\u000a      dancers (Kriefman and several dancers took part in the Arnolfini\u000d\u000a      workshop), and with Plymouth\u000d\u000a      University's ICCI (Innovation for the Creative and Cultural Industries).\u000d\u000a      Hyde's involvement\u000d\u000a      culminated in the production of a performance piece using the danceroom\u000d\u000a      Spectroscopy system,\u000d\u000a      entitled Hidden Fields. This work, incorporating 5 dancers,\u000d\u000a      was conceived by Laura Kriefman and\u000d\u000a      Joseph Hyde, who also provided the sound design\/music for the performance.\u000d\u000a      Both danceroom\u000d\u000a        Spectroscopy and Hidden Fields went on to receive\u000d\u000a      considerable further public exposure, as\u000d\u000a      detailed in section 4.\u000d\u000a    Position held at Bath Spa University: Joseph Hyde (Senior Lecturer\u000d\u000a      09\/2001 - 11\/2011, Professor\u000d\u000a      12\/2012 - present)\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42663","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1168579","Name":"Pakistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1149361","Name":"Afghanistan"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Educational impacts\u000a    In 2002, Baily's research highlighted the fragile state of Kabul's art\u000a      music, which forms part of Afghanistan's intangible cultural heritage. The\u000a      AKMICA Tradition Bearers education initiatives resulting from the research\u000a      report and film cited above have successfully reversed this trend. Using\u000a      his deep knowledge of local music culture, Baily set up the first school\u000a      in Kabul and immediately appointed four of Kabul's master-musicians (ustads)\u000a      as teachers, asking them to recruit suitable students from hereditary\u000a      musician families; later, following his recommendations, AKMICA appointed\u000a      a full-time Afghan Coordinator, and in 2006 a second school was opened in\u000a      Herat city. The impact of the programme since 2008 is documented in the\u000a      Aga Khan Newsletter of February 2012, with a report of 64 successfully\u000a      graduating students at the two AKMICA schools in Kabul and Herat.[1]\u000a      At present the two schools have 157 students (20 of these female). Their\u000a      work is not simply a matter of preserving tradition, but also of promoting\u000a      creativity and development within this tradition. These schools have also\u000a      improved the low status of hereditary musicians, who are now seen both as\u000a      artists and as music educators.\u000a    At Monash in 2009, Baily worked closely with Dr Ahmad Sarmast, who was\u000a      raising funds for the co-educational vocational music school in Kabul that\u000a      opened under Dr Sarmast's direction in 2010 as the Afghanistan National\u000a      Institute of Music (ANIM). In 2011 Baily was sent by the Society for\u000a      Education Music and Psychology Research (SEMPRE) as their Special\u000a      Ambassador to Afghanistan, to visit ANIM and informally evaluate its\u000a      activities. While there he videoed material for a 30-minute documentary\u000a      film, Return of the Nightingales,[2]\u000a      subsequently edited in collaboration with Dr Evangelos Himonides, Senior\u000a      Lecturer in IT and Music Education at the Institute of Education,\u000a      University of London. This is now being shown in the UK and abroad to\u000a      raise awareness of ANIM's impressive work and to recruit Western interns\u000a      for the school.\u000a    Baily's research on the global circulation of Afghan music and the\u000a      scarcity of teaching materials has led to the development on an online\u000a      tutor for the national instrument, the rubab (a short-necked\u000a      lute), in collaboration with Dr Himonides. The Online Afghan Rubab\u000a        Tutor has become a major multi-media pedagogical resource for\u000a      Afghanistan, with a large collection of notated compositions as well as\u000a      audio and video recordings, and a role going far beyond teaching people to\u000a      play the instrument. ANIM's Director wrote: \"It is a wonderful idea to\u000a        have an online rubab tutor. It definitely would contribute to the\u000a        training of ANIM students and other rubab lovers from all over the\u000a        world\".[3] Baily and Doubleday have been invited\u000a      to teach and perform Afghan music at ANIM's 4th Winter Academy\u000a      in Kabul in January 2014, when the usefulness of the rubab tutor\u000a      can be assessed.\u000a    Directly related to the Online Afghan Rubab Tutor was a series of\u000a      workshops on rubab performance at the Asian Music Centre, Acton,\u000a      London (2010-11), and at The Music Room, an Afghan community centre in\u000a      Wembley (2012-13). In addition Baily and Doubleday contributed to events\u000a      surrounding the major British Museum Exhibition Afghanistan &#8212;\u000a        Crossroads of the Ancient World. At two Young Friends Events (9\u000a      April and 7 May 2011) a presentation of Afghan music and\u000a      dance with an Afghan family involved teaching large groups of Young\u000a      Friends and their parents to dance the attan, the national dance\u000a      of Afghanistan. Alice le Page at the Museum wrote:\u000a    \"I would also like to thank you and Veronica for delivering such\u000a        wonderful sessions. It's a real pleasure to have music filling the\u000a        Museum and even more so when the families are actively involved with it.\u000a        Many of the families commented on how much they enjoyed your workshop\u000a        and I hope you did too &#8212; despite the long evening!\" [4]\u000a    Recognising that military bands have the potential to engage beneficially\u000a      with local Afghan musicians, the Royal Military School of Music (Kneller\u000a      Hall) organised an Afghan Music Study Day on 3 May 2012. Under the\u000a      guidance of the AMU, a team of Afghan musicians and dancers worked with\u000a      four groups of bandsmen preparing for deployment to Afghanistan, all of\u000a      whom learned to dance the attan.\u000a    Performance and media impacts\u000a    Baily and Doubleday have been giving concerts of Afghan music for many\u000a      years. Their impact has been mainly on Afghan audiences. Baily's 2006 AHRC\u000a      grant involved organising a concert of Afghan music in Goldsmiths's Great\u000a      Hall (23 November 2006) in which Baily and Doubleday were key performers\u000a      and which attracted a large audience of Afghans. It was subsequently\u000a      broadcast in full by California-based Noor TV (22 October 2008) [4]. Baily\u000a      and Doubleday have appeared many times on the BBC Persian Service,\u000a      including the Studio 7 radio programme and the TV programme Tamasha.\u000a      Their concert in Sydney (22 March 2009) attracted a large Afghan audience,\u000a      and was published as a DVD and shown in Afghanistan, on Herat TV.[5]\u000a      Their most recent major concert was in Southbank's Purcell Room (21 April\u000a      2013).\u000a    In addition to their performance activities, Baily and Doubleday have\u000a      taken every opportunity to further knowledge and understanding of Afghan\u000a      traditional music among Afghan and wider communities. In London, they had\u000a      frequent contact with the BBC World Service Persian Service, supporting\u000a      its promotion of Afghan music among Afghan listeners; a very fruitful\u000a      resource was the popular weekly interactive live phone-in programme Studio\u000a        7. In Sydney in 2009 they took part in numerous television and radio\u000a      interviews. The respect in which Baily is held was signalled by an\u000a      invitation to speak at the inaugural National Folkloric Music Seminar and\u000a      Festival (Kabul, 23-24 October 2011), the only non-Afghan to be so\u000a      honoured.[6]\u000a    Public affirmation\u000a    Abdul Wahab Madadi, a renowned Afghan singer and writer, and the former\u000a      Head of Music of Afghan Radio and Television, spoke at Baily and\u000a      Doubleday's Now Ruz concert for the Afghan community in Hamburg\u000a      (14 March 2008).[7] He asserted that:\u000a    \"[their] contribution to awareness of Afghan music has been much\u000a        greater than anything the Afghanistan Ministry of Culture has done\u000a        towards [sic] our culture and heritage\".\u000a    The Noor TV broadcast of the (aforementioned) Goldsmiths concert ended\u000a      with viewers phoning in with their comments.[8] Viewers\u000a      thanked Noor TV for broadcasting \"one of the best music groups\",\u000a      who \"play the real Afghan music\". One viewer said:\u000a    \"I have known John Baily and Veronica Doubleday for a long time and\u000a        they are people who are in love with Afghan music, culture and heritage.\u000a        We must support them for keeping true Afghan music alive.\"\u000a    Baily and Doubleday's work has been praised at length in Nasruddin\u000a      Saljoqi's Persian translation and adaptation of Baily's CUP monograph Music\u000a        of Afghanistan: Professional musicians in the city of Herat (1988),\u000a      published in Kabul in 2010.[9]\u000a    On 10 November 2012 Baily and Doubleday were honoured by the Herati\u000a      community in London, when they gave a concert in The Music Room, an Afghan\u000a      venue in Wembley. Among speeches by Afghans praising their work was the\u000a      statement by Dr Hamid Simab, a retired psychiatrist and social activist\u000a      living in Canada:\u000a    \"Afghanistan for the last 35 years has been devastated in all aspects:\u000a        political, social, economic, spiritual. But nowhere is this devastation\u000a        more keenly felt than in the realm of artistic expression... all of us,\u000a        as Afghans who have inherited what remains of our cultural heritage, are\u000a        so deeply indebted to [Baily and Doubleday] for their lives' work...\u000a        from the bottom of my heart &#8212; as an Afghan who appreciates your work,\u000a        and I can say, on behalf of all Afghans &#8212; thank you for what you have\u000a        done for us, thank you for what you have done for the culture of our\u000a        country.\" [10]\u000a    In August 2011 Baily received an Illuminated Address from the Ministry of\u000a      Information and Culture office in Herat: \"Your valuable and tireless\u000a        service in the strengthening and growth of the Herat music abroad is\u000a        truly appreciated.\" [11]\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Since 2008, Baily has reached out to Afghanistan's shattered communities,\u000a      using music to recuperate their musical culture and rebuild their sense of\u000a      identity. Baily's work falls into three categories: education about Afghan\u000a      music, in and outside Afghan communities; preservation of Afghan musical\u000a      culture; and deploying musical practice to restore community identity and\u000a      dignity. His post-2008 work builds on his pioneering research and the\u000a      Afghanistan Music Unit, founded in 2002. His scholarship is rooted in\u000a      research, practice, networks, and decades of experience, giving him unique\u000a      insight into Afghanistan's music and its citizens at home and abroad.\u000a      Through his interactions with musicians, educators and policy-makers, as\u000a      well as his own public performances, films and educational work, his\u000a      research has had a major and direct influence in sustaining Afghan\u000a      culture, both in Afghanistan and in its worldwide diaspora in Pakistan,\u000a      Iran, Australia, Germany and the USA, as well as the UK.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    GOLDSMITHS, UNIVERSITY OF LONDON\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Goldsmiths' College","InstitutionName":"Goldsmiths' College","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"London","UKPRN":10002718}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"1140026","Name":"Herat city"},{"GeoNamesId":"2147714","Name":"Sydney"},{"GeoNamesId":"1138958","Name":"Kabul"},{"GeoNamesId":"2911298","Name":"Hamburg"}],"References":"\u000a    Evidence of the international quality of the research:\u000a      Items 3-4, and 7-8 are chapters of international significance in widely\u000a      disseminated books from major publishers.\u000a    \u000a1.

His\u000a      ethnomusicological research in Afghanistan began in 1973 and continued in\u000a      the near and wider diasporas. His wife Veronica Doubleday has played an\u000a      important role in the research from its inception in 1973 and has been\u000a      (intermittently) a Visiting Fellow at Goldsmiths since 2002. Drawing on\u000a      fieldwork initially in Afghanistan, and subsequently in the wider\u000a      diaspora, his research has engaged closely with Afghan musicians and their\u000a      cultural life around the world, with an active role in the revival of\u000a      Afghan music through performance and educational channels. This\u000a      interrelationship has resulted in an interlocking range of scholarly\u000a      outputs and impact outside academia, extending from monographs and\u000a      articles in leading international journals, to ethnographic films,\u000a      research-led concerts and recordings, consultancy and reports, as well as\u000a      direct educational interventions.\u000a    Baily's book `Can you stop the birds singing?' The censorship of\u000a        music in Afghanistan with accompanying CD (2001) has been highly\u000a      influential and republished several times.[1] In 2002 he\u000a      visited Kabul with funding from the British Academy, to evaluate the state\u000a      of musical life after the fall of the Taliban. He produced a report with\u000a      numerous recommendations and the associated documentary film A Kabul\u000a        Music Diary.[2] Musical life had revived quickly\u000a      with the return of musicians from exile, and popular music was\u000a      flourishing, but traditional art music was in a fragile state. As a first\u000a      step towards remedying this situation, Baily was appointed in 2003 as a\u000a      part-time consultant to the Aga Khan Music Initiative in Central Asia\u000a      (AKMICA), and he set up a Tradition Bearers Programme to support\u000a      traditional art music education in Kabul, described further below.\u000a    In 2006 Baily's research took on a new direction, following the receipt\u000a      of a grant from the AHRC Diasporas, Migration and Identities Programme to\u000a      research Afghan music in London and its relationship to the rest of the\u000a      transnational Afghan community. Fieldwork for this research in London,\u000a      Kabul, Hamburg and Dublin signalled a new focus for AMU on music in the\u000a      Afghan diaspora.

The\u000d\u000a      USPR fuses creative practice with music computing, audio technologies and\u000d\u000a      unorthodox field studies to explore interactions between the body,\u000d\u000a      ambisonics and wave field synthesis. In its mission to interrogate the\u000d\u000a      social impact of sonic environments, it combines the application of field\u000d\u000a      and studio-based artistic techniques with accredited methods of acoustic\u000d\u000a      measurement to investigate the auditory experiences both of audiences for\u000d\u000a      sound installation and creative performance and of de facto\u000d\u000a      `users' of products or activities which intrinsically entail exposure to\u000d\u000a      sound and noise.\u000d\u000a    The present case study, exemplifying this mission, derives from Drever's\u000d\u000a      investigation of the sonic properties and sensory\/affective consequences\u000d\u000a      of a ubiquitous societal experience: the noise made by the ultrafast hand\u000d\u000a      dryers which are now found in most public conveniences.

Whilst they represent an industrial engineering success story\u000d\u000a      which chimes with the contemporary sustainability agenda, the `sonic\u000d\u000a      footprint' of these machines and their effects on individuals who are\u000d\u000a      particularly sensitive to loud noise had not previously been investigated.\u000d\u000a    The study originated from Drever's participation in a national 9-week\u000d\u000a      project which brought together sound artists, acousticians, designers,\u000d\u000a      policy-makers and researchers to explore the relationship between sound\u000d\u000a      and built environment. Entitled \"Ways of Hearing: a Proto-Academy in\u000d\u000a        Listening, Sound and City Futures\", it was organised by Sound and\u000d\u000a      Music in cooperation with MAAP, MUSARC and Arup, and enabled individual\u000d\u000a      practitioners to develop new design approaches, processes and innovations.\u000d\u000a      In this context Drever connected with the architect Fred Manson, who had\u000d\u000a      recently designed state-of-the-art toilet facilities in Hong Kong, and\u000d\u000a      Hugh Huddy, a partially sighted sound artist then leading the development\u000d\u000a      of corporate policy on accessibility for the Royal National Institute for\u000d\u000a      the Blind. The resulting focus on hand dryer noise was of interest to\u000d\u000a      Drever and the USPR not only in its own right but because it served as a\u000d\u000a      methodological paradigm for understanding the impact of noise and\u000d\u000a      soundscapes at individual and societal levels, and for deploying the\u000d\u000a      findings to inform debate, public policy, and product design.\u000d\u000a    In essence, the study investigated the auditory characteristics and\u000d\u000a      effects of a selection of popular brands of hand dryer installed in public\u000d\u000a      washrooms. Given Drever's interest in whether certain subgroups of the\u000d\u000a      population find the noise particularly aversive, he sought advice from Anya Ustaszewski, a composer who\u000d\u000a      is herself on the autistic spectrum and works as a disability equality\u000d\u000a      trainer, and from Jo-Anne Bichard, a design anthropologist who has\u000d\u000a      expertise in ethnographic studies of public sanitation environments. He\u000d\u000a      also consulted with diverse professionals including acoustic engineers,\u000d\u000a      urban designers, architects, product designers, and environmental health\u000d\u000a      specialists. The resultant multi-dimensional methodology involved acoustic\u000d\u000a      testing at the BRE [Building Research Establishment] laboratories; in\u000d\u000a        situ environmental acoustics and noise assessment; field recording;\u000d\u000a      and a social survey.\u000d\u000a    He found that a single hand dryer, when located in a small public\u000d\u000a      washroom with highly reflective surfaces, created as much noise as the\u000d\u000a      aggregate effect of nineteen of the same machines in a free field\u000d\u000a      environment (as measured in the BRE anechoic chamber); furthermore, a high\u000d\u000a      proportion of the energy was compacted in the high-frequency range.[1][2]\u000d\u000a      The survey identified several subgroups for whom loud hand dryer noise led\u000d\u000a      to elevated anxiety, fear, and confusion: these included infants; the\u000d\u000a      elderly; partially sighted people; hearing aid users; and people with\u000d\u000a      dementia, cerebral palsy, M&#233;ni&#232;re's disease, phonophobia, hyperacusis, or\u000d\u000a      hyperacute hearing in the context of autism and Asperger's syndrome. Some\u000d\u000a      even reported having to avoid use of public or workplace toilet\u000d\u000a      facilities, exacerbating their social exclusion.[3]\u000d\u000a    Drever has complemented these empirical findings with practice-based\u000d\u000a      research exploring the subjective effects of hand dryer noise through two\u000d\u000a      sonic art works, both of which have attracted considerable public interest\u000d\u000a      and media attention (see section 4 for details):\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000asanitary tones: ayre #1 [Airblade] (60mins; 2012)[4]\u000d\u000a        The first &#233;tude in a suite of hand dryer sound energy studies, this\u000d\u000a        features a Dyson Airblade&#8482; which was recorded in BRE's large anechoic\u000d\u000a        chamber.

Bennett collects these\u000d\u000a      outcomes together for analysis; the fieldwork explores negotiated\u000d\u000a      creativity in collaborative contexts and manifests itself in his book\u000d\u000a      chapters and conference papers. In commercial terms, the fieldwork informs\u000d\u000a      Bennett, Moor and Parfitt's commercial work, whereby compositions are\u000d\u000a      created within known creative constraints using collaborative songwriting\u000d\u000a      techniques developed at the Songwriting Festival (and summarised in\u000d\u000a      Bennett's published research). Moor's work with Carl Bar&#226;t (of The\u000d\u000a      Libertines) on the latter's self-titled debut album featured several songs\u000d\u000a      that were co-written with Moor with the intention of them being performed\u000d\u000a      in Bar&#226;t's artistic (and literal) `voice'.\u000d\u000a    Public events\u000d\u000a      The UK Songwriting Festival (established in 2004 by Bath Spa University)\u000d\u000a      is an annual public workshop event, open to all songwriters, where\u000d\u000a      creative processes are explored, analysed and shared. It is organised by\u000d\u000a      Bath Spa University and has been hosted at the University itself\u000d\u000a      (2004-2010) and more recently in partnership with Scottish songwriting\u000d\u000a      organisation Burnsong (2012 and 2013), with funding support from the\u000d\u000a      University and from Creative Scotland. Media coverage of the event in 2009\u000d\u000a      had a reach of 422,028 and a value equivalent to advertising of &#163;8,849.47.\u000d\u000a      Bennett's theoretical work on creative constraint in songwriting underpins\u000d\u000a      the curriculum for taught sessions and workshop tasks; Moor, Parfitt and\u000d\u000a      many other professional songwriters contribute to the analysis and\u000d\u000a      workshop sessions, and host discussions relating to collaborative and\/or\u000d\u000a      constrained creativity in songwriting. Notable participant songwriters and\u000d\u000a      industry speakers include Richard Thompson, Eddi Reader, Chris Difford,\u000d\u000a      Boo Hewerdine, Iain Archer (Snow Patrol), Nigel Beaham-Powell (deputy\u000d\u000a      chair, PRS), and Midge Ure.\u000d\u000a    Confidential reports\u000d\u000a      Bennett's research into songwriters' working methods and his analyses of\u000d\u000a      originality thresholds in songwriting has resulted in frequent commissions\u000d\u000a      (2007-current) as a forensic musicologist by music industry clients (music\u000d\u000a      publishers, advertising agencies or individual songwriters).

The impact of this use of his research is evident in the fact\u000d\u000a      that Guantanamo Boy attracted audiences of which 70% were\u000d\u000a      estimated by the theatre to have been new. As such, it engaged\u000d\u000a        significant new audiences both with theatre generally and, more\u000d\u000a        specifically, with the complex socio-political topics raised through\u000d\u000a      the play's production, performance and review, including issues of\u000d\u000a      representation, cultural identity and diversity [a].\u000d\u000a    The play was purposely located within mainstream theatre with the\u000d\u000a      explicit aim of attracting new and diverse young audiences to the theatre\u000d\u000a      by actively contesting the lack of representation of `other' voices and\u000d\u000a      bodies on the British stage, as espoused by Arts Council England. In so\u000d\u000a      doing, it responded to pressing public policy relating to the current\u000d\u000a        lack of diversity and representation in the Arts, including that set\u000d\u000a      out in the 2008 McMasters Review (`Supporting excellence in the arts; from\u000d\u000a      measurement to judgement'), which states `we live in one of the most\u000d\u000a      diverse societies the world has ever seen, yet this is not reflected in\u000d\u000a      the culture we produce, or in who is producing it'. Furthermore, the\u000d\u000a      creation of a British Asian Muslim as the central character of Guantanamo\u000a        Boy was intended to redress the more specific lack of emotionally\u000d\u000a      challenging theatre work for a diverse teenage audience. As such, it\u000d\u000a      addressed the Arts Council England's 2010 goal for every child and young\u000d\u000a      person to have the opportunity `to experience the richness of the arts by\u000d\u000a      improving the delivery of arts opportunities for children and young people\u000d\u000a      and raising the standard of art being produced for, with and by children\u000d\u000a      and young people'.\u000d\u000a    The production was initially scheduled for fifteen performances, but high\u000d\u000a      demand from students from local FE college led to a further three\u000d\u000a      performances in 2012. The piece played, on average, to 92% capacity\u000d\u000a      houses, selling 1387 of a total 1469 tickets available across the duration\u000d\u000a      of its run between January 2012 and February 2012. This represented a very\u000d\u000a      significant achievement in relation to teenage audience development for\u000d\u000a      the Stratford Circus Arts Centre theatre. The majority of the audience\u000d\u000a      were from schools and colleges in Newham, and many were from minority\u000d\u000a      communities. The play also acted as a teaching and learning resource,\u000d\u000a      supporting pupils' attainment of curriculum criteria including those for\u000d\u000a      Key Stage 4 Citizenship (whose guidelines emphasise a need to understand\u000d\u000a      concepts of democracy and justice, rights and responsibilities, identities\u000d\u000a      and diversity through critical thinking and enquiry) and the English\u000d\u000a      syllabus (which requires students to critically analyse a production and\u000d\u000a      articulate this effectively) [a].\u000d\u000a    Eight workshops (total of 80 attendees) and seven post-show discussions\u000d\u000a      (total of 610 participants) delivered by Hingorani between January 2012\u000d\u000a      and March 2012 to accompany the production of Guantanamo Boy\u000d\u000a      further enhanced and extended its impacts on theatre participation among\u000d\u000a      young and culturally diverse audiences. Workshop participants ranged from\u000d\u000a      secondary school and FE students. The sessions were held in boroughs such\u000d\u000a      as Tower Hamlets and Stratford, which are among the most diverse boroughs\u000d\u000a      in the country; as a result, a high percentage of participants came from\u000d\u000a      minority community backgrounds. The sessions enabled students to engage\u000d\u000a      directly with the ethnically diverse professional cast and production team\u000d\u000a      of Guantanamo Boy, and encouraged them to remain open to taking\u000d\u000a      part themselves in future performing arts events [e].\u000d\u000a    The use of Hingorani's research to engage young and ethnically\u000d\u000a        diverse audiences with human rights issues through theatre promoting\u000d\u000a      the representation of minority voices is similarly evident in his\u000d\u000a      establishment in June 2011 of the Performing Human Rights\u000d\u000a      symposium, which featured a performance of the play and a post-show panel\u000d\u000a      discussion. Attended by 135 young people, this was the first of a series\u000d\u000a      of symposia organised in association with the Human Rights Lawyers\u000d\u000a      Association (HRLA), Amnesty International and Penguin Books to accompany\u000d\u000a      the production of Guantanamo Boy [b]. The event allowed its young\u000d\u000a      participants to discuss their views on the issues arising from Guantanamo\u000a        Boy concerning human rights and their representation. This,\u000d\u000a      according to an HRLA barrister involved with the Symposium, led to\u000d\u000a      `vigorous and eager interaction and engagemnet from the young\u000d\u000a      audience....I was approached by a number of them afterwards to ask\u000d\u000a      questions and a number...even wanted to apply for work experience in the\u000d\u000a      field of Human Rights' [c]. Running alongside the production and tour of Guantanamo\u000a        Boy, the symposia brought together representatives of young people's\u000d\u000a      schools groups, Penguin Spinebreakers, and Youth Amnesty to provide\u000d\u000a      opportunities for agency and engagement. A further Performing Human Rights\u000d\u000a      symposium, sponsored by Middle Temple Hall and Blackstone Chambers, will\u000d\u000a      be held at Middle Temple Hall, Inns of Court to launch the national tour\u000d\u000a      of Guantanamo Boy on November 17 2013. \u000d\u000a    Guantanamo Boy was reviewed and featured in several local and\u000d\u000a      national press outlets, including the British Theatre Guide, Time\u000a        Out, Metro, Sunday Times, Eastern Eye and Reuters\u000d\u000a      [d]. These ensured the contribution of the play itself (and of the\u000d\u000a      research underpinning its production) to media discourse both\u000d\u000a      about British Asian Theatre and about the political issues invoked by the\u000d\u000a      performance. The media coverage also helped to extend the reach of the\u000d\u000a      play's impacts by raising awareness within a wide new constituency of the\u000d\u000a      existence of theatre work for young audiences addressing the serious\u000d\u000a      issues raised in Guantanamo Boy and representing the often\u000d\u000a      marginalised perspectives of characters from the British Asian Muslim\u000d\u000a      community. The production tours nationally in November 2013, when it will\u000d\u000a      appear at the Half Moon Young People' Theatre, London; Hat Factory\u000d\u000a      Theatre, Luton; Middle Temple Hall, Inns of Court, London; Mercury\u000d\u000a      Theatre, Colchester; Burnley Arts Centre, The Drum Theatre, Birmingham;\u000d\u000a      Albany Empire, London. It aims to attract approximately 3,000 audience\u000d\u000a      over 32 performances, extending the reach of these benefits to audiences\u000d\u000a      across the UK.\u000d\u000a    Hingorani's experience as an actor, writer and theatre director, as well\u000d\u000a      as his expertise and insights resulting from his academic research, has\u000d\u000a      also allowed him to lead professional development for emerging theatre\u000d\u000a        artists from minority community backgrounds through his transfer to\u000d\u000a      them of expert skills and knowledge. Since 2008, his expertise in this\u000d\u000a      field has led to invitations from influential partners including the Royal\u000d\u000a      Court, the Tamasha Theatre Company [f] and the Old Vic programme to\u000d\u000a      develop and work with more than 120 emerging theatre practitioners from\u000d\u000a      minority communities. Many of those practitioners have since gone on to\u000d\u000a      create their own theatre work and have it produced.\u000d\u000a    Projects via which Hingorani has delivered this transfer of expert skills\u000d\u000a      and knowledge from academia to theatre practitioners have included:\u000d\u000a      directing rehearsed readings for the Royal Court's 2012 studio and writers\u000d\u000a      programme; contributions to the Tamasha Theatre Company Developing Artists\u000d\u000a      programme (2011) and Developing Artist commissions (2012); and leading\u000d\u000a      Director\/Designer workshops through Old Vic New Voices (OVNV), which aims\u000d\u000a      to nurture talent, develop new work and grow audiences at The Old Vic.\u000d\u000a      These projects shared a common commitment to the development of work by\u000d\u000a      artists from minority communities.\u000d\u000a    A recent conference organised by Hingorani and supported by PALATINE\u000d\u000a      (Performing Arts Learning and Teaching Innovation Network) facilitated the\u000d\u000a      further exchange of specialist knowledge between academic researchers from\u000d\u000a      a number of HEIs, including UEL and Rose Bruford College, and nationally\u000d\u000a      respected performing arts practitioners in theatre for young audiences,\u000d\u000a      such as Anna Ledger and Chris Elwell of Half Moon Young People's theatre.\u000d\u000a      Between February 2011 and July 2011 Hingorani provided expert\u000d\u000a        consultancy to the Theatre Royal, Stratford East based on his\u000d\u000a      expertise in critically framing and describing the theatre engagement with\u000d\u000a      minority communities. This involved his evaluation and dissemination of\u000d\u000a      the practice of a verbatim theatre production Mad Blud (2010),\u000d\u000a      which examined the issue of knife crime and based specifically within the\u000d\u000a      Black community within Newham. The consultation was funded by JP Morgan\u000d\u000a      (sponsors of the theatre production) and the document produced by\u000d\u000a      Hingorani was used to disseminate Theatre Royal's community theatre\u000d\u000a      practice to a wider audience as a model for community engagement and\u000d\u000a      action on social issues.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research undertaken at the University of East London has confronted the\u000d\u000a      historical lack of documentation, representation and participation in the\u000d\u000a      British theatre by ethnic minority communities, with particular reference\u000d\u000a      to the British Asian community.

His research since\u000d\u000a      2007 has focused on issues of representation, difference, marginalisation\u000d\u000a      and the construction of the nation, with published work particularly\u000d\u000a      addressing the emergence of Asian theatre in Britain since 1976. Herein,\u000d\u000a      he has documented, theorised and disseminated the diverse performance\u000d\u000a      praxis that constitute British Asian theatre, locating them within the\u000d\u000a      narrative of the British theatre, and historicizing and mapping the\u000d\u000a      performance practices and dramaturgies of key practitioners and theatre\u000d\u000a      companies. Research conducted and published by Hingorani since 2007 seeks\u000d\u000a      particularly to connect theatre work produced in Britain during the past\u000d\u000a      thirty years with the socio-political and critical contexts in which it\u000d\u000a      was developed [1, 2, 3].\u000d\u000a    Hingorani takes as his point of departure Naseem Khan's seminal 1976 Arts\u000d\u000a      Council report, which rejects the view of Asian theatre in Britain as an\u000d\u000a      `exotic extra' and argues that is should, instead, be understood, funded\u000d\u000a      and fostered as an integral part of British theatre. He addresses this\u000d\u000a      marginalisation through representation, research and documentation, his\u000d\u000a      2010 monograph [1] making visible the performance practice of Asian\u000d\u000a      theatre-makers over the past thirty years. As such, Hingorani's research\u000d\u000a      represents and contests not only the marginal position of Asian theatre in\u000d\u000a      Britain but also, by extension, that of other forms and constituencies\u000d\u000a      positioned on the margins of mainstream performance. His ongoing interest\u000d\u000a      in performance praxis, representation and new audiences is similarly\u000d\u000a      evidenced in his most recent publications [3].\u000d\u000a    Between 2010 and 2013 Hingorani wrote, directed and produced Guantanamo\u000a        Boy, a play adapted from the critically acclaimed novel for\u000d\u000a      teenagers by Anna Perera [4] as practice-as- research. The play was\u000d\u000a      commissioned by Stratford Circus Arts Centre and produced by Hingorani's\u000d\u000a      own company Brolly, a BME cross arts organisation. The commission was\u000d\u000a      awarded as a result of Hingorani's teaching and learning practice at UEL\u000d\u000a      (in particular his design and delivery of a module on Theatre For Young\u000d\u000a      Audiences for UEL undergraduates), his research in this area, and his\u000d\u000a      experience as a professional theatre maker.\u000d\u000a    The piece was shown at the Stratford Circus Arts Centre in 2012 and,\u000d\u000a      whilst it was originally programmed for 15 performances, popular demand\u000d\u000a      ensured that this was increased to 18. The work was specifically\u000d\u000a      formulated to attract a diverse teenage audience, in concord with the\u000d\u000a      focus in Hingorani's research on British Asian theatre on issues of\u000d\u000a      marginalisation and exclusion from the narrative of the nation. These\u000d\u000a      themes were drawn out in part by the fact that the play's lead character\u000d\u000a      is a northern British Asian Muslim boy.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42763","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1643084","Name":"Indonesia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1527747","Name":"Kyrgyzstan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1220409","Name":"Tajikistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research outlined above has contributed to international practices of\u000a      conflict prevention\u000a      through applied performance practice-as-research, and delivered cultural\u000a      and artistic benefits\u000a      through its creation, inspiration and support for these new forms of\u000a      artistic and social expression\u000a      [a]. It has also enhanced and improved public awareness and\u000a      understanding of conflict issues and\u000a      contributed to widening public access to and participation in political\u000a      processes, especially in\u000a      Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.\u000a    Cultural, artistic and social benefits in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan:\u000a      Through her integration of\u000a      local Kyrgyz cultural forms into applied performance practice-as-research\u000a      and her training of\u000a      Kyrgyz theatre artists, Breed has introduced applied performance as a new\u000a      form of artistic\u000a      expression in Kyrgyzstan. This has allowed local communities to connect\u000a      with their cultural and\u000a      artistic heritage through participatory practices that also negotiate\u000a      contemporary conflict issues.\u000a    As part of projects described above, Breed directly trained some 144\u000a      youth and adults; many\u000a      more were trained by consultants using Breed's curricula. Participants\u000a      went on to form 27\u000a      drama clubs in Kyrgyzstan, which have since engaged thousands of\u000a      additional beneficiaries\u000a      through public performances and training. As a result, Youth Theatre\u000a        for Peace (YTP)\u000a      beneficiaries in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan total more than 47,000 people,\u000a      who have engaged\u000a      directly or indirectly with Breed's work through drama clubs and public\u000a      performances [b].\u000a      Following her training of trainers and subsequent youth workshops for YTP\u000a      in 2009, Breed\u000a      facilitated a sustainability workshop in 2010 and 2012 for adult trainers\u000a      and young people who\u000a      had been promoted to the role of youth facilitators. As a direct result of\u000a      this training and of the\u000a      YTP programme more broadly, school drama clubs were established in\u000a      Kyrgyzstan and two\u000a      adult trainers were elected to paid positions with their village councils.\u000a      In those roles, `they\u000a      became prominent figures in their communities, raised issues and\u000a      challenges that they had in\u000a      their communities, and people voted for them because they could see that\u000a      they were actively\u000a      trying to solve these issues' [c].\u000a    Funding obtained in 2012 through USAID Kyrgyzstan was used in 2012-2013\u000a      to extend the YTP\u000a      project from the Chui and Batken oblasts to the Northern mountain oblasts\u000a      of Naryn and Talas,\u000a      where a further 60 trainers were instructed by Breed in participatory\u000a      practices and workshop\u000a      design. Her training of 10 former trainers as `master' trainers for new\u000a      participants has extended\u000a      the reach of Breed's distinctive methodology &#8212; and of the cultural and\u000a      artistic benefits arising\u000a      from it &#8212; throughout the country. The provision by the Kyrgyz Ministry of\u000a      Education of salaried\u000a      posts for teachers to continue theatre outreach work begun as part of YTP\u000a      has not only ensured\u000a      the sustainability of the benefits to programme participants in\u000a      Kyrgyzstan, but also delivered a\u000a      small but significant economic benefit via the creation of these new jobs.\u000a    A number of trainers and educators have initiated community projects\u000a      integrating Breed's\u000a      participatory performance methodology.Thus teachers trained by Breed have\u000a      used her\u000a      methodology to create sustainable networks and partnerships allowing\u000a      government and\u000a      community dialogue about, and responses to, conflict issues. One has\u000a      developed ongoing\u000a      participatory theatre performances in collaboration with the prosecutor's\u000a      office to address justice\u000a      issues, stage scenarios related to new laws, and address issues related to\u000a      building tolerance in\u000a      Tokmak [d]. Another has worked with the Kyzkol Village Council to\u000a      address issues related to\u000a      the social inclusion of orphans through theatre practices and has\u000a      successfully launched\u000a      campaigns through a conference of 250 social pedagogues (March 2013),\u000a      leading to financial\u000a      support for orphans and acknowledgement of legal agreements from local\u000a      authorities [d].The\u000a      methodology has also directly influenced Foundation Tolerance\u000a      International's (FTI) institutional\u000a      practices, informing the integration of participatory approaches into FTI\u000a      conflict analysis and\u000a      prevention projects covering six oblasts and all four FTI offices [c].\u000a    In addition to training described above as part of the IREX YTP project,\u000a      Breed trained an\u000a      additional 30 adult trainers and 30 youth trainers for the UNICEF\u000a      Interaction of Young People\u000a      (IYP) project, which involved 15 schools in the Osh and Jalalabad regions\u000a      of Kyrgyzstan. Drama\u000a      clubs subsequently developed from the initial training expanded to include\u000a      251 youth members,\u000a      and performances developed from theatre tours related to local conflict\u000a      issues have benefitted\u000a      an estimated 6,000 community members [e].\u000a    Raising public awareness of and changing attitudes to conflict:\u000a      The YTP project has had\u000a      demonstrable impacts on the adults and youths involved directly in it in\u000a      both Kyrgyzstan and\u000a      Tajikistan. An independent 2011 evaluation analysis of the YTP programme\u000a      in Kyrgyzstan\u000a      involved an overall sampling frame of 144 project participants and, more\u000a      widely, of 15,000\u000a      people in 93 communities. The evaluation showed marked and positive\u000a      attitudinal and\u000a      behavioural changes among both youth and adult program participants\u000a      towards people of other\u000a      ethnicities, religions and nationalities compared to a matched control\u000a      group. 12 focus group\u000a      discussions were conducted to assess the programme's effects on community\u000a      members (the\u000a      `audience' of the performances organised by participants), who weren't\u000a      involved directly in the\u000a      programme training events. The evaluation found that in Kyrgyzstan:\u000a    \u000a      Nearly 98% of program participants reported confidence in their\u000a        ability to positively\u000a        influence conflict situations in their community, compared with 31% of\u000a        the control.\u000a      Respondents in every focus group expressed their belief that the\u000a        programme methodology\u000a        could positively affect community cohesion in relation to conflict.\u000a      94% of youth participants reported a perceived increase in personal\u000a        agency in conflict\u000a        situations.\u000a      90% of youth participants reported a perception that they could speak\u000a        more openly and\u000a        in a more balanced way about conflict issues; 91% of those were assessed\u000a        by their local\u000a        adult mentors as being actually able to do so.\u000a      85% of youth participants reported increased empathy for `other'\u000a        groups (`empathy'\u000a        conceptualised as understanding the situation, feelings, motives, and\u000a        ideas of people of\u000a        other ethnicities, religions, or national origin.)\u000a      88% of youth participants reported more positive interactions with\u000a        those from other\u000a        ethnic or religious backgrounds [f].\u000a    \u000a    The benefits to programme participants of this enhanced awareness and\u000a      understanding of\u000a      conflict issues &#8212; and of the ensuing changes in attitude &#8212; are further\u000a      evidenced by some of the\u000a      successes they have enjoyed since the programme. Young participants have\u000a      become leaders\u000a      among their peers and in their schools, and to hold positions of\u000a      responsibility among, and\u000a      garner the respect of, adult community members. For example, in 2011 one\u000a      youth participant\u000a      became the first female in her school's history to hold the title of\u000a      school President [g].\u000a    Improving understanding of and increasing participation in political\u000a        processes: Breed's\u000a      work has contributed to widening public access to and participation in\u000a      political processes in both\u000a      Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, where the new drama clubs and theatre tours\u000a      have engaged (in total)\u000a      more than 53,000 community members between 2010 and 2013 through the\u000a      staging of conflict\u000a      issues in partnership with local government officials [b, e].\u000a      Several of the performances were\u000a      devised during youth workshops facilitated by Breed in collaboration with\u000a      local artists and\u000a      partner organisations. Applied performance is new to this region, and\u000a      individuals claimed that its\u000a      techniques provided the additional benefit of extending the ethos and\u000a      practice of participatory\u000a      approaches to the classroom environment. Performance topics included human\u000a      rights issues\u000a      concerning domestic violence, bride kidnapping, water and land disputes,\u000a      and girls' education.\u000a      The participatory techniques allowed audiences to actively engage with the\u000a      dialogic\u000a      performances and to express their thoughts and feelings on conflict and\u000a      suggest potential\u000a      solutions to the staged conflict scenarios. Those myriad proposed\u000a      solutions did, in fact, inform\u000a      policy-makers' discussion and debate both informally, through the theatre\u000a      performances\u000a      themselves, and formally, through meetings conducted with government\u000a      officials before and\u000a      after performances [b].\u000a    Impacts on education and training: Breed's participatory\u000a      performance workshops have\u000a      appeared in course syllabi for theatre and performance studies programmes\u000a      at the School of\u000a      Theatre and Dance UC Santa Barbara (USA) and Dartmouth College of Arts\u000a      (UK). Since 2010,\u000a      Breed has also provided consultancy to the British Museum (BM) to\u000a      facilitate its The Tree of Life\u000a        Talking Objects project (March-April 2009) and to train staff,\u000a      partners and museum personnel in\u000a      the use of participatory techniques to enrich user-based approaches to\u000a      objects (June 2011). The\u000a      Museum's dissemination of participatory approaches via its Talking\u000a        Objects project and peripheral\u000a      public engagement activities has enhanced public awareness of the utility\u000a      of such approaches.\u000a      These activities included the Museums and Participation: Unlocking the\u000a        Potential of Things\u000a      conference (20 March 2012), at which Breed facilitated an experiential\u000a      workshop with BM youth\u000a      panel members, demonstrating the Talking Objects methodology to\u000a      over 300 participants [h].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research at UEL has contributed to international practices of conflict\u000a      prevention through applied\u000a      performance practice-as-research.

Since joining UEL, Breed has worked both nationally and\u000a      internationally as an applied\u000a      performance practitioner and researcher, contributing to several important\u000a      projects exploring the\u000a      relationships between theatre\/performance, conflict and artistic exchange.\u000a      These have included\u000a      her role as an artist facilitator in the 2007-2008 intercultural theatre\u000a      project Contacting the World,\u000a      for which she developed exchange activities and intercultural practices\u000a      with youth theatre\u000a      companies in Palestine, India, Nepal, Turkey and Germany.\u000a    Her principal research focus, however, is the relationship of underlying\u000a      collective or `public\u000a      transcripts' and personal (or `hidden') transcripts to the socio-political\u000a      contexts of conflict. In\u000a      exploring this, she works with local communities to identify how cultural\u000a      forms can be adapted for\u000a      dialogic purposes and to stage possible solutions to conflict issues.\u000a      Breed's development and\u000a      application of these participatory methodologies to address conflict,\u000a      trauma and reconstruction\u000a      have been particularly informed by her work in post-genocide Rwanda. She\u000a      has adapted and\u000a      contextualised participatory practices including playback theatre, image\u000a      and forum theatre, conflict\u000a      resolution practices, and cultural forms to engage stakeholders through\u000a      theatre workshops with\u000a      grassroots associations, symposia with government officials and workshops\u000a      with theatre artists. In\u000a      line with the ethos and pedagogy of the IPAD, these approaches respond\u000a      particularly to the\u000a      national and international socio-political contexts surrounding\u000a      performances and performatives.\u000a    Breed's published research exists in a symbiotic relationship with her\u000a      practical work; whilst the\u000a      latter often forms the basis for the former, publications likewise inform\u000a      practice. Research\u000a      conducted between 2008 and 2010 exploring the use of the arts in\u000a      post-genocide Rwanda yielded\u000a      several notable publications [1-6]. Founded on interviews, workshops and\u000a      participatory projects\u000a      involving theatre companies and grassroots associations, this work has\u000a      particularly influenced\u000a      Breed's subsequent methodological application of participatory techniques\u000a      in Kyrgyzstan, which in\u000a      2010 experienced violence stemming from ethnic, religious and geographic\u000a      tensions. As in\u000a      Rwanda, ethnicity in Kyrgyzstan has historically been traced to social\u000a      status and access and these\u000a      issues are salient for conflict prevention strategies.\u000a    The impacts described below arise particularly from intercultural theatre\u000a      work and conflict\u000a      resolution practices developed through and applied in three related\u000a      project. The first of these,\u000a      Promoting Tolerance and Dialogue through Interactive Theatre\u000a      (Indonesia), began in 2008 as a\u000a      pilot project funded by the British Embassy and IREX Europe, an\u000a      international non-profit\u000a      development organisation. This developed into a second project\u000a      (2010-2014), Youth Theatre for\u000a        Peace (YTP) in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, funded by USAID. Both\u000a      projects were contracted\u000a      through IREX in collaboration with local partners including the Centre for\u000a      Civic Education Indonesia\u000a      (CCEI) and Kyrgyzstan's Foundation for Tolerance International (FTI). The\u000a      third project, Interaction\u000a        of Young People: across ethnic lines and public discourse on youth's\u000a        role in building peace and\u000a        strengthening tolerance (2012-2013), was contracted by UNICEF to\u000a      improve the interaction of\u000a      youth in the Osh and Jalalabad regions of Kyrgyzstan. Breed was the lead\u000a      facilitator, curriculum\u000a      designer and consultant for all three. In that role she oversaw the\u000a      facilitation and development of\u000a      training materials and curricula for youth camps, sustainability workshops\u000a      and the training of\u000a      trainers in participatory practices and workshop design, and provided\u000a      guidance and expert support\u000a      to identify target communities and to resource people. In total, the\u000a      projects involved four seven-day\u000a      `training of trainers' programmes, seven 12-week intensive youth camps,\u000a      and three seven-day\u000a      sustainability workshops involving more than 500 adults and young people.\u000a      Additional consultants\u000a      were hired to facilitate YTP work in Tajikistan using the curriculum\u000a      designed by Breed. For YTP,\u000a      which particularly contributed to Breed's development of the distinctive\u000a      and innovative participatory\u000a      methodologies outlined above, she worked in consultation with trainers and\u000a      artists to adapt local\u000a      games and performance traditions into applied practices. The traditional\u000a      cultural forms adapted as\u000a      part of this novel methodology included Kyrgyz folktales, manas\u000a      (oral history epics), music, games,\u000a      and theatre traditions. Partners included a professional theatre troupe,\u000a      Sakhna, from Bishkek\u000a      (Kyrgyzstan), 12 of whose actors supported Breed's delivery of the `training\u000a      of trainers' initiative\u000a      before going on themselves to lead youth workshops.\u000a    The research has contributed new knowledge about how embodied local\u000a      discourses may inform or\u000a      counter hegemonic or national constructions of post-conflict identity\u000a      formation. It responds to wider\u000a      international debates concerning participatory practices for conflict\u000a      prevention. Breed developed\u000a      this specific approach through her work considering the use of `speech\u000a      acts' in Rwanda for\u000a      incrimination in the participatory gacaca courts [3, 4, 6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42776","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"7909807","Name":"South Sudan"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The Republic of South Sudan (RSS) has some of the world's poorest\u000d\u000a      indicators for education, due\u000d\u000a      largely to decades of continual civil war. 1.3 million primary-age\u000d\u000a      children are out of school, and only\u000d\u000a      10% of women are literate. Poor access to education is exacerbated by\u000d\u000a      ongoing violence,\u000d\u000a      insecurity, decimated infrastructure, and displacement. Consequently,\u000d\u000a      there is a great need to\u000d\u000a      rebuild civil society, integral to which is the vast improvement of\u000d\u000a      literacy in this new nation.\u000d\u000a    A new Education Bill seeks both to improve literacy and protect the RSS'\u000d\u000a      63 native languages as a\u000d\u000a      means to retain and celebrate local cultures, stipulating that all pupils\u000d\u000a      be taught in their mother-tongue\u000d\u000a      until Year 4 (and thereafter in English) (1, below). However, two\u000d\u000a      fundamental problems\u000d\u000a      hinder these objectives: most RSS languages do not have established\u000d\u000a      orthographies, and hence\u000d\u000a      there are almost no published resources for literacy training in native\u000d\u000a      languages. The sets of CDs\u000d\u000a      and books produced by Impey and the team &#8212; Dance to the Drum of our\u000d\u000a        Home and Songs of the\u000d\u000a        Dinka of South Sudan, aimed at children and adults, respectively -\u000d\u000a      are thus ideally positioned to\u000d\u000a      offer the first non-religious published resources to support universal\u000d\u000a      literacy training in Dinka.\u000d\u000a    Reactions to the resources from those working in education in RSS have\u000d\u000a      been overwhelmingly\u000d\u000a      positive. Deng Yai, Undersecretary for Ministry of General Education and\u000d\u000a      Instruction, stated:\u000d\u000a    \"This resource is invaluable to us at this moment of education\u000d\u000a        development in South Sudan.

Your\u000d\u000a        materials will be valuable for use in\u000d\u000a        Early Child Development and Primary education. But what you are doing is\u000d\u000a        killing two birds with\u000d\u000a        one stone: apart from teaching Dinka children to read in their own\u000d\u000a        language, you are teaching them\u000d\u000a        a great deal about their own culture. This is a very good beginning.\"\u000d\u000a      (2)\u000d\u000a    The Dinka-speaking population of RSS is approximately 1.5 million, or\u000d\u000a      35.5% of the population.\u000d\u000a      The number who could benefit from the resources is therefore great. To\u000d\u000a      ensure their\u000d\u000a      dissemination, they were in early 2013 distributed to schools, churches\u000d\u000a      (who run literacy\u000d\u000a      programmes), community centres, government ministries, and foreign NGOs\u000d\u000a      promoting education.\u000d\u000a      500 copies of Dance to the Drum... were circulated to primary\u000d\u000a      schools supported by USAID in\u000d\u000a      Dinka-speaking states, for example.

The ability to assert a cultural identity is entwined with native\u000d\u000a      language literacy and\u000d\u000a      revitalisation, and is of particular significance to a population utterly\u000d\u000a      demeaned by protracted war,\u000d\u000a      and whose post-war insecurity and displacement still threaten native\u000d\u000a      traditions.\u000d\u000a    Lodoviko Lual, Parliamentarian and Chair of Dinka Language Development\u000d\u000a      Association (DILDA),\u000d\u000a      attests to the resources' cultural importance:\u000d\u000a    \"This is the first CD like this that is a document of Dinka history,\u000d\u000a        and particularly of the war.

The project\u000d\u000a      investigated the interplay\u000d\u000a      between traditional Dinka musical forms and the Dinka language, the\u000d\u000a      largest language group in\u000d\u000a      RSS and among the richest tonal languages in the world, yet lacking an\u000d\u000a      established orthography\u000d\u000a      and literature. Concomitantly, it examined how, in this overwhelmingly\u000d\u000a      oral culture, Dinka song has\u000d\u000a      responded to the intense disruptions and prolonged violence during decades\u000d\u000a      of civil war.\u000d\u000a    Dedicated linguists within the team produced an orthography for Dinka to\u000d\u000a      be applied in transcribing\u000d\u000a      and annotating popular children's and traditional songs.

Though an\u000a      accomplished musician supporting Ali Farka Tour&#233;, Toumani Diabat&#233; and\u000a      Youssou N'Dour,\u000a      Kouyate and his then more marginal Bamana style were relegated to the\u000a      background of the\u000a      thriving Malian music scene of the 1990s and 2000s. It was during the\u000a      making of the 1999 album\u000a      Kulanjan, intended in part to confirm the West African roots of the\u000a      Blues, that Duran realised that\u000a      there was actually far more musical common ground between Blues great Taj\u000a      Mahal and the\u000a      backing Bamana musician Kouyate than with the headline Maninka kora\u000a      player Toumani\u000a        Diabat&#233;.\u000a      In contrast to Maninka music, traditional Bamana jeli music is\u000a      largely pentatonic and slow in tempo\u000a      and &#8212; unlike the more popular west African kora &#8212; the ngoni\u000a      is capable of elaborate microtonal\u000a      variations on pitch, made possible by sliding and bending the strings on\u000a      the ngoni's neck in ways\u000a      echoed in the Blues.\u000a    This realisation inspired Duran to work directly with Kouyate to record\u000a      an experimental acoustic\u000a      album that showcased the distinctive features of traditional Bamana ngoni\u000a      music and explore\u000a      potential transatlantic links between Banama and the Blues. As producer,\u000a      Duran strongly\u000a      encouraged Kouyate to remain true to his familial jeli traditions.\u000a      The result was the 2007 album\u000a      Segu Blue featuring four ngonis. Kouyate has referred to Segu\u000a        Blue as a \"listening album,\"\u000a      intended to introduce people outside West Africa to the ngoni for\u000a      the first time.\u000a    Segu Blue's critical and popular reception surpassed all\u000a      expectation, as it quickly reached number\u000a      three in the World Music Charts Europe in 2007 and had accolades and\u000a      positive reviews hailing\u000a      the album's authenticity and purity from publications and outlets such as\u000a      Songlines (where it was\u000a      listed as one of the 10 best albums of the year), The Guardian,\u000a        Independent, iTunes and All About\u000a        Jazz amongst many others. In 2008 the album won two BBC Radio 3\u000a      Music Awards for Best\u000a      Album and Best African Artist (5) and the stage shows of the international\u000a      the tour that year (also\u000a      championed by Duran) were equally well received: The Guardian, for\u000a      example, gave Ngoni Ba's\u000a      performance at the Malian Festival au Desert of January 2008 a\u000a      review of 9.5\/10 stars. Sales\u000a      figures were and remain strong for a world music title, exceeding 30,000\u000a      to date (2). As of the 1\u000a      March 2013 the album was illegally downloadable from file sharing site\u000a      Pirate Bay. This is\u000a      significant because in World Music generally and African music in\u000a      particular the vast majority of\u000a      distribution happens through pirating\/illegal copying.\u000a    Through the course of touring in 2008-09, Kouyate and his fellow\u000a      musicians further developed the\u000a      songs of Segu Blue with more up tempo and dynamic arrangements. A\u000a      second album, I Speak\u000a        Fula of 2009 reflects these developments and includes the\u000a      contributions of special guests.\u000a    I Speak Fula too received fantastic popular and critical acclaim:\u000a      It reached number five in the\u000a      Billboard Music Chart in February 2010 (7) and was ranked tenth on the\u000a      World Music Charts\u000a      Europe for the year, having reached number five in March 2010. Together\u000a      with Segu Blue, the two\u000a      albums have more than 160,000 plays and 24,000 unique listeners on online\u000a      radio station Last FM\u000a      as of 1 March 2013. Despite fewer sales with c. 10,000 to date\u000a      (2), a raft of awards and accolades\u000a      followed the album's release culminating in a Grammy nomination for Best\u000a      Traditional World Music\u000a      Album of 2010 (8). I Speak Fula was also voted by The\u000a        Independent one of the Top Ten Best\u000a      World Music Albums, and Kouyate won in the Best Artist category at the\u000a      2010 Songlines Music\u000a      Awards. Reviewers applauded both the album and the stage shows with\u000a      positive reviews\u000a      appearing, for example, in The Los Angeles Times, New York\u000a        Times, Telegraph, Guardian,\u000a      Afropop, All About Jazz, Time Out New York and\u000a      American National Public Radio.

Since 1992, Dr Duran has\u000a      been Lecturer in African\u000a      Music at SOAS, where she completed her PhD in 1999. Since 2000 she\u000a      combined this role with\u000a      presenting the World Routes programme on Radio 3 (1, below).\u000a    Fundamentally, Duran's research examines how music encapsulates the core\u000a      values of southern\u000a      Malian identities and explores how traditional music and song participate\u000a      in communicating those\u000a      values. Duran considers her work as a producer in Mali to fall within the\u000a      rubric practice-based\u000a      research as such participation in the mediation of the creative process\u000a      can provide unique insights\u000a      into the aesthetics and dynamics of a musical culture. Much of Duran's\u000a      research since 2000 was\u000a      principally concerned with Maninka musical traditions and women singers.\u000a      Her related studio\u000a      production work, as exhibited in the albums Kassi Kasse and New\u000a        Ancient Strings, has sought to\u000a      reconcile the tensions between tradition and modernity in ways that\u000a      encourage musicians to\u000a      remain true to their traditions, whilst simultaneously enabling\u000a      contemporary interpretation.\u000a    In 2006, Duran shifted the focus of her enquiry to the little-researched\u000a      and under-exposed music of\u000a      the Bamana griots or jeliw of Mali's Middle Niger Valley. This was\u000a      a direct consequence of\u000a      research undertaken for \"Ngaraya: Women and Musical Mastery in Mali\": It\u000a      was through\u000a      understanding how Malians evaluate musical mastery that Duran recognised\u000a      that the musicians\u000a      who are most highly regarded from within the tradition are not those who\u000a      have pursued commercial\u000a      success. This led her to study Bamana music, regarded as one of the most\u000a      traditional styles of\u000a      Mande culture, and to work with Bassekou Kouyate, a respected Bamana griot\u000a      or jeli. The primary\u000a      instrument of the Bamana jeliw is the ngoni, dating from the 12th\u000a      century or earlier, and likely\u000a      ancestor of the banjo, though its connections with African American music\u000a      remain under-studied.\u000a    Research on Bamana musical traditions extant in 2006 focussed strictly on\u000a      the texts of Bamana\u000a      epics notable for their thematic emphases on warfare, slavery, honour and\u000a      betrayal. Duran's work\u000a      by contrast focussed on the distinctive sound and manner of playing the\u000a      ngoni and uncovered the\u000a      ritual significance of pieces such as \"Poyi,\" played by jeliw during the\u000a      era of the Bamana empire\u000a      (1712-1861) to war captives to persuade them to choose death in honour,\u000a      rather than slavery in\u000a      shame.\u000a    Duran is the first scholar to suggest that this combination of\u000a      distinctive Bamana musical features,\u000a      their sense of pathos and the historical context in which they were\u000a      mobilised provides a more\u000a      convincing source for the Blues of the southern United States than other\u000a      West African musical\u000a      traditions. To summarise, Duran's output as a music producer is the direct\u000a      result of her research on\u000a      core values in Mande culture. At the same time, her work in the studio\u000a      constitutes practice-based\u000a      research, providing new insights into Bamana music and, significantly, its\u000a      transatlantic\u000a      connections.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42957","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6290252","Name":"Serbia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3202326","Name":"Croatia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3190538","Name":"Slovenia"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    An A.R.T. user herself, Furse followed Your Infertility Companion\u000a      (`A useful and sensitively written reference on all aspects of human\u000a      fertility': Jane Coad, Anatomy and Physiology for Midwives (2nd\u000a      edn, Elsevier, 2005), 139) with creative outputs intended to counter media\u000a      sensationalism with enhanced public understanding of social\/scientific\u000a      issues.

Their productions performed to sell\u000a      out audiences at eleven regional theatres including the Theatre Royal Bath\u000a      and the Arcola Theatre, Hackney. According to the Guardian\u000a      reviewer: `In the hands of five young actors from Skelmersdale College,\u000a      Anna Furse's play The Peach Child was a living Manga cartoon.

As a result\u000a      of this, he was commissioned by the John Armitage Memorial Trust (a body\u000a      at the heart of commissioning contemporary music for student and school\u000a      groups) to compose a setting of English poetry, Now Sleeps the Crimson\u000a        Petal, for chorus. Following this, Mealor consciously\u000a      created the potential for impact by recording the work with the amateur\u000a      choir, Con anima, on Mealor: Stabat Mater (Campion, 2010).\u000a      Serendipitous impact occurred when an amateur, student choir was heard\u000a      singing it at St Andrews University by HRH The Duchess of Cambridge.

It was performed at the\u000a      Royal Wedding, broadcast around the world to an audience of two and a half\u000a      billion people and recorded on a number of commercial compact discs.\u000a    Numerous international performances then followed by school, community\u000a      and student choirs - especially in the UK and USA - creating an impact on\u000a      amateur music-making and in the domain of (usually) non-formal education\u000a      (in the case of school groups). It also had a cultural and spiritual\u000a      impact, enriching liturgy and impacting upon the process of worship for\u000a      performers and congregations; the piece entered the liturgy of Anglican\u000a      and Catholic churches and cathedrals, providing innovative music for\u000a      congregations at religious meetings and events.\u000a    Ubi caritas, unlike the other music at the Royal wedding ceremony,\u000a      had a global impact, and through managed impact by the composer, publisher\u000a      (Novello) and record company (Decca) created and sustained a spiritual,\u000a      cultural and educational impact as more religious, amateur and church\u000a      choirs subsequently purchased, performed and recorded the music. In turn\u000a      this led to further commissions for the composer, commercial recordings of\u000a      his music by professional choirs and orchestras and multiple broadcasts of\u000a      his work over the next two years creating a sustainable cultural,\u000a      spiritual and economic impact, which can be measured by sales figures from\u000a      the publisher Novello (over 50,000 copies of Ubi caritas) and\u000a      record company, Decca (over 1,000,000 CDs\/downloads).\u000a    The recordings have themselves impacted on the wider world of the media\u000a      and have entered our collective consciousness, with the music being used\u000a      in TV documentaries and programmes.

Like\u000a      his near contemporaries, Gabriel Jackson (b. 1962) and Tarik O'Regan (b.\u000a      1978), Mealor borrows from ancient and modern English choral\u000a      traditions, combining Tudor, baroque and twentieth-century techniques to\u000a      create a distinctive and individual voice. The sense of Britishness is\u000a      further revealed in his affinity for English, Welsh and Scots poetry and\u000a      his desire to communicate the emotional content of his chosen texts\u000a      through a specific lyrical sense of musical expression which could be\u000a      argued to have begun in the music of Kenneth Leighton and William Walton,\u000a      later developed by Michael Berkeley, Richard Rodney Bennett, James\u000a      MacMillan and Judith Weir.\u000a    Salient features of his developing compositional research and method\u000a      during the period 2008 to 2011 are the bringing together of fluent linear\u000a      part-writing within a contrapuntal texture (Locus Iste, Ave\u000a        Maria, Salvator mundi), textural manipulation (O vos\u000a        omnes, Crucifixus, Salvator Mundi), and structural symmetry\u000a      and balance, especially across and throughout large choral cycles (Now\u000a        Sleeps the Crimson Petal, Crucifixus and Praise).\u000a      Further preoccupations emerged in later works, and include now a\u000a      prevalence of modality combined with canonic imitation (...and\u000a        profoundest midnight...), set alongside metric shifts, extensive use\u000a      of tone clusters (Praise, The Farthest Shore) and the use of more\u000a      aggressive, driving repetitive rhythms (The Farthest Shore).\u000a    Mealor has combined this developing harmonic and rhythmic language\u000a      with a gradual, conscious `stripping away' of the dense, multi-layered\u000a      vocal part writing (or multiple-divisi textures) of his earlier works in\u000a      an attempt to create a more focused linear-driven, rather than\u000a      moment-driven, musical narrative and a freer, lighter choral texture which\u000a      allows for greater emphasis on the text. Works from 2003 onwards,\u000a      including the choral cycle on rose texts (Now Sleeps The Crimson Petal,\u000a      2010), exemplify this research, with the first and last movements of the\u000a      cycle in particular showing the importance of `line-driven' musical\u000a      narrative that is `lighter' in choral texture with fewer vocal parts and\u000a      clear in its text-setting, whilst retaining Mealor's stylistic\u000a      harmonic voice.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43378","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    74 Degrees North had an impact on the cultural practitioners who\u000d      brought it to life for the commissioning institution, Scottish Opera (see\u000d      supporting statements from Jeremy Huw Williams, Alex Reedijk and Michael\u000d      McCarthy). Through performances in three big Scottish cities it had a\u000d      wider impact on the general public, as reflected in the excellent reviews\u000d      in the national press (see press pack).

This included the\u000d      commissioning of four brand new operas as well as a keynote presentation\u000d      from Alex Reedijk, General Director of Scottish Opera, and an academic\u000d      symposium on the future of opera.

The text was a concise development of the central ideas presented\u000d      in Davidson's monograph The Idea of North. This text, conceived\u000d      within the research environment The North, one of University of\u000d      Aberdeen's four interdisciplinary research themes, demonstrated intensive\u000d      research across many cultures, languages and disciplines to produce a new\u000d      and positive definition of the \"north\", as well as making a contribution\u000d      to the contemporary movement of \"writing about place\".\u000d    The opera is set at 74 degrees north, at the burial place of the first\u000d      men to die on Sir John Franklin's catastrophic arctic expedition of the\u000d      1840s, the locus classicus of arctic disaster caused by arrogance\u000d      rather than adaptation to northern realities. Its underlying concern is\u000d      with relations to the climate and ecosystem of the north; its implicit\u000d      form is derived from the Noh play trope of `a visit to a celebrated\u000d      grave'.\u000d    Research undertaken was entirely collaborative. Davidson produced a\u000d      synopsis to which Stollery composed a short electroacoustic\u000d      sketch, which influenced Mealor's initial work on the score. Stollery\u000d      and Mealor subsequently worked together on the design of the rest\u000d      of the score, subverting the expected paradigms of electroacoustic =\u000d      negative, instrumental = positive. Neither of the two elements is\u000d      subservient to the other throughout the work.\u000d    Mealor's score develops his fascination with chamber orchestral\u000d      colours and the notion of waves brought about through harmonic and\u000d      rhythmic construction. The electroacoustic element is a constant of the\u000d      dramatic and musical narrative, not standing for the negative and\u000d      supernatural elements alone, but evoking and reflecting all aspects of the\u000d      arctic setting of the opera. The intention is to surround the audience and\u000d      stage with loudspeakers to create an immersive environment for both the\u000d      icy soundscapes and for the supernatural events in the second half of the\u000d      opera.\u000d    Mealor's operatic vocal writing here differs greatly from his\u000d      choral music. Extreme registers, large interval leaps with much use of\u000d      falsetto by baritone are not only responses to this dramatic text, but\u000d      also demonstrate an engagement with contemporary British opera exemplified\u000d      by recent works by Turnage, MacMillan and Weir.\u000d    Stollery has continued the research theme of collaboration with\u000d      instrumental\/vocal colleagues by providing the electroacoustic sound score\u000d      for Palmer's new choral and orchestral work Caedmon which\u000d      was also premiered in the 2012 sound festival.\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43385","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The project had impact upon four key groups:\u000a    Public participants\u000a    The most direct impact was created by the Music Walk performance\u000a      itself, which took place over a 1.5-hour period on 17 August 2012.

TFL has a Surface Planning\u000a      policy of incentivising non-vehicular travel, and recognised the potential\u000a      value of Music Walk's enrichment of travellers' experiences on\u000a      foot. TFL created bespoke mapping for the project, using its particular\u000a      mapping-design expertise to indicate composers and locations [C7].\u000a    Lilli Matson, Head of Delivery Planning at TFL, confirms the impact of\u000a      the project for TFL:\u000a    TFL's interest in the Music Walk project related to our\u000a      continuing policies designed to enrich the experience of London's urban\u000a      realm, and to our role in incentivising walking as a mode of travel... We\u000a      saw this project as an innovative way of extending our activities, with a\u000a      significant impact, not only at a crucial moment in the summer of 2012 for\u000a      London's surface network, but also as a potential model for supporting\u000a      cultural content across the capital in the future [C8].\u000a    TFL has committed to involvement in a further project based on the Music\u000a        Walk principles [C8].\u000a    Sound and music\u000a    Sound and Music (SAM) is the leading UK promoter of new music. The\u000a      project impact has led SAM to commission Hopkins to develop a large-scale\u000a      extension of Music Walk principles throughout London, and a\u000a      further project for an exportable model for other cities. Sound and Music\u000a      confirm the impact of Music Walk upon their commissioning policy:\u000a    The use of a widely available technology &#8212; offering the lowest possible\u000a      barrier to participation &#8212; the idea of location as an audio-visual muse\u000a      for composers &#8212; the carefully curated experiences offered to audiences\u000a      engaging in different ways: all these elements suggested a mode of work\u000a      which could help us extend our curatorial activity in a significant way\u000a      [C6].\u000a    Hopkins' work therefore contributes to efforts to bring new art music to\u000a      a wider audience and to enrich public space.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Music Walk project has brought contemporary art music to new\u000a      audiences and enriched the public's experience of public spaces.

As a NESTA Research Fellow between\u000a      2000 and 2005 Hopkins undertook in-depth research into the use of new\u000a      media platforms for performance. Hopkins also has expertise in\u000a      site-specific projects, e.g. Elephant and Castle (Aldeburgh\u000a      Festival, June 2007), a music theatre performance that took place in and\u000a      around the Snape Maltings, Aldeburgh, that effected dislocations between\u000a      an actual location (Snape) and a virtual location (Elephant and Castle,\u000a      London) through the use of sonic and visual media [see Section 3, R1].\u000a    Hopkins has been at Sussex since 2007. He held an AHRC Fellowship in the\u000a      Creative and Performing Arts between 12 June 2007 and 31 December 2012,\u000a      during which he undertook a series of projects specifically exploring the\u000a      potential of new media technologies for music theatre. Give me Your\u000a        Blessing (2009) deployed combinations of live performance and\u000a      digital media in a theatrical context, offering a deconstruction of\u000a      Stravinsky's Les Noces that incorporated virtual platforms such as\u000a      Second Life [R2]. The project is documented in the book Mapping\u000a        Intermediality in Performance (2010) [R3]. Lost Chord (2010)\u000a      investigated new technological interfaces between audiences and\u000a      performance events in a site-specific context [R4].\u000a    In 2009 Hopkins staged one act of Harrison Birtwistle's Masque of\u000a        Orpheus for the BBC Proms, exploring aspects of mobile performance\u000a      in a site-specific staging [R5]. The BBC Proms commission for Music\u000a        Walk followed from this, and from Hopkins' recognised research\u000a      expertise in the use of new media for site-specific performance.\u000a    Music Walk was developed by Hopkins for the BBC Proms between 2010\u000a      and 2012. Background research for the project concerned uses of `pervasive\u000a      media' tools and interfaces such as radio-frequency identification (RFID)\u000a      systems, QR Codes (portals to URLs or text) and GPS systems (locating\u000a      users of mobile devices). The creative use of such technologies\u000a      foregrounds issues of live performance and embodiment, the social effects\u000a      of digital portability, notions of public space as curated space, and\u000a      opening the digital realm outwards to the `real' world, with the potential\u000a      to augment our experience of that world. Twelve composers from a range of\u000a      musical backgrounds were commissioned to write ten short compositions\u000a      inspired by locations around the Albert Hall. The composers &#8212; including\u000a      the eminent American experimental composer Alvin Curran, the Scottish\u000a      composer Judith Weir, and the electronic music duo Sound Intermedia &#8212;\u000a      represented a wide variety of approaches to contemporary musical\u000a      composition. Their compositions were then made available online to be\u000a      heard on headphones via mobile technologies such as smartphones\/Mp3\u000a      players at the locations themselves, or downloaded and listened to\u000a      elsewhere. This placed headphone-wearing listeners at the centre of new\u000a      artistic experiences, triangulating perceptions of sites, sounds and\u000a      audience connection and action. Access was free via online sign-up in\u000a      advance or walk-up on the day. Sign-up enabled the orchestration of\u000a      participants into mobile clusters across timed routes. Each group was sent\u000a      instructions, playlists and performative tasks, designed to\u000a      heighten experiences at locations. Some locations were places of expected\u000a      distinction (e.g. Ai Weiwei's Serpentine Pavilion); others invited\u000a      visitors to perceive poetry in the mundane (e.g. bike parks). The\u000a      project's website offered online access to the music to approximately\u000a      6,000 additional visitors throughout the Proms season [R6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43494","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The contract to realise The Morning Line sound system was awarded\u000a      to York by Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary in 2008, following\u000a      competitive tender. Francesca von Habsburg's T-B A21 is an immensely\u000a      significant force in the commissioning of contemporary art, with a\u000a      particular commitment to long-term, major, international,\u000a      interdisciplinary projects that can be experienced by large numbers and\u000a      will `provoke and broaden the way viewers perceive and experience art'\u000a      (T-B A21 website). Perceptual research underpinned the York bid and\u000a      informed subsequent knowledge transfer in the areas of research outlined\u000a      above: this was the reason for York's success. The defining attributes of\u000a      the bid specification were: that the music should be spatially explorable\u000a      by listeners; that the audio presentation should support this robustly;\u000a      that the compositions should allow many spatial audio elements with\u000a      independent spatial controls. It should allow commissioned composers and\u000a      artists to create new spatial music with appropriate software tools to\u000a      make and reproduce their own spatial audio works. York researchers worked\u000a      with New York architects Aranda\/Lasch and Arup Advanced Geometry Unit to\u000a      develop loudspeaker arrays for the TML structure.\u000a    \u000a    \u000a    \u000a    To date, T-BA 21 has invested almost &#8364;2M in the construction,\u000a      installation and commissioning for this project. The TML sculpture\u000a      is 20m long and 10m high, weighs 20 tons, and the sound system has 47\u000a      channels and 53 waterproof speakers. The structure is modular, capable of\u000a      being radically reconfigured for alternative performance venues and\u000a      adaptable to a changing programme of contemporary music.\u000a    TML has been exhibited as an outdoor sculpture in public spaces\u000a      in: Seville, for a year (2009, including as part of Seville Biennial of\u000a      Contemporary Art); Istanbul, for six months (as part of the European\u000a      Capital of Culture 2010); Schwarzenbergplatz, Vienna, for six months\u000a      (2011, shown in the images above). It has also been exhibited at the T-B\u000a        A21 SoundSpace at the ZKM (Zentrum f&#252;r Kunst und Medientechnologie),\u000a      Karlsruhe, which from 2013 will house TML when it is not\u000a      travelling. Each outdoor exhibition was launched with a three to five day\u000a      music festival, and in Vienna T-B A21 hosted. The Morning Line\u000a        Symposium, a gathering of contemporary arts practitioners alongside\u000a      scientists, architects and engineers, using the project as the basis from\u000a      which to examine relationships between sound, architecture, contemporary\u000a      art and science. Given the locations of TML exhibitions, outdoors,\u000a      in central locations within major European tourist cities, in addition to\u000a      the open access and duration of the exhibitions, it is estimated that TML\u000a      and SoundSpace installations have been seen by between 1 and 2\u000a      million people.\u000a    \u000a    \u000a    \u000a    The impact of the research is technological, artistic and cultural. The\u000a      work is extremely significant for developers of audio technology (in\u000a      academia and commercially); for example, Myatt and Larkin were interviewed\u000a      about the project for the website of cycling74, the company behind the\u000a      most widely used graphical programming software for audio, visual media,\u000a      and physical computing (Max, MSP, Jitter, Gen).\u000a    The work has established a new form of artistic practice for academic and\u000a      artistic communities, situated within the broader, growing field of\u000a      spatialized sound and offering artists particular tools for exploring\u000a      relationships between sounds in different areas (rather than moving the\u000a      sound around one area that surrounds the listener). Since 2008 T-B A21\u000a      have commissioned thirty composers\/sound artists from 17 countries to\u000a      produce new works for the TML structure using these methods and\u000a      technologies. These include figures as diverse as: Russian-English\u000a      composer and inventor of the VCS3 synthesizer, Peter Zinovieff;\u000a      influential German guitar-and-laptop artist Christian Fennesz; veteran\u000a      Japanese experimental sound pioneer, Yasunao Tone; leading recorder of\u000a      wildlife and natural phenomena, Chris Watson; installation artist Florian\u000a      Hecker; experimental US rock guitarist and artist Lee Ranaldo (Sonic\u000a      Youth); and Norwegian environmental sound artist, curator and producer\u000a      Jana Winderen: this range is indicative of the broad application across\u000a      musical practices and genres. Many of those commissioned have acknowledged\u000a      considerable changes to their practices as a direct result of involvement\u000a      in the project. Zinovieff describes the experience as life-transforming\u000a      (email to Larkin, 06\/05\/13): he had removed himself from such work for\u000a      around 35 years, due to the gap between his aspirations and available\u000a      technologies, but the developments for TML turned this around: `Everything\u000a      I do now in my busy composing life derives from The Morning Line and ever\u000a      present spatial possibilities in the presentation of new electronic\u000a      pieces.' In addition to the installed works, the curators programmed live\u000a      events (often as part of the linked festivals), with real-time\u000a      performances from some of these composers plus invited live electronic\u000a      artists and DJs. All TML artists were supported by Myatt and\u000a      Larkin through on-site visits to TML and in workshops at MIAM (the\u000a      Centre for Advanced Studies in Music, University of Istanbul), at the\u000a      Akademie der Bildenden K&#252;nste, Vienna, and via video conferencing. This\u000a      support was related to spatial audio perception, its impact on\u000a      compositional methods and implementation techniques. Many composers\u000a      travelled to York studios for consultation and production support. The\u000a      final stage collaboration took place in-situ on TML, to mix,\u000a      adjust and test the works prior to exhibition.\u000a    This application of the York research has provided new opportunities for\u000a      public performance and new sonic experiences. While specific impacts upon\u000a      the large number of visitors cannot be proven, the experiential nature of\u000a      the work, with the technological developments rooted in understanding of\u000a      spatial audio perception, encourages active individual exploration. In\u000a      this respect the numerous amateur youtube videos posted online act as\u000a      indicators of engagement. The increasingly common experiencing of surround\u000a      sound in cinema formats serves as a comparator for audiences; walking\u000a      around TML, exploring perspectival relationships between areas of\u000a      sound, is a different aural experience, sophisticated and subjectively\u000a      determined.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The University of York's research in surround sound production, conducted\u000a      over twenty years, has in recent years been implemented and further\u000a      developed in The Morning Line, a huge, transportable sculpture by\u000a      Matthew Ritchie, produced by Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary (T-B\u000a      A21).

The work\u000a      described here differs in that it is concerned with spatial sound\u000a      reproduction and music content generation, both informed by human\u000a      spatial perception.\u000a    Ambisonics is a spatial audio encoding method developed by Michael\u000a      Gerzon, based on spherical harmonic modelling of three-dimensional\u000a      soundfields. This allows computer-generated sound to be heard uniformly in\u000a      3D spaces. Early analogue electronic experiments with 3D Ambisonic sound\u000a      reproduction conducted by the BBC led to significant and influential\u000a      research from the early 1990s at York by Dave Malham (Senior Technician,\u000a      Experimental Officer) and Richard Orton (Senior Lecturer, retired 1996),\u000a      with Tony Myatt (Lecturer, Senior Lecturer until 2012) joining the work in\u000a      1992. This research produced large-area Ambisonic loudspeaker arrays,\u000a      moving Ambisonics from a domestic technology to one suitable for public\u000a      presentations.\u000a    One of the factors affecting the progress of spatial composition was that\u000a      the sound reproduction system could not make allowances for different\u000a      sized spaces. Many spatial sound practitioners rely on the assumption that\u000a      if the ear is stimulated in a manner similar to that of a natural acoustic\u000a      soundfield, spatial audio perception will automatically result.\u000a    To examine this problem, Lennox (PhD 1995-2005), Vaughan (Associate\u000a      Researcher, 1996-2002) and Myatt conducted research into contemporary\u000a      theories of spatial perception, published in a series of articles (from\u000a      1999). This theoretical work integrated findings from psychology with\u000a      small-scale musical experiments to validate aspects of the theory. Early\u000a      research found that much spatial audio reproduction and spatial music was\u000a      impoverished to a point where it could not appeal adequately to human\u000a      spatial perception; surround systems predicated on a `sweet spot'\u000a      generally present the listener with less sonic information when they move.\u000a      The primary findings suggested that better understanding would occur\u000a      through the potential for listeners to move and actively explore a\u000a      soundfield. Contemporary models suggest that perceptual understanding is\u000a      equally informed by knowledge and predictions about a space as by auditory\u000a      stimulus at the ears. Methods were derived from York's Real-Time\u000a      Interactive Multiple Media (RIMM) project, led by Myatt, with European\u000a      Framework 5 funding 1999-2000 and partners including IRCAM (Institut de\u000a      Recherche et Coordination Acoustique\/Musique), Paris, who supplied and\u000a      modified jMax and Spatialisateur applications, and SIM-PK (Staatliches\u000a      Institut f&#252;r Musickforschung - Preu&#223;icher Kulturbesitz), Berlin, who\u000a      hosted and facilitated the construction for the main performance. These\u000a      were then combined with perceptual research findings to develop\u000a      composition and production techniques, first tested and demonstrated in\u000a      public by Myatt's composition untitled 3 at the Staatliche\u000a      Hochschule f&#252;r Gestaltung, Karlsruhe in 2007, staged to coincide with the\u000a      `Next Generation' conference on Music in Space at ZKM, 2007.\u000a    From 2008 this research continued as part of the T-B A21 project, The\u000a        Morning Line. Myatt led the team (all at York), working with Malham,\u000a      Peter Worth (PhD and Project Researcher, 2007-12) and Oliver Larkin\u000a      (Research Support Programmer from 2009). The TML audio system\u000a      consists of software authoring tools and the TML Audio Engine,\u000a      audio signal processing software that controls how sound is reproduced on\u000a      specific loudspeaker configurations. New audio representation formats were\u000a      developed based upon the creation of Spatial Audio Objects (SAOs). These\u000a      objects combine sound material and information about spatial behaviour. Up\u000a      to 100 simultaneous SAOs can be sequentially and\/or simultaneously\u000a      reproduced by a computer. Software tools to create and playback SAOs were\u000a      developed by the research team, along with software protocols for\u000a      algorithmic and live control of sound materials. This facilitated a\u000a      flexible, multi-area spatialization platform; a sound system with multiple\u000a      zones and surround cells that can be employed for a variety of artistic\u000a      approaches and physically explored by listeners.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43495","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Dr Potter's work has been a key influence in changing attitudes of both\u000a      professional performers and the listening public in respect of the\u000a      performance and reception of `early' music. As he points out in his\u000a      chapter `Beyond the Mainstream' in A History of Singing (2012), p.\u000a      231, `during the 1990s the concept of authenticity gave way to the idea of\u000a      performances being \"historically informed\".... and the looser ideology\u000a      made it easier for performers to be creative.' Potter himself was at the\u000a      forefront of this new approach, and epitomised the integration of\u000a      historical discovery and innovative performance. While his books and\u000a      articles brought his ideas to an academic and pedagogic audience\u000a      throughout the world, with Vocal Authority appearing on library\u000a      shelves and university reading lists in several countries, his recordings\u000a      and live performances with Red Byrd and The Hilliard Ensemble turned his\u000a      research into practice, and disseminated it to audiences both within and\u000a      far beyond academia.\u000a    Through his work with the Hilliard Ensemble he won the respect of Manfred\u000a      Eicher, the autocratic founder and director of ECM records, whose\u000a      reputation is second to none in the realm of Jazz recordings, and whose\u000a      `New' series began to forge connections with classical music, and in\u000a      particular with early music and experimental new music. Eicher's\u000a      recognition of Potter's imaginative ideas concerning the performance of\u000a      early music led him to propose the combination of early music and jazz\u000a      instrumentalists as an accompaniment for Dowland songs. The musicians\u000a      assembled had not played together before, and in the case of Stubbs and\u000a      Surman had not previously crossed the jazz\/classical divide. The Dowland\u000a      Project is in this sense both research and impact: the professional\u000a      producer (Eicher) and musicians (Stubbs, Surman, Guy and Homburger) were\u000a      led to an original forum for creative experiment through the research\u000a      ideas of Dr Potter.\u000a    The impact of the CDs is demonstrated by:\u000a    \u000a      Reviews in a variety of music publications, internationally, both\u000a        classical and jazz based.

Potter's series of interpretations of Dowland were an\u000a        important build up to the 450th anniversary of Dowland's\u000a        birth in 2013.\u000a      Potter's work had a direct influence on the composer Ambrose Field,\u000a        who created his large-scale composition Being Dufay around\u000a        fragments of chansons by Dufay (1397-1474) sung by John Potter. Although\u000a        Potter sings the vocal fragments, the piece was not a collaborative\u000a        composition. It appeared in 2009 as a single artist CD by Ambrose Field\u000a        on the ECM label. Subsequently, the piece has been toured, with\u000a        projected images by the artist Mick Lynch, and performed at major music\u000a        festivals. In the live event, John Potter contributes vocal\u000a        improvisation on the Dufay fragments, in the manner of the Dowland\u000a        Project improvisations. The composition (CD) and live performances are\u000a        claimed as demonstrating further impact arising from the Dowland\u000a        Project.

Throughout that time his\u000a      research centred on the examination and re-assessment of performance\u000a      practice in vocal music, seen both as historical phenomenon and\u000a      contemporary challenge. His 1998 book Vocal Authority (CUP 1998;\u000a      repr. 2006) probes the ideological bases underlying orthodoxies in both\u000a      classical and popular music singing, a theme which informs his later\u000a      writing on the specific subjects of portamento (a technique of gliding\u000a      between notes, much used well into the last century, but abandoned in\u000a      modern classical performance) and on the history of the tenor voice.\u000a      (`Beggar at the Door: the rise and fall of portamento in singing',\u000a        Music &amp; Letters, 87\/4 (2006); Tenor: History of a Voice\u000a      (Yale University Press, 2009).\u000a    Importantly, Dr Potter's significant contribution to scholarship in this\u000a      area was complemented by an equally rigorous and arguably even more\u000a      influential programme of practice-based research, through a continuous\u000a      series of innovative performance projects, both as singer\/director and as\u000a      record producer.

With the internationally famous Hilliard\u000a        Ensemble he was also instrumental in the discovery and recovery of\u000a      early music, and notably their recordings of Medieval and Renaissance\u000a      polyphony accompanied by the jazz saxophonist Jan Garbarek (1994 Officium)\u000a      which became an international best seller, receiving five gold discs. He\u000a      mentored the group Trio Mediaeval, and produced their five ECM\u000a      albums, with which the group have won awards and toured across Europe and\u000a      the USA.\u000a    Potter's rejection of the concept of authentic performing style, and his\u000a      arguments for the creative input of the performer even within the\u000a      performance of the accepted canon of `classical' music, led him in 2000 to\u000a      devise, with Manfred Eicher of ECM, a practical laboratory in which the\u000a      music of John Dowland (1563-1626) could be explored in just such an\u000a      iconoclastic way. Bringing together highly regarded baroque music\u000a      specialists Stephen Stubbs and Maya Homburger, and senior jazz improvisers\u000a      John Surman and Barry Guy, Dowland's songs became the raw material for\u000a      tracks which, to varying degrees, re-invented the music and presented it\u000a      in a new, contemporary, guise. The success of the album In Darkness\u000a        Let Me Dwell, both commercially and in purely artistic terms, led to\u000a      a further collaboration, Care Charming Sleep, in which the same\u000a      ensemble of musicians (The Dowland Project) explored music by other early\u000a      baroque composers (Monteverdi, Purcell, Johnson and others).\u000a    In 2008 Potter directed a third album, Romaria, in which the\u000a      project explored repertoire ranging from Gregorian chant and the 13th\u000a      century Carmina Burana manuscript to Josquin Desprez and Portuguese\u000a      traditional song, and also took further the degree of performer\u000a      intervention, giving the musicians only the vocal melody as material on\u000a      which to base their improvisations. This third project, while it moves the\u000a      classical singer into territory as far removed from the idea of historical\u000a      authenticity as could be imagined, is in many ways the logical outcome of\u000a      an extended engagement with historical data on the one hand (represented\u000a      by the meticulous scholarship of Potter's books and articles), and the\u000a      ground-breaking practical exploration of early music, at the highest\u000a      professional level, over the same period.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43496","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1168579","Name":"Pakistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"3723988","Name":"Haiti"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    References to corroborating sources are listed as `[1]'.\u000a    The series was broadcast on Al Jazeera's International Network which has\u000a      one of the largest\u000a      footprints in satellite broadcasting reaching over 100 countries with an\u000a      estimated audience of\u000a      between 40 and 50 million viewers.\u000a    The series was commissioned with the express intention of informing\u000a      public debate on slavery and\u000a      trafficking, and addressing questions and information directly to\u000a      policy-makers and activists in the\u000a      field.

Early\u000a      anti-slavery legislation in the 1800s focused on the trade itself, and\u000a      tended to prohibit the forced\u000a      movement of people across international borders. Anti-slavery protocols\u000a      today do much the same\u000a      thing &#8212; the word `slavery' has largely been replaced in government and\u000a      agency policy statements\u000a      on the subject by `trafficking'.\u000a    The three films, effectively investigative participant\/observer field\u000a      research, explore and present the\u000a      experiences and testimonies of people who do not meet modern legal\u000a      definitions of `trafficked\u000a      peoples'. Beginning with the common definition of slavery as the enforced\u000a      ownership of one person\u000a      by another, the research set out to widen this definition to cover\u000a      specific and complex cultural\u000a      mechanisms that draw people into forms of unfree labour and subsequently\u000a      trap them. The\u000a      research also sought to problematise the international regulatory emphasis\u000a      on trafficking by\u000a      arguing that some of the most persistent and widespread forms of slavery\u000a      do not involve trafficked\u000a      people and that there is evidence that these people have to some extent\u000a      been rendered invisible to\u000a      key authorities such as the US State Department, the International Labour\u000a      Organisation and other\u000a      branches of the UN.\u000a    Haiti investigated stories from current and past child slaves, or\u000a      `restaveks' &#8212; a system claimed as a\u000a      means of educating poor children from rural districts who would leave\u000a      their families for a period to\u000a      provide domestic labour for wealthier urban families in return for free\u000a      education. The restavek\u000a      system is outlawed in Haiti and does not officially exist. This research\u000a      not only confirmed that child\u000a      slaves are still drawn from the rural hinterland, but also discovered they\u000a      are streaming, not into\u000a      middle class homes, but into the post-earthquake slums and tent cities of\u000a      Port au Prince. They\u000a      receive no education and no pay, and many experience lives of routine\u000a      violence and abuse.\u000a      Pakistan examined the case of bonded labourers in the brick kiln\u000a      factories of rural Punjab. Bonded\u000a      labourers are enslaved by debts incurred partly by cultural imperatives\u000a      such as marriage dowries,\u000a      and are trapped by unfair and often unwritten contracts in which interest\u000a      on their debts accrue\u000a      faster than they can work to pay off their debt. The research here also\u000a      revealed new evidence of\u000a      other forms of exploitation `piggy-backing' on bonded slavery, including\u000a      organ trafficking. India\u000a      researched the experiences of women who had been trafficked to Haryana\u000a      state from other parts\u000a      of India, where they have experienced violence, rape and forced marriage.\u000a      The phenomenon of\u000a      bride trafficking is not recognised by the Indian government and thus the\u000a      research contributes to\u000a      exposing the practice.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43497","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Romeo &amp; Juliet in Performance.

Cordner staged\u000d\u000a      and directed colleague Tom Cantrell in scenes of the play, which were\u000d\u000a      filmed by other departmental colleagues, with additional commentary and\u000d\u000a      insight was provided via an interview with Cantrell. The project has\u000d\u000a      facilitated both a new engagement with Shakespeare and the potential to\u000d\u000a      explore the relationship between Theatre and Film in a teaching resource\u000d\u000a      produced for secondary schools. Romeo &amp; Juliet in Performance\u000d\u000a      was piloted by Film Education at their annual teaching conference in 2012\u000d\u000a      and since then 4400 DVDs have been distributed to schools via direct mail\u000d\u000a      or through the National Association of English Teachers. The DVDs are\u000d\u000a      supplied with a mechanism allowing Film Education to track when a school\u000d\u000a      first registers the DVD online. As research suggests that only a third of\u000d\u000a      teachers use the DVD on a web-connected PC, the 571 users registered by 31st\u000d\u000a      May 2013 may actually reflect a total of over 1700 users, a figure that\u000d\u000a      may be increased further if we account for schools registering a single\u000d\u000a      disc for use by multiple teachers. On average each registered user used\u000d\u000a      the disc for three one hour lessons. The resource was nominated for a\u000d\u000a      BAFTA in the `Children's, Learning &#8212; Secondary', category.\u000d\u000a    Jacobean City Comedy. This project has led to the editing,\u000d\u000a      adaptation, staging and production by Cordner of two Jacobean\u000d\u000a      masterpieces, A Mad World My Masters in June 2011 and The\u000d\u000a        Dutch Courtesan in June 2013. These productions have been supported\u000d\u000a      by major funding from the Shepherd Trust. The cast and crew of both, as\u000d\u000a      well as the website team for the second, were drawn from the staff and\u000d\u000a      students of the Department of Theatre, Film and Television. The live\u000d\u000a      performances have a significant local as well as a national reach.\u000d\u000a      Approximately 500 tickets were sold for A Mad World and 340 for The\u000d\u000a        Dutch Courtesan. There is an additional educational engagement and\u000d\u000a      outreach dimension for the latter production &#8212; a public pre-show talk with\u000d\u000a      Guardian theatre critic Michael Billington demonstrated the play's place\u000d\u000a      in modern theatre practices and discussed the place of the Jacobean\u000d\u000a      repertory on the modern stage, while freelance director and TFTV comedy\u000d\u000a      outreach officer Tom Wright conducted three practical workshops on\u000d\u000a      Jacobean trickster comedy for schools and the general public.\u000d\u000a    The production is accompanied by a specially designed website,\u000d\u000a      www.dutchcourtesan.co.uk, which will benefit both school and university\u000d\u000a      students as well as a wider, non-university public (including theatre\u000d\u000a      practitioners and companies interested in translating plays from this\u000d\u000a      repertoire into performance).The website:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      tracks the production stage-by-stage from early research to the\u000d\u000a        performances, offering insight into the rehearsal and research\u000d\u000a        processes, and demonstrating ways in which students can unlock the\u000d\u000a        performance potential of demanding, early modern scripts.\u000d\u000a      hosts and promotes new debate between an international team of\u000d\u000a        scholars about the play and the worlds out of which it was generated.\u000d\u000a      tracks past explorations of the early modern repertory at York.

In addition to being the General Editor of\u000d\u000a      OUP's Oxford English Drama series, Cordner has produced editions of\u000d\u000a      fourteen seventeenth and eighteenth century comedies across several\u000d\u000a      series, is the co-editor of collections of essays on English comedy (1994)\u000d\u000a      and performance traditions in the long eighteenth century (2007), and has\u000d\u000a      researched and published extensively on the relationship between editorial\u000d\u000a      and performance traditions, with particular reference to Shakespeare, in\u000d\u000a      top journals and presses. Cordner's creative practice is informed by his\u000d\u000a      scholarship which underpins the process of adaptation (2013) and direction\u000d\u000a      of new productions of plays from the early modern repertoire such as A\u000d\u000a        Mad World... and The Dutch Courtesan. This research as\u000d\u000a      practice in turn facilitates new scholarly insights and understandings and\u000d\u000a      poses new questions for further research. Another key strand of this\u000d\u000a      research programme, closely related to the Jacobean project, is work on\u000d\u000a      how actors have been trained in conservatoires and rehearsal rooms to\u000d\u000a      tackle early modern texts. A first fruit of this &#8212; a long article on\u000d\u000a      \"(Mis)advising Shakespeare's Actors\" &#8212; appears in the 2013 volume of Shakespeare\u000a        Survey; while an article on the Cambridge academic, director and\u000d\u000a      theatrical legislator George Rylands will appear next year in a CUP\u000d\u000a      collection, Shakespeare and the Universities. The core impetus\u000d\u000a      behind this research project is an ambition to link ambitious historical\u000d\u000a      understanding of Jacobean scripts and detailed, scholarly analysis of\u000d\u000a      their textual properties with performance exploration of their stage\u000d\u000a      potential through to full performance, in ways which can open up those\u000d\u000a      processes to as wide an audience as possible, and prompt discussion in a\u000d\u000a      wider sphere about the nature of the challenges, demands and opportunities\u000d\u000a      which this repertoire presents to modern interpreters and performers.\u000d\u000a    The insight into and understanding of A Mad World, My Masters\u000d\u000a      which emerged from the 2011 explorations is radically different from the\u000d\u000a      received view of the play and an article by Cordner exploring this was\u000d\u000a      published in spring 2013 in Shakespeare Bulletin. In addition to a\u000d\u000a      Revels edition of the play which Cordner is co-editing, The Dutch\u000d\u000a        Courtesan research provides the basis for a specially-designed\u000d\u000a      website which showcases the integrative elements of historical scholarship\u000d\u000a      and creative practice. This website includes a stage-by-stage tracking of\u000d\u000a      the production (from early research to the performances in June) and the\u000d\u000a      hosting of a debate between an international team of scholars about the\u000d\u000a      play and the worlds out of which it was generated. Scholarship which\u000d\u000a      seriously engages with the kind of performance detail on which these\u000d\u000a      projects hinge is very scarce, outside the Shakespearean repertoire. This\u000d\u000a      York initiative aims to address that lack via an innovative combination of\u000d\u000a      methods.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43781","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Odell-Miller's findings and research outputs in the field of live music\u000a      interaction with older people with dementia resulted in:\u000a    a) Direct implementation, from 2008, of Odell-Miller's music therapy\u000a      method in MHA, by ARU graduate Hsu's research collaboration, reaching\u000a      1,500-clients across 40 care homes in Britain. Hsu was invited to present\u000a      the joint research at the MHA manager's conference and, as a result, was\u000a      employed in the first, full-time music therapy post in the MHA. Hsu\u000a      deployed a model of music therapy based on the music therapist's PGDip\u000a      training at Anglia Ruskin University and Odell-Miller's research in\u000a      dementia care (Odell-Miller, 1995).

Now the charity has commissioned\u000a      independent research, assisted by Professor Helen Odell-Miller of Anglia\u000a      Ruskin University, to test the hypothesis that Music Therapy can improve\u000a      quality of life for people with dementia. Helen Nairn, a manager in MHA\u000a      further commented, \"We have seen some astonishing changes in our care\u000a      homes when people with dementia receive Music Therapy &#8212; they become so\u000a      much more responsive and joyful, and it seems to have a wonderful calming\u000a      effect on people who experience anxiety, as a lot of people with dementia\u000a      do'.

Laing and Buisson, UK's leading healthcare intelligence provider\u000a      cited the establishing of music therapy in the homes as one of the main\u000a      reasons for the award (5d). Impact on their policy and practice is further\u000a      demonstrated by the commissioning of a dementia research project by MHA\u000a      and ARU, between 2010 and 2012. Later, in 2013, MHA funded a research\u000a      assistant for &#163;25,000, held by ARU graduate Roz Pendrey, investigating the\u000a      impact of music therapy upon carers and those with dementia in reducing\u000a      Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD). Three MHA care\u000a      homes have now embarked on the five-month cluster randomised controlled\u000a      trial investigating the impact of music therapy on caring for people with\u000a      dementia, who have behavioural symptoms. The clinical trial is a joint\u000a      research project and a PhD study supervised by Odell-Miller. MHA funded\u000a      Hsu to do the PhD.\u000a    The impact of the research and its on-going value to older people is\u000a      demonstrated through international invitations to speak about the work.\u000a      The Norwegian government, in collaboration with The University of Bergen,\u000a      invited Odell-Miller and Hsu to advise on similar community-based care\u000a      homes and music therapy in November 2012, which will lead to further\u000a      international partnerships in the future. The impact is best summed up in\u000a      an article published on the MHA website, effectively demonstrating the\u000a      embedding of the music therapy service at MHA, not only in the music\u000a      therapy activities, but throughout the whole organisation:\u000a    `MHA's Dementia Care Home in Birmingham, have celebrated not only the\u000a      Home's recent refurbishment but also the impact music therapy has made on\u000a      all their lives by renaming its four wings: Symphony, Harmony, Melody and\u000a      Rhapsody.

This research (1995), the first systematic outcome\u000a      study in music therapy and dementia in the UK, investigated the use of\u000a      live interactive music therapy techniques, which were used for the first\u000a      time with people with dementia. Previous research had only advocated the\u000a      use of structured improvisation or composed music in these instances\u000a      (e.g., Bright's work (1972)). Where cognitive faculties are declining,\u000a      Odell-Miller's work showed that older people with dementia were more\u000a      engaged through music making than when undergoing reminiscence therapy, a\u000a      talking-based therapy. Outcomes from systematically measuring engagement\u000a      for eleven people over two sixteen-week periods, whilst having music\u000a      therapy and reminiscence therapy, and using observational methods of time\u000a      sampling, suggested that mean levels of engagement were higher during\u000a      music therapy than in reminiscence therapy. `Engagement' was measured in\u000a      six categories, including `eye direction', `use of musical instruments'\u000a      (in music therapy), `use of objects' (in reminiscence therapy), and\u000a      `smiling'.\u000a    Odell-Miller subsequently undertook a multi-disciplinary research case\u000a      study in an NHS community setting in collaboration with Professor Hodges\u000a      and the Cambridge University Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit. Through\u000a      single case study narrative research with a musician with dementia,\u000a      Odell-Miller (2002) showed the importance of a psychoanalytical\u000a      understanding of the work, using concepts, originally developed by\u000a      Odell-Miller, such as musical countertransference (2001). This enabled an\u000a      understanding of the patient's mind and actions during the music making\u000a      through the musical process. Further developing this relationship,\u000a      Odell-Miller discovered that rich communication could take place through\u000a      joint music making, when words are no longer available. In this single\u000a      case study medical staff and the patient's wife reported that the patient\u000a      was brighter and more relaxed following music therapy sessions at home.\u000a      Odell-Miller's sustained research, through clinical projects, family work,\u000a      case examples and research from subsequent collaborations, including\u000a      implementing the protocol in the training of music therapists, has\u000a      successfully demonstrated that this method is an effective way of\u000a      communicating for older people with dementia.\u000a    More recent joint research with MHA (Hsu and Odell-Miller 2012) carried\u000a      out a new clinical evaluation exploring the correlation between the\u000a      therapist's bodily expressions and the client's participation. This used\u000a      two evaluation tools, Dementia Care Mapping and Music Therapy\u000a        Microanalysis. Both involve quantitative documentation and data\u000a      analysis and, with results indicating promoted levels of the client's\u000a      well-being and a strong correlation between the therapist's spontaneous\u000a      movements and the client's communicative responses, resulted in increased\u000a      levels of participation. Consequently, the importance of incorporating\u000a      movements as part of the therapist's musical expression has been\u000a      identified and developed. Odell-Miller was collaborator for these research\u000a      projects, commissioned by the MHA and supported by the Lottery Fund. The\u000a      newly identified presentation techniques of the music therapist serve as a\u000a      strategy resource to enhance the client's participation in the day-to-day\u000a      practise of music therapy.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43782","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Music for Health Research Centre has made an impact upon the local,\u000a      national and international understanding, recognition of and\u000a      implementation of music therapy as an effective treatment tool. For\u000a      example, Wigram was a leading contributor to the first Cochrane Review for\u000a      schizophrenia (Gold et al, 2005), which led to the inclusion of music\u000a      therapy in the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE)\u000a      guidelines; Wigram Oldfield and Odell-Miller have demonstrated the success\u000a      of music therapy in relation to autism; and Odell-Miller is a member of\u000a      national advisory boards, influencing public knowledge, and policy-making.\u000a      Further detail about this impact is:\u000a    Assessment and treatment\u000a      Professor Wigram, Oldfield (and Sandford, Chair of the then Association\u000a      for Professional Music Therapists) jointly reviewed the music therapy\u000a      literature related to autistic spectrum disorder in order to provide\u000a      evidence of efficacy for the CAMHS (Child and Adolescent Mental Health\u000a      Service) NHS teams. Oldfield was consulted owing to her research and\u000a      clinical experience with children with autism described in section 2\u000a      above. As a result of this work music therapy was given `two ticks' (2009\u000a      onwards) for `Treatments and Therapies for Autism Spectrum Disorders\u000a      Currently Under Scientific Evaluation by Research Autism', which meant\u000a      that it was seen as an effective means of treatment for this client group\u000a      (5g).\u000a    Approach and service delivery\u000a      Odell-Miller, as invited advisory professor, has enabled a university\u000a      alliance to be set up between Anglia Ruskin University and Central and\u000a      Northwest London Healthcare (5c), which now has a large arts therapies\u000a      profile in NHS training, impacting on service delivery and changing\u000a      treatment approaches.\u000a    Professors Odell-Miller, Fachner (Professor of Music Health and the Brain\u000a      appointed at Anglia Ruskin University, January 2013), Wigram and Oldfield\u000a      regularly advise clinicians on research that impacts on healthcare\u000a      facilities, thus changing directions and policies of service delivery.\u000a      Examples of this are:\u000a    \u000a      Oldfield's involvement in the Northern Ireland Music Therapy Centre's\u000a        Lottery Fund research with children and adolescents, which has an impact\u000a        on increasing the profile, understanding and positive outcomes of music\u000a        therapy in this field.\u000a      Fachner is reported as an expert in neuro-scientific research in the\u000a        THES and this has already had an impact on raising the profile of music\u000a        therapy and neuroscience.\u000a      Odell-Miller was research advisor to a clinical NHS trial, the first\u000a        of its kind for people with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, which was\u000a        reported in 2012 (5i). The work impacted on a service that has not had\u000a        music therapy before, showing music therapy to be beneficial for people\u000a        with PTSD.\u000a      Impact on the local community of increased engagement with music\u000a        therapy is demonstrated through the new state-of-the-art Jerome Booth\u000a        Music Therapy Centre, made possible through private donations from\u000a        members of the public, amounting to over &#163;1.5M. The new centre has a\u000a        purpose-built clinic and training centre and has already enabled local\u000a        schools and health care providers wider access to music therapy, thus\u000a        changing lives of people.\u000a      The impact of the design of new assessment tools in adult mental\u000a        health is demonstrated by Nottingham Healthcare and specifically Rampton\u000a        Special Hospital adapting and trialling Odell-Miller's assessment tool\u000a        developed in Odell-Miller et al's 2006 study.\u000a    \u000a    Public Policy and Treatment Efficacy\u000a      The impact from the first Cochrane Review on schizophrenia (2005) has\u000a      far-reaching effects. Evidence for this is found within the NICE\u000a      guidelines (2009) that now recommend music therapy as a beneficial\u000a      treatment for people with schizophrenia, alongside other arts therapies,\u000a      emphasising the benefits of non-verbal treatments. Original research\u000a      evidence came from the music therapy research studies listed in the\u000a      Cochrane Review, and systematically reviewed by Wigram and colleagues. The\u000a      NICE Guidelines state: `The review found consistent evidence that arts\u000a        therapies are effective in reducing negative symptoms when compared to\u000a        any other control. Further, they recommend: (8.3.8.1) `...\u000a        offering arts therapies to all people with schizophrenia, particularly\u000a        for the alleviation of negative symptoms.

A Music Therapy Charity funded research\u000a      project (2000-4) supervised by Odell-Miller led to the development of a\u000a      new approach for children with autistic spectrum disorder and their\u000a      families: Interactive Music Therapy (Oldfield 2006a). Oldfield\u000a      analysed 222 half-hour videotapes of music therapy sessions with ten\u000a      families with pre-school children with autistic spectrum disorder in\u000a      minute detail. She identified eight aspects that characterise this\u000a      approach: the motivational aspect of music making; structure; the balance\u000a      between following and initiating; basic exchanges; control; movement;\u000a      playfulness and drama; and involving parents or primary carers.\u000a    Assessment:\u000a    Oldfield, with Odell-Miller, also researched and developed a new Music\u000a      Therapy Diagnostic Assessment tool (MTDA). Thirty children suspected of\u000a      having autistic spectrum disorder participated in MTDAs and also the\u000a      commonly used Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule tests (ADOS). The two\u000a      tests were scored and compared, and the children and the testers were\u000a      interviewed. Results showed 72% agreement between diagnostic categories,\u000a      indicating that the MTDA was providing similar information to the\u000a      recognised and established diagnostic tool. Results also showed\u000a      significant differences in scores of individual questions, indicating that\u000a      the MTDA could serve a useful and distinctive purpose in helping the\u000a      psychiatric team to diagnose children with autism, specifically through\u000a      the application of `play-based' interactive musical techniques (Oldfield\u000a      2006b).\u000a    Approach and service delivery\u000a    In the adult mental health field Odell-Miller, in consultation with\u000a      Wigram, carried out a randomised controlled trial across all the arts\u000a      therapies in a mental health trust, with 42 participants. (Odell-Miller,\u000a      Hughes and Westacott, 2006). This demonstrated: a) the need for a more\u000a      interactive approach with disturbed patients, both in arts psychotherapies\u000a      and music therapy; b) the benefits of the artistic interactive\u000a      relationship with people suffering from depression, schizophrenia and\u000a      bi-polar disorder; and c) the design of the semi-structured interview,\u000a      which was trialled in collaboration with Addenbrooke's NHS Trust, and\u000a      which was later adopted by Nottingham Healthcare Trust. The research\u000a      traced the development of patients' mental states alongside arts therapies\u000a      processes, charting whether arts therapies changed these. Important\u000a      outcomes included: an acknowledgement that the rapport between the arts\u000a      therapist and patient is crucial; a realisation that the use of art forms\u000a      helps patients feel understood through the therapist's artistic and verbal\u000a      reflection; confirmation that therapists' views about the therapy and\u000a      benefits to patients coincided with the patients' own views about this in\u000a      all cases.\u000a    Public Policy and Treatment Efficacy\u000a    Wigram was a leading contributor to the first Cochrane Review for\u000a      schizophrenia (Gold et al, 2005), which systematically reviewed current\u000a      research from across the world. The review concluded that music therapy\u000a      for people with schizophrenia reduces negative symptoms of schizophrenia\u000a      and that active improvised music making is effective in this\u000a      respect (corroborated by Odell-Miller's (2013) research\u000a      linking technique to diagnosis). These effects were shown to be sustained\u000a      at six months follow-up. This has led to the inclusion of music therapy\u000a      treatment in the National Institute for Clinical Excellence's (NIHR)\u000a      guidelines.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43818","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of the research was manifest in four connected ways:\u000a    i. Facilitating links between African, UK and International\u000a        communities\u000a    Under Professor Okagbue's leadership, AfTA has grown from a new-founded\u000a      organisation with 20 members in 2006 to 140 members by 2011 (70% African,\u000a      20% UK, 10% other) [1]. AfTA's combination of objectives (`for scholars\u000a      and practitioners to meet and exchange ideas' and `to provide information\u000a      on African performance and theatre to the wider public') has been pursued\u000a      through conferences &#8212; held annually, alternately in African and\u000a      non-African venues, including performance\/readings of new work such as\u000a      Mojisola Adebayo and Mamela Nyamza's I Stand Corrected at AfTA in\u000a      Cape Town, July 2012. AfTA conferences resonate with Okagbue's\u000a      interventions focusing attention on performance and development, notably\u000a      his keynote Managing our Destinies: Culture and the Arts in National\u000a        Development, at the School of Performing Arts, Ghana, 19 October\u000a      2012 [2].\u000a    ii. Raising awareness of colonial history\u000a    The impact of the Sameboat project has continued through the documentary\u000a      film Mami Wata and the Black Atlantic (BlackMadonnaFilms 2007),\u000a      uploaded onto the web on 10 May 2008 &#8212; the most viewed section (part 3 of\u000a      6) has had 3,459 hits to date (17 November 2013) [3]. Sameboat developed\u000a      their work the following year with Black Man Don't Float (2008-9),\u000a      a performance collaboration on economic migrancy on which Okagbue was\u000a      consultant, performed at the Pierian Centre Bristol (25 November 2008) and\u000a      subsequent workshops [4].\u000a    iii. Developing African diaspora work with intercultural communities\u000a        in South East London\u000a    The Beyond the Linear Narrrative project focused on creating a\u000a      community beyond academia. Holly Pester, a white performance poet and\u000a      teacher on a BA English Literature, spoke at the `Transformations of\u000a      Narrative' conference (November 2010) organised by Okagbue.[5a] She\u000a      commented afterwards:\u000a    `The conference was a valuable experience in terms of locating my\u000a        practice of poetics and performance outside its usual parameters. The\u000a        dialogue with practitioners and dramaturges from different disciplines,\u000a        cultural references and approach was useful for identifying points of\u000a        ethics and narrative... Knowing the debates over the political value of\u000a        the term `Post-Colonial Literature' has helped create discussion in\u000a        seminars and provide my students with alternative theories within the\u000a        field.'\u000a    The final conference, `Reconfigurations: Remaking Narrative' (November\u000a      2011) [5b] engaged the participation of schools, with local pupils writing\u000a      and performing their poems to the conference. A teacher at Deptford Green\u000a      School, South-East London, wrote:\u000a    `On behalf of myself, colleagues and Deptford Green students, thank\u000a        you so much for the opportunity to partake in the `Reconfigurations'\u000a        conference. It is quite overwhelming to perform in front of such a\u000a        talented audience dedicated to learning ... I am sure you will all have\u000a        helped the students to gain the best set of results Deptford Green have\u000a        ever had and developed skills they will need for life.'\u000a    iv. Supporting new diasporic writing and performance\u000a    Building from Okagbue's research focus, Goldsmiths has become a platform\u000a      for new Black writing. AHRC Creative and Performing Arts Fellow and AfTA\u000a      member Gabriel Gbadamosi developed his prizewinning novel Vauxhall\u000a      (Telegram, 2013) while based at Goldsmiths 2006-2009 [6]. As part of the\u000a      Pinter Centre project, Okagbue mentored Ade Solanke in developing her\u000a      plays Celebrate! and Pandora's Box.[8] The latter was\u000a      performed at the Centre's 2011 `Reconfigurations' conference, followed by\u000a      a panel-audience debate featuring Okagbue and Diane Abbott, MP, who said:\u000a      `I have been very impressed with Professor Okagbue's work. I think he\u000a        plays a vital role supporting black writers.' [7]. The play was\u000a      nominated for Best New Play in the Off West End Theatre Awards, and ran at\u000a      the Arcola Tent theatre in East London from May 9th to 26th\u000a      2012. The performance on May 12th was followed by a discussion,\u000a      the panel again including Okagbue and Diane Abbott with Richard Taylor\u000a      OBE, the black British community leader and father of Damilola Taylor, who\u000a      said `This play...address an issue at the heart of contemporary\u000a        British society.'\u000a    Solanke considers Okagbue's work to have been crucial both to her success\u000a      and the new audiences for African diasporic writing [9]:\u000a    `One of the ways the new wave is having an impact on British-African\u000a        writers is in terms of practical support for their work. Another\u000a        development is partnerships between experienced `home-grown' artists and\u000a        diaspora producers\/artists\/storytellers [...] An important impact of the\u000a        new wave is psychological. It's been inspiring to see audiences flocking\u000a        to the African plays and films that have been on in London over the last\u000a        few years. This May there were three British-Nigerian plays on in London\u000a        (my debut, Pandora's Box, included). This success is due in no small\u000a        part to the Arts Council's investment in developing new writing and new\u000a        theatre audiences. Professor Osita Okagbue and Goldsmith College's\u000a        Pinter Centre for New Writing were also sources of great support.'\u000a    On 23 February 2011 the project hosted a first rehearsed reading by\u000a      another writer mentored by Okagbue: Janice Okoh. Her play, Egusi Soup,\u000a      went on to be produced professionally by the Menagerie Theatre Company at\u000a      the Soho Theatre from 23 May to 9 June 2012, with a post-performance\u000a      discussion panel involving Okagbue, Janice Okoh, the actors and audience\u000a      members on 29 May. Okoh later won the Bruntswood Award for new playwrights\u000a      in November 2011, for her other play Three Birds.[10]\u000a    Okagbue's emphasis on performance in the politics of African diaspora\u000a      identity has further impact through an actors' collective developed in\u000a      collaboration between Goldsmiths, Heavy Wind Media\/Bubbles FM, to produce\u000a      Our Husband Has Gone Mad Again which toured London between December\u000a      2012 and June 2013. This production provided much needed work to British\u000a      actors of African descent. More of such actor\/director collectives are\u000a      envisaged, with Goldsmiths serving as an incubating\/launching space.[11]\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Okagbue's research into modern African theatre, diasporic\u000a      performance and post- colonial possibility has had impact in African and\u000a      British communities and in the world of theatre.

His research focuses on African theatre and performance, Caribbean\u000a      theatre, postcolonial theatre, and theatre-for-development. He has written\u000a      extensively about cultural strategies to counter the racist narratives\u000a      formerly used to justify slavery and colonialism in Africa and the\u000a      Caribbean, and has held research grants from the Leverhulme Trust, AHRB\u000a      and British Academy to fund research leave for his research project on\u000a      indigenous African performances and theatre [1]. This project, `African\u000a      Theatres and Performances' conducted 2002 - 2005, culminated in his books\u000a      African Theatres and Performances (2007) [2], Culture and\u000a        Identity in African and Caribbean Theatre (2009) [3], and African\u000a        Theatre: Diasporas (co-edited with Dr Christine Matzke, 2009) [4].\u000a    His research has demonstrated that African and African Diasporic theatre\u000a      portrays a world of social rhythms that use non-linear narrative\u000a      techniques of `storytelling theatre', `ritual-dream theatre' and total\u000a      theatre to show a distinctly African worldview in which the past, present\u000a      and future interact. This theatre also enables the present to engage with\u000a      itself in critical and creative ways. Okagbue's scholarly explorations\u000a      have been combined with collaborative practice-based projects and\u000a      workshops. As director of Grigri Zoro's Mami Wata and the Black\u000a        Atlantic, at the heart of Sameboat's 2007 Heritage Lottery Funded\u000a      project to commemorate the bicentenary of the abolition of the slave\u000a      trade, Okagbue's work drew public attention to the historically colonial\u000a      relationship between the UK and Africa [5].\u000a    As well as public intervention in debates on theatre and cultural policy\u000a      in the UK, Germany, Uganda and Ghana, his role in AfTA connects Africa\u000a      with diasporic networks, including non-academic practitioners and critics,\u000a      through an international membership (70% African, 20% UK, 10% other).\u000a      Okagbue's work is exemplified by the combination of intellectual enquiry\u000a      and facilitation of the agency he seeks to analyse.\u000a    The Beyond Linear Narratives project (2009 - 2012) drew on these\u000a      elements to investigate the connection between cultural and political\u000a      change, and the new emphasis on non-linear and fractured narrative.

Do they emerge from the\u000a      increasing interaction of different cultures in the globalised world? The\u000a      project also explored ways in which diaspora Africans in the United\u000a      Kingdom can take ownership of their own theatre by shifting the\u000a      sidestream-mainstream relationship of the British cultural landscape in\u000a      funding, styles and types of theatre, and places of performance [6].\u000a    Based at Goldsmiths' Pinter Centre for Performance and Creative Writing\u000a      (TPC), the project combined a traditional academic approach with creative\u000a      practice, plays, performances, readings, musical events, post-performance\u000a      forums, film, video and digital media (29 events and three conferences).\u000a    Two doctoral students were attached to the project, with one working with\u000a      Professor Okagbue on African diasporic theatre and performance in the\u000a      United Kingdom, and two artists-in-residence: one, Ade Solanke, mentored\u000a      by Okagbue.

In both forms his work has impact upon two kinds of users:\u000a      (1) arts professionals, including critics, broadcast programmers and arts\u000a      curators; and (2) contemporary audiences for film.\u000a    1. Impact on Arts Professionals\u000a    The version of Eisenstein's Battleship Potemkin with Hughes'\u000a      music was used by documentary filmmaker Mark Cousins in `The Story of\u000a        Film: An Odyssey' (2011), a major Channel 4 documentary series on\u000a      the history of film, in which Hughes' version of the famous Odessa Steps\u000a      sequence was used to explain Eisenstein's principles of montage [see\u000a      Section 5, C1].\u000a    The British Library's exhibition `Breaking the Rules' (2007-08) on\u000a      twentieth-century avant-garde art, presented Eisenstein's Strike\u000a      with Hughes' music performed live as part of a series of events in the\u000a      Atrium of the British Library [C2].\u000a    The scores for Ivens' film Regen and for Eisenstein's Strike\u000a      have had impact upon international arts programmers: Regen has\u000a      been presented at the `Hanns Eisler' public symposium in Berlin, 1\u000a      November 2008, including an evening public performance attended by 250\u000a      people, and at the Institut f&#252;r Neue Musik - Studios f&#252;r Filmmusik,\u000a      Freiburg, 9 May 2012; the score for Strike has been presented in\u000a      Tel Aviv, Israel, 17 December 2011, conducted by Ilan Volkov [C3].\u000a    The version of Auditorium with recorded sound track was used to\u000a      educate and inform curators on the uses of music in the display of visual\u000a      materials in museums and galleries when it was shown to international\u000a      gallery and museum curators at the V &amp; A `Displaying Music' event, 15\u000a      July 2011 [C4]. The film has also been selected for presentation by film\u000a      and gallery curators more widely, including Tate Britain (08 March 2008),\u000a      Brixton Ritzy (19 April 2008), Palazzo Santa Margherita, Modena (20 April\u000a      2008), and Nichido Contemporary Art, Tokyo (10 April 2009) [C5].\u000a    Dark Formations, which presents a video sequence of documentary\u000a      photographs of World War Two bombing raids from the Imperial War Museum\u000a      archive, with music by Hughes, has also impacted upon the way in which\u000a      museum curators present archive images, as evidenced by Roger Tolson,\u000a      Principal Curator, Imperial War Museum: `The methodology of Dark\u000a        Formations has been a direct stimulus to how to re-think the\u000a      selection, narration and display design of disparate groups of material,\u000a      and one that I believe will enrich these and future displays' [C6].\u000a    2. Impact on Film Audiences\u000a    Despite the importance of music for our experience of film, its effect is\u000a      often subliminal and unrecognised by film audiences. Indeed, some\u000a      film-makers argue that the music for a film should be unnoticed,\u000a      making it difficult to evaluate the nature of the impact of Hughes' music\u000a      on audiences directly. However, Hughes has also explained his methods\u000a      extensively through engagement with film audiences and viewers - e.g. he\u000a      was interviewed on BBC Radio 3's flagship contemporary music programme `Hear\u000a        and Now' on 3 May 2008 in relation to his score for Strike,\u000a      a 12-minute section of which was then broadcast in the same programme\u000a      [C7]; an extract from Auditorium was heard and discussed on BBC\u000a      Radio 3 on 2 December 2008 in `Performance on 3' as part of the\u000a      2008 British Composer Awards feature [C8].\u000a    Hughes' scores for the commercial Eisenstein and Ozu releases have\u000a      contributed to the consolidation of a market for silent film, which has\u000a      appealed especially to the UK market for DVD and Blu-ray releases in which\u000a      high-quality, imaginative audio tracks are strongly appreciated. UK and\u000a      international DVD sales for the Ozu releases are estimated by the BFI at\u000a      around 3,000 as of 11 March 2013. The Tartan Eisenstein discs had sold\u000a      1,765 units as of 11 March 2013, although these figures do not include\u000a      international and web distribution [C9]. Many of these sales are made to\u000a      institutions, thus increasing their audience reach substantially.\u000a    Sam Dunn, Head of BFI Video Publishing, comments on the impact upon\u000a      national and international audiences of Hughes' Ozu scores: `Working with\u000a      Ed Hughes on the BFI's on-going Ozu Collection has been a fantastic\u000a      experience. His scores are of a consistently high standard, making these\u000a      rarely-seen silent works accessible to modern audiences and film scholars\u000a      alike. Not only that, but his compositions are meeting with the approval\u000a      of the Japanese licensors, thereby transcending cultural difference and\u000a      functioning on an international stage' [C10].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Hughes' impact arises from his music for films without sound, which has\u000a      rendered historically important silent films, and more recent silent film\u000a      formats, accessible to contemporary audiences. Critics, programmers and\u000a      broadcasters have all recognised this impact in their commissions and\u000a      programming of Hughes' scores, and Hughes' work has also impacted upon the\u000a      way in which museum curators display film and other archival materials.\u000a      The films include commercial DVD releases of classic silent films by\u000a      Sergei Eisenstein and Yasujiro Ozu, music for Joris Ivens' film Regen\u000a      (1929), music for a new film by photographer Sophie Rickett, and music for\u000a      a documentary image sequence of photographs from the Imperial War Museum\u000a      archive.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    University of Sussex\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Sussex (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Sussex","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007806}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2950159","Name":"Berlin"},{"GeoNamesId":"2925177","Name":"Freiburg"},{"GeoNamesId":"293397","Name":"Tel Aviv"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000aR1 Hughes, E.

Between 2001 and 2007 Hughes'\u000a      compositional research was focused on music for early silent film. This\u000a      research responded to theoretical questions raised from the 1920s in\u000a      journals such as Close Up (1927-33), and in the writings of the\u000a      Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein, the composer Hanns Eisler, and others,\u000a      which investigated the possibility of producing new audio-visual\u000a      relationships between music and the moving image. Silent film-makers of\u000a      the 1920s and 1930s experimented with new visual languages, but the\u000a      subsequent standardisation of film methods means that the filmic languages\u000a      of directors such as Eisenstein, Ozu and Ivens can now seem remote. In his\u000a      work, Hughes re-examines the contrapuntal relationship between music and\u000a      the moving image to enhance the immediacy and impact of early silent\u000a      films.\u000a    In a major two-year project from 2006-08, Hughes composed new scores for\u000a      Eisenstein's films Strike (1924) and Battleship Potemkin\u000a      (1925). Hughes put into practice Eisenstein's concept, articulated in the\u000a      essay `Non-indifferent nature', that the `beats and accents' of the film\u000a      image might synchronise with the acoustic beats and accents of the music,\u000a      as evidenced in Eisenstein's supervision of Meisel's scoring of Battleship\u000a        Potemkin in 1926. By using principles derived from an understanding\u000a      of montage and other experimental filmic forms in the music itself,\u000a      Hughes' own scoring of Potemkin (2007) developed this principle\u000a      with a more extended network of audiovisual beats and accents. The music\u000a      also responded to the spatial constructions of the film's mise-en-sc&#232;ne\u000a      [see Section 3, R1].\u000a    Hughes' investigation of a very different set of practices in the early\u000a      cinema work of Yasujiro Ozu similarly sought to bring out and articulate\u000a      for contemporary audiences the unusual and meticulous cyclical structures,\u000a      and subtle use of montage, which are the hallmark of Ozu's work, yet which\u000a      are easily overlooked, in part because of these films' surface-level\u000a      engagement with Hollywood gangster films and pulp fiction genres. Hughes\u000a      has also written critical commentaries on his approach to creating music\u000a      for Ozu's films in the booklets accompanying these releases [R2].\u000a    Hughes has also undertaken research into, and composed a new score for,\u000a      Joris Ivens' film Regen (Rain; 1929), for which Hanns Eisler also\u000a      composed a score that was the basis of discussion for Eisler's influential\u000a      book with Adorno, Composing for Films [R3]. The theoretical\u000a      background for Hughes' work on this film was published in the article by\u000a      Hughes, `New technologies and old rites: dissonance between picture and\u000a      music in readings of Joris Ivens' Rain' [R4].\u000a    The use of music that matches or counterpoints the rhythm of the film\u000a      editing and the spatiality of the film image, had also been developed by\u000a      Hughes in collaborative projects with contemporary film- and video-makers,\u000a      including a score for photographer Sophy Rickett's silent film Auditorium\u000a      (2007), commissioned by Glyndebourne Opera and Photoworks, which explored\u000a      the relation between architectural, filmic and musical space [R5], and a\u000a      soundtrack for Dark Formations [R6], an audiovisual creation\u000a      exploring how music can enhance the museum visitor's experience of\u000a      archival images from World War Two kept at the Imperial War Museum,\u000a      undertaken in collaboration with photography historian David Chandler.\u000a    Hughes' film scores have also been discussed in critical literature on\u000a      film music, which have further added to their impact. His Eisenstein\u000a      scores are discussed in Mervyn Cooke, A History of Film Music\u000a      (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008) p. 269; his score for Regen\u000a      is discussed in Johannes Gall, 'A rediscovered way to describe Rain', in\u000a      P.

The commercial brief acts as a series of creative parameters\u000d\u000a      stimulating and necessitating innovation and new insights into the\u000d\u000a      particular genre or form being explored. These innovations and insights\u000d\u000a      have been more widely disseminated as part of the growing sub-discipline\u000d\u000a      of Ludomusicology.\u000d\u000a    The underpinning research for the impacts described herein relates to Shift\u000a        2: Unleashed (2011), a multi-platform racing simulation game\u000d\u000a      published and distributed worldwide by Electronic Arts. Baysted devised\u000d\u000a      the original concept for the soundtrack as well as being audio director,\u000d\u000a      lead sound designer and one of five composers on the project.\u000d\u000a    In terms of composition Baysted's research explores how music can\u000d\u000a      function, non-diegetically, to enhance the player's experience and depth\u000d\u000a      of immersion when, in the simulation genre, music is never interactive and\u000d\u000a      is very rarely heard during sequences of gameplay. Furthermore, Baysted\u000d\u000a      conceived to re-imagine a range of popular song form material as a hybrid\u000d\u000a      cinematic style score that would function as a cohesive, unifying force\u000d\u000a      governing the player's emotional responses and deepening immersion. This\u000d\u000a      innovative approach had never been used before in the genre. The score\u000d\u000a      fuses contemporary cinematic orchestral language with `distorted'\u000d\u000a      electronica and sound design elements. Additionally, the output utilises\u000d\u000a      and builds upon Baysted's novel approaches to realistic vehicle sound\u000d\u000a      modelling which he has developed in previous projects.\u000d\u000a    By operating outside the norms of the genre, the score seeks to address\u000d\u000a      the research question by describing at once the `real' racing driver's\u000d\u000a      emotional and psychological journey and by enhancing the player's\u000d\u000a      concomitant experiences. To this end Baysted explored the possibilities of\u000d\u000a      using the `menu' system as a primary interface for the gamer's experience\u000d\u000a      of the score and experimenting with how the visceral and symbolic elements\u000d\u000a      of the sound design might also be used to support the overall experience.\u000d\u000a      Conventionally music and vehicular sound design never share the same\u000d\u000a      signifying space. In Shift 2, however, the sonic and musical experience\u000d\u000a      remains unbroken because layers of processed `pit-to-car radio'\u000d\u000a      transmissions and vehicular sounds are superimposed onto the music. This\u000d\u000a      yields far deeper player immersion than other works in this genre. The\u000d\u000a      outcome was a sonic experience combining innovative score and sound\u000d\u000a      effects that functioned to prepare the player emotionally for the action\u000d\u000a      that follows and to reward their success after it. Furthermore, the score\u000d\u000a      references the musical and orchestrational vocabulary from key films and\u000d\u000a      film genres, and this vocabulary informs and guides the transformation of\u000d\u000a      the rock songs drawing on the intertextual relationship between games and\u000d\u000a      the paramusical phenomena associated with popular music artists (Karen\u000d\u000a      Collins (2008), Game Sound, MIT Press, Cambridge: MA, p.129). The\u000d\u000a      compositional process itself involved finely deconstructing the original\u000d\u000a      recorded song `stems' using original instrumental audio files for each\u000d\u000a      instrument in every song, identifying and isolating each song's `genetic\u000d\u000a      fingerprint', and subjecting the resultant material to a variety of\u000d\u000a      transformational operations including: reharmonisation, reorchestration,\u000d\u000a      metrical reframing, tempo alteration, resynthesis and resampling. These\u000d\u000a      innovations &#8212; not before seen in any video game &#8212; have been picked up by\u000d\u000a      award panels, reviewers and gamers alike.\u000d\u000a    In terms of sound design, Baysted's objective was to faithfully recreate\u000d\u000a      the visceral nature of competitive motorsport by placing the game player\u000d\u000a      at the centre of a racing driver's sonic experience. Experimentation with\u000d\u000a      different techniques and tools of audio capture led to each car being\u000d\u000a      recorded on chassis dynamometers or at a racing circuit using an array of\u000d\u000a      specialist microphones positioned strategically internally and externally.\u000d\u000a      Each sonic component was modelled and recreated in game: engine,\u000d\u000a      transmission, surface noises, chassis noises, and impacts with tyre walls,\u000d\u000a      Armco and concrete. The engine sounds were sampled at specific frequencies\u000d\u000a      (RPM) under `load' in order that an innovative crossfading audio model\u000d\u000a      could be constructed in software. The game's physics engine, running at\u000d\u000a      200hz, `plays' this model depending upon player input, thus the audio is\u000d\u000a      fully and truly dynamic. Environmental sound effects (crowds, tannoy,\u000d\u000a      helicopters) were designed to situate the player at the circuit itself and\u000d\u000a      post-production effects such as reverberation, echo and filtering are\u000d\u000a      deployed to allow the vehicle to interact with objects within its\u000d\u000a      environment realistically.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44092","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The pathways to this impact are engagement with professional and emerging\u000a      choreographers, emerging professional dancers and young dancers hoping to\u000a      become professional dancers\/choreographers and organisations that both\u000a      programme and develop dance and dance makers.

Engaging with Flexer's choreographic approach\u000a      as part of this unique scheme has opened up new ways of working for all\u000a      eight artists involved. For Lila Dance, Flexer's approach to developing\u000a      and incorporating conversational text within performance as well as her\u000a      focus on the relationship between performer and audience provided new\u000a      choreographic insights, which are influencing their own practice.

She has been exploring the\u000a      dancer's individuality as an onstage presence which she says is informed\u000a      by Flexer's approach to working with dancers and this has made a\u000a      difference to her own dance making practice. Her new work for Anjali Dance\u000a      Company premiered at the Clore Ballroom, Royal Festival Hall, London in\u000a      2013, https:\/\/vimeo.com\/71567814\u000a      (See testimonial and emails from Abigail Mortimer and Carrie Whittaker,\u000a      Lila Dance; FreeFall Dance; Aya Kobayashi).\u000a    Apprentices (emerging professional dancers)\u000a    Flexer has provided an effective apprenticeship scheme for post-graduate\u000a      dancers to transition into professional practice. Often these apprentices,\u000a      such as Hannily who worked on The Living Room rural tour as an\u000a      assistant and workshop leader, go on to make their own work or to\u000a      successfully develop a career in dance (she is now rehearsal director for\u000a      Hampshire Youth Dance and teaches dance at the Univeristy of Chichester\u000a      and Bath Spa University). The scheme has afforded two graduate dancers\u000a      from the South-East the opportunity to become full company members - Aya\u000a      Kobayashi for `Doing, Done and Undone' (2007-09) and Hannah Martin for The\u000a        Living Room (2010-11). Both apprentices developed personally and\u000a      artistically through the process and subsequently secured employment in\u000a      dance roles. Martin is now teaching and making her own work for her\u000a      company FreeFall Dance. Kobayashi is a company member for Flexer most\u000a      recently performing in Weightless (http:\/\/flexerandsandiland.com\/archives\/yael-flexer\/performances\/weightless-2013\/)\u000a      and choreographer for Anjali Dance Company (See email testimonials from\u000a      Hannah Martin, Aya Kobayashi).\u000a    Organisational impact (on staff and the young dancer participants)\u000a    Within `The Living Room' project alone, Flexer created 13 commissioned\u000a      works for youth dance companies involving a total of 246 young people\u000a      across the UK. These works were based on the research themes in TLR and\u000a      were performed as curtain raisers. For some youth companies this was about\u000a      a first engagement with dance, and for others it was about shaping their\u000a      performance\/choreographic skills and nurturing an aspiration to pursue a\u000a      dance career.\u000a    Flexer worked with young dancers and emerging choreographers at Swindon\u000a      Dance and The Place as part of the Centre for Advanced Practice\u000a      programmes. McCluskey (Swindon) says she watched Flexer work and witnessed\u000a      several young people change their approach to choreography and some change\u000a      their minds about a career path, choosing contemporary dance rather than\u000a      hiphop or musical theatre. She has also run workshops for young people and\u000a      dance teachers throughout the SE and is considered to be a valuable assest\u000a      to the region and valued for her choreographic contribution and her\u000a      ability to transmit her knowledge to a wide range of people (see email\u000a      from Sacha Lee, The Point) Cuming (Ludus Dance) says Flexer's approach has\u000a      helped her reposition Ludus Dance from one perceived as dance in education\u000a      to a professional dance organisation. Flexer was employed to create work\u000a      for Ludus specifically to help them change programmers' perceptions about\u000a      Ludus Dance.

The Living Room\u000a      constitutes a seminal moment in Flexer's choreographic development and\u000a      career and was made just prior to the culmination of twenty years\u000a      choreographic work. Her earlier performance research, for example Doing,\u000a        Done, Undone (toured internationally 2007-2010) through to later\u000a      pieces such as Weightless (2013) have made a significant impact on\u000a      the UK contemporary dance profession. It is Flexer's long and sustained\u000a      career in a sector known for its emphasis on young and emerging\u000a      choreographers along with her depth of research into choreographic\u000a      methodologies that has made a difference to this professional dance\u000a      sector.\u000a    Flexer's choreographic style and methodology is the research that\u000a      underpins this impact.

Developing notions of\u000a      choreographic `portraiture' (Albright 1997, Marks 2003) and the\u000a      `in-between' (Briginshaw 2001) of dance and `the everyday', was a means to\u000a      explore the performers' contribution and ownership in the formation of\u000a      their onstage representation. Flexer (Choreographer) developed notions of\u000a      in-between, primarily between dance and `the everyday' and\u000a      dismantled the `fourth wall' to engender an informal mode of presentation.\u000a      The research explored, in practice, a continuum between formal\/complex\u000a      movement language and everyday gesture\/behaviour to highlight a concrete\u000a      performance register and a `matter of fact' aesthetic that draws on\u000a      post-modern dance practice and extends previous contemporaneous\u000a      investigations of the nexus between audience, performer and choreographer\u000a      such as The Song (2009) by Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker, A\u000a        Series of Appointments (2010) by Siobhan Davies, The Quiet Dance\u000a      (2005) by Jonathan Burrows and Matteo Fargion. This approach asserts\u000a      dancers' agency and extends interrogations of the notion of performativity\u000a      within theatrical performance (Burt 2006;Briginshaw 2001).\u000a    The work also questions other in-betweens such as the notion of\u000a      the `unhome' and hybrid identities (Bhabha, 1994) in order to reveal\u000a      autobiographical information\/asserting socio-cultural difference. As\u000a      choreographic strategy this makes reference to the liminal experience of\u000a      migration and brings a political dimension to the reading of a work made\u000a      by an Israeli choreographer working in the UK. This then deepens the\u000a      investigation of choreographic portraiture. In turn, this furthers\u000a      interrogations of the notion of performativity within theatrical\u000a      performance (Burt 2006; Briginshaw 2001) and asserts the performers'\u000a      agency. The process enables young and emerging dancers and choreographers\u000a      to critique and create alternative female dancing representations in\u000a      performance and so change their own choreographic signature and approach\u000a      to making work developing their own feminist artistic\/choreographic voice\u000a      and results in more articulate dancers, choreographers and future dance\u000a      audiences.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44136","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"1694008","Name":"Philippines"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"1733045","Name":"Malaysia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Creating new forms of artistic expression;\u000a    \u000a      The StoryBank system was deployed in Budikote village with\u000a        approximately 3,000 inhabitants.\u000a        137 stories were made and shared in the final trial by a wide cross\u000a        section of people, including\u000a        the low caste Dalit community who are usually excluded from village\u000a        debate.

The work has\u000a      now culminated in the creation of an open source community media toolkit\u000a      called Com-Me,\u000a      launched globally in three locations: first at the Royal Geographic\u000a      Society, London, on 3rd July\u000a      2012; second at the Unbox Festival 2013 in New Delhi, India; and third in\u000a      Cape Town, South\u000a      Africa, on 18th March 2013. The Com-Me toolkit includes\u000a      a mobile phone app for digital story\u000a      creation, a tablet app for story archiving and playback, a solar-powered\u000a      mobile phone charging\u000a      station, and the TV-Cam device (renamed 'Com-Cam') for relaying mobile\u000a      phone content to old\u000a      TVs: www.digitaleconomytoolkit.org\u000a    The foundation of the work lies in Surrey's investigation of\u000a      `audiophotography' as a new media\u000a      form (Ref 1). Although the capture of sound with photographs has not yet\u000a      become a mass-market\u000a      practice, both sounds and images can be captured on mobile phones,\u000a      creating the opportunity for\u000a      apps to combine them into `audiophoto narratives' or digital stories (Ref\u000a      2). While these are fast\u000a      becoming a new form of digital art in the West, Surrey recognised that\u000a      they might become a new\u000a      form of audiovisual communication in the East, in areas where literacy\u000a      rates are low.\u000a    This prediction was endorsed by a study of community radio use in\u000a      Budikote Village in south India\u000a      (Ref 3) and confirmed in a trial of the StoryBank system there,\u000a      which included a local story\u000a      repository shown on a public display (Refs 3 &amp; 4). The approach was\u000a      expanded in the first\u000a      published study of rural camera phone use in South Africa and led to the\u000a      design and testing of an\u000a      enhanced multimedia narrative app on an Android phone (both in Ref 5). A\u000a      residual problem of\u000a      sharing multimedia content on a small display was solved by Surrey staff\u000a      working alongside\u000a      colleagues at the University of Falmouth. An overhead CCTV camera was used\u000a      to relay mobile\u000a      phone content to analogue TV sets for a cost of under &#163;20.

In conferring an Editor's Choice on Sacred Hearts, Secret\u000d\u000a        Music, Gramophone said, `A\u000d\u000a      sense of scholarship as well as intense musicality runs through the whole:\u000d\u000a      fascinating and lovely'\u000d\u000a      [5.4].\u000d\u000a    Groups from all over the world (UK; North America; Europe; Australia)\u000d\u000a      have sought guidance from\u000d\u000a      Stras and Roberts, either directly or through the Musica Secreta website.\u000d\u000a      To facilitate this, the\u000d\u000a      Dangerous Graces project website allowed the public to download\u000d\u000a      newly edited and otherwise\u000d\u000a      unavailable scores [5.5]. Stras's female-voice editions have been\u000d\u000a      used in Tallis Scholars Summer\u000d\u000a      Schools in the USA and Australia (2009-present; c. 40 attendees at each),\u000d\u000a      and at Compline at\u000d\u000a      Winchester Cathedral on International Women's Day (2013). New ensembles\u000d\u000a      mentored by Stras\u000d\u000a      and Roberts include Ensemble Cortabella in Ferrara, Italy (2012-);\u000d\u000a      Brighton Early Music Festival's\u000d\u000a      BREMF Live participants Galan (2010-), and Virtuosa (2011-) [5.6].\u000d\u000a    The involvement of amateur singers in research and performance is vital\u000d\u000a      to Celestial Sirens' overall\u000d\u000a      mission: a group of good amateur\/ semi-professional singers with a mix of\u000d\u000a      ages from late teens to\u000d\u000a      late sixties is more representative than a professional group of a\u000d\u000a      sixteenth-century convent choir.\u000d\u000a      Since 2002, more than forty singers have participated, although there is a\u000d\u000a      regular core of around\u000d\u000a      16; there were thirty workshop participants in the Sacred Hearts\u000d\u000a      project. These singers are\u000d\u000a      significant beneficiaries; they have expressed benefits ranging from\u000d\u000a      intellectual satisfaction and\u000d\u000a      musical stimulation, to positive feelings related to community and\u000d\u000a      personal wellbeing. Testimonies\u000d\u000a      include: `Laurie considers things like temperament and pronunciation from\u000d\u000a      a historical point of view\u000d\u000a      rather than focusing only on \"making a nice sound\". We spend a lot of time\u000d\u000a      talking about the\u000d\u000a      background of the pieces, putting them in context and I feel that this\u000d\u000a      gives the music much more\u000d\u000a      purpose than simply choosing a few \"nice\" pieces and singing them in a\u000d\u000a      concert'; `I get a rare\u000d\u000a      opportunity to make stunning and sublime music with a group of talented,\u000d\u000a      inspiring and, above all,\u000d\u000a      warm ladies &#8212; many of whom are now firm friends. I suffer from chronic,\u000d\u000a      clinical depression and I\u000d\u000a      cannot overstate the importance that participating in such wonderful\u000d\u000a      projects plays in living with\u000d\u000a      this disorder' [5.7].\u000d\u000a    Celestial Sirens were voted Choir of the Day and reached the National\u000d\u000a      Selection stage of Choir of\u000d\u000a      the Year 2012. Although amateurs, they performed in elite venues, such as\u000d\u000a      the Royal Festival Hall\u000d\u000a      (2009) and Latitude Festival (2011). Some members also used their\u000d\u000a      experiences with Celestial\u000d\u000a      Sirens to form new female voice choirs: Cantilena in Horsham and the St\u000d\u000a      Pancras Schola in Lewes\u000d\u000a      both now perform repertoire from Stras's research. The choir has also\u000d\u000a      provided a platform for\u000d\u000a      young professionals to develop solo and small ensemble experience,\u000d\u000a      enhancing their resum&#233;s.\u000d\u000a    Creative collaboration with non-musical practitioners is another crucial\u000d\u000a      route for Stras's impact on\u000d\u000a      cultural life and artistic practice. Stras's collaboration with Dunant on\u000d\u000a      Sacred Hearts (2007-12)\u000d\u000a      developed into 18 months of providing historical and musical source\u000d\u000a      material, background for\u000d\u000a      plotlines and characters, translation, critical reading of drafts and\u000d\u000a      final proofreading. In turn, this led\u000d\u000a      to further research, collaboration and mutual outputs. The live\u000d\u000a      performances brought Musica\u000d\u000a      Secreta and Celestial Sirens together with Niamh Cusack, Claire Cox and\u000d\u000a      Deborah Findlay\u000d\u000a      (actors) and Nicholas Renton (director); it gave Irish actress Molly Lynch\u000d\u000a      her UK debut at Latitude.\u000d\u000a      It was a co-devised script, with the music an integral component. As\u000d\u000a      Dunant says: `The result of\u000d\u000a      the most creative partnership. Writer and singers, words and music: a\u000d\u000a      collaboration of women\u000d\u000a      worthy of a good convent'. [5.8]\u000d\u000a    The recording's inclusion in a work of mass-market fiction has brought\u000d\u000a      Stras's research to a public\u000d\u000a      well beyond the usual audience for early music: one Amazon reviewer said,\u000d\u000a      `Selected by my book\u000d\u000a      club, it was a good read: well researched, moving and insightful of\u000d\u000a      monastic life, drove a good\u000d\u000a      pace and was very appropriate to have the matching CD playing on my iPod'.\u000d\u000a      Sacred Hearts was\u000d\u000a      serialised on BBC R4 (2009), was voted Best Book by Channel 4's Book Club\u000d\u000a      (2010) and was\u000d\u000a      shortlisted for the Walter Scott Prize (2010). The Sacred Hearts\u000d\u000a      project generated international\u000d\u000a      broadcast and print coverage [5.9]: BBC R3\/4, CBC (Canada), ABC\u000d\u000a      (Australia), NPR (USA), RTE\u000d\u000a      (Ireland), with CD reviews including Classic FM, Gramophone,\u000d\u000a      the Observer; there was also\u000d\u000a      widespread coverage across the blogosphere. A blogger in Manchester said\u000d\u000a      after the performance\u000d\u000a      in the Cathedral: `The choir is perfect; their songs echo around the\u000d\u000a      interior, every bit as harmonious\u000d\u000a      as one would hope. Once again, it's time for a long walk home with\u000d\u000a      music having had a significant\u000d\u000a      impact upon us. There's something about music in a holy setting; you can't\u000d\u000a      help but be moved a\u000d\u000a      little, regardless of the genre or the circumstances'. All 10 live\u000d\u000a      performances were to capacity\u000d\u000a      audiences, reaching in excess of 3000 members of the public.\u000d\u000a    Sacred Hearts's impact is ongoing, through continued sales: book\u000d\u000a      sales in publisher Virago's\u000d\u000a      territories alone have reached 175,000 copies [5.10]; CD sales,\u000d\u000a      physical and downloads, have\u000d\u000a      exceeded 5,000. Dunant and Musica Secreta are writing a second live show\u000d\u000a      based on another of\u000d\u000a      Dunant's novels, The Company of the Courtesan.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The University of Southampton's Dr Laurie Stras co-directs the ensemble\u000d\u000a      Musica Secreta and its\u000d\u000a      amateur choir, Celestial Sirens.

Through her\u000d\u000a      collaboration with author\u000d\u000a      Sarah Dunant, Stras's activities have had an international impact on\u000d\u000a      artists and non-academic\u000d\u000a      audiences.

Stras's research has successfully contested these\u000d\u000a      perceptions by providing\u000d\u000a      evidence for widespread adaptive performance practices that allowed female\u000d\u000a      ensembles to sing\u000d\u000a      repertoire that is ostensibly unperformable without male voices. Practical\u000d\u000a      investigation is essential\u000d\u000a      to the historical research; moreover, without demonstration in the\u000d\u000a      marketplace, the dominant\u000d\u000a      narratives holding sway over promoter and audience attitudes are difficult\u000d\u000a      to shift.\u000d\u000a    In 1999, after a successful pilot project [3.1, 3.7], Stras and\u000d\u000a      Musica Secreta were awarded an\u000d\u000a      AHRB Major Research Grant [3.8] for an investigation into\u000d\u000a      performance practice relating to late-sixteenth-century\u000d\u000a      Italian female court musicians. The Dangerous Graces project\u000d\u000a      combined archival\u000d\u000a      research, musical preparation in workshop sessions, and finally recording\u000d\u000a      and live performance of\u000d\u000a      the repertoire [3.2, 3.4]. The project's methodology is still core\u000d\u000a      to Stras's approach: music is first\u000d\u000a      transcribed from source, prepared in scores, and then adapted in rehearsal\u000d\u000a      until the ensemble\u000d\u000a      arrives at a comfortable performance mode. The method is informed by\u000d\u000a      ongoing archival research\u000d\u000a      into historical context, and study of contemporary texts for evidence of\u000d\u000a      performance practice.\u000d\u000a    In 2006, Stras received an ACE grant to develop a multimedia event, Fallen,\u000d\u000a      a specially\u000d\u000a      commissioned play about characters buried in a Ferrara convent. It was\u000d\u000a      filmed and then projected\u000d\u000a      alongside a staged musical performance, in which Musica Secreta was joined\u000d\u000a      by Celestial Sirens,\u000d\u000a      an amateur choir formed in 2002 by Stras and her co-director Deborah\u000d\u000a      Roberts specifically to\u000d\u000a      extend their investigations into the sacred repertoire. Fallen was\u000d\u000a      produced in Brighton and London\u000d\u000a      in 2006\/7, and a related CD was released [3.5, 3.9].\u000d\u000a    As a result of Fallen's success, in 2007 the writer Sarah Dunant\u000d\u000a      approached Stras to act as\u000d\u000a      consultant for her novel, Sacred Hearts, set in a Ferrarese\u000d\u000a      convent in 1570. The research\u000d\u000a      undertaken for this project extended and reinforced the Dangerous\u000d\u000a        Graces project, as it uncovered\u000d\u000a      an important and hitherto unrecognised musical intersection between court\u000d\u000a      and convent music\u000d\u000a      [3.3, 3.6]. Consultation developed into collaboration, with Stras\u000d\u000a      devising a `soundtrack' of liturgical\u000d\u000a      chants and polyphonic works that was intentionally woven into the novel's\u000d\u000a      storylines; the novel and\u000d\u000a      CD were launched together at the London Literature Festival in 2009. A\u000d\u000a      radio serialisation\u000d\u000a      incorporated the soundtrack; a live event toured the British Isles,\u000d\u000a      sometimes involving local\u000d\u000a      workshop participants in the performance.\u000d\u000a    Stras has worked in the institutional context of other research on\u000d\u000a      similar repertoires by Jeanice\u000d\u000a      Brooks (Professor; 1990-present) and Elizabeth Kenny (Reader in\u000d\u000a      Performance; 2007-present);\u000d\u000a      Kenny also performs with Musica Secreta. Deborah Roberts was a Research\u000d\u000a      Fellow on the AHRB\u000d\u000a      project (1999-2002) and is an Associate Performer at Southampton.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44197","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Our research on domestic music making has achieved impact through the\u000d\u000a      means of performance,\u000d\u000a      recording, radio, and film, and via extensive collaboration with heritage\u000d\u000a      bodies on the conservation,\u000d\u000a      interpretation and presentation of their holdings.\u000d\u000a    Brooks's initial findings featured in 'A Guide to the Accomplishments'\u000d\u000a      for BBC Radio 3 (July 2008),\u000d\u000a      recorded at JAHM, which used Jane Austen's music books to illustrate the\u000d\u000a      dissemination patterns\u000d\u000a      of domestic sheet music [5.1].

Norris recorded it at Hatchlands as Entertaining\u000d\u000a        Miss Austen, to\u000d\u000a      enthusiastic response from Austen fans (e.g. Jane Austen's Regency\u000d\u000a        World (2011): `David Owen\u000d\u000a      Norris breathes new life into recently discovered manuscripts....\u000d\u000a      delightful.') Working with Brooks's\u000d\u000a      claims about the uses of domestic sheet music albums, Norris mounted Radio\u000d\u000a      4's Jane Austen's\u000d\u000a        iPod (June 2010, recorded at JAHM) to fans' delight: 'WONDERFUL! . .\u000d\u000a      .

[5.3]. It was so successful that Radio 4\u000d\u000a      commissioned a spinoff 'iPod' series in\u000d\u000a      which Norris researches the musical choices of prominent historical\u000d\u000a      figures.\u000d\u000a    CHL and JAHM regularly refer Austen music queries to Brooks [5.1, 5.4],\u000d\u000a      providing the public with\u000d\u000a      fuller and more accurate information about domestic music.

Southampton research\u000d\u000a      insights were essential to\u000d\u000a      completing the film. Brooks appears on screen explaining how music was\u000d\u000a      copied for domestic use;\u000d\u000a      she sourced the dance music from the Austen family books and collaborated\u000d\u000a      on historically\u000d\u000a      appropriate arrangements with Drabkin; Thorm&#228;hlen formed and led the dance\u000d\u000a      band (made up of\u000d\u000a      Southampton staff) with accurate instrumentation, which played for the\u000d\u000a      Regency domestic ball\u000d\u000a      reconstruction that the film is about. Comments on social media on\u000d\u000a      Brooks's contribution included\u000d\u000a      'That was one of the many wow moments for this viewer' [5.6].\u000d\u000a      Through CHL and JAHM, Brooks\u000d\u000a      has provided expertise on Austen music to the British Council (musical\u000d\u000a      consultancy for the\u000d\u000a      Teaching English film on Pride and Prejudice); trade book authors\u000d\u000a      (Joan Strasbaugh, List Lovers\u000d\u000a        Guide to Jane Austen (2013); amateur musicians (Jane Austen Society\u000d\u000a      and other concerts in the\u000d\u000a      UK, US, Canada and Australia) and students at all levels from the US, UK,\u000d\u000a      and east Asia.\u000d\u000a    Brooks's research has improved the conservation and dissemination of\u000d\u000a      Austen music. She\u000d\u000a      negotiated deposit of Austen private materials at CHL (2009) for public\u000d\u000a      and scholarly use, and led\u000d\u000a      the digitisation of both private and JAHM-owned Austen books (2011-13,\u000d\u000a      c.500 pieces) [5.1, 5.4].\u000d\u000a      JAHM now distributes the images to scholars and the public on demand and\u000d\u000a      we have a joint\u000d\u000a      license to mount them online in 2014, making the books' contents freely\u000d\u000a      available worldwide. The\u000d\u000a      University of Southampton funded the work in its state-of-the-art\u000d\u000a      digitisation unit, as well as\u000d\u000a      financing pre-digitisation conservation of the heavily deteriorated\u000d\u000a      private materials.\u000d\u000a    Norris's research has helped instrument curators better understand their\u000d\u000a      holdings; he has\u000d\u000a      generated information for heritage partners about the instruments formerly\u000d\u000a      used in their spaces\u000d\u000a      and helped them to deploy this new knowledge in interpretation and\u000d\u000a      display. The World's First\u000d\u000a        Piano Concertos and Entertaining Miss Austen featured\u000d\u000a      Hatchland pianos, and Norris recorded the\u000d\u000a      NT-Hatchlands audio guide (2008), matching domestic repertory to the\u000d\u000a      appropriate instruments. In\u000d\u000a      2013 his research in Southampton's Wellington Papers helped English\u000d\u000a      Heritage restore\u000d\u000a      Wellington's instrument &#8212; the oldest extant English grand piano &#8212; to his\u000d\u000a      former residence at Apsley\u000d\u000a      House.

Southampton and\u000d\u000a      RNCM mounted a\u000d\u000a      public masterclass on historical singing practice using the Tatton\u000d\u000a      repertory, attended by c500\u000d\u000a      visitors. Of the 320 surveyed, 58 identified the live music as the most\u000d\u000a      enjoyable aspect ('enjoyed\u000d\u000a      authenticity of music'; '[the highlight was] real people playing real old\u000d\u000a      instruments') [5.9]. The\u000d\u000a      Tatton Park business plan for 2013-17 explicitly includes further\u000d\u000a      exploitation of our music research\u000d\u000a      findings to enhance visitor experience [5.9].\u000d\u000a    With funding from Tatton Park Trust and the AHRC, Brooks produced four\u000d\u000a      short films on domestic\u000d\u000a      music for Tatton's Heritage Lottery 'Hidden Histories' project, aimed at\u000d\u000a      bringing to life the activities\u000d\u000a      of former residents [5.10].

Brooks collaborated with filmmaker Aura Satz and\u000d\u000a      composer Larry Goves\u000d\u000a      on Sound Ornaments in the Music Room (SOMR), an\u000d\u000a      installation responding to Tatton's\u000d\u000a      architecture and the instruments and scores of former residents [5.11].\u000d\u000a      Brooks supplied music,\u000d\u000a      images and historical information, and mounted performances that produced\u000d\u000a      raw digital and sound\u000d\u000a      material for the work. Brooks's work created impact for Tatton staff and\u000d\u000a      Biennial visitors as well as\u000d\u000a      the artists: SOMR's relationship with Southampton research was\u000d\u000a      explained in 'Interpreting the\u000d\u000a      Archives', an exhibition of the original musical materials with\u000d\u000a      descriptive text by Schofield and\u000d\u000a      Tatton volunteers, and SOMR featured in the family learning pack\u000d\u000a      distributed to visitors. Reviews\u000d\u000a      in international art media singled out the piece: Creative Times\u000d\u000a      called it a 'moment to savour' and\u000d\u000a      The Lady praised its close engagement with the house's history.\u000d\u000a      Brooks curated the 2012\u000d\u000a      Biennial's concluding event (29\/09\/12), a live installation for which she\u000d\u000a      selected the music from\u000d\u000a      Tatton's collection and supplied raw materials for two further newly\u000d\u000a      commissioned works, a\u000d\u000a      collaboration between Aura Satz and Southampton staff member Jane Chapman\u000d\u000a      and a work by\u000d\u000a      Leo Grant, which were premiered during the event. The audience of 70\u000d\u000a      included music lovers who\u000d\u000a      had not previously visited Tatton, art enthusiasts and heritage tourists.\u000d\u000a      Written feedback included:\u000d\u000a      'A vibrant and colourful addition to the Biennial! It is a real pleasure\u000d\u000a      to hear the instruments played\u000d\u000a      in this fantastic setting. More concerts would be much appreciated!' 'I\u000d\u000a      really enjoyed listening to old\u000d\u000a      and new compositions, especially in these different acoustics. It created\u000d\u000a      a completely different\u000d\u000a      atmosphere, unusual to most concert spaces' [5.9].\u000d\u000a    Southampton's music research has engendered a significant shift in\u000d\u000a      attitude among heritage\u000d\u000a      partners, representing an important contribution to the &#163;26 billion pa the\u000d\u000a      sector brings to the UK\u000d\u000a      economy. The National Trust's Head Librarian Mark Purcell wrote, 'We are\u000d\u000a      all guilty of deluding\u000d\u000a      ourselves that the Trust knows more about its properties than it really\u000d\u000a      does, but it is striking how\u000d\u000a      little attention we had given to the history of music and music-making in\u000d\u000a      them until recently',\u000d\u000a      pointing to Southampton initiatives as an exciting new way of bringing\u000d\u000a      National Trust soundscapes\u000d\u000a      to life [5.12]. In 2012 Brooks and PGRs showcased Southampton's\u000d\u000a      work at the NT national plenary\u000d\u000a      for 150 senior heritage managers. Unsolicited email reactions include\u000d\u000a      'What a triumph the\u000d\u000a      performance at Blickling was &#8212; all my colleagues were abuzz about it\u000d\u000a      afterwards!' (James\u000d\u000a      Rothwell, regional curator); 'Well-researched musical performances are\u000d\u000a      exactly what we have been\u000d\u000a      lacking in Trust spaces for as long as I can remember!' (Ylva Dahnsjo,\u000d\u000a      regional conservator); 'The\u000d\u000a      performances were a revelation' (Katy Lithgow, national head conservator)\u000d\u000a      [5.13]. Subsequently\u000d\u000a      we have secured further joint funding for musical research at the NT's\u000d\u000a      Mottisfont (2 AHRC awards\u000d\u000a      2013-16); we are collaborating with JAHM on music facsimiles for sale in\u000d\u000a      their shop; and 2013-14\u000d\u000a      sees the launch of a new research-led concert series at CHL, with the\u000d\u000a      first concert by Norris in\u000d\u000a      December 2013. The continued enthusiasm of heritage partners for our\u000d\u000a      research confirms they\u000d\u000a      have become newly sensitive to the importance of music, both to the\u000d\u000a      history of their properties and\u000d\u000a      as a component of their current practices of interpretation and display.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This project achieved impact on cultural life through improved public\u000d\u000a      understanding of domestic\u000d\u000a      music making c. 1800; conserving, interpreting and presenting neglected\u000d\u000a      musical sources in\u000d\u000a      heritage properties and private collections; creating new public art\u000d\u000a      works; influencing the practice\u000d\u000a      of heritage curators, conservators, and volunteers at local and national\u000d\u000a      levels; and enhancing\u000d\u000a      heritage visitor experience.

And after the explosion of the British printing trade in the\u000d\u000a      18th century, a vast amount of\u000d\u000a      sheet music was published for use in the home. Yet today we know little\u000d\u000a      about how people made\u000d\u000a      music behind closed doors.\u000d\u000a    Pioneering work on music in London (McVeigh, Weber) and the provinces\u000d\u000a      (Cowgill, Holman) has\u000d\u000a      demonstrated how the burgeoning wealth of Britain c.1800\u000d\u000a      contributed to a flourishing cultural\u000d\u000a      economy. The role of domestic musical activity in this picture has been\u000d\u000a      relatively neglected,\u000d\u000a      however, and associated musical sources virtually ignored. Domestic music\u000d\u000a      collections owned by\u000d\u000a      heritage bodies are generally poorly catalogued and little understood;\u000d\u000a      music does not figure in\u000d\u000a      curatorial training, and musical aspects of properties are thus rarely\u000d\u000a      effectively interpreted for\u000d\u000a      visitors. The worlds of heritage and historically informed performance\u000d\u000a      have remained almost\u000d\u000a      entirely separate, despite many shared goals. Our research investigates\u000d\u000a      the world of private music\u000d\u000a      making in Georgian Britain, aiming to generate new information about\u000d\u000a      repertories and performance\u000d\u000a      practices that characterised domestic music making, and to discover how\u000d\u000a      musical activities\u000d\u000a      intersected with contemporary concepts of emotion, gender, family and\u000d\u000a      class. In addition to\u000d\u000a      historical work, project goals include innovations in curatorial practice\u000d\u000a      so that domestic spaces in\u000d\u000a      heritage properties `sound' for today's visitors in informative and\u000d\u000a      stimulating ways.\u000d\u000a    Researchers include Professor Jeanice Brooks, Professor David Owen Norris\u000d\u000a      (both in post\u000d\u000a      throughout) and Dr Wiebke Thorm&#228;hlen (UoS Humanities Research Fellow\u000d\u000a      2009-10; Wellcome\u000d\u000a      Trust Fellow 2010-11, AHRC Fellow Jan-Sept 2012, Lecturer in Music Sept\u000d\u000a      2012-). The project\u000d\u000a      also involves 7 PhD students and 5 further staff (Drabkin, Chandler,\u000d\u000a      Crouch, Bircher, Chapman).\u000d\u000a      Our work has generated extensive new knowledge about repertories,\u000d\u000a      collection habits and\u000d\u000a      performance practices characteristic of domestic music-making generally\u000d\u000a      and of specific\u000d\u000a      individuals and locations [3.1-7,9]. From different theoretical\u000d\u000a      directions (feminist scholarship,\u000d\u000a      history of emotion, Habermassian notions of the 'public' role of the\u000d\u000a      private sphere, material culture)\u000d\u000a      we show how domestic music making shaped ideas and identities, and\u000d\u000a      generated economic and\u000d\u000a      social activity outside and within the home [3.1-2,5,9]. Our work\u000d\u000a      in heritage demonstrates how\u000d\u000a      interpretations focussed on music can combat the static effect of earlier\u000d\u000a      conventions of display; this\u000d\u000a      reinforces new trends in curatorial practice, emphasising 'intangible\u000d\u000a      heritage' as well as the objects\u000d\u000a      that were formerly the main focus of attention [3.7-8].\u000d\u000a    Brooks's research on compilations of music for domestic performance began\u000d\u000a      in 2003, and sources\u000d\u000a      include unstudied National Trust (NT) collections at Killerton (Devon) and\u000d\u000a      Tatton Park (managed\u000d\u000a      by Cheshire East Council (CEC)); Jane Austen's music books, curated by\u000d\u000a      Jane Austen's House\u000d\u000a      Museum (JAHM); and further, previously unknown Austen albums in private\u000d\u000a      ownership.

His music has had significant cultural impact by\u000a      enhancing the repertory of new concert music, enriching audience\u000a      experience and stimulating performers, critics and audiences to\u000a      commentary, dialogue and debate.\u000a    Internationally active musicians have made Finnissy's work a core part of\u000a      their repertories and professional identities, and their engagement with\u000a      his music has changed their thinking and enhanced their careers as well as\u000a      disseminating his research to a broad range of audiences. Highly skilled\u000a      performers are attracted to Finnissy's work because they want to\u000a      participate at the cutting edge of contemporary music innovation and are\u000a      drawn to his engagement with political and social issues. The Kreutzer\u000a      Quartet provides an excellent example of a prominent group who have made a\u000a      longstanding commitment to Finnissy's music: first violinist Peter\u000a      Sheppard Sk&#230;rved confirms, `Michael Finnissy has been central to my\u000a      development and work as a musician for the past decade and a half. My\u000a      collaboration with this great composer has impelled me to radical\u000a      re-thinkings of structure, expression and sound' [5.1]. The\u000a      Kreutzer's recording of Finnissy's Second and Third String Quartets was\u000a      released on the NMC label in 2012 and named among the Sunday Times\u000a      Top Albums of the year [5.2]. The recording contributed to the\u000a      group's profile and to NMC's economic activity: according to figures\u000a      obtained from NMC (August 2013), 345 CDs and 1033 downloads of Music\u000a        for String Quartet (NMC D180) have been sold since the 2012 release\u000a      [5.1]. Similarly, many leading pianists have benefitted from\u000a      performing and recording Finnissy's works, including Nicolas Hodges,\u000a      Stephen Gutman, Marilyn Nonken and Ian Pace, who recorded The History\u000a        of Photography in Sound (5-6 CDs) for release on the Metier\/Divine\u000a      Art label in 2013 [5.3].\u000a    Major public performances of Finnissy's post-1999 music have extended the\u000a      reach of his work to varied international audiences and underpinned the\u000a      professional practice and economic and cultural activity of arts\u000a      organisations and venues. Since 2008 Finnissy has been featured composer\u000a      at many international music festivals, for example Borealis\u000a      Festival in Norway and Finland's Time of Music Festival (both\u000a      2009). Finnissy's Molly-House headlined the Time of Music's\u000a      concert series, for which a total of more than 700,000 tickets were sold.\u000a      Other major performances of post-1999 music include Concertgebouw Bruges\u000a      (3\/8\/08), Muziekgebouw, Amsterdam (18\/12\/08), Ensemble KORE, Montr&#233;al\u000a      (April 2009, including an Emerging Composers workshop led by Finnissy),\u000a      Tanglewood Festival (2009), Spitalfields Festival (2009), Boston\u000a      University (02\/2011, 11\/02\/2013, 3\/5\/3013), Wigmore Hall (21\/10\/12), Oslo\u000a      International Church Music Festival (March 2013) and London Ear Festival\u000a      (March 2013) [5.4]. We do not include here major performances of\u000a      pieces written before Finnissy's appointment at Southampton, but note that\u000a      his music represents a body of work whose impact is difficult to slice\u000a      neatly by chronology, and that his earlier (pre-1999) music has also had\u000a      hundreds of performances since 2008.\u000a    Important commissions since 2008 also testify to the impact of Finnissy's\u000a      creative work on performers and arts organisations who have found his\u000a      music compelling, and who wish to engage more closely with his insights.\u000a      These include Mankind (2009, London Festival of Church Music), a\u000a      stage work for mixed professional and amateur performers using accessible\u000a      notations Finnissy developed at Southampton; Ged&#228;chtnis-Hymne\u000a      (2010, a joint commission by the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival\u000a      and the New London Chamber Choir) premiered at the November Festival in\u000a      the Netherlands and broadcast on Radio 3's Hear and Now\u000a      (15\/01\/11); and a new vocal and two new piano works jointly commissioned\u000a      in spring 2013 by the Huddersfield and Belgium's Transit Festivals [5.4,\u000a        5.5].\u000a    Finnissy has been particularly influential in composition for amateur\u000a      musicians, bringing contemporary music to new performing constituencies\u000a      and inspiring other professionals to emulate him. James Weeks, artistic\u000a      director of the leading vocal ensemble EXAUDI (who have performed and\u000a      recorded several premieres of Finnissy works) said: `[Finnissy] is as\u000a      interested in working with students, amateurs, churchgoers, children &#8212; in\u000a      fact any constituency that might be touched and brought together by the\u000a      activity of making music, as he is with high-flying professionals......\u000a      Hundreds, perhaps thousands of us have seen the example set by Michael\u000a      Finnissy and attempted in some way to follow his lead' [5.6].\u000a      Finnissy has been an active member of Contemporary Music for All (CoMA) &#8212;\u000a      the organisation dedicated to enabling amateur musicians to become\u000a      involved in contemporary music &#8212; since its formation in 1993. As a teacher\u000a      at CoMA's summer school (1996-current) he has mentored in excess of 150\u000a      amateur music students &#8212; subsequently maintaining close and supportive\u000a      relationships with many of them &#8212; and Molly-House and other works\u000a      were composed with their benefit in mind. CoMA director Chris Shurety\u000a      confirms that `(Finnissy's) steadfast belief in the contribution the\u000a      amateur musician can make to contemporary music ... has had an enduring\u000a      impact for CoMA musicians, many of whom continue to be inspired and to\u000a      directly draw on their experience with him and his exploration of\u000a      notation, social and aesthetic issues in developing their own work' [5.7].\u000a    In many cases Finnissy has engaged directly with audiences to discuss his\u000a      compositional practice, and international media coverage has brought\u000a      further consideration of his work and its significance into the arena of\u000a      public musical knowledge and debate. For example, in a special festival\u000a      talk for Time of Music, Finnissy spoke to approximately 250\u000a      musicians and members of the public about his use of accessible musical\u000a      notation in Molly-House, calling on his audience to re-evaluate\u000a      their relationship to music and its performance [5.4]. Other\u000a      performances of Molly-House have similarly been framed to draw\u000a      attention to Finnissy's cultural critique: for example those by Ensemble\u000a      Amorpha at Handel House (4\/10\/11, including a talk by Finnissy) and at the\u000a      Institute of Contemporary Art (9\/6\/11, woven into a programme exploring\u000a      `deviancy' in classical music) [5.4]. In June 2009, 400 people\u000a      attended the sold-out premiere of Finnissy's Transgressive Gospel\u000a      at the Spitalfields Festival. Finnissy's insights on extended duration\u000a      were then further disseminated through reviews in the Guardian\u000a      (17\/6\/09) and the Daily Telegraph (16\/6\/09) and through the full\u000a      performance and an interview with Finnissy broadcast on Hear and Now (BBC\u000a      Radio 3, 22\/8\/09) [5.8]. The Guardian review claimed:\u000a      `It's a rich mix, bound by his take on modernism, highlighted in some\u000a      frenetically tangy instrumental writing, beautiful lyricism, and the odd\u000a      stinging theatrical gesture', and the Telegraph awarded it five\u000a      stars. Other examples of media coverage include a profile and links to his\u000a      music in the Guardian's `On Classical' guide (23\/07\/2012) and published\u000a      interviews in What Else (2010); Limburgs Dagblad (2010)\u000a      and the art magazine Trebuchet (2013) [5.9, 5.11].\u000a    Finnissy's compositional practice and his engagement with social and\u000a      political issues inspire heated debate in the musical world outside the\u000a      academy, drawing both passionate admiration and intense dislike.\u000a      Finnissy's impact on musical and cultural discourse has increased\u000a      substantially since 2008, as his work has become increasingly visible\u000a      within new media through postings on the internet of interviews about and\u000a      performances of his music. The activity of his fans in posting recordings\u000a      (for example, multiple extracts from History of Photography in Sound\u000a      in both commercial and private recordings, mounted on a dozen different\u000a      YouTube channels) testifies to public engagement with his work beyond\u000a      `official' music criticism in traditional media. Some of these videos have\u000a      been viewed over 30,000 times and they often spark animated discussion in\u000a      the `comments' sections: interlocutors express a gamut of reactions from\u000a      admiration (`No composer I've encountered has made me think so much'\u000a      `Finnissy is the UNIVERSE!!!') to dismissal (`This isn't music'), and\u000a      there are several lengthy discussions about his music's notation, meaning\u000a      and worth [5.10]. Social media comments support the evaluation of\u000a      Finnissy's cultural impact offered by Tom Service in the Guardian's\u000a      A Guide to Contemporary Classical Music (2012): `Few composers face\u000a      up to the cultural, creative, and political responsibilities of the\u000a      freight of musical history as sensitively as Finnissy does &#8212; and few\u000a      composers working today have managed to connect contemporary music's\u000a      expressive power as convincingly with its critical, intellectual\u000a      potential' [5.11].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research by Professor Michael Finnissy at the University Southampton into\u000a      the development of musical notation and works of extended duration has\u000a      resulted in the composition of more than ninety new musical works, which\u000a      have been publicly performed hundreds of times in classrooms, concert\u000a      halls, at international music festivals and on radio, by both amateurs and\u000a      professionals, to audiences totalling more than 700,000. Through concerts,\u000a      recordings, public lectures and media coverage, Finnissy has disseminated\u000a      his research insights and creative approach to a growing audience,\u000a      contributing to popular knowledge of contemporary music and compositional\u000a      practice, the democratisation of new music performance, and the\u000a      involvement of new music in social and political debate.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    University of Southampton\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Southampton (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Southampton","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007158}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"4930956","Name":"Boston"},{"GeoNamesId":"2759794","Name":"Amsterdam"},{"GeoNamesId":"3143244","Name":"Oslo"},{"GeoNamesId":"6077243","Name":"Montréal"},{"GeoNamesId":"2800931","Name":"Bruges"}],"References":"\u000a    Finnissy's catalogue includes more than 325 works for a wide range of\u000a      instrumental (solo, chamber, orchestral) and vocal forces, published by\u000a      organisations including Universal Edition; United Music Publishers; Oxford\u000a      University Press; and Composers Edition.

This study focuses on his\u000a      research into notation and `extended duration' and highlights his\u000a      engagement with contemporary music performance practice and wider cultural\u000a      critique.\u000a    Finnissy's work draws attention to the significance of notation beyond\u000a      utility. He employs notational practices featuring complex rhythms,\u000a      microtones and a high degree of detail [3.1,3.4-3.6]. The\u000a      underlying motivation is largely expressive: complexity provides\u000a      interpretative stimulation, which is needed in a post-tonal context\u000a      stripped of an aural tradition informing the notation (he has referred to\u000a      it as a form of `notated rubato'). His approach combines and extends a\u000a      range of practices, including those of the late Romantic piano repertory\u000a      (e.g. Busoni, Godowksy); Modernist approaches (e.g. Schoenberg and\u000a      Boulez); and Experimental and graphic-score innovations (e.g. Cage and\u000a      Bussoti).\u000a    He has explored how information is communicated from composer to\u000a      performer, for example in his Second and Third String Quartets [3.1].\u000a      The compositional process involved extensive work with the Kreutzer\u000a      Quartet, and the interaction between composer and performers was itself\u000a      the subject of ethnographic research resulting in published articles and a\u000a      digital resource. Insights included the revelation of the tension that can\u000a      exist between notation used to prescribe a specific sound and its\u000a      potential for diverging interpretations, contributing to better\u000a      understanding of the interplay of composer intentions and\u000a      composer-performer interactions than can be ascertained merely from notes\u000a      and instructions on the page.\u000a    Finnissy has developed other forms of notational practice in works for\u000a      amateur musicians [3.2,3.3]. For example, Molly-House, for\u000a      musicians of mixed ability, contains two sets of pages to be performed in\u000a      any order. One uses aspects of graphic notation and incorporates\u000a      electronic gadgets (hairdryers, drills, vibrators); the other is\u000a      conventionally notated and based on Handel arias. Through an accessible\u000a      mode of notation Finnissy both creates complex sonic and aesthetic results\u000a      and generates a `community' in which players with differing levels of\u000a      expertise can creatively co-exist.\u000a    Finnissy has written several `extended duration' works since 1999. He\u000a      describes the sense of time in his five-hour solo piano work The\u000a        History of Photography of Sound [3.4] for example, as being\u000a      like a painter scaling up a postage-stamp design to fill the side of a\u000a      building. Such time scales engage perception and memory in novel ways,\u000a      especially in his use of cinematic editing techniques to unfold different\u000a      musical `narratives' and trajectories over extended periods.\u000a    The History of Photography in Sound also considers how we\u000a      understand and misunderstand historical and cultural imagery through\u000a      juxtaposing and combining disparate musical practices such as South\u000a      African children's songs, Mozart and 1940s popular music. Similarly,\u000a      Finnissy's The Transgressive Gospel [3.4] weaves together\u000a      passages from St Mark's gospel, Tyndale's New Testament and Rimbaud's\u000a      poetry with music alluding to Bach, Beethoven, Coptic Chant and American\u000a      spirituals in a 120-minute exploration of Christ's Passion. Ivan Hewett (Telegraph)\u000a      described how he keeps all these influences `in play at once, but just out\u000a      of sight, trembling under the surface of his own musical language. His\u000a      piece is a model of integrity, which is why it is so powerfully moving.'\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44201","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Cochrane's contribution to public knowledge of the importance of the\u000a      Birmingham Repertory Theatre dates back as far as the 1980s. (Her doctoral\u000a      research initiated the move of the theatre's archive to Birmingham Central\u000a      Library, where it has been conserved and made publicly accessible.\u000a      Throughout the 1990s she led annual public day schools as part of\u000a      Birmingham's annual city-wide Towards the Millennium Festival.\u000a      Core elements of her published histories of the Rep featured in season\u000a      programmes from 1994-9 and, most recently, were included in programmes\u000a      launching the centenary celebrations). When the Rep closed in 2011 for a\u000a      multi-million pound redevelopment as part of Birmingham's new Central\u000a      Library, Cochrane provided a century-long time-line for display on\u000a      hoardings around the building. Since 2008, she has regularly given invited\u000a      talks about the Rep's history to locally-based groups such as the\u000a      Birmingham National Trust Association, Central Birmingham Soroptimist\u000a      International Club, University of the Third Age, the Shakespeare Club of\u000a      Stratford-upon-Avon and to the Friends of Dymock Poets Society. The\u000a      theatre now regularly directs requests for talks to her.\u000a    In 2011, Cochrane took part in informal consultations on how best to\u000a      develop community participation in the Rep's Rep100 celebrations\u000a      and to suggest ways in which the Rep's often radical, but historically\u000a      `top-down' contribution to British theatre could stimulate public\u000a      engagement and the interest of community volunteers. Cochrane proposed key\u000a      individuals and events to be highlighted within the chronologies of the\u000a      four distinctive themes that shaped the Rep's successful &#163;175,000 Heritage\u000a      Lottery Fund bid to create a digital archive which would conserve the\u000a      theatre's heritage and permit wider access and understanding (www.birmingham-rep.co.uk).\u000a      Her support provided accurate historical information to REP100\u000a      project leader, Jenny Smith and exhibition curator, Gwendolen Whittaker\u000a      which proved essential to successful creation of the REP100\u000a      touring exhibition and accompanying catalogue. Cochrane assisted Whittaker\u000a      in identifying the provenance of artefacts for exhibition and clarified\u000a      the origins of original material held by Birmingham City Museum &amp; Art\u000a      Gallery, including the context for a series of paintings by Dame Laura\u000a      Knight of Rep performances from the 1930s to 1950s. She brokered an\u000a      invitation from the Bristol Theatre Collection for Whittaker to access the\u000a      Manders and Mitcheson archive, which contains additional artefacts. She\u000a      then wrote brief introductions to each of the four themes illustrated in\u000a      the exhibition catalogue &#8212; `Station Street to Stratford via Malvern';\u000a      `Drama Queens'; `The Detail's in the Design'; and `Hidden Histories' &#8212; and\u000a      edited and contributed to extended captions accompanying illustrations.\u000a      From January 2013, Cochrane was credited formally as REP100's\u000a      Historical Advisor. The exhibition launched at the Old Birmingham\u000a      Repertory theatre in February 2013 and was then mounted at Birmingham's\u000a      Grosvenor G Casino (REP100's sponsors), the Royal Shakespeare Theatre,\u000a      Malvern Library (as part of the Malvern Festival) and a further 16 local\u000a      Birmingham libraries. To date the total number of people accessing Old\u000a      Rep-related activities is 1,504. 5000 copies of the catalogue were printed\u000a      and Cochrane continues to provide advice for the expanded exhibition to be\u000a      mounted in September 2013 in the new public space shared between the\u000a      refurbished theatre and the new Library of Birmingham. Anticipated total\u000a      visitor numbers to the exhibition by November 2013 is estimated at 10,000.\u000a    At the request of the Rep, Cochrane took part in a BBC1 Inside Out\u000a        West Midlands feature broadcast in time for its actual 100th\u000a      birthday. On discovery of an apparently handwritten script belonging to\u000a      Laurence Olivier dating from 1927, she was interviewed for The Times.\u000a    The two-day REP100 Weekender event held in March 2013 at the\u000a      `Old' Birmingham Repertory Theatre was designed to appeal to diverse\u000a      publics, from local people wishing to recover memories of the theatre and\u000a      its legacy to academic and non-academic theatre specialists. Cochrane\u000a      worked closely with the project leaders to create a lively accessible\u000a      programme, acting as co-ordinating Chair throughout. The first day focused\u000a      on the theatre's history and heritage; the second, taking Cochrane's theme\u000a      of `Drama Queens,' concentrated on women's contribution to contemporary\u000a      theatre and began with Cochrane interviewing actor and writer Meera Syal.\u000a      There then followed a series of panels: the first comprised well-known\u000a      women playwrights including Bryony Lavery and Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti; the\u000a      second brought together actor and director Dame Janet Suzman with deigner\u000a      Pamela Howard and actors Shelley King and Lorna Laidlaw; the third\u000a      comprised key executives and directors including Kate Horton, Deputy\u000a      Executive Director of the National Theatre and Vikki Heywood, former\u000a      Executive Director of the RSC. In all, the Weekender attracted an\u000a      audience of some 165.\u000a    Rep 100 celebrations attracted extensive national media coverage\u000a      including features and\/or interviews in the Daily Telegraph, The Guardian,\u000a      The Independent, The Stage, BBC News, BBC Inside Out and Whatsonstage.com.\u000a      Additionally, there has been widespread regional coverage including\u000a      coverage on BBC Midlands Today and BBC Radio WM, and in the Birmingham\u000a      Post, the Birmingham Mail, the Birmingham Post &amp; Mail, the Shropshire\u000a      Star, Edge Magazine and Birmingham Life.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The case study describes impact associated with Prof Claire Cochrane's\u000a      twenty years' research into the history of the Birmingham Repertory\u000a      Theatre, one of the UK's largest and most historically important regional\u000a      producing theatres.

Her 1993 monograph, drawn from\u000a      her doctoral research in the 1980s, was the first detailed analysis of the\u000a      early development of Birmingham Rep's radical innovations in Shakespeare\u000a      production which led, in the 1920s, to the highly influential productions\u000a      of Shakespeare in modern dress. Her subsequent research into the history\u000a      of the company from 1962 until 2002 produced arguably the most\u000a      comprehensive and in-depth exploration of the artistic, managerial and\u000a      financial history of a major regional theatre to be published in recent\u000a      years. In addition to her analysis of the means by which Birmingham Rep\u000a      became a leading regional centre for the nurturing of new playwriting,\u000a      there was a parallel focus on the theatre's promotion of the work of Black\u000a      British and British Asian actors and playwrights. Cochrane subsequently\u000a      expanded this area of her research into developments in Birmingham as a\u000a      whole since the 1970s, and then undertook comparative studies of similar\u000a      initiatives at Nottingham Playhouse and Leicester Haymarket Theatre.\u000a    Cochrane's research into Birmingham Rep has covered a complete century\u000a      and thereby provided a basis for the wide-ranging knowledge of changing\u000a      economic and social trends in British theatre which led to her most recent\u000a      monograph. Informed by her growing interest in cultural geography and\u000a      social economics, this mapped the history of theatre as artistic and\u000a      industrial practice across all four nations of the United Kingdom\u000a      throughout the twentieth century. A significant strand of the book, which\u000a      explores the effect of demographic change brought about as a result of\u000a      migration from countries once part of the British empire, was stimulated\u000a      by her research into Birmingham Rep's response to the growth of an\u000a      increasingly diverse local population within its immediate urban context.\u000a      An understanding of third sector status &#8212; which requires subsidised\u000a      theatre managements constantly to manoeuvre between not-for-profit\u000a      idealism and commercial imperatives &#8212; is another strand, grounded in\u000a      Cochrane's study of Birmingham Rep's financial history; this has opened up\u000a      a new area of economic enquiry which is proving increasingly influential\u000a      within the academy. As a regional theatre historian Cochrane's work\u000a      interrogates the unequal cultural and economic relations between the\u000a      metropolitan core and the regional periphery. Her most recent research\u000a      into the work of the Belgrade Theatre in Coventry, and the consequences of\u000a      its history as part of post-war urban regeneration, is further evidence\u000a      of her continuing preoccupation with the importance of the regional\u000a      experience for both theatre-makers and theatre-goers.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44391","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Lingas founded Cappella Romana (CR) in 1991.

CR generated revenue from earned income\u000d\u000a      (tickets, hiring fees, commercial recordings and licensing), individual\u000d\u000a      donations (232 households in the 2012\/13 financial year) and grants from\u000d\u000a      governmental agencies and private foundations.\u000d\u000a    Lingas' research has been fundamental to CR's operation throughout the\u000d\u000a      period, shaping its concert programming of ancient and modern repertoire,\u000d\u000a      informing its approaches to vocal performance practice and guiding its\u000d\u000a      educational and outreach efforts to cultivate Orthodox musical traditions\u000d\u000a      in both public and ecclesiastical settings. CR has thereby served members\u000d\u000a      of ethnic communities (Greeks, Russians, etc., whether in their homelands\u000d\u000a      or in diaspora) and converts to Orthodoxy wishing to preserve and transmit\u000d\u000a      their musical heritage. At the same time it has promoted widely\u000d\u000a      experiences and understanding of Orthodox musical traditions amongst\u000d\u000a      people from other cultural and spiritual backgrounds. These have included\u000d\u000a      individuals drawn to the history, aesthetics and spiritual qualities of\u000d\u000a      Eastern Orthodox art and liturgy, as well as devotees of classical and\u000d\u000a      world genres of vocal ensemble music. Recognising this, Metropolitan\u000d\u000a      Gerasimos, Greek Orthodox Metropolitan of San Francisco, wrote in a 2011\u000d\u000a      letter that the ensemble 'is more than just a choral group; they are\u000d\u000a        ambassadors of our Holy Orthodox faith through music'. Glen W.\u000d\u000a      Bowersock offered another perspective in The New York Review of Books,\u000d\u000a      noting that 'The success of the contemporary Cappella Romana chamber\u000d\u000a        ensemble, ably directed by Alexander Lingas of London, introduces modern\u000d\u000a        listeners to the sounds that filled the churches of Byzantium no less\u000d\u000a        than the light of their lamps' (25\/9\/08).

The series gives the ensemble a laboratory to\u000d\u000a        expand its repertory before a loyal 'home' audience and therefore often\u000d\u000a        includes world or American premieres. A lecture precedes nearly every\u000d\u000a        concert and approximately 25% of events feature guest artists. Audience\u000d\u000a        diversity is reflected in the range of media outlets praising the\u000d\u000a        performances. Describing a concert of Byzantine Christmas chant, Rod\u000d\u000a        Parke of The Seattle Gay News (1\/15\/10) wrote 'the passionate\u000d\u000a          intensity with which they sang, combined with the exotic nature of\u000d\u000a          this unfamiliar music, had at times an almost erotic feel. To ears\u000d\u000a          that gradually opened to the unaccustomed harmonies and pitches, it\u000d\u000a          was anything but dull.' In The Oregonian (the main\u000d\u000a        Portland newspaper), James McQuillen noted that during a 2013\u000d\u000a        performance of Rachmaninoff's Divine Liturgy 'the sensual\u000d\u000a          appeal was inescapable, and it carried through the evening with\u000d\u000a          crystal clarity, gentle cadences and phrases as natural as breath'\u000d\u000a        (12\/1\/13).\u000d\u000a      \u000aTouring.

Listeners have often found CR\u000d\u000a        performances of previously unheard early Orthodox music revelatory. Upon\u000d\u000a        hearing medieval Constantinopolitan chant sung at Stanford in the\u000d\u000a        acoustics of a virtual Hagia Sophia in 2013, Jason Victor Serinus of the\u000d\u000a        San Francisco Classical Voice wrote 'It is impossible to\u000d\u000a          describe the experience objectively....

The RAA also licensed tracks for\u000d\u000a        the audio guide to its exhibition, the attendance for which was 342,726.\u000d\u000a      Praise by professional reviewers for CR's discs of unfamiliar\u000d\u000a        pre-modern music has been noted above, but similar themes appear also in\u000d\u000a        published reviews of contemporary works, e.g., 'Richard\u000d\u000a          Toensing...has written a spellbinding Christmas choral concerto in\u000d\u000a          traditional Orthodox style....stunningly realized by Cappella Romana',\u000d\u000a        Kyle MacMillan, Denver Post (7\/12\/2008); and 'The liturgical\u000d\u000a          music of Greek-America composers is barely known outside the USA...the\u000d\u000a          addition of this English-texted Liturgy...by Peter Michaelides...is\u000d\u000a          very welcome indeed. ...Cappella Romana... produce what I imagine to\u000d\u000a          be an ideal performance of Michaelides's music', Ivan Moody, Gramophone\u000d\u000a        (October 2010). Fans of CR recordings have communicated their enthusiasm\u000d\u000a        through both traditional and social media. For example in 2008 science\u000d\u000a        fiction author Neal Stephenson wrote in a playlist for The New York\u000d\u000a          Times (17\/9\/2008) that 'My favorite style of chant is\u000d\u000a          Byzantine, which I learned about by attending concerts by...Cappella\u000d\u000a          Romana.

In addition to\u000d\u000a        pre-concert talks, CR members regularly offer lectures and workshops on\u000d\u000a        Orthodox liturgical music open to the general public. The range of\u000d\u000a        organisations for which Lingas himself has presented such events\u000d\u000a        includes the Royal Academy of Arts (2008), Stanford University (2009 and\u000d\u000a        2013), the Canterbury Gregorian Music Society (2010), the Yale Institute\u000d\u000a        of Sacred Music (2011), the Axion Estin Foundation of New York (2008,\u000d\u000a        2010 and 2012), the Border Marches Early Music Forum (2012) and the\u000d\u000a        Hellenic Centre of London (2013, excerpts later broadcast on Hellenic\u000d\u000a        TV). A participant describing the 2010 Canterbury workshop later wrote:\u000d\u000a        'Alexander showed that both Gregorian Chant and Eastern Chant were\u000d\u000a          historic musical forms with a living tradition today. ...Our great\u000d\u000a          triumph was actually reading and singing the whole Orthodox Saturday\u000d\u000a          Evening Vespers from start to finish.'\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    CR also works directly with Orthodox churches to serve their pastoral\u000d\u000a      needs. It does so in part by offering its skills and repertories in\u000d\u000a      worship, singing for services in such locations as London (2009), San\u000d\u000a      Francisco (2011), St Vladimir's Seminary (Crestwood, NY), Los Angeles\u000d\u000a      (2012) and Athens (2013). CR's flagship pastoral project is a cooperative\u000d\u000a      venture with the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Thyateira and Great Britain\u000d\u000a      to set its English liturgical texts to traditional Byzantine chant.

Leventis Foundation, the\u000d\u000a      National Forum of Greek Orthodox Church Musicians (USA), the Virginia H.\u000d\u000a      Farah Foundation and the [Anglican-Orthodox] Fellowship of St Alban and\u000d\u000a      St Sergius. Its first milestone was the release of the 2008 Divine\u000d\u000a        Liturgy mentioned above, a two-disc recording accompanied by a\u000d\u000a      40-page booklet with an introduction by Greek Orthodox Archbishop\u000d\u000a      Gregorios of Thyateira and Great Britain, in which he writes 'I commend\u000d\u000a        it...with the confidence that it will increase the understanding and\u000d\u000a        appreciation of both the spirituality of Orthodox worship and the\u000d\u000a        heights of musical expression to which its chanting aspires.' Its\u000d\u000a      musical settings were subsequently released as free PDFs in both Byzantine\u000d\u000a      neumes and Western staff notation, facilitating transmission of the\u000d\u000a      musical patrimony of Byzantium across notational, linguistic, ethnic and\u000d\u000a      religious boundaries through their use in liturgical and educational\u000d\u000a      contexts such as those listed above. In recognition of his scholarly and\u000d\u000a      pastoral work, Lingas received the highest musical award of the Greek\u000d\u000a      Orthodox Archdiocese of America in 2010.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Singing has been integral to the practice of Eastern Orthodox\u000d\u000a      Christianity since antiquity. Its vast medieval repertories of Byzantine\u000d\u000a      and Slavic plainchant gradually developed into native musical traditions\u000d\u000a      spread across a geographic arc from Southern Italy to Alaska. Thanks to\u000d\u000a      emigration and missionary work, forms of Orthodox singing are now also\u000d\u000a      cultivated in diasporic and missionary communities throughout the world.\u000d\u000a      Despite the historical importance of Byzantine chant as a sibling to\u000d\u000a      Gregorian chant, the richness of the historical record and the vibrancy of\u000d\u000a      contemporary Eastern Christian musical practice, these musical traditions\u000d\u000a      remain largely unstudied and poorly known in the geographic and cultural\u000d\u000a      West, in part due to transmission in non-Western languages and forms of\u000d\u000a      musical notation. Dr Alexander Lingas' research undertaken at City\u000d\u000a      University London has nourished the global dissemination, understanding\u000d\u000a      and enjoyment of these music traditions. Building on scholarship that\u000d\u000a      embraces music philology, performance practice and liturgiology, Lingas'\u000d\u000a      research has had a broad international societal impact, achieved largely\u000d\u000a      through his role as Artistic Director of Cappella Romana, an\u000d\u000a      American-based vocal ensemble with an international reputation for\u000d\u000a      promoting Eastern Orthodox music. Through encounters with music that was\u000d\u000a      often previously unknown or inaccessible, listeners from a variety of\u000d\u000a      cultural and religious backgrounds have discovered the musical traditions\u000d\u000a      of Eastern Christianity to be as historically significant, artistically\u000d\u000a      rich and spiritually profound as its better-known masterpieces of\u000d\u000a      iconography and architecture. This has in turn helped to broaden the\u000d\u000a      repertories of early and contemporary vocal music in Western Europe and\u000d\u000a      America to include the musical inheritance of Byzantium and its Slavic\u000d\u000a      commonwealth. Through his research Lingas has also supported the creation\u000d\u000a      of new forms of artistic expression and reconstructed older forms of\u000d\u000a      Eastern Orthodox sacred music; influenced attitudes and perceptions of\u000d\u000a      musicians, scholars, viewers, readers and listeners on an international\u000d\u000a      basis; enriched cultural lives and aesthetic experiences in a range of\u000d\u000a      performance and multimedia contexts; enhanced knowledge and understanding\u000d\u000a      among different beneficiaries through the close integration of performance\u000d\u000a      and educational work; and contributed significantly to the preservation,\u000d\u000a      renewal, interpretation and dissemination of Eastern Orthodox Christian\u000d\u000a      musical heritage.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    City University London\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"City University, London","InstitutionName":"City University, London","PeerGroup":"C","Region":"London","UKPRN":10001478}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"5128581","Name":"New York City"},{"GeoNamesId":"5879092","Name":"Alaska"},{"GeoNamesId":"6173331","Name":"Vancouver"},{"GeoNamesId":"5809844","Name":"Seattle"},{"GeoNamesId":"5368361","Name":"Los Angeles"},{"GeoNamesId":"4921868","Name":"Indiana"},{"GeoNamesId":"2849483","Name":"Regensburg"},{"GeoNamesId":"5391959","Name":"San Francisco"},{"GeoNamesId":"4930956","Name":"Boston"},{"GeoNamesId":"5744337","Name":"Oregon"},{"GeoNamesId":"264371","Name":"Athens"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a1.

His essay is a pleasure to read,\u000d\u000a        informative, and clearly set forth.' Writing for the same journal\u000d\u000a      (2009\/10), C&#233;cile Morrison (CNRS, Paris and Dumbarton Oaks) noted that\u000d\u000a      among chapters 'presenting their respective complex and wide subject in\u000d\u000a        as clear a form as possible' this was 'a task achieved\u000d\u000a        excellently for instance by A.

There are four major dimensions to the impact:\u000a    a) Educational work with schools &#8212; The Shahnameh Project: Between\u000a      November 2011 and May 2012 Nooshin initiated and led a collaborative\u000a      outreach project with the Education and Community Department at the London\u000a      Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO). The project also involved one of the LPO's\u000a      partner organisations, the Bridge Project (an organisation providing free\u000a      music tuition to children who might not otherwise have the opportunity to\u000a      learn an instrument). The Shahnameh Project introduced key stage 2\u000a      children (ages 7 to 11) to Iranian music and culture through several\u000a      workshops and teacher-led activities, including working with composer\u000a      David Bruce on a specially-commissioned piece for orchestra; Iranian\u000a      instruments and narrator; and Prince Zal and the Simorgh, which\u000a      was premiered at two LPO BrightSparks schools' concerts at the Royal\u000a      Festival Hall on 23rd May 2012. The LPO reaches about 15,000\u000a      children annually through its BrightSparks concerts. The majority of them\u000a      have not previously experienced a live orchestral performance. The story\u000a      on which the piece was based was selected by Nooshin for its contemporary\u000a      social relevance. The performances involved 53 key stage 1 (ages 5 to 7)\u000a      violinists from two south London primary schools (Ashmole and Jessop);\u000a      Iranian musicians Arash Moradi and Fariborz Kiani; storyteller Sally Pomme\u000a      Clayton; and members of City's Middle Eastern Music Ensemble. The concerts\u000a      were attended by 4,658 key stage 2 children and 75 teachers. Initial\u000a      workshops were held at Ashmole and Jessop Schools in the autumn of 2011,\u000a      involving around 120 children, during which Bruce developed initial ideas\u000a      for his piece. He worked closely with Nooshin, learning about Iranian\u000a      music styles, structures and processes, particularly in relation to the\u000a      role of improvisation. Bruce is a successful British composer with an\u000a      international profile whose previous work with the LPO and recent\u000a      children's opera production at the Royal Opera House made him particularly\u000a      suitable for the project. The school sessions included whole school\u000a      assemblies at which the Iranian musicians, City music students and\u000a      storyteller Sally Pomme Clayton performed, introducing Iranian music and\u000a      culture through one of the stories from the epic Shahnameh. The\u000a      majority of children attending the assemblies had not seen or heard the\u000a      Iranian instruments before. Nooshin also wrote a Teachers' Guide,\u000a      introducing Iranian modes, rhythms and instruments as well as broader\u000a      cultural issues and including practical classroom activities. The Guide\u000a      was available through the LPO website, together with relevant sound\u000a      examples. Additionally, two INSET training sessions, led by Nooshin and\u000a      Patrick Bailey (LPO Education and Community Department) and attended by 35\u000a      teachers, were held in April 2012 to assist teachers in preparing pupils\u000a      for the concerts.\u000a    The reach and significance of the impact can be judged from the\u000a      attendance figures, qualitative feedback from post-concert teacher\u000a      questionnaires and interviews with the Bridge Project and the LPO\u000a      Community and Education Department. Teachers provided qualitative feedback\u000a      on how the children benefited from the concert, workshops and classroom\u000a      activities, for example: `The children enjoyed hearing the story set to\u000a        music and left humming various tunes. They noticed the Iranian\u000a        instruments and benefited from seeing real live musicians.' and `The\u000a        Bruce piece served as a model for pieces the children put together the\u000a        following week. The children's performances were of a high standard, no\u000a        doubt as a result of the previous week's visit to the Royal Festival\u000a        Hall.'\u000a    The Teachers' Guide and INSET sessions received similarly positive\u000a      feedback, highlighting ways in which the project facilitated\u000a      cross-curricular work with subjects such as mathematics; art; literacy;\u000a      geography; personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) and citizenship\u000a      education, as well as developing music-specific skills in listening,\u000a      performing and composing: `My colleague and I LOVED the Teachers'\u000a        Guide; coupled with the INSET training session. It is possibly the best\u000a        resource we've ever been provided with for an educational visit. I\u000a        played audio clips that were recommended in the pack, did the activities\u000a        based around the map and Iran's location and talked about oral stories\u000a        and the children also painted their own Simorghs.'; `The concert and\u000a        resource pack provided a rich `text' as a basis for our Literacy work.\u000a        It exposed children to a new culture. Their listening skills were\u000a        developed by using Prince Zal's theme to understand how a character\u000a        changes over the course of a story. And the concert inspired the\u000a        children in their own music-making. The information about the\u000a        instruments and drumming rhythms were useful in music and maths lessons.';\u000a      'We used the drumming patterns from the resources pack in a Mathematics\u000a        lesson, working out which numbers could be made by adding strings of 2s\u000a        and 3s. Lots of children subsequently identified the concert as their\u000a        favourite trip of the year!'; `The week before the concert we\u000a        used the story in our Literacy lessons. The children were really engaged\u000a        with the story and produced some really good writing. This meant that\u000a        they were familiar with both the story and music, which enhanced their\u000a        enjoyment and engagement at the concert.'; `The background work\u000a        to Iranian rhythms was an excellent introduction and proved a good basis\u000a        for percussive activities in school. We composed our own music to the\u000a        Prince Zal story using the Iranian modes and rhythms. Great fun!'\u000a        and `The children created their own compositions based on the some of\u000a        the rhythms they had heard using ideas that we were shown in the\u000a        teachers' session. The music produced was very good.' Pupil\u000a        responses were equally positive: `From the story I learnt that you\u000a        cannot be cross with someone forever. You need to forgive. If you have\u000a        something you should be grateful for it because you may regret it if\u000a        you're not.' (PSHE and citizenship education); `I liked the daf\u000a        best. It was noisy. I wish they would come to our school.' The\u000a        Bridge Project also reported that: `This was a very successful project\u000a        on many levels. It was good for the children to work with adults and\u000a        other young people outside their sphere; it's an encouraging validation\u000a        to have young professionals come into their school and invest time in\u000a        them and to have a piece written especially for them. The real value of\u000a        having City University involved was bringing diverse elements to the\u000a        collaboration in a way that we haven't seen before and which provided so\u000a        many different types of role models for the children.' They also\u000a        commented on the value of the project to the children in performing in a\u000a        professional setting on stage at the Royal Festival Hall and being able to\u000a      `experience making music in such a large ensemble and to feel that\u000a        they're contributing something of worth. For these children from these\u000a        schools and at this age it's the kind of memory that will remain with\u000a        them forever. They will also identify these experiences, and the people\u000a        they are making music with, with Iran and as they get older and engage\u000a        more in current affairs that will be for them a really positive memory\u000a        of things Iranian.'\u000a    Composer David Bruce provided further evidence of the impact of the\u000a        project in the form of personal testimony: `The project helped spread\u000a        ideas and understanding about Iranian culture and music to everyone\u000a        involved. From talking with Laudan and reading the materials she gave me\u000a        I gained a more fine-grained understanding of the music of the region. I\u000a        also gained understanding of some of the techniques of Iranian classical\u000a        music, the concepts of gusheh and dastgah and the way a scale might, for\u000a        example, emphasize a particular pitch other than the root.' Bruce\u000a        has since drawn on these ideas further in his compositional work,\u000a        including in the piece `Cut the Rug', commissioned by Yo Yo Ma and the\u000a        Silk Road Ensemble and premiered in New York's Carnegie Hall on 16th\u000a        October 2013.\u000a    b) Print media. Nooshin has contributed to several high-profile\u000a        publications aimed at the general public, including The Rough Guide to\u000a        World Music: Africa &amp; Middle East, London: Rough Guides, 2006\u000a        (`Iran: The Art of Ornament', pp.519-32); Songlines: The World Music\u000a        Magazine (two features and 15 CD reviews since 2008; average\u000a        international circulation 20,000 per issue between 2008 and 2013); and The\u000a        Middle East in London magazine (circulation 800 per issue). Nooshin\u000a        has also written CD liner notes for prominent Iranian vocalists Mohammad\u000a        Reza Shajarian and Shahram Nazeri (Without You: Masters of Persian\u000a        Music, World Village USA, 468011, 2002; Faryad: Masters of\u000a        Persian Music, World Village USA, 468023, 2006; and Through\u000a        Eternity: Persian Devotional Music, Sounds True USA, STAM112D,\u000a        1999). All of these came about through invitation and Nooshin's recognised\u000a        expertise in the field. Those published before 2008 are still on sale and\u000a        in wide public circulation, both in the UK and internationally.\u000a    c) Broadcast media and performances. In February 2008 Nooshin\u000a       appeared by invitation on the BBC Radio 3 programme World Routes\u000a       (average audience 88,000, source: RAJAR) reviewing current Iranian music\u000a       CDs. Her research has also raised the profile of musicians about whom she\u000a       has written, particularly outside Iran, thus impacting on CD sales and\u000a       audience-generation. Many musicians have acknowledged this. Iran's\u000a       foremost pop group, Arian Band, posted information on Nooshin's edited\u000a       volume, which includes a chapter on their music, on their website\u000a       (www.arianmusic.com\/en).\u000a       Prominent musician Kayhan Kalhor has used text from CD liner notes by\u000a       Nooshin on his website (www.kayhankalhor.net\/).\u000a    d) Other impact activities include: Convening a festival of Music\u000a      in Middle Eastern Cinema, including screenings at the Tricycle Theatre,\u000a      Kilburn, London (May 2011, funded by LCACE and Iran Heritage Foundation\u000a      (IHF)); advising IHF on music for a promotional film by Sogand Bahram\u000a      (March 2011); speaking at and chairing sessions for the London Borough of\u000a      Kensington and Chelsea's Nur Festival of contemporary Middle Eastern and\u000a      North African arts (autumn 2012 and 2013); advising film-maker Andrew\u000a      Smith on a film about female singers in Iran (2013); public workshops and\u000a      concerts with City's Middle Eastern Ensemble (2008 to 2013) at venues\u000a      including the British Museum (part of Magic of Persia's Educational Family\u000a      Weekends), BBC Maida Vale studios (BBC Symphony Orchestra Persepolis\u000a      Project) and the October Gallery. Most of these activities came about by\u000a      invitation. Iran Heritage Foundation and Magic of Persia are the primary\u000a      organisations promoting wider public understanding of Iranian arts,\u000a      culture and history in the UK. Nooshin's involvement in their activities\u000a      has contributed positively to their work in this area.\u000a    This research has supported the creation of new forms of artistic\u000a      expression linked to Iranian music; influenced attitudes and perceptions\u000a      of musicians, scholars, readers and listeners; enriched the cultural lives\u000a      and aesthetic experiences of children and adults in a range of performance\u000a      and multimedia contexts; enhanced knowledge and understanding in different\u000a      educational environments; and contributed significantly to the\u000a      preservation, renewal and interpretation of Iranian musical heritage. The\u000a      impact thus relates to several broad areas, including benefits to cultural\u000a      life, education, economic prosperity, public discourse and civil society;\u000a      disseminated through a number of channels including educational work with\u000a      schools; print and broadcast media; consultancy work for a range of\u000a      organisations and festivals; and performance work in a variety of\u000a      contexts.\u000a    Beneficiaries of the activities detailed include: 1) school\u000a      children and teachers involved in the Shahnameh Project; 2) BBC Radio 3\u000a      listeners; 3) musicians, including those whose work has been promoted\u000a      through the underpinning research and activities listed; members of the\u000a      LPO; Iranian musicians involved in the Shahnameh Project; and composer\u000a      David Bruce; 4) readers of magazines and books directed at lay audiences;\u000a      5) publishers, record companies and others benefiting economically from\u000a      audio and other media outputs; 6) purchasers of music CDs; 7) audiences\u000a      attending public lectures and film screenings; 8) film-makers: Sogand\u000a      Bahram, Andrew Smith and those whose work was screened at the 2012 film\u000a      festival; and 9) Iranians in the UK, through better public understanding\u000a      of their music and culture. This is a community whose self-esteem is\u000a      severely affected by British media representations of Iran. One response\u000a      by a teacher following the Shahnameh Project points to this: `We had an\u000a        Iranian pupil, and her family were very excited about the chance to talk\u000a        about their heritage. She was able to bring her own versions of the\u000a        stories to read to the class.' Although this aspect of impact is\u000a      often subtle and not easy to evidence, the various manifestations of\u000a      Nooshin's research are nevertheless extremely important in determining how\u000a      communities view themselves and their places in British society, thereby\u000a      aiding integration and more positive community relations in a\u000a      multi-cultural society.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Music at City University London has long demonstrated a commitment to\u000a      ethnomusicological outreach. This is particularly manifested in the\u000a      extensive research of Dr Laudan Nooshin which has facilitated access to\u000a      and understanding of Iranian music and culture in Britain and\u000a      internationally. The primary channels through which impact has arisen from\u000a      this research comprise: educational work with schools; a wide range of\u000a      print and broadcast media; consultancy work for a range of organisations\u000a      and festivals; and performance work in a variety of different contexts.\u000a      Overall, the impact of Nooshin's research has enhanced knowledge of a\u000a      rich, historically-rooted culture and acted as a counterbalance to the\u000a      often negative representation of Iranian culture in the British and\u000a      international media.

The research has involved several periods of fieldwork in\u000a      Iran, extensive work with Iranian communities in the UK and analysis of\u000a      digitally-mediated Iranian music, generating insights into both\u000a      contemporary and historic forms of Iranian music cultures in Iran and\u000a      around the world. It has focused on two main areas: 1) creative processes\u000a      in Iranian classical music, specifically how musicians conceive\u000a      creativity, the nature of the creative process itself and the relationship\u000a      between improvisational and compositional practice; and 2) popular music\u000a      and youth culture in Iran, specifically the ways in which popular music\u000a      has, since the 1979 Revolution, served as an arena for negotiating ideas\u000a      about national identity, hegemony and resistance and youth empowerment.\u000a      Nooshin's research into Iranian classical music is the first to engage\u000a      perspectives from critical theory and postcolonial studies and to examine\u000a      the relationships of power embedded in the musical system and its central\u000a      repertoire. Her work on Iranian popular music has also contributed\u000a      significantly to the development of what was previously a largely\u000a      unresearched area.

They informed an ongoing\u000a      intellectual property and copyright debate as the industry attempted to\u000a      adjust to unprecedented changes in music recording, sales and purchasing.\u000a    The most immediate impact lay in plugging significant information gaps.\u000a      UK Music, which supports the music industry through policy and research,\u000a      commissioned the work on behalf of its constituent members, who are: the\u000a      Performing Rights Society for Music (PRS), Phonographic Performance\u000a      Limited (PPL), British Phonographic Industry (BPI), British Academy of\u000a      Songwriters, Composers and Authors (BASCA), Music Publishers Association\u000a      (MPA), Music Producers Guild (MPG), Music Managers Forum (MMF), Musicians\u000a      Union (MU), and the Association of Independent Music (AIM). These nine\u000a      organisations, which are the engines of the UK music industry, engage with\u000a      government in crafting policy on intellectual property, copyright\u000a      infringement and other important legislative areas for industry growth. As\u000a      each organisation is represented on UK Music's Research Steering Group,\u000a      the entire membership was closely involved in ensuring that the work would\u000a      serve their interests and needs. They also discussed and analysed the\u000a      data, and its implications for business decisions, policy and education.\u000a    The research informed UK Music's position on policy issues and the design\u000a      of copyright education resources, in turn informing its members' business\u000a      development and licensing teams. UK Music's policy advisers were\u000a      particularly interested in the changing spending patterns identified by\u000a      the report, and its senior policy advisor summed up the value of the\u000a      findings to the organisation:\u000a    The research involved the largest study to date of the attitudes and\u000a      practices of a very important age group in the UK, at a very crucial time\u000a      in the development of the market &#8212; and it was a very useful as well as an\u000a      innovative and illuminating piece of research. We used it. That's about as\u000a      much as you could ask for in research.\u000a    Music Industry: International\u000a    The first report was widely read by the major international record\u000a      labels, especially Universal Music (the largest music company in the\u000a      world), which circulated the research internally.\u000a    One example of its influence on an overseas music industry organisation\u000a      is the Songwriters Association of Canada (SAC), whose president was\u000a      particularly interested in the findings' implications for adapting to\u000a      changing listening preferences. He has stated that he was greatly\u000a      influenced by the `tremendous impact' of Hertfordshire's `groundbreaking\u000a      work', which inspired the SAC's own region-specific investigation of\u000a      piracy. Funded by the Ontario government and conducted across all of\u000a      Canada by Montreal-based research group CROP, the findings were well\u000a      publicised in the USA in particular.\u000a    `The Hertfordshire Study' is prominently cited in the SAC's `Proposal' &#8212;\u000a      its discussion, advocacy and lobbying document &#8212; which, according to the\u000a      organisation's website, has attracted `unprecedented interest'. The\u000a      Proposal's summary opens with an uncompromising proposition whose origins\u000a      clearly lie in Bahanovic and Collopy's findings:\u000a    Rather than continuing to engage in increasingly futile efforts to stop\u000a      people from using new technologies to share music, we . . . believe this\u000a      massive use of creators' work should be licensed just as live performances\u000a      and broadcasting, also initially considered infringement, were ultimately\u000a      licensed in the past.\u000a    Informing Legislators\u000a    Nationally\u000a    UK Music incorporated the research findings into its submissions to\u000a      government on legislative and policy matters. In June 2008, for example,\u000a      it presented the research at a meeting of the All-Party Parliamentary\u000a      Group on Music. According to UK Music's senior policy advisor, `the\u000a      meeting was very enlightening and invigorating' and the new data was `very\u000a      valuable to Parliamentarians'.\u000a    Indirect impact on government debate and policy making occurred via UK\u000a      Music's current and former chief executives, who often provide evidence to\u000a      various select committees; and through the organisation's policy\u000a      recommendations, which are regularly cited in Commons and Lords debates.\u000a      The organisation meets officials, MPs, advisers and ministers to discuss\u000a      policy issues affecting the music industry, and uses the Hertfordshire\u000a      findings in its numerous responses to consultations on copyright exemption\u000a      for private copying.\u000a    The 2008 report was quoted in a Department for Business, Enterprise and\u000a      Regulatory Reform consultation on peer-to-peer file sharing (2008), and in\u000a      the Digital Britain Report (2009), a significant government policy\u000a      document that detailed a strategic plan to secure Britain's place in the\u000a      vanguard of the global digital economy. Copyright was a central issue, and\u000a      Action 11 read: `The University of Hertfordshire research into attitudes\u000a      towards music and copyright by young people showed that only 10% of those\u000a      surveyed are currently deterred from file-sharing by a fear of being\u000a      caught. The current approach to civil enforcement is not working as well\u000a      as it needs to.'\u000a    As the Digital\u000a        Economy Act (2010) was one outcome of this report, MEIRG's research\u000a      therefore contributed to the government's decision to introduce\u000a      legislation to reduce unlawful file-sharing. The research was further\u000a      cited in the Strategic Advisory Board for Intellectual Property Policy's\u000a      report `Copycats?

UK Music made this commission based\u000a      on MEIRG's academic profile, and because the university's undergraduate\u000a      degree programme in Music and Entertainment Industry Management (MEIM) is\u000a      recognised by industry as the leading programme of its kind in the UK. A\u000a      third national survey, not commissioned by UK Music, took place in 2011.\u000a    The findings of all three research projects were based on a large-scale\u000a      survey of approximately 1,800 UK respondents, which included a\u000a      representative mix of ages, and a roughly 50\/50 gender split, within the\u000a      target demographic. The survey's respondents were sourced via YouGov,\u000a      youth groups, secondary schools and universities across the UK, as well as\u000a      through media and social networks, and music partners. David Bahanovich\u000a      (Reader) and Dennis Collopy (Senior Lecturer) co-directed the research\u000a      project, which included concept generation, survey question design,\u000a      marketing and online implementation, along with data analysis and writing\u000a      the final reports. They generated the questions in collaboration with UK\u000a      Music, enlisting the university's 120 MEIM students as a focus group to\u000a      test and refine the final questions used in the survey. Robust statistical\u000a      analysis of the respondents' answers was carried out by Lindsey Kevan of\u000a      the university's Statistical Services and Consultancy Unit.\u000a    The results provided a penetrating insight into how 14-24 year-olds\u000a      accessed, consumed and shared music during the 2008-11 period. The\u000a      findings shed light on key issues confronting the music industry, chiefly\u000a      revealing that music was the most popular form of entertainment, that\u000a      ownership both online and offline was hugely important to the target\u000a      group, and that there was a significant value gap in terms of the\u000a      popularity of music and the amount of money spent on it, especially when\u000a      compared to other entertainment types. Free file-sharing was widespread,\u000a      yet 85 per cent of those who accessed music illegally said they would be\u000a      interested in paying for an unlimited download service. Eighty-seven per\u000a      cent2028said that copying between devices was important to them; 86 per\u000a      cent of respondents had copied a CD for a friend; 75 per cent had sent\u000a      music by email, Bluetooth, Skype or MSN; 57 per cent had copied a friend's\u000a      entire music collection; 39 per cent had downloaded music from an online\u000a      storage site; and 38 per cent had ripped a TV, radio or Internet stream.\u000a      The main entertainment hub was the computer: 68 per cent of respondents\u000a      used it every day to listen to music. The popularity of peer-to-peer file\u000a      sharing remained unchanged between 2008 and 2011, with 61 per cent stating\u000a      that they downloaded music using peer-to-peer networks or torrent\u000a      trackers. Of this group, 83 per cent did this on a weekly or daily basis.\u000a    This was the first major piece of targeted academic research in this\u000a      fast-changing area of interest: previously, the British music industry and\u000a      government had relied on reports from commercial organisations. The first\u000a      report's findings were delivered before the House of Commons in June 2008\u000a      (discussed in section 4), while the 2011 national survey's findings\u000a      (published 2012) were released in June 2012 at the University of Music and\u000a      Performing Arts, Vienna.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44496","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"},{"GeoNamesId":"453733","Name":"Estonia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Reach\u000d\u000a    Plenum was presented on six occasions in Europe and Australia\u000d\u000a      between 2010 and 2012. As a site-specific public work, each time it was\u000d\u000a      projected onto different buildings and surfaces the acoustic of the space\u000d\u000a      created a unique sound-world. Festival and event curators confirm that,\u000d\u000a      over the six performances, the installation was experienced by over\u000d\u000a      240,000 people; if website visitors are included, this rises to well over\u000d\u000a      300,000. Plenum was also discussed by resident artists and\u000d\u000a      scientists at `round tables' held by each festival, and at a culminating\u000d\u000a      symposium in London.\u000d\u000a    Three performances &#8212; at Toru&#324; (Poland), Tallinn (Estonia) and Durham &#8212;\u000d\u000a      came under the Lux Scientia umbrella, described as `a major collaboration\u000d\u000a      and international dialogue' between the three light festivals. Three\u000d\u000a      artists were each commissioned to create an installation inspired by\u000d\u000a      discussions with a scientist about the scientific and aesthetic aspects of\u000d\u000a      light. The organisers reported that the resulting performances attract ed\u000d\u000a      a total of 240,000 visitors to the three festivals, and generated over 500\u000d\u000a      press, online and TV\/radio features.

The UK curatorial team, the Artichoke Trust, drew\u000d\u000a      150,000 visitors to the Durham Lumiere alone, significantly more than the\u000d\u000a      other two light festivals combined. Durham County Council estimated that\u000d\u000a      the Lumiere generated &#163;4.3 million for the local economy.\u000d\u000a    Figures are unavailable for the Skyway '10 festival performance (Poland,\u000d\u000a      2010), but two other Plenum performances saw audiences of just\u000d\u000a      over 2,000 each: KickArts Contemporary Arts in Cairns, Australia reported\u000d\u000a      2,100 visitors over June and July 2012; while the Cambridge Music Festival\u000d\u000a      (November 2012) attracted an audience of around 2,500 over the two-night\u000d\u000a      projection onto King's College Chapel. Again, the work's online presence\u000d\u000a      extended the audience, with almost 3,300 Youtube views (in aggregate) of\u000d\u000a      six videos of Plenum posted at various times between early 2011\u000d\u000a      and July 2013.\u000d\u000a    Significance\u000d\u000a    Festival curators have commented on Plenum's significance and its\u000d\u000a      reception by audiences. M&#225;rio Caeiro, Toru&#324; curator and the work's\u000d\u000a      original commissioner, described Plenum as `thought provoking and\u000d\u000a      exciting', noting in particular that: `The adaptation of sound to visual\u000d\u000a      concept, as well of the sound and image concept to a building (taken as\u000d\u000a      peculiar kind of canvas), was of course a way to let art become truly\u000d\u000a      important . . . for the public to be \"there\", at the artistic event,\u000d\u000a      becomes truly a cognitive experience.'\u000d\u000a\u0009 After the King's College performance, part of the 2012 Cambridge Music\u000d\u000a      Festival, the festival's director said of the installation's musical\u000d\u000a      aspect that:\u000d\u000a\u0009  \u000d\u000a     \u000d\u000a     \u000d\u000a    Plenum . . . appeals on many levels: from the scientists' awareness of\u000d\u000a      particles amassing and breaking up, to the modern beauty and clarity of\u000d\u000a      the narrative inspired by the stories and science of creation. Popular\u000d\u000a      culture does not always demand much from its audiences but Plenum had that\u000d\u000a      broad appeal but also demanded concentration and for people to allow\u000d\u000a      themselves to be absorbed into the ever-changing sound and projection.\u000d\u000a    On another occasion, he described the festival as something that combined\u000d\u000a      `music, education and technology . . . and really what Plenum is\u000d\u000a      about is trying to bring together at least the music and technology\u000d\u000a      aspects'.\u000d\u000a    This performance also created press interest from sources as diverse as Gramophone,\u000d\u000a      technology publication Cabume, the BBC, and student newspapers Varsity\u000d\u000a      and The Cambridge Student. The latter reported that `many King's\u000d\u000a      students appeared to enjoy the show, despite not seeming to know what it\u000d\u000a      was about', and included humorous impressions alongside more considered\u000d\u000a      observations: `Plenum starts as a grid of dots of light that slowly, but\u000d\u000a      with increasing energy, merge together, decay and vanish in time with\u000d\u000a      pulsating music and `alien sounds' which made one King's student comment:\u000d\u000a      \"it sounded like the world was ending\".'\u000d\u000a    The installation's Australian curator reacted positively to the work:\u000d\u000a    The combination of the sounds and the visual made that I felt I was\u000d\u000a      WITHIN the work; there were no boundaries between sound, visual and\u000d\u000a      myself, it was an experience of being entirely \"present\", all \"thought\"\u000d\u000a      becoming \"non-thought\" . . . I found the work utterly inspiring.\u000d\u000a    Longevity\u000d\u000a    Plenum's sound-world is now migrating from public art to\u000d\u000a      concert-hall performance, in which the visuals will be projected inside\u000d\u000a      the buildings rather than onto exteriors. In this form, it has been booked\u000d\u000a      for three separate music events during 2013\/14: the Huddersfield\u000d\u000a      Contemporary Music Festival (November 2013), Frome Festival (July 2014)\u000d\u000a      and the Kings Place experimental and multimedia group of concerts, London\u000d\u000a      (January 2014). This shift demonstrates that Plenum has succeeded\u000d\u000a      as a customisable piece, capable of presentation in a wide range of\u000d\u000a      environments and able to reach different audiences.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Plenum is an algorithmic work composed by Rob Godman in 2010 as\u000d\u000a      part of a collaborative art-music installation.

The entire work was\u000d\u000a      substantially revised in 2011.\u000d\u000a    Algorithmic Composition\u000d\u000a    The starting point was a 2-dimensional animated physics model on which\u000d\u000a      the visual element was to be based. The original concept was for an\u000d\u000a      algorithmic projection to `drive' the audio, with the intention that the\u000d\u000a      audio and visual elements should be perceived by an audience as being\u000d\u000a      generated in real-time &#8212; i.e., for the art\/sound work to be `live'.\u000d\u000a    Godman and Nelson `storyboarded' the work's macrostructure, and the\u000d\u000a      microstructure was then generated algorithmically, closely linked to the\u000d\u000a      physics models. Working with artist\/programmer Nick Rothwell, the\u000d\u000a      collaborative team developed a networked system (programmed by Rothwell in\u000d\u000a      Field) whereby the visual component sent data to audio (programmed by\u000d\u000a      Godman in Max). Synchronisation was dealt with straightforwardly; but,\u000d\u000a      more pertinently, there was real-time control of all other musical\u000d\u000a      elements.\u000d\u000a    As all of Plenum's creators are time-based artists, the musical\u000d\u000a      work's strength lies in its convincing musical shape. The structure was\u000d\u000a      created by the composer on the macro level, but its microstructure (down\u000d\u000a      to the parameter settings of the software synthesizers) was generated via\u000d\u000a      the moving image, performing the function of a real-time graphic score.\u000d\u000a      This made each iteration of Plenum unique, the relationship\u000d\u000a      between sound and image being taken far beyond superficial issues of\u000d\u000a      synchronisation.\u000d\u000a    Site Specifics\u000d\u000a    As Plenum was to be performed at light festivals in Toru&#324;\u000d\u000a      (Poland), Tallinn (Estonia) and Durham (UK), Godman developed a\u000d\u000a      multi-channel audio system that could be easily adapted to each outdoor\u000d\u000a      site's unique acoustic space. Allowing for, and making use of, the\u000d\u000a      reflective qualities of the surroundings, the system was not restricted to\u000d\u000a      specific loudspeaker configurations but was instead customisable, taking\u000d\u000a      into account audience positioning, and particularly the likelihood that\u000d\u000a      festival-goers would be moving about.\u000d\u000a    A loudspeaker rig was developed that was capable of projecting the sound\u000d\u000a      in an outdoor environment with the best possible fidelity. The software\u000d\u000a      for Plenum's musical component &#8212; written by Godman for this\u000d\u000a      project &#8212; allowed the audio to be customised, mixed and fine-tuned for the\u000d\u000a      space available at each site, making a unique listening experience every\u000d\u000a      time. This allowed the composer to develop the aesthetic behind the audio\u000d\u000a      whilst simultaneously achieving a technical realisation.\u000d\u000a    Sounds\u000d\u000a    Using a variety of hybrid synthesiser techniques, the software generated\u000d\u000a      sounds varying from simple sinusoids &#8212; perceptibly difficult for an\u000d\u000a      audience to localise &#8212; to complex noise, which permits accurate and\u000d\u000a      perceivable point-source localisation. The work's algorithmic nature meant\u000d\u000a      that the sounds were subject to constant change, and were not predictable.\u000d\u000a      Given that the visual part of the artwork was partly informed by Nelson's\u000d\u000a      conversations with Durham University astrophysicist Revd Professor David\u000d\u000a      Wilkinson, the sinusoids, which mimicked early synthesis techniques from\u000d\u000a      the 1960s, were an apposite, tongue-in-cheek reference to the sound-world\u000d\u000a      of science-fiction movies of this period.\u000d\u000a    Since 2010, Plenum has been performed on six occasions. It is\u000d\u000a      site-specific as a result of the customisable sound and image projection\u000d\u000a      systems created by the team, combined with the uniqueness of the venues.\u000d\u000a      The venues' surroundings were chosen with their natural acoustic in mind\u000d\u000a      (perceived aurally and visually) &#8212; the music `playing' and intervening\u000d\u000a      with the natural reflections large structures produce. The point-source\u000d\u000a      localisation techniques allowed an audible understanding of the\u000d\u000a      surroundings. The `purpose' of the building (sacred, public meeting place,\u000d\u000a      etc) was explored and combined with the electronic acoustic (models of\u000d\u000a      Gothic cathedrals, `sacred' domes), sometimes matching the visual\u000d\u000a      surrounding and at other times being contradictory. These acoustics became\u000d\u000a      composed spaces.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44548","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The key impact of the research is in the cultural context. The research\u000a      outputs and activities associated with the research projects have directly\u000a      impacted on the practices of professional dance artists and emerging dance\u000a      artists in terms of providing new insights and understandings of the ways\u000a      in which new and emerging technologies can influence and inform innovation\u000a      in choreographic practices.\u000a    The e-Dance Project engaged in ongoing dialogue with professional dance\u000a      artists throughout the research process. An example of this is: Helen\u000a      Bailey was invited to contribute to the MIMA (Moving Image Media Artists)\u000a      workshop co-hosted by Troika Ranch, a US-based Dance and Technology\u000a      Company, and the 3DL Center in New York, USA. This workshop provided the\u000a      opportunity to discuss the e-Dance software development and disseminate\u000a      the software innovations developed as part of the project to a group of\u000a      selected international professional digital media and performance artists\u000a      from the UK, USA, Hong Kong, and Belgium. [5.5]\u000a    The e-Dance Project resulted in the creation of two publically presented\u000a      performance works, Morphologies (2007) and Here and There (2010). The\u000a      making of these works directly utilised the compositional methods that had\u000a      been developed as part of the research process. An Arts Council England\u000a      Grants for the Arts Award resulted in the development of `Here and There',\u000a      an evening's length performance work integrating the software developed as\u000a      part of the e-Dance project. This dance work toured to professional\u000a      theatre venues and provided dissemination of the research to a general\u000a      public audience. Professional dance artists were employed to work on the\u000a      development and performance of these works, ten professional dancers (Lee\u000a      Awanah, Catherine Bennett, River Carmalt, Marina Collard, Louise Douse,\u000a      Nicola Drew, Amalia Garcia, James Hewison, Diccon Hogger, and Lisa\u000a      Spackman) were engaged directly in this process and developed new\u000a      knowledge and insight. [5.6]\u000a    The e-Dance Project has resulted in the development of new software\u000a      tools, which have impacted directly on the development of new\u000a      compositional approaches and methods for documentation. The British\u000a      Library invited the e-Dance Project team to contribute research findings\u000a      and outputs in the form of the software tools and documentation of\u000a      performance outputs to a 12-month public exhibition. The exhibition titled\u000a      `Growing Knowledge: the evolution of research tools' opened to the general\u000a      public in October 2010. This provided direct access to a general public\u000a      audience to the ways in which emerging technology is driving innovation in\u000a      research methods.

DanceDigital are\u000a      resident at the University of Bedfordshire and a series of collaborative\u000a      projects are in place between CARD and DanceDigital that provides\u000a      opportunities for existing research to impact on professional dance\u000a      artists.\u000a    The partnership forms part of a strategy to develop innovative work in\u000a      dance, performance and technology that contributes to research and\u000a      professional practices in curating, artistic practice and community\u000a      development. Artistic Director of DanceDigital, Tamara Ashley's research\u000a      into environmental, site-sensitive and ecological performance practices\u000a      have directly informed the curatorial vision for DanceDigital, where she\u000a      has been particularly interested in the use of interactive technologies to\u000a      create new experiences of place, environments and social interactions. The\u000a      work of DanceDigital reaches 10,000-15,000 people annually through\u000a      performance and participation activities. Ashley led on the development of\u000a      Digital Futures in Dance Conference in 2011, which was an event of\u000a      international significance in the dance and technology sector. Ashley\u000a      secured the funds from the Arts Council Grants for the Arts programme and\u000a      led a consortium of Dance South West, South East Dance and Bournemouth\u000a      University in the development and delivery of the project. 185\u000a      participants from the professional arts community internationally attended\u000a      the conference, 25 papers, 8 workshops and 15 performances were presented.\u000a      Helen Bailey was invited to provide a keynote presentation on the e-Dance\u000a      Project and specifically the value of artist-driven software development.\u000a      [5.2]\u000a    The current collaborative project being undertaken as a result of the\u000a      partnership between DanceDigital and CARD is Mobilities, an artist\u000a      development project funded by Arts Council England, which will culminate\u000a      in a Festival in April 2014.

This\u000a      practice-led research resulted in the production of a range of outputs\u000a      including published peer-reviewed papers, conference proceedings and an\u000a      original dance work, a 10-minute duet titled `Stereobodies', which\u000a      integrated live performance and stereoscopic projection of prerecorded\u000a      video of dancers. This was the first project in dance to explore e-Science\u000a      visualisation methodologies in networked virtual research environments and\u000a      their applicability for dance research [3.6].\u000a    The findings of this project in relation to the use of access grid as a\u000a      potential environment for networked performance and as a research\u000a      environment in which to document the creative choreographic process became\u000a      the basis for the next large project, the e-Dance Project.\u000a    The e-Dance Project was a three-year project, which took place between\u000a      2007 and 2010. The project received &#163;400,000 joint research council\u000a      AHRC-EPSRC-JISC funding as part of the e-Science Arts &amp; Humanities\u000a      Scheme Large Research Award (2007-2009) Relocating Choreographic\u000a        Process: the Impact of Collaborative Memory and Grid Technologies on\u000a        Practice-led Research in Dance, led by University of Bedfordshire\u000a      with Helen Bailey as Principal Investigator. Collaborative partner HEIs\u000a      were University of Manchester (Martin Turner as co-investigator),\u000a      University of Leeds (Sita Popat as co-investigator) and The Open\u000a      University (Simon Buckingham-Shum as co-investigator). The e-Dance Project\u000a      also received &#163;15,500 Arts Council of England, Grants for the Arts Award\u000a      (2010-2011) Composite Bodies: Networked Choreography to apply the\u000a      practice-led outcomes of the research into an original dance work for a\u000a      public audience. The e-Dance Research Project resulted in a range of\u000a      outputs including peer reviewed articles, published conference\u000a      proceedings, production of new software tools and public performances\u000a      [3.4, 3.2, 3.3]. There were two original choreographed performance works\u000a      created. The first piece was `Morphologies', a 20-minute quartet which\u000a      integrated projected stereoscopic motion capture visualisations as a\u000a      real-time interactive environment in live performance [3.3]. The second\u000a      piece was `Here and There', a 60-minute quartet, which integrated\u000a      networked video technology in live performance. `Here and There' utilised\u000a      the e-Dance Scene Editor software within the performance. This software\u000a      had been developed as part of the research councils funded part of the\u000a      project. The practice-led research outcomes in the use of motion capture\u000a      as a means of visualising spatio-temporal structure which was integrated\u000a      into the `Morphologies' dance work had a direct impact on the MiPP:\u000a      Movement in Place Platform project.\u000a    The MiPP: Movement in Place Platform project was undertaken between 2010\u000a      and 2011. It received &#163;500,000 AHRC (Digital Equipment and Database\u000a      Enhancement for Impact) Large research grant. The project was led by Kirk\u000a      Woolford, Principal-Investigator, University of Sussex, with collaborative\u000a      partner HEIs; University of Bedfordshire (Helen Bailey, co-investigator)\u000a      and King's College London (Stuart Dunn, co-investigator), University of\u000a      Reading (Micheal Fulford as consultant) and industry partnership,\u000a      Animazoo. This project used interdisciplinary intersections between dance,\u000a      archaeology and new media to consider the ways in which motion capture\u000a      technology could be used as a methodological tool to investigate\u000a      spatio-temporal structures and embodied experience of place through these\u000a      structures.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44641","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of PR is measured both by its sustainability and the\u000a      network of associations, collaboration, readership and supplementary\u000a      projects that it has been able to develop as a result of its editorial and\u000a      publishing approach since its inception in 1996.

The interchange of performance\u000a      research between arts practice and academic sphere is at its core and\u000a      exemplified in the collaborations that run through its pages; e.g. (9:4,\u000a      2004) 'On Civility' (Desperate Optimists, Soci&#233;tas Raffaello Sanzio, Stut\u000a      Theatre); or (6:3, 2001) 'Navigations' (tgSTAN, Kevin Mount, Bruce\u000a      Gilchrist, Molly Davies, Gary Hill and Lone Twin).

Working in\u000d\u000a      partnership with Sustrans, the\u000d\u000a      sustainable transport charity, they brought together a research team\u000d\u000a      comprising two acousticians,\u000d\u000a      a computational neuroscientist, and a clinical audiologist in order to\u000d\u000a      develop a concept for a\u000d\u000a      `listening aid': a device that rather than correcting an impairment in\u000d\u000a      hearing, might facilitate\u000d\u000a      contemplation on the act of listening itself.

Designed in collaboration with the Acoustics Research Group at the\u000d\u000a      Open University, lead by\u000d\u000a      Professor Keith Attenborough, Organ of Corti is an array of 96,\u000d\u000a      4-metre cylinders that form an\u000d\u000a      enveloping structure through which the visitors moves. Sound from the\u000d\u000a      surrounding environment\u000d\u000a      passes through the array of cylinders and is sculpted by the structure,\u000d\u000a      creating changing\u000d\u000a      perceptions of familiar sounds. Acoustics research into the use of sonic\u000d\u000a      crystals is still in its\u000d\u000a      infancy Organ of Corti became a vehicle through which the Open\u000d\u000a      University team could expand\u000d\u000a      their ongoing research into this emerging technology. [Section: 3, Ref: 4]\u000d\u000a    Organ of Corti is particularly unusual in the contribution to\u000d\u000a      Sound Art in that it makes to this history\u000d\u000a      in that it does not make any sound of its own, but rather, 2028it attempts\u000d\u000a      to draw our attention to the\u000d\u000a      sounds already present by framing them in a new way. The piece builds on\u000d\u000a      the pioneering work if\u000d\u000a      Alvin Lucier, who through numerous pieces, establishes a complex interplay\u000d\u000a      between the material\u000d\u000a      of the sounds produced and the acoustic context of the place in which they\u000d\u000a      are heard. Similarly,\u000d\u000a      some of the installation work of Michael Asher sought to change the\u000d\u000a      acoustic behaviour of existing\u000d\u000a      spaces. However, with its specific focus on rematerializing sound and\u000d\u000a      dehabituating the listener's\u000d\u000a      relationship to it, Organ of Corti bears just as close a\u000d\u000a      relationship to the light sculptures of James\u000d\u000a      Turrell and the environmental philosophy of Gernot Bohme or the\u000d\u000a      anthropology of Tim Ingold. The\u000d\u000a      research has contributed to further impact within the wider academic\u000d\u000a      disciplines of acoustics,\u000d\u000a      music and sound art, being cited in a number of peer reviewed papers and a\u000d\u000a      book [Section: 3 Ref\u000d\u000a      5-10].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44643","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Commissioned by the Arts Council England under the scheme Artists Taking\u000a      The Lead (4.1) to mark and celebrate the London 2012 Cultural Olympiad, The\u000a        Boat Project, delivered by Whelan, Winters and company (Lone Twin)\u000a      began in January 2011. A large-scale participatory public artwork, its\u000a      success relied on creating impact in the public domain. A considerable\u000a      investment by Arts Council England, &#163;500,000, underlined the perceived\u000a      agency of the project's ambition, to engage many thousands of people in\u000a      the communal building of a world-class racing yacht, a fitting invitation,\u000a      perhaps, for an island people: hand over a piece of your life, a wooden\u000a      piece of life, and together we'll build a boat.\u000a    Across January 2011 to September 2012, 440,698 people engaged with the\u000a      project during the build process and the boat's maiden voyage as part of\u000a      the London 2012 Festival and Cultural Olympiad (4.2). The experience of\u000a      joining The Boat Project, by donating a wooden item, participating\u000a      in the build process or crewing the boat during its maiden voyage, was\u000a      beneficial to public participants in various ways: the project facilitated\u000a      the acquisition of new skills - 80 volunteers were trained in a range of\u000a      boat building techniques, project administration and archival processes,\u000a      while eight were taught to sail to RYA Competent Crew level; volunteers\u000a      formed new and lasting relationships with fellow volunteers; and 2,217\u000a      donors contributed to, and their lives were documented by a public artwork\u000a      of national and international significance - as donor Mary Milton puts it\u000a      `there's a part of me in that boat, and a part of my husband, he would\u000a      have loved this, well, off he goes now, a new life. I didn't know an art\u000a      project could do that' (4.3).\u000a    The impact the project had on participants became a global media story,\u000a      with BBC One broadcasting live from the boat's launch. From ITV to CNN,\u000a      from Saga Magazine to Time Magazine (4.4), the media's clear fascination\u000a      with the project is a product and reflection of the value and impact it\u000a      had on a large participatory audience. As Fiona Wilkie states `...it is as\u000a      a record of more than 1200 separate trajectories - the movements of the\u000a      donated objects and their owners, both small- and large-scale - that it is\u000a      most powerful.... a record of the range of life events, birth, death,\u000a      marriage, parenthood, graduation, career changes, falling in and out of\u000a      love... Its significance as part of a dialogue around arts and the\u000a      Olympics lies in its coupling of aesthetic achievement with social\u000a      encounter' (4.5)\u000a    The project impacted on various professions, creating 22 paid positions\u000a      across teams of professional boat builders, archivists, producers and\u000a      project administrators. The boat was built in Thornham Marina, Emsworth\u000a      under the technical direction of Olympic Yachtsman Mark Covel.\u000a    Following completion of the project, Jesse Loynes, Covell's\u000a      second-in-command, launched Arbor Yachts LTD, a commercial yacht building\u000a      company (4.6). Abor Yachts grew directly from expertise Loynes developed\u000a      working on The Boat Project and currently employs all three\u000a      professional boat builders trained by Covell. Long in decline in Emsworth,\u000a      boat building is now enjoying a renaissance.\u000a    Due to the unique nature of the technologies and techniques developed to\u000a      create the boat the project had considerable impact in the marine sector,\u000a      featuring in all major UK yachting magazines (4.7). The use of the West\u000a      Epoxy System in the build process developed a number of new opportunities\u000a      for West, a partner in the project, including an introduction to Rolls\u000a      Royce, also project partners, to discuss use of West Epoxy in the\u000a      treatment of vehicle interiors, a move which sees the project acting as an\u000a      informal broker between two leading private sector organisations. The\u000a      project partnered with over one hundred private and public sector\u000a      organisations. These include leading cultural organisations: The London\u000a      Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, London 2012\u000a      Festival, Arts Council England, Turner Contemporary, Jerwood Gallery and\u000a      the Brighton Festival; and various public-sector local authorities.\u000a      Working in collaboration partners commissioned over thirty public\u000a      artworks, many from leading UK artists and arts companies, in direct\u000a      response to the themes and concerns of the project (4.8). Here the project\u000a      had significant impact on the programming decisions of major cultural\u000a      organisations' response to the 2012 Cultural Olympiad. The project's\u000a      status as an innovative participatory art work has had significant impact\u000a      on its public sector partners, specifically on audience development: `The\u000a      Boat Project brought together and had a tangible impact on a variety of\u000a      hard to reach groups and communities that would typically not access arts\u000a      or cultural provision in Margate' - Kent County Council (4.9). Impact on\u000a      audience development extends to France where the boat appeared during\u000a      Dunkirk's Regional Capital of Culture programme (May 2013) (4.10). A\u000a      large-scale outreach programme engaged over three thousand young people\u000a      through partnerships with over one hundred schools, enabling an innovative\u000a      and participatory learning experience focused on the social possibilities\u000a      of contemporary public art (4.11).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    A participatory public artwork commissioned as a part of the London 2012\u000a      Cultural Olympiad, The Boat Project's impact reaches to a national\u000a      audience of 440,698 while a global audience of many millions encountered\u000a      the work via print and broadcast media.

Whelan and\u000a      Winters have collaborated under the name Lone Twin since meeting at\u000a      Dartington as undergraduates (1994-1997). Dartington\/Falmouth colleagues\u000a      David Williams and Larry Lynch also made key contributions to the\u000a      research.\u000a    The Days of The Sledgehammer Have Gone, an umbrella title for a\u000a      series of public research residencies and performance outcomes was\u000a      supported by Dartington College of Arts and Arts Council England. The\u000a      project toured extensively, working through a research residency model at\u000a      major international cultural houses and festivals, including The Melbourne\u000a      International Festival (2005), The Andy Warhol Museum, Pittsburgh (2003),\u000a      and the Gulbenkian Foundation, Lisbon (2002). This research period, beyond\u000a      creating The Boat Project, continues to have significant impact on\u000a      the fields of theatre and performance studies, ` (Lone Twin) have\u000a      transformed the way we perceive, practice, and live out our desires within\u000a      and around the work of the theatre and the everyday engagements of\u000a      performance' (3.1).\u000a    The research posed this central question: how can arts practice, in this\u000a      case performance-making, operate beyond orthodox cultural spaces and\u000a      create a generative space of meeting and social exchange with a broad\u000a      public audience? Ite research used the theme and materiality of water, and\u000a      its relationship to a land's human geography, as a catalyst in a series of\u000a      meetings with waterside communities - a definition of place that includes\u000a      major urban centres and rural contexts alike. Research findings, presented\u000a      and disseminated through live performance and a published `research\u000a      companion' with contributions from David Williams (3.2) focused on\u000a      participatory modes of public engagement as means of producing a\u000a      meaningful `place' for performance in public space. Crucially the first\u000a      mode of participation would be the artist's own: Lone Twin's participation\u000a      in the lives and contexts of its audience became the leading operational\u000a      tactic of the research, a turn in the duo's practice with its own impact\u000a      (3.3).\u000a    In participatory terms ideas of travel became important: repeated\u000a      journeys made by Whelan and Winters through a given context became a key\u000a      mode of social and spatial encounter. During a residency in Norway\u000a      (Absolut Galskapp Festival, Kongsvinger, 2000) the researcher's interests\u000a      in water, travel and participation converged in the idea to communally\u000a      build a working boat (3.4). Channel Six, a public outcome created\u000a      by Whelan, Winters with Larry Lynch, and presented at Baltic Centre For\u000a      Contemporary Art, Gateshead (2005), was created during a North Sea\u000a      crossing on board a Russian fishing trawler, a context that further\u000a      informed an enquiry into the variously layered relationships between\u000a      seafaring, community and ideas of nationhood. Research in Stavanger,\u000a      Norway as a part of the port's preparations for its European City of\u000a      Culture programme (2008) centred on the possibility of building a wooden\u000a      boat from items gifted to the process by members of the public, and for\u000a      the public to work alongside professional boat builders in creating the\u000a      vessel. The central idea, to fold personal identity, and personal value,\u000a      into a national, participatory communal activity was later commissioned by\u000a      Arts Council England, as The Boat Project.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44644","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Audience development\u000a      The palace building work offered a unique opportunity for Kensington\u000a      Palace to experiment with different ways for visitors to explore and\u000a      interact with the palace, its stories and treasures [1]. After the\u000a      extensive refurbishment, the palace would re-open in 2012 as `A palace for\u000a      everyone', so the opportunity to develop Kensington Palace's visitor\u000a      demographic prior to the re-opening was an important part of the project.\u000a    The core audience of Kensington Palace was previously made up of\u000a      `traditional' visitors who have a general interest in historic buildings.\u000a      The majority of this group were mostly international, `once in a lifetime'\u000a      visitors. People whose interest in the palace due to its association with\u000a      Princess Diana made up another key audience segment, while families and\u000a      young, urban Londoners were underrepresented [3].\u000a    The Enchanted Palace had a considerable impact on the visitor\u000a      demographic. It attracted a much wider audience than usual with a 20% rise\u000a      in London-based visitors and 17% rise in visitors aged 25-34 [2]. More\u000a      people were visiting Kensington Palace than ever before: in the first year\u000a      of The Enchanted Palace visitor numbers were up 22% on the\u000a      previous year at their peak [3].\u000a    The Enchanted Palace was an immersive experience, very different\u000a      from a standard museum visit. This provoked some extreme reactions from\u000a      visitors. As well as filling the palace's visitor book, many comments were\u000a      posted online on TripAdvisor and Mumsnet [6].\u000a    While many people loved The Enchanted Palace, a minority hated\u000a      it. This strength of feeling (both positive and negative) was something\u000a      that Kensington Palace had never encountered before [3].\u000a    The exhibition was widely covered in the press [4], including national\u000a      newspapers, prestigious fashion-focused magazines such as Vogue, trendy\u000a      urban publications Time Out and Wallpaper as well as by influential\u000a      bloggers. It was also well-received by the museum sector and featured on\u000a      the International Council of Museums website: Clothes Tell Stories [5] as\u000a      well as cited in several peer- reviewed journals [9]. The Enchanted\u000a        Palace won the Editor's Award for Innovation and Tourism at the 2010\u000a      Group Travel Awards [8].\u000a    As part of project, Kensington Palace tried out late-night opening for\u000a      the first time, with four Enchanted Evening attracting on average\u000a      400 visitors. Nearly 700 people attended `Peter the Wild Boy's Ball', the\u000a      last in the series of evening events. Following the success of these\u000a      events, Kensington Palace has run further evening events, including `Eerie\u000a      evening tours'.\u000a    Community\u000a      Community involvement was a key part of the project. Drawing on WildWorks'\u000a      and specifically, Mercedes Kemp's previous work with communities in\u000a      unusual settings, the project brought a diverse group of people together,\u000a      both from within the palace and the local area. Thirteen educational and\u000a      community partners were involved in creating artwork and exhibits for The\u000a        Enchanted Palace: Acton and West London College, Central St Martin's\u000a      College of Art, Chelsea Methodists, Fox Primary School, Harpley Pupil\u000a      Referral Unit, Into University, Locksley and St Dunstan's Sewing Group,\u000a      North Kensington Jigsaw Club Positive Age, Pimento Supplementary School,\u000a      the Prince's Drawing School, Queens Park Children's Sewing Centre,\u000a      Stitches in Time and Wimbledon College of Art.\u000a    Many of the people involved had never visited Kensington Palace before,\u000a      or would have even thought of visiting, yet made a strong emotional\u000a      connection with the stories connected to the palace:\u000a    \"Visiting Kensington Palace taught me that even princesses had sad\u000a        lives too. I didn't realise they had to be married off, or leave their\u000a        country, family and precious possessions behind, just like us.

It transformed the\u000a      State Apartments at Kensington Palace into an interactive exhibition (26\u000a      March 2010 &#8212; 1 June 2012) which brought the stories and the palace to\u000a      life.\u000a    The Enchanted Palace enabled Kensington Palace to remain open\u000a      during a two-year &#163;12 million refurbishment. The project brought in\u000a      income, safeguarded jobs and drew in new audiences. Thirteen community\u000a      groups, schools and colleges were involved in its creation while 10\u000a      high-profile designers were invited to create work in response to the\u000a      stories of the palace.

Mercedes Kemp (Senior Lecturer,\u000a      Falmouth) is a core artistic member and Associate Director, Community and\u000a      Research. Kemp has worked developed storylines and text for site-specific\u000a      pieces across Europe. Her research is at the boundaries of participative\u000a      and professional practice. Wildworks have produced several celebrated\u000a      large-scale public projects, involving European communities. Two projects\u000a      contemporary with the Enchanted Palace are `The Passion' [1b] and `Babel'\u000a      [1c].\u000a    The Passion, Port Talbot, Wales (2011, National Theatre Wales with\u000a      Michael Sheen), involved 1200+ members of the Port Talbot community.\u000a      People took part as writers, musicians, singers, actors, makers and\u000a      stewards over a three-day non-stop celebration from afternoon of Good\u000a      Friday to Sunday evening. During a six month preparation and devising\u000a      period, the team worked in the streets, malls and social clubs of Port\u000a      Talbot to engage members of the community in finding stories, memories,\u000a      images and locations for the story of The Passion.\u000a    Babel brought together the community engagement teams of 5 organisations:\u000a      Wildworks, Battersea Arts Centre,The Lyric Hammersmith, Theatre Royal\u000a      Stratford East and Young Vic. Babel was created as a celebration of the\u000a      diversity of London in terms of language, culture, ethnicity, identity and\u000a      the wider idea of communication beyond language. 600+ participants from\u000a      across 23 Boroughs created 12 performances for audiences totalling 9000+.\u000a      Participation was intergenerational with people from every age bracket in\u000a      the census. 224 members took part in the final performance run.\u000a    Other projects that have involved this methodology of community\u000a      participation include:The Memory Projector, Merchant City Festival,\u000a      Glasgow (2009) [1d], The Beautiful Journey (2009) [1e], Souterrain,\u000a      Britain and France (2006-2007) [1f] and A Very Old Man with Enormous\u000a      Wings\/3 Island Project, Malta (2003), Cyprus (2004), Cornwall (2005) [1g].\u000a    WildWorks aims to balance high production values with a commitment to\u000a      community engagement. Kemp's role within WildWorks involves working with\u000a      host communities, exploring their relationships with place and memory and\u000a      adapting text to fit each new location. Her method involves eclectic\u000a      ethnographic research using a variety of sources: archives, artefacts,\u000a      local historians, old photographs and conversations. Observing process of\u000a      memory and its effect on the value that people place on their environments\u000a      is key.\u000a    The initial research period explored ideas with staff at the palace,\u000a      including curators, conservators and warders. Although they all approached\u000a      the project from different perspectives, what united them was their\u000a      passion for Kensington Palace and its stories, artefacts and significance.\u000a    HRP initially suggested using fairy stories as a framework for The\u000a        Enchanted Palace, but WildWorks were keen for the project to be\u000a      based around real stories of the palace: the real stories were as\u000a      intriguing and compelling as any fairy tale. Because the noise of the\u000a      building work would be heard, it made sense to weave this into the story.\u000a      The idea was that the vibration and disturbance were shaking the stories\u000a      out of the wall of the palace with the dust, and that they were somehow\u000a      running free in the State Apartments [2].\u000a    The stories of seven princesses who lived in Kensington Palace were\u000a      chosen as a focal point for the project, a way of presenting the historic\u000a      site through an emotive narrative. They included those of Diana, Princess\u000a      of Wales and Queen Victoria. While the stories spanned four centuries, the\u000a      themes explored universal human experiences, such as the desire for love,\u000a      rebellion, lonely childhoods and the pain of losing a child which would\u000a      resonate with contemporary audiences.\u000a    Kemp was the principle writer for The Enchanted Palace. She\u000a      started writing poems for each princess [3], using the narrative of their\u000a      lives and translating them into more mythic terms. These story-poems are\u000a      at the core of The Enchanted Palace guide book [4] and became a\u000a      focal point for the collaboration of artists, designers, curators,\u000a      conservators, performers, community groups, educational partnerships and\u000a      warders working on the project. The poems were translated into seven\u000a      languages and included in storybooks accompanying the installations.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44649","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The dissemination of research findings to a wide public beyond higher\u000a      education was an integral part of these projects from their initial\u000a      planning stages through to their delivery.\u000a    At the National Portrait Gallery, the primary audience of gallery\u000a      visitors was able to access the findings of Sheppard Skaerved's research\u000a      not only through the exhibition itself, but also through a large programme\u000a      of interactive events co-ordinated by him and delivered by him in\u000a      collaboration with composers, performers and advanced students from the\u000a      Royal Academy of Music. These included public lecture-recitals, open\u000a      workshops, guided tours, and question-and-answer sessions with the\u000a      visitors.

His prolific research has led to a variety\u000a      of outputs, including CD recordings, scholarly editions, articles,\u000a      collaborations leading to the creation of new music, and the curation of\u000a      exhibitions and museum-based events.\u000a    In 2008 the National Portrait Gallery invited Sheppard Skaerved to\u000a      co-curate a music-centred exhibition, working with Paul Moorhouse, the\u000a      Twentieth-Century Curator at the Gallery. Sheppard Skaerved's research for\u000a      the project involved the discovery and interpretation of creative,\u000a      cultural and biographical connections between a wide range of musicians.\u000a      The resulting Exhibition, Only Connect, ran from 16 April to 27\u000a      November 2011, and comprised 45 pictures, subjects ranging from Maria\u000a      Cosway to Michael Tippett, joined by a network of connections and\u000a      explained by a large `viewing table' located in the centre of the room.\u000a      Performance and the creation of new music &#8212; in response to the insights of\u000a      the exhibition &#8212; were integral to the project. Collaborating with Sheppard\u000a      Skaerved, composers Elliott Schwarz and David Gorton both composed works\u000a      inspired by the exhibition, which were premiered in the gallery and filmed\u000a      in situ.\u000a    From 2009-12 Sheppard Skaerved conducted research on Nicol&#242; Paganini with\u000a      the instrument and paper holdings of the Music Division of the Library of\u000a      Congress in Washington DC. Following Sheppard Skaerved's lecture-recital\u000a      `The Revolutionary Violin' (based on an earlier research project) at the\u000a      Library's Coolidge Auditorium in the summer of 2009, the Library's Music\u000a      Division invited him to bring his previous Paganini research and\u000a      performances to bear on the resources of the institution. He was given\u000a      access to a cross-section of holdings relating to Paganini, alongside\u000a      three violins (the Brooking Amati, the Betts Stradivarius and the Kreisler\u000a      Del Ges&#249;). In addition to Paganini's `Red Book', a memorandum book in\u000a      which he documented his `Grand Tour' of 1828-31, the paper materials\u000a      included letters, music manuscripts, playbills and recipes. The research\u000a      led to new insights into the context of Paganini's work, to the\u000a      rediscovery of `lost' works, and to a reappraisal of the significance of\u000a      his achievements. Sheppard Skaerved also worked with composers in the\u000a      creation of new works inspired by his research. His research findings\u000a      informed a lecture-recital Sheppard Skaerved delivered in the Coolidge\u000a      Auditorium on 15 December 2012, performing rediscovered and new works\u000a      alongside a presentation of issues relating to the `Red Book'. In the\u000a      summer of 2013, this material was made into an hour-long film for the\u000a      Music Division, in which the objects, images and instruments are explored\u000a      in the context of Paganini's life and work. Consequently, the US-based Strings\u000a      magazine invited Sheppard Skaerved to write an article `My Year with\u000a      Paganini' which appeared in its May 2013 edition. The entire project was\u000a      charted through Sheppard Skaerved's online journal.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44650","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Shipton's research on twentieth-century jazz and popular music history\u000d\u000a      has been disseminated through books, radio and television broadcasts,\u000d\u000a      newspapers, and magazines. This has served to bring his subjects (and\u000d\u000a      related areas of jazz and popular music) to a wide public and generated\u000d\u000a      new professional and commercial interest in their work, in the UK and\u000d\u000a      internationally. McHugh's songs have been recorded by a new generation of\u000d\u000a      artists; Calloway and his work have featured on radio and television;\u000d\u000a      there has been a major CD reissue programme of Nilsson's work.\u000d\u000a    Throughout his career, Shipton has sought to communicate his research to\u000d\u000a      a wide public beyond academia. His weekly broadcasts on BBC Radio 3 have\u000d\u000a      sought to reach a general listenership, and so, for example, he has not\u000d\u000a      only presented programmes on Cab Calloway, but on members of Calloway's\u000d\u000a      orchestra including Dizzy Gillespie and Jonah Jones. Shipton's appearances\u000d\u000a      at Cheltenham Jazz Festival and King's College London in April 2010 to\u000d\u000a      discuss McHugh and Calloway were open to the general public, as was the\u000d\u000a      discussion of McHugh at the London Jazz Festival in November 2010. Shipton\u000d\u000a      has also chaired a round table discussion on Duke Ellington (and his\u000d\u000a      connections with Calloway and McHugh) at the Barbican, London, in November\u000d\u000a      2010.\u000d\u000a    McHugh's music is less well-known than that of his contemporaries George\u000d\u000a      Gershwin, Jerome Kern and Irving Berlin. However, as a direct consequence\u000d\u000a      of Shipton's book, Michael Feinstein presented a concert of McHugh's work\u000d\u000a      at the Zankel Hall (below New York's Carnegie Hall) in November 2009, and\u000d\u000a      interviewed Shipton on stage about the composer and his music. Feinstein\u000d\u000a      has subsequently presented similar programmes in New York and Los Angeles.\u000d\u000a      In November 2009, the singer Wesla Whitfield presented a concert of\u000d\u000a      McHugh's songs at the Barnes and Noble bookstore at Lincoln Center, New\u000d\u000a      York, at which Shipton talked about the composer and his work. This was\u000d\u000a      televised for local New York PBS stations, reaching a sizeable media\u000d\u000a      audience. Since Shipton's book was published, leading singers including\u000d\u000a      Michael Bubl&#233; and Jane Monheit have recorded McHugh's songs.\u000d\u000a    Shipton's research on Cab Calloway was used by the New York filmmaker\u000d\u000a      Gail Levin in making a television biography of the singer for the European\u000d\u000a      Arte Network (the leading Arts network in France and Germany) and for\u000d\u000a      public broadcasting Channel 13 in the USA. The book also generated renewed\u000d\u000a      interest in the singer and his work, as interpreted by his grandson\u000d\u000a      Christopher Calloway Brooks, and the present-day version of the Cab\u000d\u000a      Calloway Orchestra. In addition to a Jazz Library programme on BBC\u000d\u000a      Radio 3 in April 2011, Shipton broadcast extensively about Calloway in the\u000d\u000a      USA, including appearances on the WNYC book programme Soundcheck,\u000d\u000a      WNIC's Mark Hayes music programme, and the Daily Swarm blog. Jazz\u000d\u000a        Library at the time had a weekly audience of 150,000 (source:\u000d\u000a      RAJAR). WNYC has approximately one million listeners a week in the New\u000d\u000a      York area (source: WNYC website) and WNIC has a reach of over 100,000.\u000d\u000a    The reach of the impact of Shipton's research is also evidenced by sales\u000d\u000a      figures. Both the McHugh and Calloway biographies have sold approximately\u000d\u000a      2500 copies in hardback, with a further 1500 copies sold of the Calloway\u000d\u000a      paperback. Nilsson had sold approximately 6000 copies in its first four\u000d\u000a      months from publication in July 2013, plus half that number again as\u000d\u000a      Kindle e-book sales. It was serialised by The Mail on Sunday (with\u000d\u000a      a readership of 1.7 million), and broadcast as Radio 4's Book of the\u000d\u000a        Week in August 2013 (estimated audience, BBC figures: 1.2 million).\u000d\u000a      Japanese translation rights have also been sold.\u000d\u000a    The significance of Shipton's contribution to the public understanding of\u000d\u000a      jazz and pop music is such that in addition to being the weekly presenter\u000d\u000a      of Radio 3's Jazz Record Requests, he is a frequent contributor to\u000d\u000a      Radio 4 programmes such as Front Row and Last Word.

His published output\u000d\u000a      now stands at four volumes of oral history, seven academic biographies and\u000d\u000a      a synoptic history of jazz. He has continued this work since being\u000d\u000a      appointed Lecturer in Jazz History at the Royal Academy of Music in 2008.\u000d\u000a      His particular interest has been in reconciling information from oral\u000d\u000a      histories and testaments with documentary biography and sound documents or\u000d\u000a      discography. A study of his research methods was published in the Jazz\u000d\u000a        Research Journal under the title `New Jazz Histories' (JRJ\u000d\u000a      3:2, 2009, pp 127-144) and it also formed the basis of an academic\u000d\u000a      conference on Jazz Research at Salford University in the spring of 2008.\u000d\u000a      His oral history interviews formed the basis of his `Jazz Library' series\u000d\u000a      for BBC Radio 3 (2007-2012), and over 150 of these are preserved in\u000d\u000a      perpetuity on the BBC website as downloadable podcasts.\u000d\u000a    His biography of the songwriter Jimmy McHugh I Feel a Song Coming On\u000d\u000a      was published in 2009, and explored the New York music publishing,\u000d\u000a      song-plugging and recording industry, as well as the early years of the\u000d\u000a      Hollywood musical. Material from it was incorporated in a subsequent\u000d\u000a      biography of McHugh's songwriting partner Dorothy Fields by the American\u000d\u000a      author Charlotte Greenspan.\u000d\u000a    Shipton's investigation of Mills Music publishing (in which McHugh was a\u000d\u000a      partner) led him to research Irving Mills' links with Cab Calloway in his\u000d\u000a      biography of the singer Hi-De-Ho published in 2010. This shed new\u000d\u000a      light on the early years of modern artist management and promotion, radio\u000d\u000a      broadcasting and recording policy, and Shipton appeared at events\u000d\u000a      organised by the 2010 Cheltenham and London Jazz festivals and at a\u000d\u000a      seminar at King's College London, on 26 April 2010, presenting the fruits\u000d\u000a      of this research with Dr Harvey Cohen, whose biography of Duke Ellington (Duke\u000d\u000a        Ellington's America, 2009) looked in detail at a later period of\u000d\u000a      Irving Mills' work. The interest in management and production of music\u000d\u000a      drew Shipton to research the life of the pop singer Harry Nilsson,\u000d\u000a      discovering new material on the development of studio recording techniques\u000d\u000a      and re-evaluating a body of work that led to RCA reissuing almost\u000d\u000a      Nilsson's entire catalogue of recordings in a 17CD boxed set, published in\u000d\u000a      tandem with Shipton's biography. Shipton worked in detail on the\u000d\u000a      documentary material on Nilsson's recordings held at the Sony \/ RCA\u000d\u000a      archives in New York, and in the singer's personal archive, publishing\u000d\u000a      most of this material for the first time.\u000d\u000a    His work on Nilsson brought Shipton's jazz research methodology to an\u000d\u000a      area of 1960s and 1970s pop music, and has led to subsequent broadcasts\u000d\u000a      and articles on the period, from Radio 4's Front Row to several\u000d\u000a      NPR stations in north America, and blogs including The Huffington Post.\u000d\u000a      In particular these have focused on the establishment of London as the\u000d\u000a      major base for pop music recording in the 1970s.\u000d\u000a    "}]

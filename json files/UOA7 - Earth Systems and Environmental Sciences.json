Co-Chair of the Assessment, Bateman leading the UK-NEA\u000d\u000a      Economics Team, and Burgess (since 2007, now Emeritus) leading the\u000d\u000a      Cultural Services team with major inputs from Watkinson (since\u000d\u000a      1976) and Turner. Indeed the CSERGE SEER project is explicitly\u000d\u000a      acknowledged as the only external research underpinning the UK-NEA\u000d\u000a      (see page 2 in [8]). The UK-NEA in turn became the empirical basis of the\u000d\u000a      Government's 2011 Natural Environment White Paper [9], an impact\u000d\u000a      explicitly acknowledged in its Foreword by the then Secretary of State for\u000d\u000a      Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Caroline Spelman, who stated:\u000d\u000a    \"The National Ecosystem Assessment has given us the evidence to inform\u000d\u000a        our decisions. It makes clear that government and society need to\u000d\u000a        account better for the value of nature, particularly the services and\u000d\u000a        resources it provides\".\u000d\u000a    The UK-NEA is by far the most cited document in the Natural Environment\u000d\u000a      White Paper, which has provided a 25 year vision for management of the UK\u000d\u000a      natural environment and underpins all related policies.\u000d\u000a    Impact on Government investment appraisals: CSERGE wrote\u000d\u000a      the UK Government official guidelines for the valuation of the\u000d\u000a      environmental impacts of investments [4] and these have been used\u000d\u000a      continuously in official appraisals since their publication in 2002.\u000d\u000a      Indeed the Environment Agency inform us that these guidelines have been\u000d\u000a      used as the basis of several hundred appraisals for the on-going Water\u000d\u000a      Industry Price Review process [10]. These appraisals have determined\u000d\u000a      decisions regarding several billion pounds of investment in water quality\u000d\u000a      improvements across the UK. This guidance has also been used in various\u000d\u000a      other appraisals covering a variety of environmental impact contexts too\u000d\u000a      numerous to include here.\u000d\u000a    In 2007-08 Day was commissioned by the Government to undertake an\u000d\u000a      assessment of the impact of varying vehicle taxation as a means of\u000d\u000a      reducing emissions. His recommendations formed the basis of changes in\u000d\u000a      taxation announced in the Chancellor of the Exchequer's 2008 Budget [11].\u000d\u000a      Day also led the 2009 study for the Department for Transport which\u000d\u000a      led to their incorporation of noise impacts into the policy and practice\u000d\u000a      regarding the planning of all UK trunk roads [12].\u000d\u000a    Impact through projects undertaken for the business sector:\u000d\u000a      The School's work on economic valuation [4] has been used extensively by\u000d\u000a      the private sector, most particularly by water companies in preparing\u000d\u000a      submissions to the Ofwat Price Review processes (PR09 and PR14). As\u000d\u000a      confirmed by [13], CSERGE researchers designed many of these studies\u000d\u000a      including: appraisal of the &#163;4 billion Thames Tideway investment\u000d\u000a      (construction approved for 2012-23); appraisal (in 2008) for Thames Water\u000d\u000a      Utilities of their &#163;1 billion leakage reduction scheme and in 2011-2013 of\u000d\u000a      their 5 year &#163;5 billion investment plan for the 2014 (PR14); studies in\u000d\u000a      2008 and 2012-13 for the United Utilities PR09 and PR14 business plans\u000d\u000a      entailing investment of around &#163;3 billion; Southern Water PR09 study.\u000d\u000a      CSERGE also provided peer review of the first Triple Bottom Line Account\u000d\u000a      for a water company in the UK; and of the Severn Trent Water PR14\u000d\u000a      submission involving investment expenditure of around &#163;2.5 billion. In sum\u000d\u000a      this shows the active involvement of CSERGE in informing over &#163;15 billion\u000d\u000a      of water sector investment during the present REF period.\u000d\u000a    Pathways to Impact #1: via direct advice to Government and via\u000d\u000a          Government Committees: Since 2009 Bateman has given\u000d\u000a      personal briefings to a variety of senior decision-makers including: The\u000d\u000a      Defra Secretary of State, Oliver Letwin, MP and Minister of State at the\u000d\u000a      Cabinet Office; Ministers from H.M.

Natural resources play a vital role in the supply\u000d\u000a      of food, the provision of clean water, regulation of the climate,\u000d\u000a      availability of raw materials and so on. They also determine the quality\u000d\u000a      of life through the provision of high quality recreation, beautiful\u000d\u000a      landscapes, peace and quiet, urban green-space, and habitat for wild\u000d\u000a      species. Yet the fact that many of these vital services lack market prices\u000d\u000a      means they are often ignored when it comes to making decisions. CSERGE\u000d\u000a      research has addressed this by developing theory and methods for valuing\u000d\u000a      ecosystem services and incorporating them within decision making. The\u000d\u000a      international status of CSERGE is demonstrated by independent citation\u000d\u000a      assessment (Hoepner et al., (2012) Ecological Economics 77:\u000d\u000a      193-206) which positions CSERGE as the most influential institution in\u000d\u000a      Europe and third most influential in the world in the fields of\u000d\u000a      environmental and ecological economics: this status is also reflected in a\u000d\u000a      track record of research funding [see Section 3].\u000d\u000a    Theoretical and methodological basis of the Ecosystem Service\u000d\u000a          approach and environmental valuation: CSERGE has led the\u000d\u000a      European field in ecosystem valuation research for more than two decades\u000d\u000a      and in this REF window the key contributions have included ground-\u000d\u000a      breaking work linking ecosystem services through to economic values [1,\u000d\u000a      2]. Methods for estimating such values were described in numerous key\u000d\u000a      books and journal papers resulting in several thousand citations. CSERGE\u000d\u000a      researchers have pioneered the incorporation of environmental complexity\u000d\u000a      within techniques for the economic valuation of non-market environmental\u000d\u000a      goods.

The true coverage will\u000a      substantially exceed these numbers because of the difficulty of recording\u000a      foreign-language news articles. The carbon budget is also re-disseminated\u000a      through the independent organisations CO2now.org\u000a      and www.rtcc.org.

Our work is cited in the report\u000a      of the Committee on Climate change which underpinned this emissions target\u000a      [9a]. Our work was also cited for two of the six reasons to strengthen the\u000a      target in a letter written by Lord Turner, Chair of the Committee on\u000a        Climate Change to the UK Secretary of State [9b]. The first\u000a      reason explained that:\u000a    `we know more about how rising temperatures will reduce the\u000a      effectiveness of carbon sinks'\u000a    and the second reason stated that:\u000a    `latest global emission trends are higher than those anticipated in\u000a        most IPCC scenarios, largely because of higher economic growth and a\u000a        shift towards more carbon intensive sources of energy'.\u000a    Lord Turner's letter was published in advance of its planned publication\u000a      date 11 days after (and possibly in response to) the publication of our\u000a      2008 carbon budget. Our work has also been cited in the Third Report of\u000a      the Select Committee on Environmental Audit [9c].\u000a    In support of the International Negotiations, our carbon budget data have\u000a      been requested by the European Commission, the Minister of the Environment\u000a      in Germany, congressional advisers in the US, policy advisers in Sweden\u000a      and the UK, and the Department of Climate Change in Australia [10]. We\u000a      presented our work in briefings to the Leader of HM Government's\u000a      Opposition (David Cameron, 2007), to the Prince of Wales's corporate\u000a      leaders group on climate change (2008), to the Department of Energy and\u000a      Climate Change (2010, 2012), to the Canadian Ambassador for Climate Change\u000a      (2011), and to the UNFCCC Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological\u000a      Advice on research and systematic observations (2011).

Liss\u000a      (since 1969) and Watson, A. were co-authors on the Royal Society\u000a      report on ocean acidification [13], which is widely cited in connection\u000a      with responses to this topic by the European Commission, NERC and other\u000a      countries.\u000a    Iron fertilisation: The Royal Society's 2009 report on\u000a      geoengineering [14] leaned heavily on the School's research which\u000a      quantified geoengineering methods in general [5] and iron fertilisation in\u000a      particular. Watson led the chapter on carbon removal methods. The\u000a      House of Commons Science and Technology Committee in 2009 conducted a\u000a      study on the regulation of geoengineering (Liss was Scientific\u000a      Advisor). The US Congressional Science and Technology Committee were also\u000a      simultaneously investigating this matter and drew upon our work. In recent\u000a      years a few companies have developed plans to perform artificial iron\u000a      fertilisation triggering reactions from national and international\u000a      policymakers. UN bodies became involved in 2008 when the Scientific Group\u000a      of the London Dumping Convention appointed an advisory group (including Watson,\u000a        A.) and issued interim guidelines, and the 2010 Conference on\u000a      Biological Diversity (CBD) issued a statement restricting iron\u000a      fertilisation research [15].

Only about 45% of the\u000a      global emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) remain in the\u000a      atmosphere every year; the remainder is absorbed by the ocean and land\u000a      \"carbon sinks\". As CO2 is the most important anthropogenic\u000a      greenhouse gas responsible for global warming, knowledge on the trends in\u000a      global emissions and sinks of carbon is crucial for at least three\u000a      reasons: (a) to maintain an accurate understanding of the evolution of\u000a      world's climate; (b) to determine meaningful targets for reductions in CO2\u000a      emissions; and (c) to provide early warning of any weakening in the\u000a      efficiency of the carbon sinks.\u000a    In 2005, Le Qu&#233;r&#233; (at UEA since 2004) proposed the release of\u000a      annual carbon budgets via the Global Carbon Project, which she now\u000a      co-chairs. The first annual budget identified that global CO2\u000a      emissions had increased beyond expectations, with a growth in emissions of\u000a      1% per year in the 1990s and 3% per year during 2000-2006 [2]. It also\u000a      showed that the carbon sinks were probably responding to recent climate\u000a      change and variability. These analyses were deepened in 2009 [3] and\u000a      updated in three peer-reviewed correspondence items in Nature\u000a        Geoscience (2010) and Nature Climate Change (2012, 2013).\u000a      They are supported by an extensive database and methods that were\u000a      published in the journal Earth System Science Data in 2013.\u000a    Ocean carbon sink and ocean acidification: The School has\u000a      led the monitoring of the oceans' carbon sinks. The oceans are expected to\u000a      be the main sink for anthropogenic carbon on century time scales. We have\u000a      led high-profile studies showing the sensitivity of the ocean carbon sink\u000a      to climate (e.g. [4]), demonstrating that it is possible to accurately\u000a      observe the carbon flux into an ocean basin using instrumented commercial\u000a      vessels. These results are used in the aforementioned global carbon\u000a      budgets [3].\u000a    Iron fertilization: The School has led the scientific\u000a      understanding of how iron affects uptake of CO2 in the\u000a      world's oceans, i.e. partly addressing how the ocean carbon sink\u000a      functions. We have also been actively informing debates over ocean\u000a      fertilization as a geoengineering technique. We have quantified\u000a      geoengineering methods in general [5] and iron fertilization in\u000a      particular. The puzzle of what limits plankton growth in \"high nitrate low\u000a      chlorophyll\" regions- especially the Southern Ocean and Equatorial Pacific\u000a      &#8212; has a long history. The hypothesis that iron deficiency might be\u000a      critical was mooted in the 1930s and gathered momentum in the 1980s. The\u000a      \"iron hypothesis\" was finally proved in several iron release experiments\u000a      in the open ocean by international teams, in the Equatorial Pacific (in\u000a      1993) and in the Southern Ocean (in 2000). These experiments were made\u000a      possible by a water-tracking technique developed in the School, and School\u000a      scientists including Watson, A. (at UEA1996-2013) and Bakker,\u000a        D (since 1998) were essential to most of these experiments, through\u000a      leading the studies that quantified the uptake of atmospheric CO2\u000a      by iron fertilization [6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"1449","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"248816","Name":"Jordan"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    UK adaptation policy and regulatory development has been influenced\u000d\u000a      through the codified\u000d\u000a      knowledge of possible future climate impacts and adaptation options\u000d\u000a      developed in the School.\u000d\u000a      Hansard cites links to our work in three White Papers between 2001 and\u000d\u000a      2005 and three policy\u000d\u000a      briefings from the Parliamentary Office for Science and Technology, one of\u000d\u000a      which was authored by\u000d\u000a      a School secondee to Parliament, have relied heavily upon this work [7].\u000d\u000a      These findings have been\u000d\u000a      presented through personal briefings to successive Secretaries of State\u000d\u000a      for the Environment\u000d\u000a      (Beckett, 2001-05; Miliband, 2005-07; Benn, 2007-10); to parliamentary\u000d\u000a      select committee inquiries\u000d\u000a      (International Development; Science and Technology; Energy and Climate\u000d\u000a      Change; Environment\u000d\u000a      Audit [e.g.8]); and to devolved administrations in Belfast, Cardiff and\u000d\u000a      Edinburgh.

The UKCIP02 scenarios have been cited over 1,100\u000d\u000a      times (half of which\u000d\u000a      are in the period 2008-2013) in academic, policy and applied studies and\u000d\u000a      used by large numbers of\u000d\u000a      public and private sector organisations in their strategic planning and\u000d\u000a      decision-making in the period\u000d\u000a      from 2002-2010. One specific example of their impact concerns the UK\u000d\u000a      Government's 2004\u000d\u000a      Foresight report on future flood risk [10]. Watkinson was one of\u000d\u000a      the six lead authors of this peer-reviewed\u000d\u000a      study, and Jordan (since 1992) a contributing author, which drew\u000d\u000a      specifically on the\u000d\u000a      UKCIP02 climate scenarios. The report was commissioned by the DTI and\u000d\u000a      received by Defra and\u000d\u000a      constituted the primary evidence base for the subsequent policy document Making\u000d\u000a        Space for\u000d\u000a        Water; in turn it directly informed a multi-million pound uplift in\u000d\u000a      the flood risk management budget\u000d\u000a      announced by Defra in 2006. The national benefits of this work and policy\u000d\u000a      advice, through\u000d\u000a      improved flood defence, continue to be realised throughout the period to\u000d\u000a      2013 &#8212; and beyond. The\u000d\u000a      innovative methodology developed for this purpose [10] has also informed\u000d\u000a      flood risk management\u000d\u000a      in other parts of the world (China and the USA). The UKCIP02 scenarios\u000d\u000a      also guided the\u000d\u000a      development of the new 2009 national building design data for the Chartered\u000d\u000a        Institute of Building\u000d\u000a        Service Engineers and improved the resilience of new buildings to\u000d\u000a      future weather extremes [11].\u000d\u000a    The School's underpinning research also made substantial contributions to\u000d\u000a      the most recent update\u000d\u000a      of these scenarios: the 2009 UK Climate Projections (UKCP09). Their\u000d\u000a      development was led by the\u000d\u000a      Hadley Centre who refined the UKCIP02 scenarios through adding detailed\u000d\u000a      probabilistic\u000d\u000a      assessments of uncertainty and extreme weather outcomes. Goodess'\u000d\u000a      work [3] provided\u000d\u000a      justification for this approach and she also served as a member of the\u000d\u000a      UKCP09 science steering\u000d\u000a      committee and as an international reviewer for Defra. Jones,\u000d\u000a      together with the University of\u000d\u000a      Newcastle, developed the UKCP09 weather generator (WGen) which allows\u000d\u000a      public and private\u000d\u000a      sector users to generate scenarios of local extreme weather events. The\u000d\u000a      UKCP09 scenarios\u000d\u000a      formed the basis of the 2012 National Climate Change Risk Assessment\u000d\u000a      [12] and have been used\u000d\u000a      by over 100 public and private sector organisations for developing their\u000d\u000a      adaptation strategies, e.g.\u000d\u000a      Network Rail; the Lighthouse Authority; Severn Trent Water; Anglian Water\u000d\u000a      [12]. Some of the\u000d\u000a      development work of WGen was undertaken for the Environment Agency which\u000d\u000a      now uses the\u000d\u000a      derived `EarWig' tool on an operational basis [13]. Further applications\u000d\u000a      of WGen are focused on\u000d\u000a      urban planning and adaptation decision-making by regional policymakers\u000d\u000a      such as the Greater\u000d\u000a      London Authority and third sector bodies such as the Commission for\u000d\u000a      Architecture and the Built\u000d\u000a      Environment and the Town and Country Planning Association. Through a\u000d\u000a      series of EU FP6 and 7\u000d\u000a      funded projects, the School's work on climate scenarios, impacts and\u000d\u000a      adaptation assessments has\u000d\u000a      informed the EU's 2009 White Paper on Adapting to Climate Change:\u000d\u000a        Towards a European\u000d\u000a        Framework for Action [14].\u000d\u000a    The School's work on adaptation has influenced the large-scale\u000d\u000a      disbursement of funds to\u000d\u000a      developing countries to adapt to the impacts of climate change. It has\u000d\u000a      informed the 2010 World\u000d\u000a      Development Report of the World Bank (Adger scientific advisor,\u000d\u000a      2008-2010) and contributed to\u000d\u000a      UNDP's Adaptation Policy Frameworks and FAO's 2009 assessment of\u000d\u000a      adaptation for fisheries as\u000d\u000a      part of World Food Summit [15].

Sustained work by scientists in the\u000d\u000a      School &#8212; Jones (in post\u000d\u000a      since 1976), Wigley (1978-2010), Goodess (since 1982) and Hulme\u000d\u000a      (1988-2013) &#8212; developed a\u000d\u000a      range of climate scenario methods and techniques, e.g. multi-model\u000d\u000a      scenario composites, regional\u000d\u000a      pattern-scaling, climate scenario generators and statistical weather\u000d\u000a      generators [1]. This work has\u000d\u000a      resulted in national, regional and global climate scenarios constructed\u000d\u000a      for UK and European\u000d\u000a      governments and for UN organisations. Building on this scenario work and\u000d\u000a      continuing today, work\u000d\u000a      by Goodess, Hulme, Jones, Warren (since 2002), Watkinson\u000d\u000a      (since 1976) has simulated the\u000d\u000a      physical and social impacts of climate change and extreme weather at\u000d\u000a      global, European [2] and\u000d\u000a      UK scales and for a wide range of sectors (water, agriculture, flooding,\u000d\u000a      built environments [3],\u000d\u000a      human migration, coastal processes, biodiversity and human health).\u000d\u000a      Risk-response metrics in a\u000d\u000a      number of these sectors have been developed [4], suitable for a wide range\u000d\u000a      of policy applications.\u000d\u000a    The winning by the School in 2000 of the joint Research Council contract\u000d\u000a      to establish the Tyndall\u000d\u000a      Centre (&#163;19m core funding, 2000-2009, plus over &#163;10m funding in levered\u000d\u000a      contracts) enabled one\u000d\u000a      of the world's earliest coherent research programmes on climate change\u000d\u000a      adaptation to be\u000d\u000a      established. This Tyndall Centre programme was led by School researchers (Adger\u000d\u000a      1992-2012;\u000d\u000a      O'Riordan since 1971, now Emeritus; Hulme) and has produced\u000d\u000a      over 200 peer-reviewed\u000d\u000a      publications and more than ten books with leading publishers; the current\u000d\u000a      Director is Corrine\u000d\u000a      LeQuerre (since 2005). The group pioneered the development of\u000d\u000a      metrics for vulnerability, adaptive\u000d\u000a      capacity, resilience and equity which have been applied to the design and\u000d\u000a      evaluation of adaptation\u000d\u000a      planning and decision-making in the UK and globally. This work has also\u000d\u000a      stimulated new thinking\u000d\u000a      around the principles of fair and resilent adaptation [5], with particular\u000d\u000a      applications to policies\u000d\u000a      dealing with coastal retreat and the rights of indigenous peoples. The\u000d\u000a      School's adaptation\u000d\u000a      programme also published research exploring the meaning of `dangerous\u000d\u000a        climate change' &#8212; a\u000d\u000a      central concept in international climate change negotiations &#8212; and on\u000d\u000a      establishing where limits to\u000d\u000a      adaptation to climate change may reside [6], be they in the policy system,\u000d\u000a      in wider society or in\u000d\u000a      human cognition.\u000d\u000a    The quality of our pre-eminent work on climate scenarios was evidenced\u000d\u000a      through CRU being\u000d\u000a      contracted to host the IPCC's scenario data centre from 1997 to 2002. The\u000d\u000a      world-leading research\u000d\u000a      in these areas is also evidenced through: a) Hulme being appointed\u000d\u000a      to co-convene the climate\u000d\u000a      scenarios chapter in the Third Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental\u000d\u000a      Panel on Climate\u000d\u000a      Change (IPCC); b) Adger to co-convene the adaptation chapter in\u000d\u000a      the Fourth Report; c) Adger to\u000d\u000a      co-convene the human security chapter and Warren the emergent\u000d\u000a      risks and key vulnerabilities\u000d\u000a      chapter in the Fifth Report; and d) Warren being appointed as\u000d\u000a      co-Chair elect of the new IPCC\u000d\u000a      Task Group on Data and Scenarios Support for Impact and Climate Analysis.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"1450","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"289688","Name":"Qatar"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    During the period 2008-2013 the world's governments have adopted an\u000d\u000a      agreed climate change mitigation policy goal of limiting global warming to\u000d\u000a      no more than 2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average\u000d\u000a      temperature. This was first agreed at the 15th Conference of\u000d\u000a      the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP15) in\u000d\u000a      Copenhagen in December 2009 [7] and was confirmed at COP18 in Doha in\u000d\u000a      December 2012 [8]. (This goal had originally been adopted by the EU in\u000d\u000a      1996 and re-confirmed in 2007, and was also adopted by the G8 Summit in\u000d\u000a      July 2009). In agreeing this goal it was necessary to note that the\u000d\u000a      global-mean warming observed thus far had been 0.8&#176;C &#8212; thus setting the\u000d\u000a      level of policy ambition necessary to limit further warming to no more\u000d\u000a      than 1.2&#176;C. This `2 degree' policy goal is now guiding national (e.g. UK &#8212;\u000d\u000a      see [9]), European [10] and international efforts to negotiate and\u000d\u000a      implement a range of policy measures which will be effective and\u000d\u000a      sustainable.\u000d\u000a    In reaching this global agreement at COP15, after 15 years of\u000d\u000a      international negotiations, the world's governments relied upon (see [7],\u000d\u000a      [8]) the four successive assessment reports of the UN's IPCC, published in\u000d\u000a      1990, 1996, 2001 and 2007 (and the Fifth Assessment Report agreed in\u000d\u000a      September 2013). The global temperature datasets produced by the School\u000d\u000a      were and continue to be central to these IPCC Reports; in particular, the\u000d\u000a      HadCRUT3 dataset was used for the 2007 Report which guided the COP15\u000d\u000a      negotiations [11]. The importance of these data for the international\u000d\u000a      negotiations is shown by the fact that the UN World Meteorological\u000d\u000a      Organisation (WMO) brought forward its press release for the annual update\u000d\u000a      of these data to November\/December, to coincide with the UNFCCC talks\u000d\u000a      being held at that time of year (e.g. WMO Press Release for the COP18 Doha\u000d\u000a      meeting [12]). This demonstrates that these data are vital for informing\u000d\u000a      decision-makers each year about the current state of world climate. The\u000d\u000a      work of the School &#8212; jointly with the Met Office Hadley Centre &#8212; in making\u000d\u000a      it possible to quantify and monitor the world's average surface\u000d\u000a      temperature has therefore directly contributed to this\u000d\u000a      internationally-agreed climate policy goal. Without these IPCC reports\u000d\u000a      being able to draw upon the School's work, very specifically upon\u000d\u000a      successive versions of the global temperature dataset, the importance of\u000d\u000a      addressing the dangers of anthropogenic climate change would be much less\u000d\u000a      well recognised and acknowledged by politicians and policy-makers around\u000d\u000a      the world. The impact of this work extends well beyond the IPCC and the\u000d\u000a      UNFCCC. The first diagram in many reports on climate change policy and\u000d\u000a      adaptation is the HadCRUT4 global temperature series (most recently by the\u000d\u000a      European Environment Agency [13]), and the update each year is headline\u000d\u000a      news in many media outlets. Indeed it is one of the most famous diagrams\u000d\u000a      in science.\u000d\u000a    The importance and significant impact of this work on national and\u000d\u000a      international climate policy and public engagement was vividly\u000d\u000a      demonstrated, but in a very different way, in November and December 2009.\u000d\u000a      Professional email correspondence between scientists in the School and\u000d\u000a      colleagues around the world was obtained illegally and made publicly\u000d\u000a      available via the internet. The subsequent controversy became known as `Climategate'\u000d\u000a      and revolved around a number of issues, but most critically whether the\u000d\u000a      School's temperature data (including reconstructed temperature data over\u000d\u000a      the last millennium) had been improperly manipulated. The importance of\u000d\u000a      this question, and hence the impact of the School's work in this area,\u000d\u000a      demanded a series of subsequent independent inquiries: by the House of\u000d\u000a      Commons Select Committee on Science &amp; Technology; the Muir-Russell\u000d\u000a      Independent Climate Change Email Review; and the Oxburgh Scientific\u000d\u000a      Assessment Panel. All of these Inquiries unambiguously affirmed the\u000d\u000a      quality and reliability of the School's work &#8212; [e.g. 14].\u000d\u000a    The School's unique work on global temperature data has also had impact\u000d\u000a      on public awareness, political negotiations and policy development on\u000d\u000a      climate change through its widespread use in Detection and Attribution\u000d\u000a      (D&amp;A) of climate change due to human activities. The scientific\u000d\u000a      community's efforts to reconstruct up to 2,000 years of past Northern\u000d\u000a      Hemisphere temperatures, in which the School has played a key role, helps\u000d\u000a      address a range of policy-relevant questions. Instrumental warming during\u000d\u000a      the 20th century is `clear and unequivocal' [11] and study of these longer\u000d\u000a      periods helps determine the unusualness of this warming in much longer\u000d\u000a      time sequences.\u000d\u000a    The School's datasets (HadCRUT4 and its precursor global temperatures,\u000d\u000a      Northern Hemisphere temperature proxies, and instrumental precipitation\u000d\u000a      data) have been used in almost all studies that have considered the\u000d\u000a      D&amp;A problem. The Special Report on Extremes (SREX) of the IPCC\u000d\u000a      extended D&amp;A to also consider the extremes of the climate as manifest\u000d\u000a      in temperature, precipitation and storm datasets [15] and again relied\u000d\u000a      upon the School's datasets. The School's datasets are widely used by many\u000d\u000a      less-developed governments around the world. Access is through the World\u000d\u000a      Bank [16], who have taken our `national' products for all UN countries and\u000d\u000a      recognized territories (developed in Ref [3] above) and extended the work\u000d\u000a      to additionally include all major river basins of the world.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Knowledge of the changing global temperature has contributed to an\u000d\u000a      international political agreement being reached about the over-arching\u000d\u000a      objective of climate change mitigation policies. The School's scientists\u000d\u000a      have made a crucial contribution to one of only three datasets that reveal\u000d\u000a      changes to the world's average temperature over the last 150 years.

Collaboration with the Met Office Hadley Centre (MOHC) has\u000d\u000a      led to the construction of one of only three global (land and marine)\u000d\u000a      temperature datasets in the world (currently named `HadCRUT4'). It is also\u000d\u000a      the longest established dataset having, for the first time in 1986,\u000d\u000a      combined global land and marine temperature reconstructions. The School\u000d\u000a      produces the land component (CRUTEM4) [1], and MOHC the marine component,\u000d\u000a      which are combined to form the global instrumental temperature dataset\u000d\u000a      HadCRUT4 (1850 to present day) [2]. Despite improvements in data\u000d\u000a      availability in many parts of the world, these new versions closely\u000d\u000a      resemble earlier versions, indicating the robustness of the series.\u000d\u000a      Differences between the newer and older versions are within the ranges of\u000d\u000a      error estimation, the techniques of which were first established in 1997\u000d\u000a      by School scientists (Jones, Osborn, Wigley, Briffa). An update of\u000d\u000a      the highly-cited dataset (CRU TS 2.1) [3] providing spatially-infilled and\u000d\u000a      high-resolution (0.5 by 0.5 degrees latitude\/longitude) land grids of\u000d\u000a      temperature, precipitation, vapour pressure and cloud cover has recently\u000d\u000a      been completed (version 3.10). Several other datasets (circulation indices\u000d\u000a      such as the North Atlantic and Southern Oscillations) have been developed\u000d\u000a      through the critical analysis of instrumental records and are routinely\u000d\u000a      updated on the School's CRU website (http:\/\/www.cru.uea.ac.uk).\u000a      As evidenced by citation and download statistics, all the above datasets\u000d\u000a      are very widely used.\u000d\u000a    The School has been responsible for widely adopted methodological\u000d\u000a      advances in the field of past climate reconstruction [4] and has produced\u000d\u000a      multiple spatially-detailed and regionally-averaged reconstructions of\u000d\u000a      various climate parameters. The School is well known for its\u000d\u000a      reconstruction of mean summer temperature changes, extending over\u000d\u000a      centuries to millennia in different regions of the world. Scientists in\u000d\u000a      the School (Briffa, Jones and Osborn) have produced\u000d\u000a      [5], or contributed to, widely cited and utilised reconstructions of\u000d\u000a      average Northern Hemisphere temperature changes over the last 1,000 years,\u000d\u000a      some based solely on tree-ring data and others based on compendia of\u000d\u000a      multi-proxy sources.\u000d\u000a    Some scientific applications of these palaeo- and instrumental climate\u000d\u000a      datasets are specifically linked to climate models and their simulations\u000d\u000a      of future climate. It is through comparison of the instrumental and\u000d\u000a      palaeoclimate datasets with climate model simulations that climate models\u000d\u000a      are improved. More importantly though, the comparisons lead to Detection\u000d\u000a      and Attribution (D&amp;A) studies where temperature changes in the past\u000d\u000a      are explained through the causes of climate change (the sun, greenhouse\u000d\u000a      gases, sulphate aerosols, volcanoes, etc). In 1996, School scientists (Jones\u000d\u000a      and Wigley) were the first to detect unusual warming in the\u000d\u000a      atmosphere (above the surface) and to attribute this to anthropogenic\u000d\u000a      causes [6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"1451","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Impacts on Ozone Depletion: Through emission controls of\u000d\u000a      certain halocarbons, the Montreal Protocol on `Substances that Deplete\u000d\u000a        the Ozone Layer' has been hugely successful in avoiding ozone\u000d\u000a      depletion and has thus protected the global population from increased UV\u000d\u000a      radiation and ozone-related climate change. The Montreal Protocol is an\u000d\u000a      international agreement which was initially adopted in 1987, but is an\u000d\u000a      on-going process by which the Parties are informed of the latest science\u000d\u000a      through international WMO Assessments (hereafter referred to as\u000d\u000a      Assessments) provided by a Scientific Assessment Panel of experts every 4\u000d\u000a      years, and, based on these, the Parties have agreed Amendments to the\u000d\u000a      Protocol [7].

(i) Research in\u000d\u000a      the earlier part of the REF research-period has fed through the\u000d\u000a      Assessments into internationally agreed Amendments to the Protocol and\u000d\u000a      subsequent national policies, which have in turn led to observable\u000d\u000a      declines in emissions and atmospheric concentrations of ozone depleting\u000d\u000a      substances during the REF impact- period.

The Head of the Global\u000d\u000a        Atmosphere Division in the UK Department of the Environment has\u000d\u000a      provided a testimonial to confirm this [10].\u000d\u000a    Below are 2 examples where the impact of our research has been\u000d\u000a        observable in the environment during 2008-13:\u000d\u000a    Example 1a - Halons:\u000d\u000a      UEA research contributed to the science which led to strengthening of the\u000d\u000a      Montreal Protocol, resulting in an observable decline in bromine from\u000d\u000a      halons during 2008-13, as corroborated by the Co-Chair of the\u000d\u000a        Scientific Assessment Panel: \"Despite halon emission controls in\u000d\u000a        developed countries, UEA research (Fraser et al, 1999) showed continuing\u000d\u000a        increase in global emissions of the most abundant halon and alerted\u000d\u000a        Parties to the growth in atmospheric concentrations of a previously\u000d\u000a        undetected halon (1202). Consequently the Protocol resolved to identify\u000d\u000a        the sources of halon-1202 and introduced controls on the other halons\u000d\u000a        for developing countries. The impact has been that global emissions of\u000d\u000a        all halons have fallen dramatically, with concentrations of all but one\u000d\u000a        halon declining during the 2008-13 period (Newland et al, 2013).\"\u000d\u000a      [9]. \u000d\u000a    Example 1b - Methyl Bromide:\u000d\u000a      UEA research contributed to the science which led to methyl bromide\u000d\u000a      becoming a controlled substance under the Montreal Protocol in 1997 and to\u000d\u000a      subsequent Amendments and hence to lower atmospheric concentrations in\u000d\u000a      2008-13 [7, 11, 12].

The same UEA research that has underpinned the Montreal Protocol has\u000d\u000a      therefore contributed to the climate forcing benefits of the Protocol.\u000d\u000a    However, the gain from reductions in the emissions of the CFCs and halons\u000d\u000a      is threatened by the transition to other non-ozone-depleting halocarbons\u000d\u000a      as replacement compounds, many of which are strong greenhouse gases (e.g.\u000d\u000a      HFCs). These replacement halocarbons are therefore included in the\u000d\u000a      WMO Ozone Assessments along with other fluorinated compounds that are\u000d\u000a      potent greenhouse gases (i.e. PFCs) because of their climate\u000d\u000a      impact even though they are not ozone- depleting substances.

In line with the Montreal\u000d\u000a      Protocol, which is aimed at protection of stratospheric ozone, we\u000d\u000a      initially focussed our research on chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and the\u000d\u000a      powerful bromine-containing halons and methyl bromide\u000d\u000a      [e.g. 1, 2]. As `replacement' compounds (hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs)\u000d\u000a      and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)) were introduced, we shifted our\u000d\u000a      focus towards these [e.g. 3, 4] and other highly potent greenhouse gases\u000d\u000a      (i.e. fully fluorinated compounds [e.g. 5]). Subsequently we have\u000d\u000a      gained international recognition for being the first to detect many of\u000d\u000a      these compounds in the atmosphere (e.g. Halon 1202 [1], HFC-23\u000d\u000a      [4], HFC-227ea and SF5CF3\u000d\u000a      [5]).\u000d\u000a    Research in this area started at UEA in 1985, but for the purpose of this\u000d\u000a      impact case study when we refer to UEA research we mean that since 1993.\u000d\u000a      This has been supported by over &#163;3M from the Dept. of the Environment, EU\u000d\u000a      and NERC, and has resulted in nearly 50 papers in international\u000d\u000a      peer-reviewed journals. The work makes use of highly sensitive\u000d\u000a      laboratory-based, and field- deployed mass spectrometers, allowing\u000d\u000a      measurements from ground-stations, aircraft, stratospheric balloons,\u000d\u000a      ships, deep polar snow (firn) and ice cores. The analyses we make allow us\u000d\u000a      to track atmospheric temporal trends of halocarbons and to assess their\u000d\u000a      origins, emission rates and atmospheric lifetimes. These parameters are\u000d\u000a      crucial in the determination of policies for their regulation, and are\u000d\u000a      fundamental to the calculation of metrics commonly used by policymakers\u000d\u000a      such as Ozone Depletion Potentials and Global Warming Potentials.\u000d\u000a    By examining long-term records we have assessed the impact of human\u000d\u000a      activities on the burden of gases in the atmosphere. We collaborate with\u000d\u000a      CSIRO in Australia to make measurements on the Cape Grim, Tasmania air\u000d\u000a      archive which dates from 1978 [e.g. 1, 3, 4, 5], and have extended this\u000d\u000a      record backwards in time via measurements in firn and ice cores from the\u000d\u000a      Arctic and Antarctic [e.g. 5], in part through UEA-led EU projects.\u000d\u000a      Coupled to the observational work is a modelling capability from which we\u000d\u000a      determine `top-down' global emission estimates (i.e. constrained by\u000d\u000a      atmospheric observations) for comparison with other emission estimates\u000d\u000a      (including `bottom-up' industrial estimates). This has identified large\u000d\u000a      inaccuracies with industrial estimates for several halocarbons, including\u000d\u000a      the halons [1], HCFC-142b [3], HFC-23 [4],\u000d\u000a      perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and chloroform.\u000d\u000a    There has been intense political debate over the control, under the\u000d\u000a      Montreal Protocol, of the man- made fumigant methyl bromide as it\u000d\u000a      also has poorly constrained natural sources and sinks. We have undertaken\u000d\u000a      modelling and measurement studies of specific sources of methyl bromide\u000d\u000a      (e.g. marine, automobile) and of long-term trends of its atmospheric\u000d\u000a      concentration leading to improved understanding of its atmospheric budget\u000d\u000a      and the anthropogenic contribution [e.g. 2].\u000d\u000a    Our measurements from balloons, research aircraft and commercial aircraft\u000d\u000a      [e.g. 6] have allowed us to determine the important, but previously poorly\u000d\u000a      known, contribution of the mostly unregulated halogenated `very\u000d\u000a        short-lived substances' (VSLS) to the stratospheric bromine\u000d\u000a      burden.

Through inter-disciplinary collaboration with social\u000d\u000a      scientists, environmental economists and numerous NGOs, Peres (at\u000d\u000a      UEA since 1997) and Dolman (since 1996) have investigated\u000d\u000a      large-scale human, economic and policy impacts on tropical and temperate\u000d\u000a      biodiversity, providing an evidence-base for sustainable management.\u000d\u000a    Dolman with others helped introduce the necessity for, and a model\u000d\u000a      of, evidence-based approaches to biodiversity conservation [1].\u000d\u000a      Quantitative research demonstrated that existing conservation approaches\u000d\u000a      were largely based on uncorroborated anecdotal evidence. An evidence-\u000d\u000a      based approach to conservation intervention was advocated, applying the\u000d\u000a      Cochrane medical framework for evidence of the effectiveness of\u000d\u000a      interventions. Dolman has since conducted a large body of research\u000d\u000a      providing the evidence-base for conservation management issues in several\u000d\u000a      vulnerable habitats.\u000d\u000a    Despite widespread adoption of evidence-based approaches to\u000d\u000a      interventions, strategic biodiversity conservation policy remains largely\u000d\u000a      incomplete in the UK; in terms of what biodiversity is prioritised and the\u000d\u000a      poor integration of species into habitat- or landscape-scale approaches. Dolman\u000d\u000a      developed an innovative Biodiversity Audit Approach - a framework to\u000d\u000a      quantify regional biodiversity and objectively identify priorities [2].\u000d\u000a      This demonstrated that numbers of priority species were one or two orders\u000d\u000a      of magnitude greater than recognised in Biodiversity Action Planning and\u000d\u000a      provided a novel methodology that defined integrated guilds of priority\u000d\u000a      species, supporting cost- effective evidence-based management for multiple\u000d\u000a      taxa [2].\u000d\u000a    Peres leads a major tropical forest conservation science programme\u000d\u000a      resulting in highly-cited papers that are used by lobbyists and advocates\u000d\u000a      to influence policy at national (e.g. Brazil) and global scales. Research\u000d\u000a      has focused on the biodiversity consequences of land-use and subsistence\u000d\u000a      game hunting (e.g. [3]) and the ramifying ecosystem effects of\u000d\u000a      community-based extraction of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) on forest\u000d\u000a      dynamics. Demographic studies on non- timber extraction systems in\u000d\u000a      tropical forests (e.g. [4]) have informed management plans of Extractive\u000d\u000a      Reserves throughout lowland Amazonia and introduced new guidelines to the\u000d\u000a      way sustainable use forest reserves are managed. Landscape ecology studies\u000d\u000a      in a highly fragmented forest region of southern Amazonia (e.g. [5])\u000d\u000a      provided evidence to the Brazilian National Senate and Lower House to\u000d\u000a      refute disastrous legislative reforms of the Brazilian Forest Bill, which\u000d\u000a      would erode minimum forest set-asides that are legally required within 5.3\u000d\u000a      million rural properties within Brazil's 8.5M km2.\u000d\u000a    In Asia and Africa, Dolman has demonstrated dependence of a suite\u000d\u000a      of critically threatened tropical species on traditional livelihoods in\u000d\u000a      farmed or pastoral landscapes within developing countries [6]. This\u000d\u000a      challenged the more common focus of conservation in tropical anthropogenic\u000d\u000a      landscapes of mitigating human impacts in natural ecosystems, particularly\u000d\u000a      forests. It offers win- win synergies by linking conservation delivery to\u000d\u000a      livelihood entitlements of marginalised rural communities, both of which\u000d\u000a      are often threatened by inappropriate development and land sequestration.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"1989","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    From the outset community engagement was a core element of the Dunluce\u000d\u000a      project.

It played a\u000d\u000a      significant role in the socio-economic and political life of both areas\u000d\u000a      and familial connections from the medieval period remain evident in\u000d\u000a      today's communities. A 5 year programme of excavation and survey work led\u000d\u000a      by Dr. Colin Breen (lecturer \/ senior lecturer at the University of Ulster\u000d\u000a      since 1999), and funded by the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, was\u000d\u000a      initiated at Dunluce Castle in 2008 examining these past connections.\u000d\u000a      Prior to this project little was known about the material culture and\u000d\u000a      lifeways that bound these past peoples together. This ambitious\u000d\u000a      undertaking was the first large-scale project to address the historical\u000d\u000a      archaeology of the late medieval period of this region.\u000d\u000a    Dunluce Castle is one of Ireland's most substantial and best preserved\u000d\u000a      medieval castle complexes but, surprisingly, had not been previously\u000d\u000a      studied in any systematic way. The architecture of the Castle illustrates\u000d\u000a      the complexity of Ireland's political, economic and cultural life during\u000d\u000a      the medieval period and the building expresses the complex broader\u000d\u000a      cultural influences of this area (Breen, 2012a).\u000d\u000a    Excavations within the castle uncovered an early sequence of cultural\u000d\u000a      activity dating back to the Iron Age. The undisturbed remains of an early\u000d\u000a      17-century town, discovered outside the castle walls by Breen in 2008,\u000d\u000a      represent one of the best preserved examples of the period, unparalleled\u000d\u000a      across the globe in terms of its preservation. The key research findings\u000d\u000a      from this project have revealed that the settlement was one of the\u000d\u000a      earliest examples of a regionally planned town in the early modern period\u000d\u000a      and the archaeology has provided key insights into the functioning and\u000d\u000a      structure of society at the close of the middle ages. They have also shown\u000d\u000a      that this urban site was established a number of years earlier than the\u000d\u000a      official Plantation of County Londonderry, supported by the Crown in\u000d\u000a      London, and this result significantly alters the official histories of\u000d\u000a      early 17th-century Ulster. This settlement should be understood\u000d\u000a      as part of a broader cultural process within the context of British\u000d\u000a      colonial expansion and the newly founded towns and settlements across\u000d\u000a      north America such as at Jamestown, Virginia, the first permanent English\u000d\u000a      settlement in the New World.\u000d\u000a    Insights into this `unofficial' plantation by Randal MacDonnell can only\u000d\u000a      be provided by archaeology due to the paucity of surviving historical\u000d\u000a      sources (Breen, 2012b).To support the emerging cultural insights from the\u000d\u000a      Dunluce project further investigations subsequently took place at Kinbane,\u000d\u000a      Ballylough and Ballyreagh castles in north Ulster and at both Dunstaffnage\u000d\u000a      castle and Dun Mhuirich in Argyll and at Dun Cholla on Colonsay (Breen et\u000d\u000a      al., 2010). Each of these sites provided a detailed regional context for\u000d\u000a      later medieval societal and landscape change and significantly enhanced\u000d\u000a      our understandings of that period (Breen 2012b; Forsythe et al., 2012).\u000d\u000a      This research highlights the significance of the historic built heritage\u000d\u000a      and associated material culture across both localities, which have been\u000d\u000a      neglected and undervalued resources, and is examining ways by which the\u000d\u000a      better utilisation of this resource can contribute to building more\u000d\u000a      resilient and sustainable societies.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"1990","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"248816","Name":"Jordan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Two policy impacts related to the Republic of Ireland's obligations under\u000d\u000a      the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) and Waste Directive (WD) resulted\u000d\u000a      from this research; achieving at least good ecological status in water\u000d\u000a      bodies by 2015 and providing a strategy for mitigating septic tank system\u000d\u000a      pollution. Respectively:\u000d\u000a    In 2009 the Irish Government approached Teagasc to provide a scientific\u000d\u000a      assessment of the bio- physical lag-times associated with soil phosphorus\u000d\u000a      decline and nitrate enrichment of groundwaters in agricultural catchments.\u000d\u000a      Due to his experience with nutrient transfer science, Prof Jordan was\u000d\u000a      asked by Teagasc (during his secondment period) to investigate these\u000d\u000a      processes and assess the potential of the River Basin Management Plans in\u000d\u000a      Ireland to meet the goals of the WFD and achieve at least good ecological\u000d\u000a      water status by 2015.\u000d\u000a    The results showed that, while the measures to mitigate excessive\u000d\u000a      phosphorus in soils and nitrate enrichment of groundwaters were sound,\u000d\u000a      there were bio-physical constraints that would ultimately hinder water\u000d\u000a      quality measures to be met in the time specified. The original measures\u000d\u000a      could achieve the targets set by the WFD but only if sufficient time were\u000d\u000a      allowed to accrue between implementation and compliance.\u000d\u000a    Specifically, the soil phosphorus decline model developed by the team at\u000d\u000a      Teagasc, based on realistic farm management scenarios, estimated that\u000d\u000a      improvements in soil phosphorus status to meet the requirements of the WFD\u000d\u000a      may take up to 20 years (Schulte et al., 2010); longer than anticipated\u000d\u000a      and beyond the original target deadline of 2015 for achieving at least\u000d\u000a      good water quality status. In addition, the groundwater quality models and\u000d\u000a      simulations developed by Fenton et al. (2011) suggested that acceptable\u000d\u000a      nitrate concentrations would only be achieved between 2019 and 2033, if\u000d\u000a      mitigation were implemented by 2012.\u000d\u000a    These findings provided further evidence for a more phased time frame for\u000d\u000a      compliance with the WFD water quality targets and as a direct result, and\u000d\u000a      following consultation with the EU, all River Basin Management Plan\u000d\u000a      targets were amended to account for revised lag-times - up to 2027 for\u000d\u000a      achieving 100% good status1,2. The work has greatly benefitted\u000d\u000a      the Irish Department of Environment, Community and Local Government which\u000d\u000a      has overall administrative responsibility for WFD compliance via\u000d\u000a      individual River Basin Districts3. Without coherent mitigation\u000d\u000a      measures in place and a scientific assessment of the likelihood of these\u000d\u000a      measures to correct water quality impairment by the 2015 target date,\u000d\u000a      Ireland would have been at risk of investigation and charge by the\u000d\u000a      European Court.\u000d\u000a    Further, as a consequence of a European Court order under the WD on a\u000d\u000a      water quality infringement resulting from the poor regulation of septic\u000d\u000a      tank systems, the Irish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has\u000d\u000a      introduced a process of registration, inspection and mitigation works in\u000d\u000a      rural areas. Previously, pathogenic contamination of groundwater from\u000d\u000a      faecal matter in 25.4% of water samples was referred to the European Court\u000d\u000a      of Justice resulting in a lump sum fine of &#8364;1,8m and a daily penalty\u000d\u000a      payment of &#8364;19k until the infringement ended. Research led by Prof Jordan\u000d\u000a      identified the environmental risk to surface waters from low level\u000d\u000a      persistent effluent discharges especially in areas with high septic system\u000d\u000a      density and low soil permeability (Arnscheidt et al., 2007; Macintosh et\u000d\u000a      al., 2011). This research was recognised by EPA hydrometric and ecology\u000d\u000a      sections and a revised inspection plan now includes a methodology to\u000d\u000a      include environmental (as well as health) risk to both ground and surface\u000d\u000a      waters4,5.

As a direct development of this\u000d\u000a      research, in 2004 Prof Jordan led the EU INTERREG IIIa funded Blackwater\u000d\u000a      TRACE (Trans-boundary River-basin Action for Community and Environment)\u000d\u000a      project which sought to test the efficacy of emerging and proposed WFD\u000d\u000a      mitigation measures. The project collected high resolution chemical water\u000d\u000a      quality data sets in three small (3-5 km2) grassland\u000d\u000a      agricultural sub-catchments and developed a bankside analyser\u000d\u000a      instrumentation suite from equipment which had formerly been used in water\u000d\u000a      treatment plants. This novel approach revolutionised bankside water\u000d\u000a      sampling (Jordan et al., 2007) as, for the first time, long term high\u000d\u000a      resolution (sub-hourly) water quality data sets could be collected,\u000d\u000a      synchronous with river discharge. These data were subsequently used to\u000d\u000a      test theories of river chemistry monitoring from less frequent data and to\u000d\u000a      evaluate the use of new technology passive samplers (Jordan et al., 2013).\u000d\u000a    The technique of high resolution nutrient monitoring in rivers has since\u000d\u000a      been emulated in a number of high profile catchment studies (e.g. the\u000d\u000a      Irish Agricultural Catchments Programme, the UK Demonstration Tests\u000d\u000a      Catchments, and the North Wyke Farm Platform).\u000d\u000a    Blackwater TRACE included specific research into reducing phosphorus from\u000d\u000a      excessively fertilised soils and replacing defective septic tank systems;\u000d\u000a      the high resolution monitoring demonstrated pressures from these sources\u000d\u000a      at both high and low river discharges. The results clearly showed that\u000d\u000a      soil phosphorus declines would be slow to achieve in the impermeable soils\u000d\u000a      near the Blackwater River and would not necessarily be mirrored by\u000d\u000a      synchronous changes in phosphorus concentrations during diffuse high flows\u000d\u000a      in rivers. Through additional research, the results also demonstrated that\u000d\u000a      replacing defective septic tank systems would only be successful if a\u000d\u000a      planning strategy to avoid clusters (i.e. increased densities) in\u000d\u000a      headwater systems was developed (Macintosh et al., 2011) - otherwise\u000d\u000a      septic tanks would continue to be an environmental risk to the on-going\u000d\u000a      eutrophication of headwaters during low summer flows in Ireland and\u000d\u000a      elsewhere (Arnscheidt et al., 2007).\u000d\u000a    These themes were continued and augmented by Prof Jordan during a three\u000d\u000a      year secondment period as Principal Scientist to Teagasc, the Irish\u000d\u000a      Agriculture and Food Development Authority (01\/01\/09 to 31\/12\/11). In one\u000d\u000a      study during this period, the decline of excessive soil phosphorus was\u000d\u000a      modelled to predict the time taken to reduce to an agronomic optimum under\u000d\u000a      fertiliser deficit scenarios - and so become environmentally benign to\u000d\u000a      diffuse pollution (Schulte et al., 2010). Here, lag-time scenarios of\u000d\u000a      7-20+ years were predicted, independent of soil type, and this validated\u000d\u000a      the work in the Blackwater River catchment. In a partner study, a\u000d\u000a      groundwater model of nitrate- nitrogen flux was developed to show how\u000d\u000a      there was also a lag-time associated with high nitrate concentrations\u000d\u000a      leaving a polluted aquifer and that this was dependent on metrics of soil\u000d\u000a      permeability and on the geology controlling both vertical and lateral\u000d\u000a      nitrate fluxes (Fenton et al., 2011).\u000d\u000a    During the secondment period the number of high resolution nutrient\u000d\u000a      monitoring stations in Ireland was increased from three to nine in order\u000d\u000a      to investigate diffuse and point source pollution processes across a\u000d\u000a      land-use gradient. Soil controls on diffuse pollution were validated in\u000d\u000a      multiple soil types (Jordan et al., 2012) and the impacts of septic tank\u000d\u000a      systems were reproduced. The techniques have also been used for the first\u000d\u000a      time to investigate nutrient fluxes from karst springs and this on-going\u000d\u000a      research has developed theories of critical source areas of diffuse P\u000d\u000a      pollution in karst landscapes.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"1991","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Adoption of the Northern Ireland Countryside Survey habitat research\u000a      methodology by NIEA across the whole of the rural countryside and upland\u000a      landscapes was key to the development by NIEA of regional biodiversity\u000a      management strategies1,2.

The\u000a      research, which became known as the Northern Ireland Countryside Survey\u000a      (NICS) was extended to all four AONBs in NI, two Environmentally Sensitive\u000a      Areas (DARD funded) and then, in 1992 (NI Department of Environment\u000a      funded), to the whole of NI (Cooper et al., 2003). It contributed to the\u000a      development of the then growing field of European landscape-scale ecology\u000a      and its applications to countryside management (Cooper et al., 1996).\u000a    In 1998, a second NICS (NIEA funded) assessed the extent of change and\u000a      showed that the main land use drivers were agricultural intensification,\u000a      industrial forestry and rural development (Cooper et al., 2003). For the\u000a      first time, a NI scientific evidence base linking land use change to\u000a      terrestrial habitat biodiversity loss in NI was available to\u000a      policy-makers. The research also showed, again for the first time, that\u000a      habitat sampling intensity influences the structure of numerical habitat\u000a      classifications and that area-proportional sampling design linked\u000a      explicitly to landscape structure is required to avoid biased\u000a      environmental decision-making based on such classifications (Cooper et\u000a      al., 2006).\u000a    A third phase of NICS, initiated in 2007 (NIEA funded), developed\u000a      hypothesis-based habitat monitoring and completed a 20-year time-series\u000a      data set quantifying trends in habitat biodiversity and ecological\u000a      condition (Cooper et al., 2009). Key findings were that seminatural\u000a      habitat conversion to agricultural grassland and forestry, the\u000a      scrubbing-up of marginal farmland and the removal of hedges and earth\u000a      banks had occurred and that there had been a large increase in the rate of\u000a      rural building over a wide range of seminatural habitats. (McKenzie et\u000a      al., 2011).

Of key importance was establishing the\u000d\u000a      effect that these faults would have on the integrity of caprocks and the\u000d\u000a      compartmentalisation of reservoirs. Caprocks are especially important for\u000d\u000a      resource exploitation (hydrocarbons, groundwater and subsurface CO2\u000d\u000a      sequestration) because they have intrinsically low permeability, hindering\u000d\u000a      the movement of fluids in the subsurface and providing potential barriers\u000d\u000a      for the escape of resource or toxic fluids to the Earth's surface.\u000d\u000a    This work allowed Cardiff to capture new investment from major\u000d\u000a      international hydrocarbon exploration companies. An example is the new\u000d\u000a      Block 17\/06 oil field in offshore Angola, the largest oil field in West\u000d\u000a      Africa and one of the largest in the world to be affected by polygonal and\u000d\u000a      associated fault families. In 2012 TOTAL, Sonangol P&amp;P, Partex Oil and\u000d\u000a      Gas, SSI Seventeen, Falcon Oil and ACR funded a new large Cardiff-led\u000d\u000a      consortium to analyse the interaction between deeper fault families and\u000d\u000a      the polygonal faults dissecting caprocks that develop within reservoirs in\u000d\u000a      the Angola Block. In presenting a new model for the formation, evolution\u000d\u000a      and sealing properties of polygonal and other types of faults, data\u000d\u000a      produced by Cardiff is directly informing the development planning for\u000d\u000a      this major resource, part of a project costed at in excess of $10Bn.\u000d\u000a    The Block 17\/06 project is working to minimise the geological\u000d\u000a      uncertainties of key reservoir succession in offshore Angola. The study is\u000d\u000a      looking at the role of fault systems in the migration of fluids between\u000d\u000a      pre-salt, Albian rafts and Oligo-Miocene channels, in which some of the\u000d\u000a      largest oil fields in Angola are located (such as CLOV, Girassol, Dalia,\u000d\u000a      Rosa), and indicating the regions of larger connectivity between reservoir\u000d\u000a      intervals. This involves investigating distinct structural architectures\u000d\u000a      and styles of compartmentalization as these may cause significant\u000d\u000a      variations in reservoir volumes, wettability and pressures that can have a\u000d\u000a      profound impact on CO2 production and underground injection.\u000d\u000a      The project follows the methods extensively proven in the pioneer work in\u000d\u000a      rafts from SE Brazil by Alves (2012) and provides the consortium with a Connectivity\u000a        Index to assess exploration risks prior to drilling.\u000d\u000a    Professional practice\u000d\u000a    The risk of seal failure is difficult to assess and is a significant\u000d\u000a      concern for the hydrocarbon industry; it is responsible for many failed\u000d\u000a      exploration boreholes, and accounts for billions of dollars annually. The\u000d\u000a      research on polygonal faulting has shifted the risk assessment approach\u000d\u000a      from a laboratory-scale investigation of the physical properties of\u000d\u000a      samples of seals to a more holistic approach in which petrophysical data\u000d\u000a      is used to calibrate three-dimensional seismic data. Through its\u000d\u000a      geological analysis of seismic data to characterise seal integrity,\u000d\u000a      Cardiff has been fundamental in this shift of emphasis within the\u000d\u000a      industry.\u000d\u000a    The methodology established by Cardiff has been disseminated to industry\u000d\u000a      through the CAPROCKS and Block 17\/06 consortia. CAPROCKS was originally\u000d\u000a      funded by ten major oil companies (including Shell, BP, ExxonMobil,\u000d\u000a      Statoil, BG Group and Total). Block 17\/06 is sponsored by five major oil\u000d\u000a      companies. These companies apply the results produced by Cardiff to\u000d\u000a      redesign workflows used to assess the quality of caprock seals, and\u000d\u000a      develop new software and models of reservoir and seal units.\u000d\u000a    Environmental impact\u000d\u000a    The wider societal and environmental impacts of this research include\u000d\u000a      identifying sites for the underground disposal of CO2 as a\u000d\u000a      climate change mitigation activity. For underground CO2\u000d\u000a      disposal, the long-term containment capability is predicated on seal\u000d\u000a      integrity to prevent the leakage of CO2 back to the surface. It\u000d\u000a      has the potential, according to the International Energy Agency (2008), of\u000d\u000a      reducing greenhouse gas emission by 20% by 2050.\u000d\u000a    The Cardiff approach to assessing seal quality has also helped secure\u000d\u000a      funding for a consortium of twelve academic and civil protection\u000d\u000a      institutions, sponsored by the European Commission, to assess oil spill\u000d\u000a      risks and set up workflows for marine pollution accidents in the Eastern\u000d\u000a      Mediterranean (Cyprus, Israel, Lebanon and Greece). The work of CAPROCKS\u000d\u000a      and Block 17\/06 consortia on seal quality is also being used to predict\u000d\u000a      the areas where the possibility of seal fracturing as a result of CO2\u000d\u000a      injection is much reduced.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Economic gains by oil and gas companies, improvements in professional\u000d\u000a      practice in hydrocarbon exploration, and environmental benefits from\u000d\u000a      identifying CO2 disposal sites have been achieved through a\u000d\u000a      Cardiff-led consortium with industry.

In 1994, Professor Joe Cartwright, then at\u000d\u000a      Imperial College, discovered a type of fault system that did not conform\u000d\u000a      to this standard model. These faults were identified using geophysical\u000d\u000a      imaging of 3D seismic data; firstly in the North Sea Basin and, subsequent\u000d\u000a      to Cartwright's move to a Chair at Cardiff in 1999, in over 200 basins\u000d\u000a      worldwide [3.1]. The faults are characterised by their polygonal pattern,\u000d\u000a      similar to shrinkage cracks on a dried-out lake bed, albeit developed at a\u000d\u000a      much larger scale. Research then focused on establishing their effect on\u000d\u000a      the integrity of caprocks and the compartmentalisation of reservoirs. The\u000d\u000a      caprocks are especially important for resource exploitation (hydrocarbons,\u000d\u000a      groundwater and latterly subsurface CO2 sequestration) because\u000d\u000a      they have intrinsically low permeability, hindering the movement of fluids\u000d\u000a      in the subsurface and providing potential barriers to the escape of\u000d\u000a      resource or toxic fluids to the Earth's surface.\u000d\u000a    After a first stage largely funded by the hydrocarbon Industry (CAPROCKS\u000d\u000a      consortium) and NERC, research undertaken at Cardiff focused on the\u000d\u000a      development of models for the formation of polygonal faults. The first\u000d\u000a      possible triggering processes considered were a) high pore fluid pressure\u000d\u000a      or b) syneresis (a process by which gels spontaneously contract under\u000d\u000a      inter-particle forces) [3.1]. Neither explanation was fully satisfactory\u000d\u000a      from a theoretical viewpoint. Polygonal faults could not be explained\u000d\u000a      using standard rock or soil mechanical theory, since they defined a bulk\u000d\u000a      volumetric contraction of the medium in which they formed [3.1]. More\u000d\u000a      recent work has implicated volumetric contraction during diagenesis [3.1].\u000d\u000a      Following the award of a NERC grant on the genesis of polygonal faults,\u000d\u000a      efforts concentrated on recognition of the timing of fault formation from\u000d\u000a      2008 to August 2012. Tiago Alves (lecturer) also started to make a\u000d\u000a      contribution to this work, which is on-going. Between 2007 and 2010 he\u000d\u000a      added quantifiable geophysical and structural data to the initial results\u000d\u000a      [3.2].\u000d\u000a    This led to the discovery of significant controls on the reactivation of\u000d\u000a      early faults on both reservoir and caprock intervals [3.3] and, later, on\u000d\u000a      the recognition of an important degree of internal organisation in blocky\u000d\u000a      and faulted submarine mass-flows, which are commonly part of caprocks\u000d\u000a      [3.4]. Cardiff's work has now demonstrated conclusively that faulted and\u000d\u000a      blocky caprock intervals have important implications for the degree of\u000d\u000a      connectivity between reservoir units, and to the seal competence of\u000d\u000a      caprocks [3.5].\u000d\u000a    From this research, a novel approach to assessing seal quality has been\u000d\u000a      developed by Alves and Cartwright in conjunction with Aplin (Newcastle) (http:\/\/research.ncl.ac.uk\/caprocks\/).\u000a      Cartwright left Cardiff in 2012, but the work is being continued by Alves.\u000d\u000a      The value of the research on seal quality was recognised by The Royal\u000d\u000a      Society and the Wolfson Foundation, which invested &#163;200K in a new\u000d\u000a      laboratory for CO2 sequestration in Cardiff in 2008.

The combination of specialist knowledge and analytical facilities\u000a      at Cardiff allows the total distribution of PGE within ores, metallurgical\u000a      products or other samples to be mapped and quantified; impacting both on\u000a      exploration efficiency and reducing costs at deposits such as Aguablanca\u000a      and Sudbury5.1,5.2. The evolution of these research- led\u000a      technologies has led to collaborations with major PGE producers and junior\u000a      exploration companies. Examples of these industrial impacts include:\u000a    Collaboration with Anglo Platinum Ltd (McDonald) resulted in the\u000a      identification of staging chambers below the world's third largest PGE\u000a      deposit (the Platreef) where highly PGE-rich sulphide liquids were\u000a      concentrated3.3.

Prichard's research on\u000a      PGM at the Aguablanca Ni-PGE deposit in Spain began in 2000 and since 2009\u000a      this work has been extended through a study of PGE behaviour in the\u000a      gossans (siliceous iron oxide caps developed from weathering) in\u000a      collaboration with the mine operators, Rio Narcea Recursos S.A3.2.\u000a      This research has helped Rio Narcea Recursos S.A understand the ore\u000a      mineralogy in a way they would not have been able to do themselves and has\u000a      helped the company \"add value to the base metal product through the\u000a      processing of precious metals within our ores and helped us deal with\u000a      smelter credits for precious metals in the ores\" 5.1.\u000a    In recent years there has been strong activity in the mining sector for\u000a      exploration at craters, formed via the impact of asteroids or comets with\u000a      the Earth. This is due to the high probability that medium-giant sized\u000a      craters will host significant mineral or hydrocarbon resources. For\u000a      example, in 2005 it was estimated that in North America alone over US$ 18\u000a      billion worth of natural resources were extracted from crater sites each\u000a      year. The research carried out by Prichard on the behaviour of PGE in the\u000a      sulphide ores at the Sudbury impact crater3.1 has been used by\u000a      nickel company Vale to improve extraction efficiency of PGE in their ore5,2.\u000a    A major research milestone during the REF period has been the discovery\u000a      of the giant Maniitsoq impact crater in West Greenland3.5. Due\u000a      to the highly eroded nature of the crater it took three years from\u000a      2009-2012 to establish the validity of the Maniitsoq crater among the\u000a      scientific community3.5. However the mineral exploration\u000a      industry was quicker to grasp the significance of the discovery and\u000a      exploit it before the research was formally published. The opportunity was\u000a      taken up in late 2010 by two mining consultants, John Ferguson and John\u000a      Rowntree, who recognized the potential of the impact model and used it to\u000a      prepare an outline programme for a mining company to acquire a licence and\u000a      carry out exploration for nickel and PGE at Maniitsoq5.4. They\u000a      recognised that the key targets were supercooled magmas (termed norites)\u000a      carrying nickel and copper sulphides (with by-product PGE) that were\u000a      produced shortly after the impact and which invaded the fractured target\u000a      rocks.

All current\u000a      major world minable PGE resources, and likely future potential resources,\u000a      occur in mafic igneous rocks. Almost all exploitable PGE ore deposits form\u000a      when an immiscible sulphide liquid scavenges PGE from a silicate melt,\u000a      then separates and concentrates them. Depending on the extent of sulphide\u000a      melt fractionation, its trace element chemistry and any post-magmatic\u000a      alteration, the PGE may be distributed between different base metal\u000a      sulphide (BMS) minerals or form their own platinum-group minerals (PGM) in\u000a      the final ore. Since 2000, research on the distribution of PGE in ores has\u000a      changed focus from PGM studies using electron microscopy to include laser\u000a      ablation ICP-MS analysis that measures trace PGE concentrations in\u000a      sulphide minerals. Drs Prichard and McDonald have been based at Cardiff\u000a      from 1996 and 2001 respectively. They are recognized as experts with\u000a      established track records in PGE studies using electron microscopy3.1,\u000a        3.2 and laser ablation mass spectrometry techniques3.4.\u000a      This work is crucial in evaluating the economic potential of PGE mineral\u000a      deposits, since the distribution of PGE between BMS and PGM in the ore\u000a      strongly influences the type of ore processing and its cost (e.g., at\u000a      Aguablanca mine in Spain). Research by Prichard and McDonald in 20103.2\u000a      on the redistribution of PGE during low temperature alteration at\u000a      Aguablanca has provided significant insights into the potential for\u000a      processing oxidized supergene ores that are a presently under-exploited\u000a      PGE resource.\u000a    In addition to characterizing ore and improving extraction efficiency at\u000a      known deposits, research at Cardiff has revealed new targets for PGE\u000a      exploration. In 2009-2010, as the Cardiff lead, McDonald's work on the\u000a      World's third largest PGE deposit, the Platreef, resulted in a\u000a      fundamentally new exploration model involving highly efficient\u000a      concentration of PGE in staging chambers3.3, 3.4. The points\u000a      where these chambers feed into the Platreef are prime targets for high\u000a      grade mineralization3.3 and in 2011 this research won the\u000a      Wardell Armstrong prize from the Institution of Materials, Minerals and\u000a      Mining. Major extra-terrestrial impact structures are potential hosts for\u000a      PGE deposits and the Sudbury Basin, long known to host a range of magmatic\u000a      sulphide deposits that are the subject of Prichard's research3.1,\u000a      is such an impact structure. Prichard's research at Sudbury since 2009 has\u000a      been described as part of a number of \"landmark contributions to the\u000a      science of nickel deposits\" by Peter Lightfoot, chief geologist of the\u000a      mining company Vale5.2. Research by McDonald in collaboration\u000a      with the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland and Lund University,\u000a      led to the discovery of a 3 billion year old giant impact crater at\u000a      Maniitsoq in West Greenland3.5, 3.6. McDonald led the\u000a      geochemical and economic geology aspects of the project. Prior to this\u000a      study the oldest known crater was the 2.02 billion year old Vredefort\u000a      crater in South Africa. Giant (&gt;150 km diameter) craters have major\u000a      exploration significance because all of the craters previously known in\u000a      this size class are associated with multi- billion dollar mineral and\u000a      hydrocarbon resources (gold and uranium at Vredefort; nickel and copper at\u000a      Sudbury; and hydrocarbons at Chixculub). Identifying old eroded craters\u000a      such as Maniitsoq is extremely difficult, and it took from 2009 until 2012\u000a      to compile enough evidence to validate the discovery3.5. The\u000a      earliest version of the impact model was exploited in an intellectual\u000a      property transaction in 2011 is now being used by North American Nickel\u000a      Incorporated, to guide exploration for nickel and PGE at Maniitsoq3.6.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4582","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The CPRG has developed techniques and software for the extraction\u000a      of key parameters from coastal video images that are designed to help\u000a      effective monitoring, management and protection of the coastal environment.\u000a      These video-derived parameters are given the generic term Coastal State\u000a      Indicators or CSIs.

The Intertidal Momentary CoastLine (IMCL) is a\u000a      CSI that measures the shoreline position (R4). Developed jointly between\u000a      the CPRG, WL Delft Hydraulics and the Rijkswaterstaat, the\u000a      IMCL can be used to assess shoreline erosion and accretion, and trigger\u000a      beach replenishment, protecting coastal communities from flooding. The\u000a      unique advantage of this methodology is that a daily measurement of the\u000a      shoreline can be obtained using the video systems compared to only\u000a      bi-annual measurements that are practical with traditional survey methods;\u000a      providing far more reliable estimates of erosion and accretion trends in\u000a      the shoreline.

Our coastal environments are a valuable resource for\u000a      industry and recreation with over 50% of the European population living\u000a      within the coastal zone. Motivated by scientific endeavour to monitor and\u000a      understand the changing shape of our coastline, Davidson (Associate\u000a      Professor at PU 1992 to present) initiated coastal video research in the\u000a      UK with the installation of the first system in 1996 at Perranporth.\u000a    The scientific success of this work is evidenced by Davidson's inclusion\u000a      as named investigator on 10 peer reviewed video-related research projects\u000a      with a value exceeding &#163;5M of over the past 15 years. This research\u000a      highlighted the potential of video technology for practical coastal zone\u000a      management, leading to Davidson's co-ordination of the EU CoastView\u000a      project. CoastView [2001-4] investigated the role of coastal video systems\u000a      for monitoring and managing coastal environments. This ambitious &#163;1.3M\u000a      project engaged 14 partners from 7 countries and involved four national\u000a      scale coastal managers from the UK, Spain, Netherlands and Italy. The\u000a      project developed a set of video-derived coastal state indicators (e.g.\u000a      parameters quantifying beach width\/volume, the location of dynamic\u000a      navigation channels and the spatial density distribution of beach users)\u000a      that informed the coastal management process in the areas of coastal\u000a      protection, navigation and recreation.\u000a    CoastView demonstrated that coastal state indicators (CSIs) in isolation\u000a      did not ensure effective coastal management and required implementation\u000a      within a carefully designed 'Frame of Reference' (FoR) system [R3-4]. The\u000a      CoastView project extended and demonstrated the utility of the FoR system\u000a      in all areas of coastal management, setting a precedent that has been\u000a      followed by numerous applied research projects (e.g., MICOR, Ecoshape and\u000a      CONSCIENCE).\u000a    CoastView also investigated the dual advantages that could be gained from\u000a      combining numerical models with video data. Firstly, it was demonstrated\u000a      that video-derived parameters (e.g., bathymetry and wave parameters) could\u000a      be used to provide up-to-date boundary conditions for numerical models,\u000a      improving the accuracy of forecasted sediment erosion and accretion.\u000a      Secondly, these inexpensive, robust systems provide a unique opportunity\u000a      to acquire long-term (decadal) datasets, facilitating the development,\u000a      calibration and validation of data-driven models for coastal change.\u000a    CoastView's success led to a succession of research projects focusing on\u000a      the modelling and prediction. In 2009 Davidson developed a new model\u000a      [R1&amp;2] that skilfully hindcasts the temporal evolution of the\u000a      shoreline, a prime concern for coastal managers. More impressively, this\u000a      new model significantly outperforms existing models for forecasting\u000a      shoreline change with a prediction horizon of approximately a decade.\u000a    On-going research projects involves a close collaboration with the\u000a      University of New South Wales and is extending the present model to\u000a      forecast shoreline change in a changing climate. Other current projects\u000a      involving coastal video systems aim to: better understand the dynamics of\u000a      rip currents, motivated by beach safety (and working with the RNLI);\u000a      improve our understanding of gravel beach dynamics and examine the\u000a      resilience to flooding of coastlines fronting the UK's nuclear power\u000a      stations.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4583","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The main impacts of our research are on marine policy, regulation and\u000a      guidelines designed to bring environmental improvements and through\u000a      informing governments and industry on carbon capture and storage leaks as\u000a      well as threats of ocean acidification to food security.\u000a    The research has had international impact.

The first\u000a      indication that exposure to CO2-rich water could result in\u000a      biological effects that were not straight-forward to interpret came from a\u000a      NERC-funded studentship (2006, Spicer as principal supervisor).

Dr Fine from Bar-Ilan\u000a      University Israel provided expertise on corals, Dr Turner from UEA\u000a      provided expertise on trace gases, Dr Tedesco from University of Naples\u000a      provided expertise on volcanology and Dr Buia from Stazione zoological\u000a      Naples provided seagrass expertise. By studying marine organisms along\u000a      natural gradients of CO2, he was able to show the\u000a      ecosystem-level effects of long-term exposure. This resulted in a\u000a      land-mark publication in Nature (Hall-Spencer et al. 2008), which\u000a      has set the standard for working with natural analogues, generating\u000a      considerable public and scientific interest (223 ISI citations).

Davies et al.

Decisions regarding location of MPAs rely on an\u000a      understanding of the\u000a      extent and distribution of marine habitats, and increasingly marine\u000a      habitat mapping is recognised\u000a      as critical to this process.

(2010), which was first\u000a      published in the form of a series of\u000a      Government reports (Narayanaswamy et al., 2006; Howell et al., 2007;\u000a      Davies et al., 2007; Howell\u000a      et al., 2009), used a combination of acoustic multibeam survey coupled\u000a      with video transect survey\u000a      to describe and map the distribution of the benthic communities of the\u000a      banks, seamounts and\u000a      canyons of the UK deep-sea area. Howell demonstrated there were\u000a      significant areas of cold water\u000a      coral reef habitat and coral gardens habitat at all these sites.\u000a    Howell (2010) identifies the inadequacy of current deep-sea habitat\u000a      classification systems,\u000a      including the pan-European system EUNIS, to represent deep-sea\u000a      biodiversity in any meaningful\u000a      sense. The paper proposes a new system based on a review of our current\u000a      understanding of deep-\u000a      sea benthic biology (bottom up approach), which would be more appropriate\u000a      for use in planning\u000a      marine protected areas. Howell et al., (2011) demonstrates the application\u000a      of statistical models that\u000a      predict species presence from environmental characteristics, to habitat\u000a      mapping using the reef-\u000a      forming cold water coral Lophelia pertusa as a case study. The\u000a      study is the first to apply species\u000a      niche modelling techniques to whole assemblages, demonstrating a new\u000a      approach to habitat\u000a      mapping. It also demonstrates the relative rarity of Lophelia pertusa\u000a      reef compared to the\u000a      distribution of the isolated colonies of the species.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4585","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The body of research undertaken by Prof Rowland and colleagues:\u000d\u000a    (a) is being used by oil companies such as BP, Chevron, Total and others\u000d\u000a      to monitor and model\u000d\u000a      oil pipeline problems,\u000d\u000a    (b) has significantly helped in enhancing the understanding of policy\u000d\u000a      makers of environmental\u000d\u000a      pollution from supercomplex mixtures of organic chemicals (e.g.\u000d\u000a      Environment Canada) and\u000d\u000a    (c) has influenced public debate and engagement with scientific issues\u000d\u000a      concerning maritime\u000d\u000a      transport and spills of chemical pollutant mixtures (e.g. questions in UK\u000d\u000a      parliament).\u000d\u000a    Applications arising from oil pipeline fouling have resulted in grants of\u000d\u000a      a GB patent and PCT\u000d\u000a      patents pending.

Thomas,\u000d\u000a      PhD student 1992-1995,\u000d\u000a      now Head of Ecotoxicology, NIVA, Norway) to develop research showing that\u000d\u000a      extant\u000d\u000a      environmental legislation ignored the importance of high concentrations of\u000d\u000a      so-called `unresolved\u000d\u000a      complex mixtures' of pollutant chemicals. It was widely believed that the\u000d\u000a      individual chemicals could\u000d\u000a      not be identified; some considered the difficulty of identifying this\u000d\u000a      `petroleome' analogous to that of\u000d\u000a      sequencing the human genome (A barrel load of compounds': Chemistry World,\u000d\u000a      May 2010).\u000d\u000a    Professor Steven Rowland was convinced such mixtures could be resolved\u000d\u000a      and showed with a\u000d\u000a      prize-winning study at the World Congress of the Society for Environmental\u000d\u000a      Toxicology and\u000d\u000a      Chemistry (21-25 May 2000) by PhD student Emma Smith (now University of\u000d\u000a      West Indies) and co-worker\u000d\u000a      the late Dr Peter Donkin, that such mixtures were toxic to marine\u000d\u000a      organisms and later with\u000d\u000a      Tasman Crowe at University College Dublin, were even implicated in\u000d\u000a      population effects on\u000d\u000a      mussels. Rowland actively pursued this line of research, (as later, did\u000d\u000a      scientists from, for example,\u000d\u000a      the Wood's Hole Oceanographic Institution, USA), eventually receiving the\u000d\u000a      first of a number of\u000d\u000a      research contracts from the (then) Department of Environment, Transport\u000d\u000a      &amp; the Regions (DETR),\u000d\u000a      the Maritime &amp; Coastguard Agency and NERC in 1999-2004 to identify the\u000d\u000a      toxicants, many of\u000d\u000a      which resulted from crude oil degradation processes and were distributed\u000d\u000a      worldwide.\u000d\u000a    Professor Rowland, along with the late Dr Peter Donkin who transferred\u000d\u000a      from Plymouth Marine\u000d\u000a      Laboratory to Plymouth University to work with Rowland, proceeded to show\u000d\u000a      in a number of\u000d\u000a      studies mainly that many of the toxicants could be identified and\u000d\u000a      measured. The work resulted in\u000d\u000a      international collaborative links with laboratories in Norway, Canada,\u000d\u000a      USA, Australia and many\u000d\u000a      others, in many cases with Plymouth as the lead partner (e.g. Maritime\u000d\u000a      &amp; Coastguard Agency\u000d\u000a      Project 480 extension Potential Ecological Effects of Chemically Dispersed\u000d\u000a      and Biodegraded Oils,\u000d\u000a      2005). Subsequently workers at Wood's Hole, Oceanographic Institution,\u000d\u000a      USA, after discussion\u000d\u000a      with Rowland, also pursued this avenue of research.\u000d\u000a    By 2006, Rowland, had developed an analytical method in collaboration\u000d\u000a      with (then) Dr Ally Lewis at\u000d\u000a      the University of York, based on multidimensional gas chromatography-mass\u000d\u000a      spectrometry, which\u000d\u000a      was capable of resolving the `unresolved' mixtures and, with synthesis of\u000d\u000a      the proposed chemicals,\u000d\u000a      Rowland was able to identify many of these and to demonstrate their\u000d\u000a      toxicity to organisms such as\u000d\u000a      mussels (e.g., Booth et al., 2007) and later (2013) in a internationally\u000d\u000a      publicized chemical spill, to\u000d\u000a      show the dramatic physical effects of man-made unresolved mixtures (e.g.\u000d\u000a      polyisobutene) to\u000d\u000a      seabirds.\u000d\u000a    In 2009 the importance of this work was recognised by a &#8364;2m Advanced\u000d\u000a      Investigators Award by\u000d\u000a      the European Research Council to Rowland who was then able to purchase a\u000d\u000a      multidimensional\u000d\u000a      gas chromatography-mass spectrometry system at Plymouth. The methods then\u000d\u000a      allowed Rowland\u000d\u000a      with samples supplied by Environment Canada, to identify the even more\u000d\u000a      complex `unresolved'\u000d\u000a      toxic mixtures arising from the multi-billion dollar oil sands industries,\u000d\u000a      which are the projected major\u000d\u000a      supplier of USA crude oil for the next 50 years (e.g., Rowland et al.,\u000d\u000a      2011a- c).\u000d\u000a    Rowland has now applied the methods to studies of airborne pollutant\u000d\u000a      mixtures (e.g., Alam, M.S,\u000d\u000a      West, C.E., Scarlett, A.G., Rowland, S.J. and Harrison, R.M.

The first parliamentary discussions were\u000d\u000a      within days of Thompson's 2004 publication and policy interest has been\u000d\u000a      sustained resulting in the regulation of microplastics being incorporated\u000d\u000a      into European Union Policy during 2010.\u000d\u000a    The first two microplastics papers from the team prompted the United\u000d\u000a      States Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric\u000d\u000a      Administration (NOAA) to organise the first international meeting on\u000d\u000a      microplastics at the University of Washington (2008), Thompson gave the\u000d\u000a      opening presentation outlining his research. The meeting resulted in a\u000d\u000a      White Paper summarising current understanding on microplastics as an\u000d\u000a      emerging contaminant and associated environmental concerns, Immediate\u000d\u000a      beneficiaries were NOAA and Defra (4Arthur et al. 2009,\u000d\u000a      published by NOAA). In 2009 the Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific\u000d\u000a      Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection (an advisory body of the United\u000d\u000a      Nations) organised an international meeting dedicated to microplastics.\u000d\u000a      This resulted in a position statement for policy makers worldwide\u000d\u000a      outlining the potential concerns arising from microplastic contamination (5GESAMP\u000a      2010).\u000d\u000a    Within the EU, policy to reduce microplastic contamination was\u000d\u000a      implemented via the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) in April\u000d\u000a      2010. To achieve good environmental status in the EU waters member states\u000d\u000a      would need to achieve a `measurable and significant decrease' in\u000d\u000a      the abundance of microplastics by 2020 (7Galgani 2010). To\u000d\u000a      inform implementation Thompson presented on his research at the European\u000d\u000a      Parliament (Brussels, June 2010) and EU Committee of the Regions\u000d\u000a      (Brussels, November, 2010). These meetings were widely attended by MEPs\u000d\u000a      and the European Commission and Prof. Thompson was subsequently asked by\u000d\u000a      the EU to be a scientific expert in a Technical Subgroup to define\u000d\u000a      methodological standards for member states to implement MSFD policy with\u000d\u000a      respect to microplastic (8policy document, EC, 2011).\u000d\u000a    The importance of research by Thompson's Group, in influencing EU MSFD\u000d\u000a      Policy, is summarised in a testimonial from a 1DG Environment\u000d\u000a      Policy Officer `'Research at Plymouth directly led to the inclusion of\u000d\u000a        microplastics as part of the assessment of good environmental status. In\u000d\u000a        2010, microplastics were identified in the Commission Decision on\u000d\u000a        criteria and methodological standards for determining GES (2010\/477\/EU)\u000d\u000a        as one of the key-indicators of the characteristics of litter in the\u000d\u000a        marine environment.''. The research continues to be a key source of\u000d\u000a      information to EU policymakers, for example: 9Science for\u000d\u000a      Environment Policy DG Environment, February 2012 is entirely based on a\u000d\u000a      microplastics paper from Thompson's group (Browne et al. 2011)\u000d\u000a      which is also cited in the 2013 Green Paper `European Strategy on\u000d\u000a        Plastic Waste in the Environment.\u000d\u000a    As part of the UK contribution to achieving good environmental status\u000d\u000a      within MSFD the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)\u000d\u000a      awarded a competitively won tender (ME 5416, 2010 - 2014) to Thompson\u000d\u000a      together with colleagues Rowland at Plymouth University and Galloway (now\u000d\u000a      at University of Exeter), to establish the extent to which microplastics\u000d\u000a      might cause harm in the marine environment. The importance of research by\u000d\u000a      Thompson's group in influencing policy is outlined in a testimonial from a\u000d\u000a      2Defra Policy Officer (2012) `'The inclusion of a\u000d\u000a        requirement to understand trends in the amount, distribution and\u000d\u000a        composition of microplastics in a legally binding European Directive was\u000d\u000a        only made possible by the compelling evidence put forward by the group''\u000d\u000a      Similarly, the importance in the US is outlined by a 3Programme\u000a      Director within Ocean Conservancy (2013). ). `'His work has helped\u000d\u000a      re-shape how scientists and policymakers view the persistent problem of\u000d\u000a      marine debris and influenced a number of processes here in the United\u000d\u000a      States. This includes the strategies employed by Ocean Conservancy and\u000d\u000a      other non-profit organizations to confront the threat of plastic pollution\u000d\u000a      in the ocean. Thompson's insights have also influenced how the U.S.\u000d\u000a      Environmental Protection Agency approaches the issue of marine debris''.\u000d\u000a      In 2013 Thompson was invited to present evidence on microplastics to the 6House\u000a      of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee as part of their\u000d\u000a      consideration of water quality in the UK. An outcome being a discussion on\u000d\u000a      banning microplastics in cosmetics. Several global companies including\u000d\u000a      Unilever, Colgate Palmolive and L'Oreal have voluntarily withdrawn\u000d\u000a      microplastics (described by manufacturers as `microbeads') from\u000d\u000a      their products in 2013.\u000d\u000a    More generally, three of the publications in Section 4 were independently\u000d\u000a      acknowledged in the journal Environmental Science and Technology':\u000d\u000a      in 2008, Teuten et al. (2007) and Browne et al. (2008) were\u000d\u000a      highlighted as `two of the most influential papers in the field',\u000d\u000a      and in 2012 Browne et al. (2011) was awarded `best paper of\u000d\u000a        the year'. Following the discovery of microplastics, there have been\u000d\u000a      themed sessions at international conferences in Europe and the USA. In\u000d\u000a      addition, there have been over 100 media articles and programmes on the\u000d\u000a      topic (including New York Times, Washington Post, Das Spiegel, El Pais,\u000d\u000a      Guardian, BBC). The research has inspired artistic representations,\u000d\u000a      educational projects (e.g., El Viaje de Jurella y los Micropl&#225;sticos, a\u000d\u000a      national educational programme throughout Chile) and been incorporated\u000d\u000a      into popular science books (The World Without US, A. Weisman and Reporting\u000a        Live form the End of the World, D. Shukman). In 2010 Thompson was\u000d\u000a      invited to participate in a public debate as part of the Plastics Europe\u000d\u000a      Annual Meeting (a trade organisation representing European plastics\u000d\u000a      industry). Facilitated by a BBC journalist this took the form a discussion\u000d\u000a      between representatives from the plastics industry and international\u000d\u000a      marine pollution experts (Thompson, Galgani, van Franeker). It was held in\u000d\u000a      front of an audience of 200 who indicated their opinions on marine litter\u000d\u000a      in real time using hand-held electronic voting tools and was broadcast\u000d\u000a      live as a pod-cast.\u000d\u000a    In terms of global solutions to the growing problem of marine debris, of\u000d\u000a      which microplastics are a part, Thompson was asked by the United Nations\u000d\u000a      Environment Programme to identify `Global and Regional Solutions to the\u000d\u000a        Marine Debris Problem (10STAP 2011).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Researchers at Plymouth University were the first to demonstrate the\u000d\u000a      occurrence of microscopic plastic debris in the environment.

As a consequence\u000d\u000a      of voluntary work co-ordinating beach-cleans for the UK Marine\u000d\u000a      Conservation Society he had also realised that substantial quantities of\u000d\u000a      small plastic fragments were being overlooked by standard marine litter\u000d\u000a      surveys. Shortly after arriving at Plymouth he secured funding to describe\u000d\u000a      and quantify these fragments (Leverhulme Trust Pilot Grant, Principal\u000d\u000a      Investigator Thompson, 2001-2002) and with colleagues at Plymouth he\u000d\u000a      quickly established that sub-millimetre sized fragments of plastic were\u000d\u000a      widespread in sediments and in the water column in the north-east\u000d\u000a      Atlantic. Using archived plankton samples his team went on to show that\u000d\u000a      the abundance of this material had more than doubled over the previous 40\u000d\u000a      years, mirroring trends in plastic production, and that a range of marine\u000d\u000a      organisms could ingest these fragments. In 2004 he published a paper in\u000d\u000a      the journal Science, which summarised the findings and described\u000d\u000a      the fragments using, for the first time, the name `microplastic',\u000d\u000a      (Thompson et al. 2004; 90% of this work was done at Plymouth\u000d\u000a      University).\u000d\u000a    Having described this new form of contamination, Thompson, then a Senior\u000d\u000a      Lecturer in Marine Ecology, together with Prof. Rowland and Dr Galloway\u000d\u000a      (all Plymouth University) secured further funding from the Leverhulme\u000d\u000a      Trust (principal investigator Thompson, 2003-2007) to quantify\u000d\u000a      microplastic contamination and examine the potential environmental\u000d\u000a      consequences. They supervised PhD student Browne and Research Assistants\u000d\u000a      Niven and Teuten at Plymouth University. Teuten used radio-labelled\u000d\u000a      contaminants and an in-vitro modelling approach to show that\u000d\u000a      minute quantities of microplastics (parts per million) had the potential\u000d\u000a      to increase uptake of a persistent organic pollutant to deposit feeding\u000d\u000a      worms (Teuten et al. 2007; 100% of the work for this paper was\u000d\u000a      done at Plymouth University). Building on Thompson's earlier work, which\u000d\u000a      had shown that a range of invertebrates could ingest microplastics\u000d\u000a      (Thompson et al. 2004), Browne used laboratory experiments to show\u000d\u000a      that, after ingestion by the commercially important mollusc (Mytilus\u000d\u000a        edulis), microplastics translocated from the gut to the haemolymph\u000d\u000a      where they could be retained for more than 40 days (Browne et al.\u000d\u000a      2008; 90% of the work for this paper was done at Plymouth University). The\u000d\u000a      team established that microplastics originated from various sources;\u000d\u000a      including the fragmentation of larger items together with waste water from\u000d\u000a      domestic washing machines, and showed that these particles were now an\u000d\u000a      important component of marine debris on shorelines worldwide (Browne et\u000a        al. 2010, 2011; 100% and 90% respectively of the work for these\u000d\u000a      papers was done at Plymouth University).\u000d\u000a    This body of research is important because it describes a previously\u000d\u000a      neglected, but widespread, constituent of marine litter. This missing\u000d\u000a      fraction helps to clarify why, despite exponential increases in the\u000d\u000a      quantity of plastic waste generated; monitoring data from the environment\u000d\u000a      showed no related increase in plastic debris. By contrast this work, and\u000d\u000a      subsequent monitoring by others, shows a significant increase in the\u000d\u000a      abundance of small fragments over time. The research also indicated that\u000d\u000a      contamination of marine habitats by microplastics presented risks that\u000d\u000a      differed from those described for larger items of debris.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4885","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"2215636","Name":"Libya"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact described here has occurred in the period 2008-2013, and is\u000d\u000a      based on research published in open scientific literature and widely\u000d\u000a      available.

This work has\u000d\u000a      identified periods of earth history - OAEs - during which high biological\u000d\u000a      productivity and low oxygen levels in the deep ocean lead to preservation\u000d\u000a      of very organic-rich sediments. These OAE sediments represent significant\u000d\u000a      hydrocarbon source rocks.\u000d\u000a    The changes in oceanic redox conditions are due to rapid rises in global\u000d\u000a      temperature, probably forced by the addition of huge quantities of\u000d\u000a      volcanically derived carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Global temperature\u000d\u000a      rise accelerates the hydrological cycle, increasing nutrient supply to\u000d\u000a      oceans and lakes, hence enhancing productivity and the delivery of\u000d\u000a      planktonic organic matter to sediment: such organic matter is the original\u000d\u000a      source for all hydrocarbons.\u000d\u000a    Careful stratigraphic research in the last two decades has demonstrated\u000d\u000a      that these events are global - occurring synchronously and impacting many\u000d\u000a      marine and lacustrine settings. Chemostratigraphic work has indicated that\u000d\u000a      the events are encoded in the trace-element and isotope composition of\u000d\u000a      sedimentary rocks, enabling strata deposited during OAEs to be identified\u000d\u000a      even in the absence of high organic content at the specific location being\u000d\u000a      studied, and enabling correlation of the event both locally and globally.\u000d\u000a    The OAE model was first proposed before the REF period in the late 1970s,\u000d\u000a      with a pioneering paper in 1976 by Schlanger and Jenkyns based on\u000d\u000a      observations in the North Pacific. This model, which was not without its\u000d\u000a      detractors when first advanced, but has been refined and developed by work\u000d\u000a      in the period 1993 to present to demonstrate its resilience. Jenkyns, as\u000d\u000a      the co-originator of the OAE model, has continued to be a world-leading\u000d\u000a      expert on the subject and to pursue extensive research on OAEs throughout\u000d\u000a      the 1993-2013 period. His, and other UoA research on the OAE model, has\u000d\u000a      led to a significant shift in the way that petroleum companies think about\u000d\u000a      potential hydrocarbon source-rock distribution.\u000d\u000a    Jenkyns' research is complemented by that of others at Oxford,\u000d\u000a      principally Hesselbo (Oxford Professor 1986-2013) and Morgans-Bell (Oxford\u000d\u000a      PDRA, 1998 - 2002). The research conducted in the 1993-2013 period and\u000d\u000a      leading to impact includes:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Documentation of the global nature of OAEs, and of the widespread\u000d\u000a        deposition of organic-rich shales during these events, including in\u000d\u000a        open-ocean settings [1-3]\u000d\u000a      Discovery that isotopic signatures (e.g. f06413C, 87Sr\/86Sr)\u000a        of sedimentary rocks could be used to identify and correlate OAEs,\u000d\u000a        constrain their relationship to perturbations of the global carbon\u000d\u000a        cycle, and provide evidence of the global and local environmental\u000d\u000a        conditions that led to organic-rich deposition in sedimentary basin\u000d\u000a        settings [2-6]\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Because the cost of drilling oil\/gas wells is so high, industry requires\u000d\u000a      evidence-based models to inform drilling decisions. A fundamental\u000d\u000a      necessity for successful oil\/gas exploration is the occurrence of a\u000d\u000a      hydrocarbon-prone source rock within the target sedimentary basin -\u000d\u000a      usually in the form of an organic-rich shale. The OAE model has become a\u000d\u000a      fundamental aspect of hydrocarbon resource exploration. In addition,\u000d\u000a      chemostratigraphy [2-6] enables the dating and correlation of sedimentary\u000d\u000a      sequences by geochemical means in the absence of biostratigraphically\u000d\u000a      useful fossils. One particular chemostratigraphic tool - carbon-isotope\u000d\u000a      stratigraphy - also offers insight into the fraction of carbon deposited\u000d\u000a      as organic carbon through time, providing an additional pointer to the\u000d\u000a      likely presence of potential petroleum source rocks in any basin under\u000d\u000a      investigation.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"5733","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    National Geographic's television producer [S1] became aware of the DD and\u000d\u000a      approached Swansea\u000d\u000a      University in 2008 regarding concepts for a proposed new series involving\u000d\u000a      animal migrations.

The methodological\u000d\u000a      advances conceived by\u000d\u000a      Wilson were pivotal to the way in which National Geographic set out their\u000d\u000a      concept for Great\u000d\u000a        Migrations [S1] because the fine-scale properties of animal movement\u000d\u000a      paths and their associated\u000d\u000a      energetic costs were previously impossible to quantify despite being\u000d\u000a      central for defining movement\u000d\u000a      efficiency and thereby understanding patterns of migrating animals.\u000d\u000a    National Geographic provided funding [G2, G3] to enable Professor Wilson\u000d\u000a      to use the DD on\u000d\u000a      whales, seabirds, sharks and seals. This resulted in new discoveries about\u000d\u000a      movement strategies in\u000d\u000a      free-living animals and their ecological consequences [R5-6] which were\u000d\u000a      included in the television\u000d\u000a      series. Specifically, Professor Wilson featured in the episode The\u000d\u000a        Science of Migrations, in which\u000d\u000a      he explains the DD and its importance for understanding how animal\u000d\u000a      movements relate to\u000d\u000a      energetics (e.g. how penguins use positive buoyancy to catch prey from\u000d\u000a      below, and the\u000d\u000a      movements of elephant seals conducting drift dives).\u000d\u000a    Evidence of impact from the television series\u000d\u000a    Great Migrations was first presented in November 2010 as a\u000d\u000a      seven-part series (of 1-hour\u000d\u000a      episodes) showing animal migrations in different areas of the globe. This\u000d\u000a      work, the highest budget\u000d\u000a      in National Geographic's 124-year history, was eventually aired in 166\u000d\u000a      countries (in 34 different\u000d\u000a      languages), accessible to 330 million people [S2]. There was a strong\u000d\u000a      positive response to the\u000d\u000a      series from both the press and the public:\u000d\u000a    The Press [S3]\u000d\u000a    The Guardian: \"The \"Great Migrations\" footage, which took three\u000d\u000a        years to shoot, was filmed on\u000d\u000a        land and from the air, in trees, cliff-blinds, ice floes and underwater\u000d\u000a        across 420,000 miles and in 20\u000d\u000a        countries. ... four core hours chronicle the stories of some of the\u000d\u000a        planet's many animal species and\u000d\u000a        their movements, thanks to new scientific discoveries about them and\u000d\u000a        their natural history. ...

In 2005, Professor Rory Wilson\u000d\u000a      conceived a unique\u000d\u000a      recording device (the `Daily Diary'; DD) for attachment to wild animals\u000d\u000a      that determined these four\u000d\u000a      cornerstones simultaneously to a hitherto unrealised scale [R1]. In\u000d\u000a      particular, Wilson proposed two\u000d\u000a      new key methodological advances by maximizing synergy in sensor\u000d\u000a      combinations and original\u000d\u000a      analytical approaches [R1]. One advance showed how to determine animal\u000d\u000a      movements via `dead-\u000d\u000a      reckoning' [R1] (using vectorial calculations on sensors that yielded\u000d\u000a      speed, heading and\u000d\u000a      height\/depth data) and avoids the need for the tag to communicate by\u000d\u000a      transmission telemetry. This\u000d\u000a      thus provides a seamless sub-second update on animal 3-D position even\u000d\u000a      when subjects are `out\u000d\u000a      of sight' (for example, underwater or underground [R1]). The best\u000d\u000a      comparable method, GPS, will\u000d\u000a      only work in air with sight of the sky. The second novelty was creation of\u000d\u000a      a powerful proxy for\u000d\u000a      metabolic rate (dynamic body acceleration [R1-R6]). This metric is derived\u000d\u000a      from tri-axial\u000d\u000a      accelerometers and can be determined instantaneously, and thus applied to\u000d\u000a      determine the cost of\u000d\u000a      wild-animal behaviours over single seconds. The only comparable method,\u000d\u000a      determination of heart\u000d\u000a      rate, is onerous, involving tag implantation, and works, at best, over\u000d\u000a      minutes. In addition, the DD\u000d\u000a      provided various standard metrics which can be used to determine behaviour\u000d\u000a      [R1, R3, R6], and\u000d\u000a      environmental data such as light intensity, humidity and temperature [R1].\u000d\u000a      Since animal movement\u000d\u000a      and behaviour depend on the environment and are critically dependent on\u000d\u000a      judicious use of energy,\u000d\u000a      the DD represents the first device quantifying and linking these elements\u000d\u000a      together and represents a\u000d\u000a      radical, new approach for understanding the ecology of wild animals.\u000d\u000a    Grants from National Geographic to fund further DD work [G2, G3], in\u000d\u000a      association with the Great\u000d\u000a        Migrations series (see below), led to important discoveries (such as\u000d\u000a      how marine animals use\u000d\u000a      undulating flight to save energy [R5] and how the landscape can be\u000d\u000a      considered in terms of\u000d\u000a      movement costs and how this explains animal landscape use [R6]) that were\u000d\u000a      in turn incorporated\u000d\u000a      into the series.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6273","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Natural Environment Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    From 1993-1998 Keele researchers were awarded grants from the Atomic\u000a      Energy of Canada Ltd (AECL) Underground Research Laboratory (~&#163;1 million)\u000a      for the \"Application of Induced Seismicity to Radioactive Waste Management\u000a      Programmes\".

He has\u000a      advised the Australian and Canadian Mining Industry on how to combat these\u000a      problems using microseismic techniques, with Australian monitoring of coal\u000a      mines now based on research he initiated and developed at Keele [3].\u000a      In 2009, Professor Styles was a member of the Foreign Office Clean Coal\u000a      Technologies Mission to Australia as scientific advisor to the national\u000a      coal industry on the development (and hazard implications) of developing\u000a      Coal Bed Methane (CBM) energy. In the UK, the Outburst Prediction system\u000a      developed by the group was deemed by HM Inspector of Mines to be a\u000a      mandatory requirement for mines in the UK, which laid the foundation for\u000a      new mine-stability monitoring technologies in the salt\/gypsum industries.\u000a      In 2002, Keele was awarded a &#163;600k grant from Vale Royal Council for the\u000a      Microseismic Monitoring of Salt Mine Instability in Northwich, Cheshire\u000a      (2002-2007). The research provided vital information on the stability and\u000a      deformation characteristics of ground above and surrounding the mines, and\u000a      was pivotal in the design and ongoing monitoring of English Partnership's\u000a      &#163;32 million remediation programme (funded from the Government's Land\u000a      Stabilisation fund). The stabilisation of the mines led to the\u000a      establishment of the 2007+ \"Northwich Vision\" regeneration programme and\u000a      the comprehensive Northwich Urban Design &amp; Public Realm Strategy of\u000a      2010 [4].\u000a    Keele-based microseismic research has led to staff serving on (and\u000a      Chairing) a number of key government policy-making advisory groups\u000a      including\u000a    \u000a      DEFRA\/DTI Criteria Proposals Group (CPG), Sub-Surface Exclusion\u000a        Criteria for Geological Disposal of Radioactive Waste (MRWS), 2006-7.\u000a      NDA Geosphere Characterisation Panel (2008-),\u000a      Royal Society Committee on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\u000a        (2010-).\u000a      President of the International Commission on Hydrocarbon Exploration\u000a        and Seismicity in the Emilia region, Italy (2013-)\u000a    \u000a    In 2011, the Department of Energy and Climate Change invited Prof. Styles\u000a      to join the independent evaluation panel investigating the\u000a      implications\/nature of microseismicity associated with \"Shale Gas\u000a      Hydraulic Fracturing\" in Lancashire. Their 2012 report \"Preese Hall Shale\u000a      Gas fracturing, Review &amp; Recommendations for induced seismic\u000a      mitigation\" has been pivotal in the government's decision to resume UK\u000a      Shale Gas exploitation on the basis of low microseimic risk. Key\u000a      recommendations of the report were that future shale gas operations should\u000a      include....\"seismic monitoring to establish background seismicity\"\u000a      and an \"effective monitoring system that can provide automatic\u000a        locations and magnitudes of any seismic events in near real-time\" [5].\u000a      The research undertaken at Keele in the past fifteen years has underpinned\u000a      the development of these techniques and the methodologies needed to meet\u000a      the report's recommendations [6]. This work has led to Keele's\u000a      involvement in the recently formed \"ReFINE Consortium\" (Researching\u000a      Fracking in Europe with Durham, Newcastle and Heriot- Watt as University\u000a      partners) funded by RCUK and industry.\u000a    Keele has been instrumental in developing our understanding of the\u000a      nature, magnitude, risk and implications of ground vibrations from onshore\u000a      wind turbines. In 2004-6, the group was funded by the MOD to undertake a\u000a      &#163;115k programme of research at Eskdalemuir, Scotland. The project assessed\u000a      the impact of turbine-related microseismic noise on the MOD's nuclear test\u000a      ban treaty seismometer network and showed that, within certain distance\u000a      limits, wind turbines have little influence on the network's detection\u000a      capability or human health (as presented in a 2011 House of Lords debate [7]).\u000a      Keele-based work has had a major, positive impact on the development of\u000a      the UK's onshore wind provision and led directly to the permission for,\u000a      and construction of, 1.5 GW of renewable wind energy in the Southern\u000a      Uplands of Scotland, equivalent to inward investment of &#163;1.5 billion. This\u000a      research has been highly commended by the Ministers of State for Energy\u000a      &amp; Defence [8], and has helped the UK government meet its\u000a      commitment to the Kyoto CO2 emission reduction targets (through\u000a      renewable energy provision). The outcomes of Keele's research have also\u000a      been integrated into the 2006 US \"Report To The Congressional Defence\u000a      Committees on The Effect of Windmill Farms On Military Readiness\" along\u000a      with the recommendation that the Keele-developed monitoring methodologies\u000a      be adopted for all US wind farm sites [9].

These can be natural (i.e. the movement of active geological\u000a      faults) or man-made (e.g. the collapse of abandoned seams in coal mines).\u000a      Generally, these low amplitude earthquake events are only detectable by\u000a      sophisticated seismic monitoring systems, although their impact can be\u000a      severe (e.g. local subsidence, ground water flow disruption, etc.).\u000a      Microseismic mointoring allows researchers to assess the location and\u000a      time- dependent nature of these events (e.g. where and how subsidence will\u000a      occur) therefore providing predictions for risk management and mitigation\u000a      strategies.\u000a    The monitoring techniques developed at Keele are able to detect the\u000a      smallest underground microseismic events (a very complex and difficult\u000a      task) and the research has found relevance across the wider sector of\u000a      environmental engineering (e.g. wind farm turbine monitoring, development\u000a      and exploitation of new on-shore gas reserves) and geological\/geotechnical\u000a      engineering (e.g. coal and salt mining collapse).\u000a    From 1993-2000, Microseismic research at Keele was led by Professor Paul\u000a      Young (Chair of Applied Seismology) where many of the commercial\u000a      microseismic processing and monitoring techniques used today in the mining\u000a      and geotechnical engineering industries were pioneered. Professor\u000a      Young is currently the Vice-President (Research) at the University of\u000a      Toronto, Canada and Keck Chair of Seismology and Rock Mechanics. In 2000,\u000a      Professor Peter Styles joined Keele as Chair of Applied and Environmental\u000a      Geophysics, continuing the theme of applied microseismics research.\u000a      Professor Styles has been at the forefront of international\u000a      high-resolution microseismic data processing and monitoring research for\u000a      over thirty years. He is the Past-President of the Geological Society of\u000a      London, a Board Member of the British Geological Survey and Geophysical\u000a      Advisor to the Coal Authority.\u000a    Research within the current Applied and Environmental Geophysics Group is\u000a      focused around the engineering\/technical development of hardware,\u000a      software, methodological approaches, fundamental theory, data processing,\u000a      numerical\/mathematical modelling and data interpretation\/visualisation\u000a      methods for the monitoring, evaluation and characterisation of these\u000a      microseismic signals, predominantly in the mining and energy sector.

Recently nominated for a Queen's\u000d\u000a      Anniversary Prize, the Hub serves many purposes: a test-bed for new\u000d\u000a      technologies, an outreach centre for schools, a centre for public\u000d\u000a      awareness and a meeting place for interdisciplinary sustainability\u000d\u000a      research. This investment was underpinned by the development of\u000d\u000a      undergraduate and taught postgraduate degrees in Environmental\u000d\u000a      Sustainability, which include strong industrial research collaboration\u000d\u000a      (e.g. placements, industry-supported projects, specialist industrial\u000d\u000a      lectures). The opening of the Sustainability Hub in 2011 led to key\u000d\u000a      partnerships being developed with local councils, businesses (from local\u000d\u000a      SMEs to international major companies such as Rolls Royce, Siemens and\u000d\u000a      Schott), government departments and charitable bodies (e.g. Wildlife\u000d\u000a      Trust, RSPB, Keep Britain Tidy). Since opening, the Hub has had over\u000d\u000a      20,000 visitors, including members of the public, schools, visiting\u000d\u000a      academics and government representatives [6]. The October 2011 meeting of\u000d\u000a      the Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) was held at the Hub, and led to\u000d\u000a      the establishment of the Sustainability Knowledge Alliance (SKA), which\u000d\u000a      runs annual events jointly hosted by the Royal Society and the British\u000d\u000a      Academy. The SKA have been instrumental in informing government on\u000d\u000a      sustainability and environmental policy-making [6]. Business-related\u000d\u000a      research at the Hub has led to major economic gains for regional\u000d\u000a      industries and national recognition for research innovation. For example,\u000d\u000a      a collaboration between Hub research staff and McCamley Ltd (developer of\u000d\u000a      a prototype `vertical' wind turbine) was short-listed for a Lord Stafford\u000d\u000a      Innovation Award for engagement of Universities with industry. Working\u000d\u000a      directly with Keele scientists has enabled the company to fully evaluate\u000d\u000a      the performance of the prototype turbine (e.g. assessing MW generation\u000d\u000a      output, vibration and noise levels) and establish its potential\u000d\u000a      application for new markets such as urban-based renewable energy [7].\u000d\u000a    Project Green: The economic and industry-related impact of\u000d\u000a      the Sustainability Hub is also evidenced by the success of the \"Project\u000d\u000a      Green\" business-link initiative and its successors, \"Keele Connect\",\u000d\u000a      \"Project FIT\" and \"Destination Green\". Originally funded by HEFCE's\u000d\u000a      Economic Challenge Investment Fund in 2009 and running every year since,\u000d\u000a      this ~&#163;1+M funded initiative combines staff expertise from the\u000d\u000a      environmental sciences and management disciplines across the University.\u000d\u000a      It has provided environmental sustainability-related internships and\u000d\u000a      training to well over 200 graduates in more than 100 different companies,\u000d\u000a      predominantly SMEs, across the region. For example, the most recent cohort\u000d\u000a      of 19 graduates in Destination Green saved 16 organisations 62,000 tonnes\u000d\u000a      of CO2, 2600 tonnes of waste, 220 MWh of electricity and\u000d\u000a      &#163;60,000 [8]. The programme also resulted in over half the cohort obtaining\u000d\u000a      graduate level jobs, predominantly in the environmental\/sustainability\u000d\u000a      sector [8]. An excellent example of the impact of the internship programme\u000d\u000a      is the 2011-12 research collaboration with Kerry Foods, Burton-on-Trent\u000d\u000a      (part of the international Kerry group).

Environmental geophysics,\u000d\u000a      sustainable technology and materials chemistry and environmental policy\u000d\u000a      represent the core of Keele's environment-related research, with funding\u000d\u000a      well in excess of &#163;10M from RCUK (NERC, EPSRC, ESRC), EU, industry and\u000d\u000a      other funding bodies. Since 2008, Keele has been awarded ~&#163;3M of external\u000d\u000a      research funding across the environmental-sustainability research,\u000d\u000a      including several large, multidisciplinary grants.\u000d\u000a    In 2011, Keele University was awarded &#163;3.4M from the HEFCE Strategic\u000d\u000a      Development Fund, to develop its campus-wide sustainability initiative,\u000d\u000a      and explicitly to include resources and facilities to support research in\u000d\u000a      its new Sustainability Hub building. Specific research programmes that are\u000d\u000a      integrated into the Hub's educational and outreach activities include the\u000d\u000a      following:\u000d\u000a    i) Resilience of land\/water resources: This includes the\u000d\u000a      characterisation, monitoring and assessment of river-ground water systems,\u000d\u000a      the impact of climate change on these systems, and the interaction\/impact\u000d\u000a      of pollutants (e.g. industrial spillages) on soil proprieties and\u000d\u000a      agricultural\/land management practices.

This impact is evidenced by the growth of RDR\u000a      business, and through\u000a      growth of fault research, consultancy, and training within the School of\u000a      Earth and Environment.\u000a    Between 2008 and 2010, RDR had an average annual turnover over of &#163;1.9\u000a      million, and the\u000a      estimated annual turnover today is &#163;4.0 million [A]. Since 2008,\u000a      RDR has conducted consultancy\u000a      for 90 oil companies on a total of 200 petroleum reservoirs throughout the\u000a      world [A, B]. In 2008,\u000a      the company released a database of fault rock properties that has been\u000a      purchased by 9 companies\u000a      (BG Group, Wintershall, Bayergas, BHPbilliton, ConocoPhilips, DetNorsk,\u000a      Maersk, Nexen and\u000a      Statoil). Most importantly, in 2008, RDR entered into an exclusive\u000a      agreement with Schlumberger\u000a      Ltd, in which RDR have created a plug-in software module for the most\u000a      popular geological\u000a      modelling software (PetrelTM) used by the petroleum industry\u000a      (see www.rdr.leeds.ac.uk\/petrel-\u000a        software.html) [C,D,E]. This module has sold over 500\u000a      licenses and allows geoscientists to model\u000a      all of the major uncertainties associated with fault-related fluid flow in\u000a      petroleum reservoirs so as to\u000a      reduce the risks associated with drilling new exploration and production\u000a      wells [B]. This work\u000a      incorporated results from both laboratory studies of fault rock\u000a      petrophysics as well as structural\u000a      interpretations conducted during the numerous JIPs in Leeds. In\u000a      recognition of the high quality of\u000a      this plug-in, RDR were presented with the 2010 SIS Global Forum Innovation\u000a      Award at the 2010\u000a      Global Schlumberger Information Solutions forum [F]. In addition\u000a      to software production and\u000a      consultancy, RDR have conducted around 30 short courses on fault-related\u000a      fluid flow for the\u000a      petroleum industry that have been attended by up to 700 people [B].\u000a    Research, consultancy and training on fault-related fluid flow have also\u000a      continued in the University\u000a      of Leeds separately from RDR. Fisher has established two JIPs to\u000a      continue research in this area.\u000a      The first (sponsored by ADMA, BHP, ConocoPhilips, Shell, Statoil and\u000a      Wintershall) is a &#163;450,000\u000a      project developing a database on the relative permeability of fault rocks.\u000a      The second (sponsored\u000a      by Chevron, ConocoPhillips, DECC and Shell) is a &#163;590,000 project which\u000a      has investigated the\u000a      impact of faults and fractures on gas production from tight gas sandstone\u000a      reservoirs. Fisher has\u000a      also given over 40 presentations and 4 short courses to industry, and\u000a      continued to conduct\u000a      consultancy work on fault- and fracture- related fluid flow on 9 petroleum\u000a      reservoirs, a CO2 storage\u000a      site (Middle East) and a project on shale-hosted radioactive waste\u000a      repositories (NAGRA -\u000a      Switzerland).\u000a    The non-uniqueness in the interpretation of subsurface data and the\u000a      extreme confidentiality of\u000a      many projects means that it is difficult to assign an accurate monetary\u000a      value to the impact of this\u000a      research, consultancy and training. Although software sales, training\u000a      courses and consultancy\u000a      projects offers one indication of impact, other examples such as:-\u000a    \u000a       Failure to predict fault-related reservoir compartmentalisation often\u000a        leads to dramatic\u000a        downgrades in reserves (e.g. 100 million barrels - from a single Gulf of\u000a        Mexico reservoir).\u000a       Failure to predict the sealing capacity of wells often leads to dry\u000a        wells being drilled at costs\u000a        in excess of &#163;50 million per well.\u000a       Demonstration that sandstones are not connected across faults allows\u000a        companies to claim\u000a        small fields tax allowances in excess of &#163;75 million.\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research on faults and fluid flow led by the University of Leeds has\u000a      dramatically increased the\u000a      ability of the petroleum industry to predict the impact of faults on fluid\u000a      flow in petroleum reservoirs.\u000a      The work has allowed the industry to reduce the risks associated with the\u000a      exploration of fault-\u000a      bounded reservoirs, and to identify areas of un-drained reserves in\u000a      producing reservoirs.

Despite their importance, prior to\u000a      the mid-1990s there was\u000a      little understanding of and virtually no quantitative data available on\u000a      the flow processes and\u000a      permeability of faults in petroleum reservoirs. Consequently, petroleum\u000a      engineers were forced to\u000a      guess the values of fault rock permeability when modelling fluid flow in\u000a      petroleum reservoirs.\u000a    Between 1994 and 2005, Rob Knipe and Quentin Fisher led a\u000a      series of frontline Joint Industry\u000a      Projects (JIPs) and NERC grants (e.g. GR3\/5765, GR3\/4612) at the\u000a      University of Leeds to remove\u000a      this knowledge gap. These JIPs were integrated\/multidisciplinary studies\u000a      of faulting mechanisms\u000a      and fluid flow behaviour; and the generation of a robust database on the\u000a      structure and petro-\u000a      physical properties of faults within petroleum reservoirs. Three of the\u000a      JIPs built up the most\u000a      extensive database of the permeability and capillary entry pressure of\u000a      fault rocks ever generated.\u000a    Rock Deformation Research (RDR), an applied research Fault Foundation\u000a      programme, was\u000a      established in 1997 as a University of Leeds spin-out company to assess\u000a      faulting processes and\u000a      flow behaviour. With 15 company sponsors in 2012, RDR represents one of\u000a      the largest active\u000a      global structural geology consortia. This project built up the data and\u000a      knowledge on sub-seismic\u000a      structure of faults based on extensive outcrop studies. Some results from\u000a      the studies of faults in\u000a      petroleum systems were published [1,2,3,4], although most remain\u000a      confidential.\u000a    University of Leeds research has pioneered the determination and\u000a      prediction of flow properties in\u000a      faulted reservoirs. In the early 2000s, Knipe, Fisher and\u000a      their team became the first scientists to\u000a      recognise and provide evidence for the potential importance of\u000a      incorporating the multiphase flow\u000a      properties of faults into production simulation models [3,5,6].\u000a      The research showed that it was\u000a      important to understand the multiphase flow properties of the fault rocks\u000a      to predict whether or not\u000a      other reservoir compartments need to be drilled. Unfortunately, no data\u000a      were available on the\u000a      multiphase flow properties of fault rocks.\u000a    The University of Leeds responded by investing nearly &#163;2 million in\u000a      building a state-of-the-art\u000a      multiphase flow laboratory (www.see.leeds.ac.uk\/wolfson).\u000a      This provided an important platform for\u000a      the School of Earth and Environment's petroleum research programmes, and\u000a      for the initiation of a\u000a      large JIP involving 9 major oil companies to make the first ever\u000a      measurements of the relative\u000a      permeability of fault rocks [6]. The Wolfson laboratory has now\u000a      received over &#163;2 million of\u000a      sponsorship from industry (BG, BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, EBN, Perenco,\u000a      Petrobras, Shell, Statoil,\u000a      Total, and Wintershall).\u000a    The University of Leeds continues to host a thriving group of more than\u000a      10 academics, post-docs\u000a      and PhD students conducting frontline research on the impact of reservoir\u000a      deformation on fluid\u000a      flow.

Third, it adds up the\u000a      costs and benefits of the widespread deployment of different low carbon\u000a      options and it assesses\u000a      the investment needs and payback periods for different levels of change.\u000a      Fourth, it develops a\u000a      baseline that takes into account the future impacts of on-going trends in\u000a      energy use. Against this\u000a      baseline, the impacts of different levels of change are added, allowing\u000a      the assessment to identify\u000a      the levels of cost and carbon saving that could be achieved with different\u000a      levels of investment.\u000a      The subsequent evidence base is detailed and robust enough to enable\u000a      cities to focus their\u000a      activities on the most cost- or carbon-effective options, and to secure\u000a      the finances needed to\u000a      invest in exploiting these.\u000a    For example, applying this method to the Leeds City Region, it is found\u000a      that &#163;5.4 billion (10% of its\u000a      GDP) leaks out of the local economy every year through payment of its\u000a      energy bill [2,3]. However,\u000a      the research also shows that there are commercially attractive\u000a      opportunities to invest &#163;4.9 billion to\u000a      exploit profitable low carbon measures that would cut the energy bill by\u000a      &#163;1.2 billion a year, paying\u000a      for themselves within four years, creating 4,500 jobs in the low carbon\u000a      goods and services sector\u000a      and cutting the carbon footprint by 36%.\u000a    The research therefore demonstrates that there can be a compelling\u000a      business case for major scale\u000a      investments in low carbon options at the local level, and that this\u000a      business case is supported by a\u000a      wider social and economic case. This evidence base enables these\u000a      investments to be made [4]. It\u000a      also enables the production of league tables of the most cost and carbon\u000a      effective measures\u000a      available for the domestic, commercial, industrial and transport sectors,\u000a      allowing more focused and\u000a      incisive decisions to be taken both on policy and investment terms in\u000a      different contexts. This work\u000a      therefore provides a practical way of identifying opportunities and\u000a      creating the preconditions for, but\u000a      importantly also recognising the limits of [5], approaches that\u000a      seek to decouple economic growth\u000a      from environmental impact.\u000a    Key researcher\u000a    Andrew Gouldson, Professor of Sustainability Research\u000a      (2006-present) in the School of Earth and\u000a      Environment, University of Leeds.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6323","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"933860","Name":"Botswana"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Our research has had impact at national and international levels,\u000a      stemming from our long-standing engagement with policymakers, agricultural\u000a      extension workers and land managers.\u000a    National level impacts\u000a    The research led to the development of new integrated land degradation\u000a      monitoring and assessment methods [1], which were adopted at the\u000a      national level in Botswana [A]. Environmental assessment manuals\u000a      based on field research undertaken by Reed and Dougill (based on\u000a      socio-ecological research led from Leeds, 1998 to present) resulted in new\u000a      local monitoring systems linked to management decision support tools.\u000a      These have been distributed by Dougill since 2010 through agricultural\u000a      extension services in 3 sub-districts of Botswana (SW Kgalagadi, S\u000a      Kgalagadi and mid-Boteti). Our methods prompted a shift away from solely\u000a      scientific evaluation of land quality towards integration of scientific\u000a      knowledge with local knowledge. This research was a contributing factor\u000a      that altered the emphasis of Botswana's land degradation priorities to\u000a      include ecological change including bush encroachment of grazing lands\u000a      (e.g. Fire Suppression Programme 2011), rather than solely wind erosion,\u000a      which previously dominated national policy statements (e.g. UNCCD National\u000a      Action Programme, 2006).\u000a    The new methodology for explicitly including local knowledge has ensured\u000a      that assessment tools are easy to understand, do not require expensive\u000a      equipment and that indicators are suited to the environmental, social and\u000a      economic context, allowing sustained monitoring to take place. The\u000a      assessment manuals provide information on appropriate indicators and new\u000a      decision-support tools, which have guided sustainable land management\u000a      practices by outlining practical and cost-effective management\u000a      alternatives to new Village Rangeland Management Committees established in\u000a      12 Botswana villages. The manuals are also used in national training\u000a      programmes for agricultural extension staff provided by the Botswana\u000a      College of Agriculture and Government Department of Agricultural Research\u000a      [A]. Enhanced community involvement in rangeland degradation\u000a      monitoring targets policy gaps noted in the UNCCD National Action\u000a      Programme (Republic of Botswana, 2006). Similar approaches are being\u000a      replicated globally and are being advanced through major international\u000a      programmes in which Stringer and Dougill have a role. These international\u000a      projects include EUFP6 DESIRE, EUFP7 CASCADE, the Food and Agriculture\u000a      Organisation's LADA (LAnd Degradation Assessment) programme and the World\u000a      Overview of Conservation Approaches and Technologies (WOCAT).\u000a    International level impacts\u000a    Our research [2-6] has also informed international policy by\u000a      changing the ways in which scientific input feeds into international\u000a      policy on land degradation [B, G]. In doing so, it has introduced\u000a      new topics to the UNCCD policy agenda, including knowledge management, the\u000a      economics of land degradation and the need to strengthen the\u000a      science-policy interface [C]. Recognition of the value of our\u000a      input in informing international policy has led to a formal Memorandum of\u000a      Understanding between the University and the UNCCD Secretariat [B].\u000a      The letter from the UNCCD Executive Secretary accompanying the MoU signed\u000a      in Jan 2013 [B] states: \"I take this opportunity to express my\u000a      deep gratitude to the University of Leeds for its support to the work of\u000a      the UNCCD secretariat and the implementation of the Convention\".\u000a    Recommendations building on proposals by Stringer in 2008 [5]\u000a      drew attention to the lack of suitable channels for research to feed into\u000a      the UNCCD - an issue that was relatively low on the international policy\u000a      agenda prior to its use to develop a COP Briefing paper [F]. The\u000a      initial impact of this was a shift away from dependence upon a Roster of\u000a      Experts (membership of which was politically determined by governments)\u000a      towards wider scientific input through UNCCD Scientific Conferences\u000a      (drawing on peer-reviewed science that also integrates local knowledge).\u000a      Routes to enhance the science-policy interface over the longer term\u000a      featured in White Paper 3 [D], which was developed for the First\u000a      UNCCD Scientific Conference (Buenos Aires, 2009) [E]. An e-survey\u000a      consultation was commissioned by the UNCCD in July 2011, building on\u000a      recommendations in [C] and [D]. Stringer's key\u000a      involvement in the research that informed these actions led to an\u000a      invitation to undertake a series of scientific reviews, presented to COP10\u000a      (Changwon, 2011). She peer-reviewed the e-survey analysis and results were\u000a      adopted in CST\/L.9\/COP.10 [C], calling for the establishment of an\u000a      ad hoc Working Group on Scientific Advice to the UNCCD, to\u000a      determine the optimal structure of the science-policy interface for land\u000a      degradation issues. The first meeting of the ad hoc Working Group\u000a      took place in July 2012, which began the evaluation of possible\u000a      science-policy interface options proposed. The international impact of the\u000a      research is thus twofold: i) a change to public policy and ii) development\u000a      of new institutional structures [G].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Science has guided national dryland policy in Africa through approaches\u000a      that have omitted local knowledge, and has informed international policy\u000a      through implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat\u000a      Desertification (UNCCD), previously developed by a Roster of Experts.

The work was led by Leeds\u000a      researchers Andrew Dougill and Mark Reed (PhD student, Researcher,\u000a      and Lecturer, 2000-2009) in Botswana [1] and by Lindsay\u000a        Stringer in Swaziland [2], and identified locally-relevant\u000a      degradation indicators and sustainable land management practices. The\u000a      outcomes are documented in environmental assessment manuals that are now\u000a      supplied to agricultural extension workers working with pastoralists to\u000a      guide their rangeland management practices. These manuals highlight\u000a      sustainable land management options for communal rangeland areas, and have\u000a      helped to shift the implementation of national agricultural policy away\u000a      from focusing solely on private ranches. The manuals were translated into\u000a      Afrikaans and Setswana using University EKT funds and an ESRC Michael\u000a      Young Prize (awarded to Reed in 2008) and rolled-out in Botswana by Dougill\u000a      (from 2010). Discussions with national policymakers and communities have\u000a      taken place throughout, allowing the research outputs to meet clear user\u000a      demands and enable impact.\u000a    Research informing international policy\u000a    Work in Botswana and Swaziland led by Dougill, Reed, and Stringer\u000a      has informed international policy through the EU FP6-DESIRE project. The\u000a      work developed and tested a new integrated multi-stakeholder approach to\u000a      sharing and managing knowledge on land degradation assessment and\u000a      remediation across a variety of scales [3]. The DESIRE project\u000a      covered 26 countries, and worked alongside global initiatives on land\u000a      degradation including the FAO Land Degradation Assessment in Drylands\u000a      programme and the World Overview of Conservation Approaches and\u000a      Technologies network. The Leeds research led to the production of White\u000a      Paper 3 [4], recognised in UNCCD Conference of the Parties (COP)\u000a      Decision 19.COP.9, and leading to Stringer's invitation to provide\u000a      scientific input to the First UNCCD Scientific Conference (2009). These\u000a      contributions resulted in the introduction of new topics to the UNCCD\u000a      policy agenda (see Section 4 and [5]).\u000a    Further research underpinning international impact included analyses of\u000a      institutional structures, and of knowledge flows into the UNCCD process\u000a      and their effectiveness [6]. This research by Stringer\u000a      found that scientific input into the UNCCD needed to be restructured and\u000a      broadened through the development of new platforms and structures to\u000a      provide integrated assessments that include local knowledge.

Originally a partnership\u000a      between the University of\u000a      Leeds, the Bettys and Taylors Group and Deloitte LLP, UBoC is now a\u000a      registered charity\u000a      (1133285) that brings together business, non-governmental organisations\u000a      and academia to support\u000a      climate change mitigation through protection of the world's forests and\u000a      their peoples. The role of\u000a      the University of Leeds is to provide underpinning scientific rigour to\u000a      the charity's activities based\u000a      on a sound foundation of academic research in climate change and climate\u000a      mitigation [C,D]. In\u000a      collaboration with over 40 national and international non-governmental\u000a      organisations, UBoC has\u000a      established a database of forest protection projects, which is used to\u000a      match UK businesses to\u000a      forest protection projects. Researchers at Leeds support a detailed\u000a      assessment of these projects\u000a      against community, climate and biodiversity criteria. This thorough\u000a      academic assessment lends\u000a      confidence to private sector investment in forest protection [D].\u000a      In its first two years (2009-2011),\u000a      UBoC worked with more than 20 UK businesses to bring about the investment\u000a      of &#163;1.5 million in\u000a      forest protection, resulting in improved management of over 200,000\u000a      hectares of rainforest in\u000a      Tanzania, Peru, Malawi, Kenya, Uganda and India resulting in avoided\u000a      emissions of at least\u000a      620,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide [C]. The charity has also\u000a      achieved notable successes and\u000a      awards in the UK including the Yorkshire Pride 2011 award for the most\u000a      meaningful philanthropic\u000a      initiativeby a business, organisation or leader. Collaboration with UBoC\u000a      has resulted in\u000a      demonstrable benefits to UK companies: Deloitte LLP was ranked 16th in\u000a      2012 Sunday Times Best\u000a      companies to work for with a top 10 result for environmental protection\u000a      which was directly\u000a      attributed by the newspaper to the company's work to preserve Tanzanian\u000a      rainforest, which is\u000a      being done in collaboration with UBoC [E].\u000a    Biofuel Policy Impact\u000a    The underpinning research has impacted UK biofuel policy. After the paper\u000a      in Science [2] was\u000a      published, Spracklen was invited to provide expert advice to the\u000a      House of Commons\u000a      Environmental Audit Committee in 2007, where he argued that UK biofuels\u000a      policy needs to account\u000a      for land-use change emissions from biofuel production. The report on this\u000a      session of the committee\u000a      concluded that \"The stimulation of biofuels production by the\u000a        Government and EU is reckless in the\u000a        absence of effective mechanisms to prevent the destruction of carbon\u000a        sinks internationally. The\u000a        Government must ensure that carbon sinks are effectively protected\u000a        before providing incentives for\u000a        the use of biofuels\" [F]. In 2008, Spracklen was\u000a      invited by the think-tank Policy Exchange to write\u000a      a policy report detailing land use emissions from biofuels [3].\u000a      Media coverage of these reports [2,3]\u000a      was extensive (including BBC, Guardian, Telegraph, New Scientist) and\u000a      helped disseminate\u000a      findings of the research and contributed to wider public awareness of the\u000a      issue. In 2009,\u000a      Spracklen and Policy Exchange submitted joint written evidence to\u000a      the Environmental Audit\u000a      Committee on deforestation. The Leeds-led research influenced policy\u000a      debates of the sustainability\u000a      of biofuels within the United Nations, the Food and Agriculture\u000a      Organisation and the United Nations\u000a      Environment Programme documented in a range of publications and reports [G,H].\u000a      In total,\u000a      research by Spracklen [2,3] was cited by over 250 policy relevant\u000a      publications. The above\u000a      research evidence and debate contributed to a decision in December 2011 by\u000a      the UK Government\u000a      to amend the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) to include\u000a      mandatory sustainability\u000a      criteria which would for the first time address carbon emissions from\u000a      land-use change [I]. Under\u000a      the amendment, fuel suppliers must account for land-use change emissions\u000a      and be able to\u000a      demonstrate that cultivation of biofuel feedstocks do not damage areas\u000a      with high carbon stocks.\u000a      This policy amendment will ensure that biofuel use in the UK does not\u000a      result in the clearance of\u000a      natural forests and grasslands worldwide.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    We conducted research on the impact of land-use change that has resulted\u000a      in international action\u000a      to improve forest management.

Dominick Spracklen has led research\u000a      to improve the understanding\u000a      of these processes, and this research has subsequently allowed a land-use\u000a      policy to be crafted\u000a      that effectively mitigates climate change.\u000a    Whilst there are numerous observations of carbon storage in lowland\u000a      tropical forests, observations\u000a      in tropical mountain ecosystems are limited. In 2005, a project led by Spracklen\u000a      reported some of\u000a      the first observations of carbon storage and sequestration in tropical\u000a      mountain forests in Ecuador\u000a      [1]. This involved direct measurement of trees in Ecuadorian\u000a      forests and subsequent accurate\u000a      estimation of total biomass, upon which the calculations were based.\u000a    In 2007, Spracklen co-authored a study in Science\u000a      contrasting the carbon mitigation potential of\u000a      using land to grow crops for liquid biofuels against protecting and\u000a      restoring forests [2]. The paper\u000a      demonstrated that the carbon sequestered by protecting and restoring\u000a      forests is considerably\u000a      greater than the carbon emissions avoided through the use of liquid\u000a      biofuels. The paper was the\u000a      first to highlight the large land-use carbon emissions that result if\u000a      forests are cleared to make way\u000a      for biofuel crops. In 2008, Spracklen was the lead author of a\u000a      policy review of the impacts of forest\u000a      management on climate mitigation [3].\u000a    The research also aimed to quantify the non-carbon effects of forests on\u000a      climate. Previous studies\u000a      concluded that boreal forests (those at high latitudes) warm the climate\u000a      due to absorption of the\u000a      Sun's heat by the dark forest canopy but ignored the impacts of forests on\u000a      atmospheric aerosol. In\u000a      2008, Leeds researchers Spracklen and Kenneth Carslaw (Lecturer\u000a      1999-2006 and Professor\u000a      2006-present of Atmospheric Science in the School of Earth and\u000a      Environment) led a study that\u000a      used a global atmospheric model to show that through emission of organic\u000a      vapours boreal forests\u000a      double regional cloud condensation nuclei concentrations, increasing cloud\u000a      reflectivity and causing\u000a      a strong cooling impact on climate [4].\u000a    Climate change will also impact forest ecosystems. In 2009, Spracklen\u000a      led a project that\u000a      calculated that climate change over the period 2000 to 2050 is likely to\u000a      cause a 50% increase in\u000a      forest wild fire across the western United States [5]. The\u000a      research was based upon historical data\u000a      on the relationship between weather patterns and forest fires, and the\u000a      predicted weather patterns\u000a      that are likely to arise as climate change proceeds.\u000a    In 2012, Leeds researchers Spracklen and Stephen Arnold (Lecturer\u000a      2003-2011, Senior Lecturer\u000a      2011-2013 and Associate Professor 2013-present of Atmospheric Composition\u000a      in the School of\u000a      Earth and Environment) used satellite observations of tropical rainfall\u000a      and a model of atmospheric\u000a      air flow patterns to demonstrate that forests substantially increase\u000a      downwind rainfall [6].

Access to spatial data sets, such as\u000a      satellite gravity, can have a massive impact on targeting potential oil\u000a      structures which can be followed up by more detailed and expensive\u000a      exploration methods such as 3D seismic and CSEM prior to drilling.\u000a    Satellite-derived gravity data sets were available in the mid-1990s.\u000a      However, take-up of these early products as a commercial exploration tool\u000a      was modest due to their limited accuracy, resolution and reliability. The\u000a      improvements in resolution that were made through this research led to a\u000a      step change in the use of satellite altimeter data to grade frontier\u000a      offshore areas for exploration. Satellite gravity data are now widely used\u000a      throughout the offshore oil industry, and Getech is a major supplier.\u000a    Although gravity data measured on a ship or on the seabed can provide\u000a      better accuracy and resolution than satellite gravity, they are relatively\u000a      expensive and time consuming to acquire - and speed is a major factor in\u000a      exploration as it is competitive and often needs to be carried out to\u000a      specific timetables. Satellite data, on the other hand, are valuable,\u000a      because they are already available for any offshore area and enable rapid\u000a      assessment of new exploration areas. In consequence, satellite gravity\u000a      data continue to be used by oil and gas companies for hydrocarbon\u000a      exploration &#8212; especially in frontier areas or at regional scales (see [A1]).\u000a    The economic value of the underpinning research can be measured in terms\u000a      of the value of the Getech marine gravity data to their customers; this is\u000a      related to the value of the data for each offshore exploration and the\u000a      number of times the data have been employed. According to Shell [A1],\u000a      cost savings afforded by the use of satellite marine gravity data are\u000a      related to the improvement in quality (accuracy, resolution and\u000a      reliability) over alternative products, and they estimate that a 10%\u000a      improvement in the reliability of marine gravity data yields at least\u000a      US$2.5M increase in the value of a single project. Two other Getech\u000a      customers confirm that the use of Getech Trident data set has indeed led\u000a      to a 10% improvement in the reliability of marine gravity data for\u000a      prospecting [B, C]. Four Getech customers [A1, A2, B, C,\u000a      and D] confirm that the Getech marine gravity data have been used\u000a      routinely for frontier exploration in offshore areas, and three of these\u000a      customers [A2, B, C] state that the Trident data set has been used\u000a      in 3, 35-40, and 12 exploration projects per year, respectively.\u000a    In addition to reducing commercial risk, the increased use of satellite\u000a      data has the added advantage of mitigating other risks associated with\u000a      exploration (see [A1]). Limiting risks to personnel and the\u000a      environment is very important to exploration companies; thus, technologies\u000a      which do not involve people working on the ground have important\u000a      advantages.\u000a    The underpinning research has of course also been of economic value to\u000a      Getech itself [E]; the improved gravity anomaly data have\u000a      benefited the company through income and through reputational gain. Getech\u000a      received &#163;1.2M between 2002 and 2004 from six leading oil companies for\u000a      their initial marine gravity data set, helping enable the company to be\u000a      floated in 2005. Since then, and during the REF period, Getech has\u000a      licensed updated versions of the gravity data sets to sponsors, developed\u000a      as a consequence of technological improvements derived from the\u000a      underpinning research. The long-standing collaboration between Getech and\u000a      the University of Leeds has therefore maintained the economic impact and\u000a      reach of the underpinning research.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research carried out at the University of Leeds has been used to develop\u000a      data sets that are now routinely used in offshore oil exploration to\u000a      identify prospective areas faster, and with reduced cost. New techniques\u000a      applied to satellite altimeter data have been used to compute gravity\u000a      anomalies in marine areas with increased accuracy and reliability relative\u000a      to earlier products.

However, although\u000a      satellite altimeter data with good coverage were available (~4 km track\u000a      spacing over most of the oceans), the resolution of the derived gravity\u000a      grids was significantly worse, particularly in coastal regions. In\u000a      consequence, the potential applications of satellite gravity anomalies\u000a      were limited in scope by the available data.\u000a    Between 1996 and 1998, Leeds researchers Derek Fairhead, Chris Green,\u000a      and Stefan Maus (Researcher, 1996-1998) developed an improved method of\u000a      detecting marine gravity anomalies using satellite altimeter data. Their\u000a      approach was to use the most basic altimeter data available - the raw\u000a      waveforms transmitted from and recorded by the satellite. This relatively\u000a      large data set required sophisticated processing, and a range of new\u000a      techniques were developed to pick the exact return time of the radar\u000a      echoes, and to test the robustness and accuracy of the retrievals. The\u000a      results demonstrated a significant improvement over previously-available\u000a      along-track data, enabling the production of improved gravity anomaly\u000a      grids [1].\u000a    Subsequent research (1997-1998) by Green and Fairhead in\u000a      association with Getech reviewed the whole process of generating satellite\u000a      gravity data. By modifying the details of the various techniques, it was\u000a      shown that the improved along-track satellite altimeter data could be\u000a      processed to provide improved gravity anomaly grids. Paper [2] and\u000a      report [5] describe these techniques and demonstrate that the\u000a      improvement in results compared with gravity data from other sources is\u000a      better than 10% (see also corroboration [B, C]). These new\u000a      techniques were later (2002-2004) applied by Getech to develop a new\u000a      gravity data set for the continental margins of the world [6].\u000a      Paper [3] looks at a specific area of interest and quantifies the\u000a      improvement achieved by applying the new techniques.\u000a    Sustained collaboration between Getech and the University of Leeds has\u000a      driven further advances in the technology. In 2008, Fairhead led\u000a      research on the effectiveness of combining gravity data sets derived from\u000a      different satellite missions, resulting in the production of Getech's new\u000a      Trident marine gravity product with improved resolution and\u000a      reliability [4]. In 2012, Green and Fairhead\u000a      initiated a joint research collaboration with Leeds to maintain their\u000a      industry-leading position by incorporating the latest generation of\u000a      interferometric satellite altimeter data. This project has now evolved\u000a      into a major 3-year oil industry sponsored study (2013-2016) to improve,\u000a      yet further, the resolution of the data.\u000a    The impact of the research has been achieved via Getech, primarily\u000a      through the sale of gravity data products, which are used by oil companies\u000a      in hydrocarbon exploration.\u000a    Key researchers:\u000a    Derek Fairhead, Lecturer and Professor (now Emeritus)\u000a      (1973-present) of Applied Geophysics in the School of Earth and\u000a      Environment, University of Leeds; Managing Director (1991-2011) and\u000a      President (2011-present) of Getech\u000a    Chris Green, Research Assistant (1983-1992) and Teaching Assistant\u000a      (2010-present) in the School of Earth and Environment, University of\u000a      Leeds; Scientist (1992-2010) at Getech\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6326","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3474414","Name":"Falkland Islands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Improved weather forecasts &#8212; protecting people\u000a    The 3DVOM predictive computer model is now fully integrated into the\u000a      operational forecasting of the Met Office in the UK, aided by the transfer\u000a      of Dr Simon Vosper (Research Fellow, 1995-2001) from Mobbs' Leeds\u000a      research group to the Met Office in 2004-05. It provides meteorologists\u000a      with predictions of vertical wind speed, which they can integrate into\u000a      their forecasts.\u000a    The 3DVOM software was initially deployed in 2005 for forecasting\u000a      hazardous turbulence in the Falkland Islands, especially around MPA.\u000a      However, following additional studies and testing by the Leeds group, the\u000a      Met Office extended its operational use of 3DVOM to four UK meteorological\u000a      domains: south-west England (Dartmoor and Bodmin moor), north Wales\u000a      (Snowdonia), northern England (the Pennines and the Lake District) and\u000a      eastern Scotland (the Grampians) [A1,A2]. In 2007 the domains of\u000a      Northern Ireland and eastern Ireland were added. Since this application of\u000a      3DVOM to the UK, duty forecasters have been able to use the model's output\u000a      to produce warnings of hazardous turbulence for both the MoD and civil\u000a      aviation authorities across the country, allowing them to adjust flight\u000a      plans accordingly [B].\u000a    Since 2010 the 3DVOM system has been run four times per day serving 5 UK\u000a      areas, Eire and the Falklands, giving forecasters refreshed model\u000a      predictions every six hours. Direct users include all the Aviation and\u000a      Defence forecasters within the Met Office Head Quarters (Exeter), all the\u000a      outstations (e.g. Falkland Island) and within the Defence sites (c.5).\u000a      3DVOM predictions for low- level winds, combined with outputs from other\u000a      forecasting models, are also used by forecasters to assess the risk of\u000a      overturning for high-sided vehicles on exposed routes, such as the A1\u000a      trunk road to the east of the Pennines. Forecasts of `gusts' in public\u000a      weather forecasts and warnings issued by the Met Office are based on 3DVOM\u000a      output [B].\u000a    Commercial benefits &#8212; reducing costly diversions from Mount Pleasant\u000a        Airport\u000a    MPA was constructed in the Falkland Islands in the 1980s following the\u000a      conflict there to service the military garrison. It is often afflicted by\u000a      severe turbulence, which prevents incoming aircraft from landing. Aircraft\u000a      from the UK fly to MPA via Ascension Island, over seven hours flying time\u000a      away. If flights to MPA are unable to land they are diverted to distant\u000a      airports in South America, at least three hours away. Here the crew must\u000a      rest for more than 12 hours and the passengers must be accommodated during\u000a      this time. Such diversions are costly: rough estimates suggest diversion\u000a      costs for a flight are somewhere around &#163;250,000, based on additional\u000a      aviation fuel costs, airport charges and unscheduled overnight\u000a      accommodation for 300 passengers [C,D].\u000a    Clearly it is preferable for flights to remain at Ascension until weather\u000a      conditions at MPA improve; ideally accurate weather and turbulence\u000a      forecasts are required at least 12 hours in advance of take-off from the\u000a      Ascension stopover. Since the implementation of 3DVOM for Falkland Islands\u000a      forecasting by the Met Office in 2005, the system has helped to avoid\u000a      approximately five diversions per year, with a cost saving to the MoD of\u000a      around &#163;1.25 million per year [B,D].\u000a    The 3DVOM turbulence forecasts have also helped to protect military\u000a      personnel at MPA, for example in a case described by the Principal Met\u000a      Officer at MPA: \"I did have a case last year when a VVIP was on board\u000a        the airbridge, and I advised all in this region that the vertical motion\u000a        was of great concern as we were forecasting very strong cross winds and\u000a        rotors during the usual airbridge arrival time. I briefed CBF [Chief of\u000a        British Forces] along with many operators, and we managed to delay the\u000a        aircraft until the wind backed westerly, to reduce any diversion risk\"\u000a      [B].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research carried out at the University of Leeds has led to the\u000a      development of a system for predicting severe air turbulence at airports\u000a      and elsewhere.

Strong winds passing over and\u000a      around a hill generate pockets of highly turbulent `spinning' air, which\u000a      are dangerous for aircraft. When atmospheric conditions for rotor\u000a      streaming occur, flights may be diverted to a safer airport.\u000a    Although rotor streaming has been recorded many times since the 1950s,\u000a      meteorologists have had limited success in predicting this phenomenon.\u000a      Even the high-resolution weather models of the UK's Met Office, which run\u000a      on supercomputers, have been unable to resolve the details of these\u000a      turbulent eddies, which typically are very small (a few hundred metres) in\u000a      scale.\u000a    In 1999 the Ministry of Defence (MoD) commissioned a Leeds team led by Stephen\u000a        Mobbs to develop a new forecasting system for turbulence at the new\u000a      Mount Pleasant Airport (MPA), Falkland Islands, which suffered from\u000a      problems of expensive flight diversions. The work was funded on the basis\u000a      of Mobbs' expertise on airflows over mountains (e.g. [1]).\u000a      Following a successful first phase, the MoD continued to support the\u000a      development of the forecasting model in three additional phases over a\u000a      period of about four years (1999-2004), and the research was further\u000a      supported by funding from the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC)\u000a      between 2002 and 2007.\u000a    Mobbs and colleagues from Leeds spent two years taking atmospheric\u000a      measurements in the Falkland Islands and in Scotland [2,3]. Some\u000a      of this work required the team to modify the design of sensitive\u000a      barographs so they could measure the effect of lee waves on the drag force\u000a      on hills. These instruments were deployed in the Falklands and in the UK;\u000a      readings from these instruments helped the researchers to understand the\u000a      parameters and dynamics of rotor streaming and diagnose the physical\u000a      processes that were the cause of the severe turbulence at MPA.\u000a    Such detailed ground-based and aircraft observations generated a detailed\u000a      understanding of this localised turbulence which allowed the researchers\u000a      to develop a computer prediction model, later called 3D Velocities Over\u000a      Mountains (3DVOM) [5]. Analysis of this data over several years\u000a      also led to new and more detailed understanding of turbulent airflow over\u000a      hills [4].\u000a    Model refinement, testing and validation\u000a    As part of the wider development of the predictive model, Mobbs\u000a      and his colleagues carried out an 18-month experiment in collaboration\u000a      with the Met Office. The study focused on the Pennines in northern England\u000a      to address turbulence encountered by flights to and from the chain of MoD\u000a      airfields in North Yorkshire, as well as wind hazards on the A1 trunk road\u000a      [5]. Both the Leeds research group and the Met Office team\u000a      contributed equally to the collection of field data and modelling using\u000a      3DVOM. The team also studied capabilities of the 3DVOM system to forecast\u000a      turbulence in steeper mountains, carrying out experiments in Switzerland\u000a      in 2003 [6]. This work demonstrated that techniques developed for\u000a      the Falkland Islands could be effectively adapted to similar turbulence\u000a      situations elsewhere.\u000a    By 2007, 3DVOM had been integrated into the Met Office's suite of\u000a      forecasting models; the Met Office was able to improve its turbulence\u000a      forecasting to airports using the new technology (see Section 4).\u000a    Key researcher:\u000a    Stephen Mobbs, Professor of Atmospheric Dynamics (1995-present) in\u000a      the School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6408","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aPETGAS created an impact from a very early stage and was viewed as being so successful by the\u000d\u000asponsors that it they provided a further &#163;930,000 to fund a second stage of the project.

In 2011-2012,\u000d\u000aAurelian spent &#163;35 million drilling and hydraulically fracturing two horizontal wells within the\u000d\u000aSiekierki Field. The well performance was not as good as was hoped for, in that low gas production\u000d\u000arates were accompanied by high water production rates. Aurelian and several of their consultants\u000d\u000ainitially thought that the poor performance resulted from the hydraulic fractures intersecting natural\u000d\u000afractures that drained the underlying aquifer. A plan was therefore made to drill additional wells in\u000d\u000aan area less likely to contain natural fractures. However, results from Leeds as part of the PETGAS\u000d\u000aproject provided an alternative explanation for the production behaviour. In particular, based on\u000d\u000amicrostructural analysis of the reservoir rock and comparing these to other rocks on the PETGAS\u000d\u000adatabase it was possible to rapidly estimate the key petro-physical properties (permeability,\u000d\u000acapillary pressure and relative permeability) that controlled gas flow in the reservoir. These\u000d\u000aproperties were then incorporated into a production simulation model and suggested that gas\u000d\u000aexpansion in the reservoir was responsible for the high rates of water production instead of the\u000d\u000apresence of open fractures. The results from the simulation model indicated that it was possible\u000d\u000athat the brine production rates would decrease with time. Overall, these results had a very rapid\u000d\u000aimpact on the field development plan. So instead of drilling more wells with the aim of avoiding\u000d\u000anatural fracture networks, the company decided to conduct longer term well tests to assess how\u000d\u000abrine and gas production rates evolved with time.\u000d\u000aA senior executive of San Leon confirms: \"PETGAS input on our Siekierki core significantly helped\u000d\u000ain the understanding of water production mechanisms, explaining water production to be from the\u000d\u000arock matrix rather than the initial assumption of flow along natural fractures. This informed the\u000d\u000atechnical re-evaluation and dramatically changed the proposed reservoir development plan\" [A].\u000d\u000aThe executive adds that \"The study showed that by integrating microstructural information with a\u000d\u000adatabase of petro-physical properties of tight gas reservoirs, it may be possible to provide\u000d\u000areasonably accurate estimates of reservoir properties...within a few days rather than waiting\u000d\u000amonths to years for the results from core analysis\" [A].The results of the PETGAS research have\u000d\u000abeen placed on a web-based database along with wireline log data from the wells analysed [B].\u000d\u000aThe results can be used easily by the sponsors to identify analogues and improve reservoir\u000d\u000acharacterisation.

These reservoirs are difficult and only marginally\u000d\u000aeconomic to produce. It is therefore essential to dramatically reduce costs in the exploration,\u000d\u000aappraisal and development of these reservoirs.\u000d\u000aThe University of Leeds has established an excellent reputation in industry and academia for\u000d\u000aconducting high-quality research on the single and multiphase flow properties of low permeability\u000d\u000arocks [1,2,3]. In response to an industry-led call for future research into unconventional gas\u000d\u000areservoirs, Quentin Fisher established a joint industry project entitled PEtro-physics of Tight Gas\u000d\u000aReservoirs (PETGAS). The initial phase of the project took place from 2009 to 2012 and was\u000d\u000asponsored by Aurelian Oil and Gas, BG, BP, EBN, Shell and Wintershall to a cost of &#163;900,000. A\u000d\u000asecond phase of the project started in July 2012. The aim of the project was to improve\u000d\u000aunderstanding of the petro-physical properties (porosity, permeability, relative permeability,\u000d\u000acapillary pressure, elastic moduli, and electrical resistivity) of tight gas sandstone reservoirs to\u000d\u000aimprove predictions of reservoir performance and to reduce costs associated with reservoir\u000d\u000acharacterization in these marginally economic developments.\u000d\u000aFisher conducted a wide range of tests on the petro-physical properties of around 150 tight gas\u000d\u000asandstone samples provided by sponsors. Analyses included: microstructural and mineralogical\u000d\u000aassessment, porosity, gas and brine permeability, as well as compressional and shear wave\u000d\u000avelocity as a function of stress, electrical resistivity, NMR T2 distribution and Hg-injection\u000d\u000aporosimetry. After rock typing, 40% of the samples were subject to special core analysis including\u000d\u000acapillary pressure, resistivity and relative permeability as a function of stress, cation exchange\u000d\u000acapacity, surface area analysis and NMR cryoporometry. In addition, experiments were conducted\u000d\u000ato address specific issues such as the use of restricted rate practice to enhance production from\u000d\u000atight gas reservoirs. These parameters were matched with the microstructure of the samples when\u000d\u000aviewed in a microscope. The results showed that the key petro-physical properties of the tight gas\u000d\u000asandstone can be predicted by a sample's microstructure [4].\u000d\u000aA blind test was conducted at the end of the project which attempted to predict a wide range of\u000d\u000aproperties based simply on their microstructure obtained by scanning electron microscopy. The\u000d\u000aestimates provided proved to be incredibly close to the measured values [4]. In other words, simply\u000d\u000aby inspecting a sample of the sandstone it was possible to gauge its properties and the likelihood\u000d\u000athat it will be potentially productive or otherwise. This in turn means that it is now possible to\u000d\u000aprovide accurate estimates of reservoir petro-physical properties within a day of them being cored\u000d\u000aas opposed to waiting six months to two years for the results from laboratory tests. This provides\u000d\u000athe operators with an early indication of the likely reservoir performance, allowing them to optimise\u000d\u000afuture appraisal and development programmes or in some cases relinquish the asset to avoid more\u000d\u000afruitless expense [4].\u000d\u000aPETGAS has also conducted specific experiments that should lead to changes in practice within\u000d\u000athe industry. For example, experiments were conducted to address the impact of stress on\u000d\u000aabsolute and relative permeability of tight gas sandstones. The results suggest that these\u000d\u000aproperties are extremely stress-dependent and that it would be worthwhile implementing restricted\u000d\u000arate practice in which lower pressure drawdowns\/production rates are used to improve longer-term\u000d\u000aproduction [4].\u000d\u000aKey researcher\u000d\u000aProfessor Quentin Fisher, Researcher, University of Leeds spin-out company RDR (1992-2008);\u000d\u000aPrincipal Researcher (2003-2007) and Professor of Petroleum Geoengineering (2008-present) in\u000d\u000athe School of Earth and Environment, University of Leeds.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"6423","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2629691","Name":"Iceland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    As the first ever quantitative assessment of the impact of a future\u000d\u000a      Icelandic Laki-type eruption on\u000d\u000a      air quality and human health, the research conducted at the University of\u000d\u000a      Leeds provided evidence\u000d\u000a      (i.e., the number of potential fatalities due to a future Laki-type\u000d\u000a      eruption), which resulted in policy\u000d\u000a      changes by the UK Government.

In May 2010, Schmidt\u000d\u000a      presented to this subgroup the\u000d\u000a      first quantitative assessment of the potential effects that a future\u000d\u000a      Laki-type eruption could have on\u000d\u000a      the air quality and human health in Europe and the UK [A].\u000d\u000a      Consequently, SAGE advised UK\u000d\u000a      government on the range of Icelandic volcanic eruption types that could\u000d\u000a      impact UK society.\u000d\u000a      Stemming from this scientific dissemination, in January 2012 the generic\u000d\u000a      risk of volcanic hazards\u000d\u000a      was added for the first time to the UK National Risk Register (NRR) [A].\u000d\u000a      Two types of eruptions are\u000d\u000a      described: gas-rich Laki-type eruptions and explosive ash-rich eruptions.\u000d\u000a      In the 2012 NRR, Laki-type\u000d\u000a      eruptions were given the second highest impact score (4 out of 5) with a\u000d\u000a      relative likelihood of\u000d\u000a      occurring in the next five years of between 1 in 200 and 1 in 20; that is\u000d\u000a      the same planning priority\u000d\u000a      scenario as coastal flooding events (https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/publications\/national-risk-\u000d\u000a        register-for-civil-emergencies-2013-edition; accessed 28 August\u000d\u000a      2013).\u000d\u000a    Both the inclusion of Laki-type eruptions to the UK NRR and the research\u000d\u000a      published by the Leeds\u000d\u000a      aerosol group [1] in September 2011 led the government's Civil\u000d\u000a      Contingencies Secretariat (CCS)\u000d\u000a      to request the British Geological Survey (BGS) to conduct an expert\u000d\u000a      assessment of Laki-type\u000d\u000a      eruptions [A, B]. This work was required to verify that the\u000d\u000a      current state of knowledge and scientific\u000d\u000a      data regarding these gas-rich eruptions are reflected in the NRR (i.e. the\u000d\u000a      NRR is updated if the\u000d\u000a      evidence base changes).\u000d\u000a    In May 2012, the BGS organised a workshop based at CCS in London to\u000d\u000a      gather experts from\u000d\u000a      various fields (volcanology, epidemiology and atmospheric science). This\u000d\u000a      workshop produced a\u000d\u000a      report on \"Large magnitude fissure eruptions in Iceland: source\u000d\u000a        characterisation\" (with Schmidt as\u000d\u000a      a co-author) to advise CCS about current knowledge and future research\u000d\u000a      needs [B]. The report\u000d\u000a      describes the source characteristics of a Laki-type eruption, based on\u000d\u000a      expert elicitation that can be\u000d\u000a      used for probabilistic risk assessment [B].\u000d\u000a    Since May 2012, CCS has been in regular contact with the Leeds team to\u000d\u000a      discuss recent findings\u000d\u000a      and future research needs including funding, which will provide further\u000d\u000a      characterisation of the risks\u000d\u000a      from volcanic eruptions in Iceland. Since 2013, Schmidt has been\u000d\u000a      member of an expert group\u000d\u000a      established by CCS and BGS that meets at regular intervals to advise CCS\u000d\u000a      strategy and policy,\u000d\u000a      and she is also an independent member of the CCS project board \"Effusive\u000d\u000a      volcanic eruption\", part\u000d\u000a      of the CCS High Impact Hazards programme working to increase the UK's\u000d\u000a      preparedness to\u000d\u000a      respond to the hazards such as a Laki-type eruption [A].\u000d\u000a    Increasing public awareness\u000d\u000a    The underpinning 2011 publication [1] was reported in\u000d\u000a      international science publications, such as\u000d\u000a      Nature Geoscience, Science Now and in mainstream news publications such as\u000d\u000a      Der Spiegel [C].\u000d\u000a      The widespread coverage (including the broadcast documentaries described\u000d\u000a      below) has increased\u000d\u000a      public awareness of volcanic hazards, and of their potentially serious\u000d\u000a      impact on health and\u000d\u000a      disruption to wider society.\u000d\u000a    In June 2012, Schmidt contributed to the joint production of\u000d\u000a      scientific documentaries on Icelandic\u000d\u000a      volcanism (NOVA \"Doomsday Volcanoes\" and Channel 5 \"Ashcloud Apocalypse\")\u000d\u000a      which\u000d\u000a      highlighted Laki-type eruptions; the programmes featured Schmidt's\u000d\u000a      scientific results extensively.\u000d\u000a      The January 2013 US premiere of the programme reached an audience of 4.5\u000d\u000a      million viewers [D].\u000d\u000a      The Channel 5 documentary premiered on 26 April 2013 in the UK [E].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The 2010 Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull and 2011 Gr&#237;msv&#246;tn eruptions in Iceland were\u000d\u000a      stark reminders that global\u000d\u000a      society is increasingly vulnerable to volcanic hazards.

The\u000d\u000a      model predicts the formation and distribution of particles in the\u000d\u000a      atmosphere [2].\u000d\u000a    Key to this research was the development of a faster modal aerosol scheme\u000d\u000a      [3] and evaluations of\u000d\u000a      the model to show that it is capable of accurately predicting the size and\u000d\u000a      mass of particles in the air\u000d\u000a      [1,3], and extension of the model to include the necessary\u000d\u000a      chemistry to simulate the feedback of\u000d\u000a      high volcanic sulphur dioxide concentrations on sulphate aerosol\u000d\u000a      production [6].\u000d\u000a    Using GLOMAP and volcanological data, the underpinning research provided\u000d\u000a      evidence that the\u000d\u000a      1783 Laki eruption is likely to have substantially altered the number and\u000d\u000a      size of microscopic\u000d\u000a      particles that lead to cloud formation; hence altering the climate in the\u000d\u000a      Northern Hemisphere [4,5].\u000d\u000a    Quantification of impacts on air quality and potential fatalities\u000d\u000a    In a follow-up study published in Proceedings of the National Academy\u000d\u000a        of Sciences [1] and led by\u000d\u000a      the Leeds researchers, it was demonstrated that a future Laki-type\u000d\u000a      eruption would significantly\u000d\u000a      degrade air quality over Europe for up to twelve months &#8212; effectively\u000d\u000a      doubling the concentrations of\u000d\u000a      small-sized airborne particles during the first three months of the\u000d\u000a      eruption. Using concentration-response\u000d\u000a      functions derived from epidemiological literature together with the\u000d\u000a      increase in airborne\u000d\u000a      particle concentrations predicted by GLOMAP, the study showed that about\u000d\u000a      140,000 additional\u000d\u000a      cardiopulmonary fatalities could occur across Europe within twelve months\u000d\u000a      of the onset of the\u000d\u000a      eruption &#8212; a figure that exceeds the annual mortality from seasonal\u000d\u000a      influenza.\u000d\u000a    Key researchers:\u000d\u000a    Kenneth S.

A press release was issued on the\u000a      same day and the research results were widely reported in the\u000a      international press. Davies\u000a      discussed the results with the Senior Geophysicist at DECC - Department of\u000a      Energy and Climate\u000a      Change) and presented to a wider DECC audience in London on 25th\u000a      April 2012. On 27th Nov\u000a      2012 Davies gave evidence to the Energy and Climate Select Committee on\u000a      shale gas, chaired\u000a      by Rt. Hon. Tim Yeo MP. The impact of the research has been in four main\u000a      areas:\u000a    (1) Policy: On 13th Dec 2012 the government announced\u000a      its decision to lift the ban on fracking.\u000a      In a Radio 5 Live interview on the same day, John Hayes (Minister of State\u000a      for Energy at the time)\u000a      twice referred to the Durham study as providing evidence that\u000a      contamination could not occur if\u000a      fracking were to commence in Lancashire, UK. During the 6 min radio piece\u000a      [7], John Hayes said\u000a      `the claim that the water used in fracking gets into the aquifer was\u000a        categorically refuted by the\u000a        Durham University study'.\u000a    A month later on Jan 16th 2013, Hayes gave evidence to the\u000a      Energy and Climate Change Select\u000a      Committee who were sitting to consider `The Impact of Shale Gas on Energy\u000a      Markets'. The\u000a      transcript of oral evidence and Parliamentary video record show that the\u000a      questions and answers\u000a      moved onto the how shale gas could benefit communities financially. Rt.\u000a      Hon. Tim Yeo MP\u000a      (Chair) asked about ways of `kick-starting the whole [shale gas\u000a      exploitation] process'. John Hayes\u000a      responded `I think the issue of benefit and incentive is one that\u000a        needs to be considered closely'\u000a      then he added `In addition, one might say more information and more\u000a        understanding&#8212;clearly the\u000a        Royal Society of Engineers' report has been helpful, the Durham\u000a        University study has been\u000a        helpful, and, as things move on, I suspect provision of more information\u000a        will lead to a greater\u000a        degree of engagement' [8].\u000a    The radio interview prompted Davies to ask a senior DECC official how the\u000a      research had been\u000a      used in government. In his email to us (Jan 17th 2013) [9],\u000a      he states: `the study was included in a\u000a        briefing to ministers, including John Hayes and `it was also\u000a        referenced in the Royal Society and\u000a        Royal Academy of Engineering report on fracking, and the DECC Chief\u000a        Scientist discussed it with\u000a        John Hayes'.\u000a    The evidence shows the research was a key part of the scientific case\u000a      that the UK government\u000a      used to justify the lifting of the ban and allay public concerns. The\u000a      commercial value of this\u000a      decision is difficult to quantify precisely, but if it leads to\u000a      large-scale exploitation of shale gas, it\u000a      will likely run into billions or tens of billions of pounds.\u000a    Davies has also presented the research results across Europe (London,\u000a      Brussels, Poland,\u000a      Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria and Lithuania) including five meetings with the\u000a      Bulgarian\u000a      government's `42nd Bulgarian National Assembly Sub-Committee on Shale\u000a      gas'. This is tasked\u000a      with analyzing and discussing good practices and legislative solutions to\u000a      regulate activities\u000a      relating to exploration and extraction of mineral resources while\u000a      protecting the environment.\u000a      Bulgaria presently has a ban on fracking in place. The Manager of the\u000a      Global Technology Centre\u000a      at Chevron, one of the world's leading integrated energy companies, said `The\u000a        paper and\u000a        engagement of Richard Davies has helped promote a dispassionate,\u000a        objective, fact-based\u000a        approach to concerns expressed regarding shale gas development to a\u000a        sceptical public and\u000a        media. This will be critical to inform regulation and enable social\u000a        license to operate for natural gas\u000a        from shale which has an important potential role to play in the UK and\u000a        EU energy mix in the\u000a        decades to come.'\u000a    (2) Awareness of risk for local communities. In May 2012,\u000a      concerns came to a head in the\u000a      Sussex Village of Balcombe (population 1,765) over proposals by Cuadrilla\u000a      to carry out fracking\u000a      for shale gas and oil in the area. The Balcombe community pointed out to\u000a      Charles Hendry\u000a      (Minister of State for Energy at the time) and to the Head of Licensing,\u000a      Exploration and\u000a      Development at DECC [10] that the separation distance was less than\u000a      600 m and this was\u000a      grounds to not allow fracking at this site. This triggered a series of\u000a      internal government emails\u000a      between DECC and the Environment Agency on its policy with regard to\u000a      aquifers.\u000a    (3) Process and practice: For shale gas wells where the\u000a      separation distance between water\u000a      aquifers and the fracking is greater than 600 m, the study has been used\u000a      as supporting evidence\u000a      for safe drilling [11&amp;12]. Approval documents for the drilling\u000a      of 34 shale gas wells in Garfield\u000a      county, Colorado, USA have cited the research. The commercial significance\u000a      is that a shale gas\u000a      well costs approximately &#163;4 million and 34 wells therefore cost a total of\u000a      &#163;136 million, with the\u000a      inevitable impact of job creation and allowing for the exploitation of\u000a      shale in this state, which in\u000a      turn generates revenue.\u000a    (4) Protection of the environment: The study has been used by the\u000a      Natural Resources Defence\u000a      Council to influence the USA Environmental protection agency, who are\u000a      developing policy on\u000a      fracking. The UK's Environment Agency uses the research to identify areas\u000a      where it may need to\u000a      acquire more detailed information and expertise [12], particularly\u000a      if it is required to regulate future\u000a      onshore unconventional gas operations in England and Wales. In the EU, the\u000a      research has been\u000a      cited in a report prepared for the Directorate General (DG) Environment\u000a      (40 Directorates-General\u000a      make up the European Commission), which recommended that a safe separation\u000a      distance for\u000a      fracking should be adopted. It states `For example, based on Davies et\u000a        al. (2012) an appropriate\u000a        vertical separation between shale gas extraction and aquifer may be\u000a        considered to be 600\u000a        metres' [14].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Durham research on hydraulic fracturing was an important part of the UK\u000a      government's reasoning\u000a      for lifting the ban on hydraulic fracturing to recover gas and oil from\u000a      shale, which has an estimated\u000a      commercial value in the UK of &#163;1500 billion.

He is\u000a      presently Professor of Energy in Durham Energy Institute and Dean of\u000a      Knowledge Exchange and\u000a      Impact for Durham University. He has worked on natural hydraulic\u000a      fracturing due to overpressure\u000a      in many geological settings since 2002 (14 papers), including mud volcano\u000a      systems. This led to\u000a      three key papers on the Lusi mud volcano (Indonesia) which started to\u000a      erupt on May 29th 2006 [1-\u000a        3]. Davies coordinated an international team by leading the\u000a      authorship of two papers and also two\u000a      comments on other contradictory research. These all examined the role of\u000a      hydraulic fracturing\u000a      due to an influx of fluid into a gas exploration well versus the\u000a      Yogyakarta earthquake (May 27th\u000a      2006) as triggers for the volcano. Our research concluded that hydraulic\u000a      fracturing in the\u000a      subsurface, caused by insufficient casing of a gas well was the trigger\u000a      for the eruption.\u000a    Investigating the role of hydraulic fracturing in the Lusi disaster and\u000a      the engagement with non-\u000a      specialists was an important precursor that led to research on hydraulic\u000a      fracturing for the recovery\u000a      of gas and oil from shale, a process known as `fracking'. The technology\u000a      involves drilling\u000a      horizontal wells through low permeability shale and fracturing them using\u000a      a pressurized fracking\u000a      fluid which is mainly water, but with chemical additives. This increases\u000a      gas flow rates so that\u000a      commercial extraction is possible. In 2009-2010, around 20,000 shale gas\u000a      wells were fracked by\u000a      9 companies in the USA alone. There have been significant environmental\u000a      concerns surrounding\u000a      the technology, with some academics, politicians, public organisations and\u000a      NGOs accusing the oil\u000a      and gas industry of polluting drinking water supplies with methane [4]\u000a      and the chemicals in the\u000a      fracking fluid. The aim of the key research [5] was to test this\u000a      controversial hypothesis and to\u000a      provide an evidence base for an initial safe vertical separation distance\u000a      between shale reservoirs\u000a      and aquifers.\u000a    We measured the reported heights of thousands of upward propagating\u000a      hydraulic fractures from\u000a      several thousand fracking operations in the Marcellus, Barnett, Woodford,\u000a      Eagleford and Niobrara\u000a      shales (USA) mainly from published sources. We also measured 1170 natural\u000a      hydraulic fractures\u000a      imaged with three-dimensional seismic data offshore of West Africa [6]\u000a      and mid-Norway where\u000a      heights are no more than ~ 1106 m. Based on the empirical data, we derived\u000a      probabilities that\u000a      fractures, both natural and those from fracking, exceed a range of\u000a      heights. The probability of a\u000a      stimulated and natural hydraulic fracture extending vertically for\u000a      distances &gt; 350 m is ~ 1% and ~\u000a      33% respectively. The maximum height of a stimulated fracture was 588 m.\u000a      Therefore if fracking\u000a      is carried out at depths of at least 600 m below the drinking water\u000a      aquifer, the risk of\u000a      contamination is extremely small as no fractures have been documented to\u000a      extend to this\u000a      distance. Conversely, if fracking is within this 600 m safe separation\u000a      distance, then there is a real\u000a      risk of contamination. We therefore recommended a 600 m safe separation\u000a      distance.\u000a    This is extremely important as an evidence base for decisions on the safe\u000a      vertical separation\u000a      between stimulated hydraulic fracturing and rock strata not intended for\u000a      penetration. The\u000a      research provides a basis for policy decisions about fracking around the\u000a      globe.\u000a    The key paper [5] and its impact were used as a pilot for a\u000a      &#163;0.79M consortium `ReFINE'\u000a        (Researching Fracking IN Europe), which was set up\u000a      in 2012-13.

BP and Statoil conducted proprietary Re-Os and\u000d\u000a      PGE research concerning global petroleum systems with particular emphasis\u000d\u000a      on offshore Angola and Faroes-West of Shetland (F-WoS) fields because it\u000d\u000a      can be used to establish a chronological framework for a petroleum system.\u000d\u000a      This data has provided critical data to evaluate exploration models (see\u000d\u000a      below). In the mineral exploration sector, Rio Tinto needed to establish\u000d\u000a      if their preliminary stage investigations had located economic or sub-\u000d\u000a      economic copper mineralization. The specific impacts detailed below are,\u000d\u000a      in summary, that the Re-Os and Pt\/Pd data has permitted petroleum and\u000d\u000a      mineral companies to devise accurate resource estimates and exploration\u000d\u000a      programmes and save exploration expenditure and thus reduce any\u000d\u000a      industry-related environmental impact.\u000d\u000a    Petroleum Sector\u000d\u000a    For Statoil and BP, Re-Os and Pt-Pd research was used to underpin\u000d\u000a      exploration frameworks in four areas:\u000d\u000a    [A] Oil geochronology: In the F-WoS basin, Re-Os research\u000d\u000a      provided evidence that oil generation was pulsed and originated from the\u000d\u000a      same source rock strata between 70 and 40 Ma [3]. This finding\u000d\u000a      contradicted existing models that invoked a single Cretaceous age (~80Ma)\u000d\u000a      of generation and a complex history of oil migration. Given the greater\u000d\u000a      age assumed by these models, they incorrectly predicted that the\u000d\u000a      present-day basin plays should be dominated by gas. The multiple younger\u000d\u000a      generation ages identified from the Re-Os data presented Statoil with a\u000d\u000a      solution to this conundrum: the heat flow values used in their basin\u000d\u000a      modelling could simply be reduced leading to an oil-dominated system in\u000d\u000a      the F-WoS basin. Oil is economically easier and more environmentally\u000d\u000a      friendly to develop than gas. For example, the development of the F-WoS\u000d\u000a      region would cost ~$9B for oil vs $27B for gas. If the resource had been\u000d\u000a      gas, then the F-WoS basin would have been considered uneconomic and\u000d\u000a      abandoned. The basin has ~17-20% of current UK resources at ~3.5 BBOE\u000d\u000a      recoverable worth ~&#163;350B. The ability to predict the chance of oil\u000d\u000a      vs gas using Re-Os geochronology [1-3] has therefore been critical to\u000d\u000a      Statoil's economic assessments of future oil exploration and extraction\u000d\u000a      development in the F- WoS region. Testimony from a Leading Geoscientist at\u000d\u000a      Statoil states: 'This is a significant result in that it has a major\u000d\u000a        impact on future exploration activity, particularly on evaluating trap\u000d\u000a        charge and hydrocarbon type (oil vs gas). Accurate prediction of\u000d\u000a        hydrocarbon type impringes on pre-drill economic assessments' [8].\u000d\u000a    [B] Oil-source correlation [2-3]: the identification of the\u000d\u000a      correct source rock of migrated hydrocarbons is essential for all oil\u000d\u000a      companies exploring in the subsurface. Re-Os and PGE are inorganic\u000d\u000a      elements that are resistant to biodegradation. The elements are\u000d\u000a      concentrated in source rocks and oils, and yield radiometric dates. This\u000d\u000a      property allowed BP to directly date the source rocks from which oils were\u000d\u000a      generated from plays located in Angola and the North Sea. Such information\u000d\u000a      has helped to reduce exploration risk and improve capital efficiency,\u000d\u000a      e.g., avoiding one dry hole reduces costs by $70M.\u000d\u000a    [C] Shale gas play chemostratigraphy and geochronology:\u000d\u000a      determining the absolute age of source rocks and stratigraphic correlation\u000d\u000a      is often challenging due to a lack of reliable biostratigraphy. Accurate\u000d\u000a      stratigraphic correlation is essential in shale gas plays in order to\u000d\u000a      define the 'staying in zone', i.e. keeping the horizontal well in the best\u000d\u000a      horizon for gas\/oil production. Re-Os and PGE techniques [2-3] are proving\u000d\u000a      a very valuable technique for such correlation purposes, e.g., Angola (BP)\u000d\u000a      [7].\u000d\u000a    [D] Oil field compartmentalisation: Before production data is\u000d\u000a      available, it is critical to design the optimum extraction plan for an oil\u000d\u000a      reservoir. Establishing compartmentalisation from organic geochemistry\u000d\u000a      data alone is challenging because petroleum-related fluids can have a very\u000d\u000a      similar organic composition. However, combining organic with PGE and Re-Os\u000d\u000a      geochemistry [1-3], the detection of fluid compartments is more readily\u000d\u000a      achieved, allowing a better idea of the number of wells required and their\u000d\u000a      optimal positions to exploit an oil field. This has saved BP $10'sM of\u000d\u000a      well development costs [7].\u000d\u000a    Mineral Sector\u000d\u000a    Porphyry copper-systems host and supply ~75% of the world's copper and\u000d\u000a      are an important target for major mining companies (e.g., Rio Tinto). A\u000d\u000a      metallogenic belt typically comprises several porphyry systems that formed\u000d\u000a      at different geological times, e.g., 10 to 250 Ma. Commonly the most\u000d\u000a      economic porphyry systems form during similar time periods in the\u000d\u000a      geological evolution of a metallogenic belt. Thus, the age of copper\u000d\u000a      porphyry mineralization in magmatic arcs is of paramount importance in\u000d\u000a      determining the likely economic potential resource of a porphyry system\u000d\u000a      located during preliminary exploration.\u000d\u000a      Molybdenite located near a regional fault zone in the Andes was sampled by\u000d\u000a      Rio Tinto for Re- Os geochronology. The fault juxtaposes two geological\u000d\u000a      terranes of different age: Permian- Triassic and Tertiary. For the\u000d\u000a      exploration programme, it was necessary to know the age of the\u000d\u000a      mineralization to quickly assess the likely value of the exploration\u000d\u000a      target potential prior to an extensive drilling programme. The Re-Os\u000d\u000a      molybdenite age obtained by the Durham Group [3- 6] was Triassic and as a\u000d\u000a      direct result of the Re-Os age the exploration was abandoned. The senior\u000d\u000a      geologist testimony states, 'In the Andes, Triassic porphyry systems\u000d\u000a        are known to be sub-economic for major mining companies (such as Rio\u000d\u000a      Tinto). As a consequence, this target was dismissed' [9]. The Re-Os\u000d\u000a      dating resulted in saving the company approximately US$300,000 in\u000d\u000a      drilling, rock geochemistry and employee-related costs and avoided\u000d\u000a      additional environmental impact through the mining exploration programme.\u000d\u000a      As a result, the company was able to allocate resources to other projects\u000d\u000a      with greater economic potential [9].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Innovative geochemical research led by Selby at Durham has permitted\u000d\u000a      savings of up to $70M in global mineral and petroleum exploration\u000d\u000a      programmes (e.g., Andes of S.

This permits the determination of Re-Os\u000d\u000a      ages for sulphide minerals [4-6], organic-rich sedimentary units and\u000d\u000a      hydrocarbons [1-3], and the ability to use Os isotope compositions and\u000d\u000a      Pt\/Pd ratios to identify the source rock of petroleum accumulations [3].\u000d\u000a      This has improved our understanding of genetic models for both mineral and\u000d\u000a      hydrocarbon systems [1-6]. In impact terms, the outcome yields critical\u000d\u000a      necessary data required for exploration programmes [Section 4]. Ultimately\u000d\u000a      Selby's research has shown that the Re-Os system can be applied much more\u000d\u000a      widely than previously thought and has placed Durham at the forefront in\u000d\u000a      the use of this novel research tool both academically and through\u000d\u000a      industry. This leadership was recognised by the award of the William Smith\u000d\u000a      Fund (2009) to Selby from the Geological Society of London for excellence\u000d\u000a      in contributions to applied and economic aspects of the science and by the\u000d\u000a      TOTAL petroleum company who fund Selby's position at Durham.\u000d\u000a    The underpinning research highlights are:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Shown that the Re-Os chronometer is a reliable, precise chronometer\u000d\u000a        for obtaining the depositional age of clastic marine and\u000d\u000a        lacustrine sedimentary rocks.\u000d\u000a      Illustrated the utility of Re-Os to define the age of oil\u000d\u000a          generation from a source rock.

The Clair\u000d\u000a      field is the largest hydrocarbon resource in the UKCS with an estimated 8\u000d\u000a      billion barrels of Stock Tank oil initially in place (STOIIP) [11].\u000d\u000a      The Phase I area came on stream in 2005, whilst the Clair Ridge (Phase II)\u000d\u000a      is due to begin production in 2016. The reservoir target is Devonian\u000d\u000a      sandstones that rest directly on Lewisian-like metamorphic basement. Both\u000d\u000a      rock units are highly faulted and fracture description and water flood\u000d\u000a      performance are considered to be the two main risks in field development.\u000d\u000a      This risk is exacerbated by a lack of industry experience in working with\u000d\u000a      metamorphic basement rocks [8-10].\u000d\u000a    The Durham research that has so far contributed directly towards\u000d\u000a      addressing these risks stems from the analysis of the fault and fracture\u000d\u000a      systems developed in the Lewisian Complex of NW Scotland as an onshore\u000d\u000a      analogue for the fractured basement in the Clair Field [9, 10].\u000d\u000a      The Durham research results were acquired using the GAVA methodology.\u000d\u000a      Quantitative data concerning the geometry, density, aperture and nature of\u000d\u000a      infills were incorporated into the structural model for the Phase II Clair\u000d\u000a      Ridge by the CJVG [9, 10]. The basement fracture framework is\u000d\u000a      known to be directly connected to the overlying reservoir impacting\u000d\u000a      subsequent fluid flow movement across and through the oilfield. The\u000d\u000a      structural model is used to derive a detailed reservoir simulation on\u000d\u000a      which an economic assessment is made, with up to 36 new development wells\u000d\u000a      for the Ridge planned. In 2013, BP announced a further two year appraisal\u000d\u000a      Programme to develop a third Phase involving the drilling of up to 12 more\u000d\u000a      wells in the Greater Clair area [11]. Each development well costs\u000d\u000a      upwards of &#163;20M and the decision to sanction the entire development\u000d\u000a      programme is significant in both financial and economic terms [8-10,\u000d\u000a        12-14].\u000d\u000a    Since 2008, the SGRG have additionally led annual field workshops with\u000d\u000a      CJVG geoscientists (42 individuals to date) to view the complex nature of\u000d\u000a      the fractured basement in NW Scotland. This has helped the industry\u000d\u000a      subsurface teams to better conceptualise the structural framework in the\u000d\u000a      basement and to design improved alternative fracture models [9, 10].\u000d\u000a      Fracture networks within the reservoir are known to boost the average\u000d\u000a      permeability by orders of magnitude and allow economic oil production\u000d\u000a      rates in otherwise unpromising metamorphic rocks. The CJVG Basement\u000d\u000a      Sub-surface Team Leader (ConocoPhillips) [9] has stated that:\u000d\u000a    \"The basement fracture models used in our reservoir simulator to\u000d\u000a        estimate recovery are substantially based on the Durham onshore data and\u000d\u000a        are additionally informed by knowledge gained during the field\u000d\u000a        workshops. Populating the fractures into a Discrete Fracture Network\u000d\u000a        (DFN) model requires a complete understanding of the interaction between\u000d\u000a        all scales of fractures observed from large seismic scale faults to\u000d\u000a        small sub-seismic scale joints. The model has been built and run,\u000d\u000a        showing an economically robust project. This ultimately led (in 2012) to\u000d\u000a        the sanctioning of the Clair Ridge for development &#8212; an investment of\u000d\u000a        around &#163;4.5 billion\" [11]\u000d\u000a    c) Commercial advantage to end-users:Statoil\/Jardfeingi,\u000a          Faroe-Shetland Basin\u000d\u000a      The Faeroe-Shetland Basin is one of the most important exploration targets\u000d\u000a      in the UKCS region [13].

The onshore\u000d\u000a      fracture characterisation work was integrated (using the GAVA methodology)\u000d\u000a      with structural interpretations made in the subsurface using offshore 3D\u000d\u000a      seismic data and subsurface core logs.

Since the 1970s, there have been a\u000d\u000a      number of well-documented drilling and completions incidents related to\u000d\u000a      overpressure of which the 2010 BP Macondo disaster is perhaps best known.\u000d\u000a    The main impacts of the Durham overpressure research were delivered\u000d\u000a      through the development of the spin-out company GPT and the subsequent\u000d\u000a      delivery and sales of its software tools and expertise. The company\u000d\u000a      employs mainly graduate\/postgraduate-level geoscientists, managers and\u000d\u000a      administrative staff. The number of professionals has grown from 8 full\u000d\u000a      time (FT) employees in 2008 to 18 FT geosciences staff located in Durham,\u000d\u000a      Kuala Lumpur, Calgary and London. There are 8 FT and 2 P\/T support staff\u000d\u000a      which includes 4 trainee Geoscientists. The company has a total revenue\u000d\u000a      from April 2008 to March 2013 of &#163;10.8million [7]. The most\u000d\u000a      important tools developed by GPT based on Durham overpressure research are\u000d\u000a      as follows:\u000d\u000a    a) Software: Based on Durham research using industry data,\u000d\u000a      research of industry practices and writing of original source code during\u000d\u000a      GeoPOP Phases 1 and 2, `PressureView' (PV) was the first dedicated\u000d\u000a      pressure database and visualisation software for use in the oil\/gas\u000d\u000a      industry. The first commercial sales were made in 1999 with licences\u000d\u000a      subsequently sold to 140 companies worldwide, including global licences\u000d\u000a      for Shell and BG. Estimated total income is over &#163;3 million, plus annual\u000d\u000a      maintenance licences (currently 20% of licence fee). During the period\u000d\u000a      2008-2013, revenue from the sales of PV amounted to &#163;0.78M [8].\u000d\u000a    b) Algorithms: The fracture strength analysis in Adrian White's\u000d\u000a      2001 thesis and associated publications [5] led to the development\u000d\u000a      of regional to local algorithms to predict fracture strength including\u000d\u000a      pore pressure-stress coupling. Algorithms are now used in consultancy\u000d\u000a      projects for prediction of fracture pressure in well planning. In the\u000d\u000a      period 2008-2013 consultancy projects relating to this development total\u000d\u000a      &#163;1.8M. In addition, during 2019-11 GPT collaborated with 11 other\u000d\u000a      organisations (including Durham University, Imperial College, Edinburgh,\u000d\u000a      Herriott-Watt, BGS, Synergy and RPS) in the Energy Technology\u000d\u000a      Institute-funded assessment of UK carbon dioxide storage estimates &#8212; GPT\u000d\u000a      fracture algorithms were used directly to assess hydraulic failure during\u000d\u000a      injection modelling and in volume estimates based on top seal failure\u000d\u000a      criteria. The value of this project to GPT to date is &#163;0.24M, but the\u000d\u000a      longer term strategic value of the project findings to the UK in planning\u000d\u000a      the future deep disposal of carbon dioxide is likely to be substantial.\u000d\u000a    c) Knowledge: Chalk of Central North Sea: Since 2001, GPT has\u000d\u000a      conducted specialist pressure analysis to aid drilling safely through\u000d\u000a      Upper Cretaceous Chalk [4], a unique challenge for pressure\u000d\u000a      interpretation and safe drilling. Pressure profiles and understanding of\u000d\u000a      drilling behaviour are underpinned by later research results (papers by\u000d\u000a      Anthony Mallon\/Swarbrick). The value to GPT of such studies varies from\u000d\u000a      &#163;15k to &#163;40k per study, and in the period 2008-13 has generated &#163;0.6M of\u000d\u000a      income to GPT from a total of 26 projects. The importance and value to oil\u000d\u000a      companies is much greater given the costs involved in drilling exploration\u000d\u000a      wells (ca. $100M each).\u000d\u000a    d) Methodology: Pore pressure prediction: research on\u000d\u000a      disequilibrium compaction (a common overpressure mechanism [1,3])\u000d\u000a      has led to a unique geological approach to predict pore pressure in shales\u000d\u000a      [6]. The technique (known as the \"Swarbrick FRD Method') is\u000d\u000a      included routinely in all GPT projects and several companies (e.g.\u000d\u000a      Petronas, Santos) have adopted the method and apply it to their well\u000d\u000a      planning worldwide (each with a value of ~ $100M).\u000d\u000a    Worldwide, all oil wells require pre-drill pressure prediction and GPT\u000d\u000a      specialises in understanding the geological context for the magnitude of\u000d\u000a      these pressures, with particular emphasis on geologically complex basins,\u000d\u000a      where traditional methods are unsuccessful, but still used by most of the\u000d\u000a      competition for this type of business. The experiences of two oil\u000d\u000a      companies in the North Sea illustrate the impact of geological\u000d\u000a      overpressure research on their operational activities and budgets:\u000d\u000a    i) BG Group participated directly in a multi-client study led by\u000d\u000a      GPT in 2009-10, the `Central North Sea Pressure Study Phase II'. The\u000d\u000a      company has operated widely in the North Sea where drilling at depth, in\u000d\u000a      high-pressure, high temperature (HPHT) environments represents a\u000d\u000a      significant technical challenge. The Pressure Advisor at BG Group has\u000d\u000a      said: \"Research carried out initially at Durham University and then by\u000d\u000a        GPT has provided a better understanding of the causes and nature of the\u000d\u000a        high pressures encountered in the North Sea area\" [9]. BG\u000d\u000a      Group uses PressureView software throughout their worldwide operations\u000d\u000a      (income to GPT of &gt;&#163;0.1M in period 2008-13), together with use of GPT\u000d\u000a      technical consultants and training for their staff to mitigate risk and\u000d\u000a      reduce uncertainty when planning and drilling HPHT wells.\u000d\u000a    ii) The Regional Pressure Study of the Central North Sea was used by Valiant\u000a        Petroleum in the planning, design and drilling of its first HPHT\u000d\u000a      well in the basin in 2010. The study successfully captured the changing\u000d\u000a      pressure regimes related to the structure of the basin, as well as the\u000d\u000a      challenges of drilling to the objective reservoir through the\u000d\u000a      lithologically complex overburden. GPT, through consultancy and real-time\u000d\u000a      monitoring, also helped in the safe drilling of the well. The Exploration\u000d\u000a      Manager at Valiant Petroleum has stated that GPT involvement in this\u000d\u000a      project during 2009-11 \"meant that we were better prepared to manage\u000d\u000a        the fluid pressures encountered thereby improving the safe management of\u000d\u000a        our operations\" [10]. With the cost of drilling North Sea\u000d\u000a      HPHT wells currently running at $600K-$1Million per day, a service that\u000d\u000a      can assist in predicting well conditions ahead of the drill bit and\u000d\u000a      minimise costly well control operations is easily justified in economic\u000d\u000a      terms. We have further testimonies from 6 other national and multinational\u000d\u000a      companies confirming the impacts of Durham-based overpressure research\u000d\u000a      through GPT operations worldwide [11-13].F\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Failure to predict and control geological overpressures during drilling\u000d\u000a      can lead to operational delays costing millions of pounds, or to blow-outs\u000d\u000a      causing serious environmental damage and costs running into billions.\u000d\u000a      Using methodologies, knowledge and data analysis techniques developed at\u000d\u000a      Durham, a spin-out, GeoPressure Technology (GPT; now Ikon Geopressure) (20\u000d\u000a      employees, revenues 2008-13: &#163;10.8 million) has become a niche supplier to\u000d\u000a      the global oil industry of expertise, training and software\u000d\u000a      (\"PressureView\") that predicts and assess the causes of overpressure.

The multi-company-funded\u000d\u000a      Durham-based GeoPOP research programme investigated overpressure in\u000d\u000a      sedimentary basins and was led by Richard Swarbrick (PhD Geology; Mobil\u000d\u000a      Oil 1979-1989; mid-career appointment at Durham 1989-2005; Managing\u000d\u000a      Director GPT 1997-present).

The\u000d\u000a      research established the predominance of compaction-\/burial-related\u000d\u000a      overpressure, with gas generation as the main secondary mechanism [1].\u000d\u000a      A new type of process &#8212; termed \"Load Transfer\" &#8212; was recognised relating\u000d\u000a      to collapse of pores during thermally-driven chemical change (diagenesis)\u000d\u000a      [2]. Macro-quartz dissolution\/cementation was shown to be\u000d\u000a      controlled by pressure, a conclusion challenging existing models of\u000d\u000a      stress-independent quartz dissolution\/reprecipitation. In order to build a\u000d\u000a      pressure database of &gt;850 deep Central North Sea boreholes, a research\u000d\u000a      software tool was designed and used to generate single and multi-well\u000d\u000a      pressure-depth plots. Maps of overpressure were created illustrating\u000d\u000a      reservoir relationships &#8212; open system, hydrodynamic reservoirs above the\u000d\u000a      Cretaceous Chalk, and highly compartmentalised pressures in the\u000d\u000a      Jurassic\/Triassic reservoir beneath [4]. Papers published by the\u000d\u000a      Durham group [1-4] remain key references on overpressure\u000d\u000a      mechanisms.\u000d\u000a    GeoPOP Phase 2 (1998-2001) research themes at Durham focussed on:\u000d\u000a      understanding the role of fine-grained carbonates (chalk) in the\u000d\u000a      development of deep overpressure; stress and rock strength analysis [5];\u000d\u000a      petrophysical modelling of clay compaction; and 2D basin modelling\u000d\u000a      including chemical compaction processes. Papers devoted to chalk\u000d\u000a      compaction as well as explaining how overpressure contributes to many\u000d\u000a      aspects of the petroleum system were published in a range of journals\u000d\u000a      using case study material from the North Sea, SE Asia and Gulf of Mexico\u000d\u000a      basins [3, 6].\u000d\u000a    In 1997 GPT was founded as a University spin-out company based in Durham\u000d\u000a      City, initially to commercialise the pressure database and visualisation\u000d\u000a      software developed during Phase 1, now termed \"PressureView\". In 2001, GPT\u000d\u000a      commenced a period of sustained growth. The research at Durham [1,3,6]\u000d\u000a      underpinned new approaches to pressure prediction, a key component in the\u000d\u000a      safe drilling of deep boreholes for oil, gas, water and, more recently, in\u000d\u000a      the search for sequestration sites for carbon dioxide. The oil industry\u000d\u000a      began to recognise that a geological approach to pressure prediction,\u000d\u000a      underpinned by good science, was able to provide high quality pre-drill\u000d\u000a      prediction and complement existing approaches based on seismic and\u000d\u000a      petrophysical data. In 2004, GPT completed the first basin-wide pressure\u000d\u000a      study for the entire Central North Sea area. This report has been sold to\u000d\u000a      more than 20 companies. From 2004 to 2011, several other regional pressure\u000d\u000a      studies were completed covering high pressure areas of Europe, plus\u000d\u000a      deep-water reservoirs in the Gulf of Mexico and Niger Delta. These studies\u000d\u000a      are considered highly authoritative (see Section 4) and are used routinely\u000d\u000a      by industry to improve safety, as well as in the exploration for new\u000d\u000a      reserves.\u000d\u000a    In 2006, GPT was purchased by Ikon Science, a global technology company\u000d\u000a      providing geoprediction tools to the upstream oil and gas industry. GPT\u000d\u000a      was rebranded as `Ikon GeoPressure' and the company has remained based in\u000d\u000a      Durham.\u000d\u000a    A third phase industry-funded research consortium, GeoPOP3 was launched\u000d\u000a      in 2012 with funding (award value &#163;2.475M TOTAL; Durham share &#163;1.79M) for\u000d\u000a      three years from BG, BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, DONG Energy, E.ON, ENI,\u000d\u000a      Petrobras, Petronas, Statoil and Tullow.

This is the\u000a      Arctic Council's follow-up to ACIA and\u000a      contributed to the 5th IPCC report released in Sept. 2013. The\u000a      commissioning of SWIPA reflects\u000a      the increasingly serious concerns about climate change impacts on the\u000a      Arctic cryosphere, and\u000a      Sheffield research has played a leading role in understanding some of\u000a      these threats. Callaghan\u000a      was a core member of the SWIPA Integration Team, a co-ordinating lead\u000a      author on part of the\u000a      Cross-Cutting Scientific Issues, and scientific liaison for the Decision\u000a        Makers' Summary.

The Arctic Council noted \"with concern the impacts documented\u000a        by the ACIA\" and\u000a      \"acknowledge that such findings ... will help inform governments as\u000a        they implement and consider\u000a        future policies on global climate change\" (Arctic Council's policy\u000a      document accompanying the\u000a      ACIA, 2005).

For example,\u000a      Callaghan hosted (July 2009), at the Abisko Research Station where he was\u000a      Director, a meeting of\u000a      twenty-seven Ministers of the Environment (including David Miliband) that\u000a      was also attended by\u000a      fifty ambassadors and climate negotiators [S4]. At this meeting\u000a      Callaghan provided policy guidance\u000a      on climate change impacts, including effects of loss of snow cover based\u000a      on his research [R1-R3]\u000a      in preparation for their negotiations at the United Nations Framework\u000a      Convention on Climate\u000a      Change (UNFCCC) conference (Copenhagen, December 2009). On a separate\u000a      occasion, the EU\u000a      climate negotiating committee (Coreper) was hosted, briefed and shown the\u000a      Sheffield-led\u000a      experiments by Callaghan (again at Abisko) prior to their negotiations in\u000a      Copenhagen. Findings\u000a      from SWIPA were presented to international ministers and climate\u000a      negotiators at the UNFCCC\u000a      Copenhagen conference (2009), and by Callaghan at the UNFCCC Durban\u000a      conference (2011),\u000a      including important new evidence of the increasing loss of winter snow\u000a      cover [R5] and its impact on\u000a      vegetation [R3]. Callaghan has also advised on Arctic and climate\u000a      change policy by invitation to\u000a      round-table discussions at four Royal Colloquia (2003, 2005, 2011 and\u000a      2012, organised by the\u000a      King of Sweden). Most recently (Oct 2013), Callaghan, in his capacity as\u000a      lead author of the Polar\u000a        Regions chapter in IPCC 2007, advised on sustainable use of natural\u000a      resources in polar regions at\u000a      a strategic level conference organised by MP James Gray [S5].\u000a    Knowledge-exchange for adaptation to climate change by indigenous\u000a        peoples\u000a    Dissemination of research, contributions to the major international\u000a      synthesis reports and\u000a      knowledge exchange with Arctic indigenous communities has allowed\u000a      Sheffield scientists to\u000a      improve the way indigenous Arctic societies adapt to climate change. This\u000a      is exemplified by the\u000a      impact on changing practices of reindeer herding societies:\u000a    \"the ACIA, the polar chapter of IPCC, and SWIPA have advised the\u000a        international reindeer\u000a        herders of ongoing and future Arctic changes\"; \"these\u000a        publications have been instrumental in\u000a        preparing a knowledge foundation for circumpolar reindeer herding\u000a        societies for understanding\u000a        and adapting to climate change and globalization, and has been\u000a        instrumental in reindeer herders\u000a        planning for future sustainable communities\" [S6].\u000a    Callaghan played a leading role in this engagement with indigenous\u000a      people, including his invitation\u000a      of a Sami social anthropologist to be a lead author on the Terrestrial\u000a        Ecosystems chapter of ACIA,\u000a      and a Sami reindeer herder and economist to be a lead author on the Changing\u000a        Snow Cover and\u000a        its Impacts chapter of SWIPA. \"Prof. Terry Callaghan was among\u000a        the first scientific lead authors to\u000a        include indigenous peoples' concerns and even indigenous co-authors\";\u000a      \"Callaghan has been\u000a        instrumental to bridge the gap between natural science ... concerns of\u000a        indigenous peoples and\u000a        their ... traditional knowledge\" [S7]. Advice to the herders\u000a      has been wide ranging, and includes the\u000a      direction not to burn forest killed by autumnal moth outbreaks because of\u000a      the resulting loss of\u000a      nitrogen. Callaghan's activities to draw on indigenous peoples'\u000a      traditional knowledge to enhance\u000a      scientific understanding [R6] have been widely recognized. His work\u000a      has made \"significant\u000a        contributions to the future sustainability of Arctic reindeer herding\u000a        communities and thereby\u000a        reindeer herding cultures\" [S6].\u000a    \"For a long time, Professor Terry Callaghan ... has had a close\u000a        cooperation with the County\u000a        Administrative Board [Norrbotten, Sweden] ... as well as the\u000a        S&#228;mi. This has had great impact on\u000a        decisions regarding reindeer herding and nature conservation. Many\u000a        decisions on local, regional\u000a        and national level have been based on Prof. Callaghan's experiences and\u000a        suggestions.\" [S8]\u000a    Increasing public awareness and influencing education.\u000a    Callaghan's Arctic research has enhanced public understanding of Arctic\u000a      climate change as\u000a      evidenced by considerable international media attention. This includes a\u000a      front-page summary and\u000a      near full-page main report in Norway's leading daily, Aftenposten\u000a      (19 October 2009) [S9], a full-\u000a      page article in one of Sweden's top newspapers Nyheter (15 July\u000a      2009) and TV coverage in\u000a      Sweden, Russia and Greenland. The research has featured in ACIA and SWIPA\u000a      outreach films.\u000a      The work has also significantly influenced secondary school education. At\u000a      the request of the A-\u000a      level Chief Examiner, Callaghan addressed teachers' conferences, leading\u000a      to a focus on climate\u000a      change impacts in the Arctic regions and its global consequences being\u000a      placed on the Geography\u000a      A-level syllabus. He was subsequently asked to be lead author on an\u000a      A-level textbook, Top Spec\u000a        Geography: The Rapidly Changing Arctic (published 2011) and has been\u000a      asked to simplify this for\u000a      primary schools.\u000a    In summary, the paradigm-shifting research led by Callaghan and Phoenix\u000a      on climate change\u000a      impacts on Arctic ecosystem functioning, and their engagement in\u000a      knowledge-exchange for\u000a      adaptation to climate change by indigenous peoples, has had major impacts\u000a      on policymakers and\u000a      the public in the UK and internationally.

His group\u000a      has provided vital early\u000a      evidence of global change impacts in the Arctic by establishing, in the\u000a      1990s, the first field studies\u000a      to simulate increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations and\u000a      increased UV-B irradiance (due to\u000a      stratospheric ozone depletion) [R1]. These studies were accompanied\u000a      by among the first field\u000a      manipulations of warming, nutrient enrichment, and increased precipitation\u000a      on Arctic ecosystems\u000a      [R1, R2]. From 2006, Phoenix and Callaghan have conducted\u000a      further pioneering experimental\u000a      studies that have been paradigm-shifting in revealing the severity of\u000a      impacts of extreme winter\u000a      warming events on Arctic vegetation caused by the loss of insulating snow\u000a      cover [R3].\u000a    These world-leading long-term studies (all of which are ongoing) have\u000a      advanced understanding of\u000a      Arctic ecosystem responses to global change [R4] and have changed\u000a      scientific opinion of\u000a      perceived global change threats, helping to define the key research\u000a      priorities for policymakers and\u000a      international funding agencies. The summer warming simulation studies [R2]\u000a      provided early\u000a      predictions of the increase in plant biomass production and shrub\u000a      expansion now occurring in the\u000a      Arctic &#8212; which has important implications for ecosystem greenhouse gas\u000a      fluxes and grazing\u000a      management by indigenous societies. Against these trends, however,\u000a      Callaghan and Phoenix have\u000a      proven that episodic extreme winter warming events are particularly\u000a      damaging to vegetation [R3],\u000a      so changes in snow and ice cover are now of major concern for the future\u000a      functioning of Arctic\u000a      ecosystems. Callaghan's recent work, leading a large international team of\u000a      experts, predicts that\u000a      snow cover duration will decrease by about 10-20% over much of the Arctic\u000a      by 2050, with the\u000a      largest decreases expected to take place over Alaska and northern\u000a      Scandinavia (30-40%) [R5].\u000a    Such changes will have far-reaching consequences for the climate system,\u000a      hydrology, ecology and\u000a      human activities. In contrast, the group's studies of UV-B radiation,\u000a      increased CO2 and\u000a      precipitation, which were of major concern in the 1990s, proved these\u000a      variables to be much less\u000a      serious threats [R1, R2]. Sheffield research has therefore helped\u000a      determine the most important\u000a      global change threats, and influenced international research priorities\u000a      for scientists, policy makers\u000a      and funding agencies, e.g. Norwegian large initiatives (2012: EWWA\u000a      (Extreme Winter Warming in\u000a      the Arctic and its biological effects) and WINNIT (extreme weather and\u000a      pollution effects on plants).\u000a    Callaghan was one of the first scientific leaders to include indigenous\u000a      peoples' concerns in Arctic\u000a      climate change research, and engage them directly in knowledge exchange.\u000a      He collaborated with\u000a      members of the Sami Parliament and Sami Language &amp; Culture Centre in\u000a      Norway to benefit from\u000a      the traditional ecological knowledge of reindeer herders in relation to\u000a      the shifting timing and\u000a      patterns of snow and ice cover [R6].\u000a    This work has attracted much media, public, political and indigenous\u000a      peoples' attention, and\u000a      established Callaghan and Phoenix as leading experts in the field of\u000a      Arctic ecology and climate\u000a      change. They have played major roles in communicating their research\u000a      findings to international\u000a      policymakers, the media, indigenous groups, and wider society, influencing\u000a      global awareness of\u000a      the particular threats posed by Arctic climate change, and adaptations of\u000a      indigenous populations to\u000a      these threats. For his outstanding contributions to Arctic Science and\u000a      society, Callaghan was\u000a      awarded the Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography's Vega Gold\u000a        Medal in 2011, and\u000a      The Polar Medal for services to the Arctic by H.M. Queen Elizabeth\u000a      in 2013. Callaghan and\u000a      Phoenix have published more than 230 peer reviewed journal articles and\u000a      book chapters on their\u000a      Arctic research and these publications have received over 8,000 Web of\u000a      Knowledge citations.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11853","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research has had impacts on a wide range of audiences: from UK\u000a      Parliament, local authorities, non-governmental organisations, wildlife\u000a      and gardening organisations, charities, gardeners and members of the\u000a      public. The research findings have been used in many contexts from\u000a      advisory publications and reports, to planning applications and campaigns.\u000a      It is notable that in many of the situations where it is used in evidence,\u000a      the BUGS project is the only primary scientific research cited, reflecting\u000a      its unique role as the first and only large-scale study of its kind to\u000a      date.\u000a    The BUGS project provided evidence for: (i) the magnitude and importance\u000a      of gardens as a habitat in urban areas [R3, R6]; (ii) the high\u000a      biodiversity in gardens, which were historically considered as `ecological\u000a      deserts', [R1, R4-R5] and (iii) the features that make a\u000a      garden good for wildlife [R2]. This evidence has been cited as\u000a      evidence for policy positions in a range of contexts, as illustrated\u000a      below.\u000a    Policy, Planning &amp; Practice\u000a    One of the BUGS project leaders, Kevin Gaston, was a lead author in the\u000a      chapter of the UK National Millennium Ecosystem Assessment\u000a      Technical Report on Urban systems, and BUGS publications are used in\u000a      evidence in the section on gardens.\u000a    BUGS research was used in evidence to Parliament: The Royal Horticultural\u000a      Society, in a written memorandum to the Parliamentary Select Committee on\u000a      Environmental Audit (2008), used results from BUGS papers to support the\u000a      evidence it was submitting [S1]. Two of the six papers they cite in\u000a      their evidence (the only two scientific papers) are from the BUGS project\u000a      [R3, R4].\u000a    The Local Biodiversity Action Plans developed by Local Authorities, in\u000a      partnership with relevant organisations, which identify local priorities\u000a      for biodiversity conservation and work to deliver agreed actions for\u000a      priority habitats and species, often cite the BUGS project as evidence of\u000a      the importance of gardens and their management for biodiversity (e.g.,\u000a      Kensington &amp; Chelsea (2010), Norfolk Biodiversity Partnership -\u000a      Allotments, (2012); London Biodiversity Partnership - Private Gardens\u000a      (2008); Tees Valley Biodiversity Partnership - Gardens and Allotments\u000a      (2012); Edinburgh Biodiversity in Parks and Green Spaces (undated)) [S2].\u000a      This demonstrates direct practical application to local conservation\u000a      planning. The project has also been used as supporting evidence in\u000a      planning and ecological impact\/mitigation documents (e.g. biodiversity\u000a      management plans [S3] and local planning applications [S4]).\u000a    The BUGS project has also had direct influences on the thinking that\u000a      underpins the design and implementation of urban landscape planting. The\u000a      high-profile planting of the 2012 Olympic Park in London - featured widely\u000a      in the media - drew on BUGS science:\u000a    We've based our design and species choices on scientific research.\u000a        Evidence for the value of urban gardens and native\/exotic vegetation\u000a        mixes to native invertebrates has come from projects like Biodiversity\u000a        in Urban Gardens (BUGS), which investigated the variety of living things\u000a        that city gardens support, and the complex relationships between them.\u000a      [S5]\u000a    This use of the BUGS project work is recorded as a noteworthy impact of\u000a      NERC science in NERC's 2012 Impact Report [S5].\u000a    Reaching a public audience\u000a    The BUGS research is relevant to multiple audiences, with one of those\u000a      being the public, and gardeners specifically. Consequently, impact is\u000a      likely to be through sometimes small, but widespread, changes in the\u000a      garden management practices of individuals. Accessible publication of the\u000a      results is key to this impact. The results provided the scientific basis\u000a      of a very successful popular science book (18,500 copies sold) written by\u000a      Dr Ken Thompson, one of the project leaders (now retired):\u000a    Thompson K (2006) No Nettles Required: the truth about wildlife\u000a        gardening. Eden Project Books. This cheerful hand grenade of a\u000a        book debunks the myth that wildlife gardening needs large gardens,\u000a        native species and beds of stinging nettles ... Fantastic science\u000a        writing for a lay audience... (New Scientist 2006).\u000a    The BUGS project website (www.bugs.group.shef.ac.uk)\u000a      has been active since the first phase of the project, and consistently\u000a      receives 400-700 visits per month, with links coming from\u000a      websites as diverse as the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), BBC,\u000a      Wildlife Trusts, wildlife discussion forums and gardening blogs. Approximately\u000a          half the visits are from outside the UK, showing its strong international\u000a          reach.\u000a    Reference to the project, and the website as a source of information on\u000a      the science behind wildlife gardening, occur in a number of popular\u000a      wildlife gardening books: e.g. Collins Wildlife Gardener, Stephan\u000a      Buczacki (2007), RSPB Gardening for Wildlife Adrian Thomas (2010).\u000a      To quote from the introduction to the latter:\u000a    ... in 1982 the RSPB produced a book called Gardening for Wildlife. So\u000a        why another one now? Well the science has been moving forwards,\u000a        including pioneering work by the Biodiversity in Urban Gardens (BUGS)\u000a        project in Sheffield. There are more ideas now than ever to get your\u000a        teeth into...\u000a    All these provide evidence of the effective dissemination of the\u000a        results to those likely to make actual practical changes to their garden\u000a        management practice in the UK and overseas. Impacts of this sort are\u000a        small individually, but collectively very important.\u000a    Advice and advocacy\u000a    The results from the BUGS project played a significant role in the\u000a      development of advice on, and promotion of, the value of gardens for\u000a      biodiversity on the websites, and activities of the statutory bodies\u000a      involved in the project, and a range of other organisations (such as the\u000a      RHS and Wildlife Trusts, e.g. [S6]).\u000a    Subsequent initiatives to develop and influence gardening practice\u000a      acknowledge the key role that the project played, e.g., the Royal\u000a      Horticultural Society's Plants for Bugs project:\u000a    The Sheffield BUGS project was instrumental (an essential precursor)\u000a        both in inspiring and in the practice of the RHS Plants for Bugs (P4B)\u000a        project - have a look at the project page for P4B - BUGS papers cited\u000a        several times. The BUGS project - in combination with Jennifer Owens'\u000a        30- year study - have clearly shown the value that gardens have for\u000a        wildlife. [S7]\u000a    The second of the British Wildlife articles was co-written by the\u000a      project investigators and the representatives of the key agencies\u000a      involved, and the ideas from BUGS summarised in that article fed directly\u000a      into the development of the Wildlife Garden Manifesto [S8,S10],\u000a      produced by the Wildlife Gardening Forum, coordinated by Natural England\u000a      (discussed further below).\u000a    In addition to the statutory agencies, individual campaigns, for example\u000a      concerned with preventing the loss of gardens to development, also make\u000a      use of evidence from the project [S9].\u000a    Overall impact\u000a    As the examples above demonstrate, BUGS has had, and continues to have,\u000a      significant impacts on advice, policy and practice. These are perhaps best\u000a      summarised in some quotations from an appraisal of BUGS from the Head of\u000a      the Wildlife Gardening Forum (WLGF) [S10]:\u000a    ... there is increasing recognition that gardens are the most\u000a        biodiverse part of urban Green Infrastructure. Most of the credit for\u000a        this lies with the exemplary detailed work of the two BUGS campaigns,\u000a        which has provided the statistically sound evidence base that we are now\u000a        using to convince decision makers such as planners and local and\u000a        national government.\u000a    Evidence from BUGS moulded the WLGF's Manifesto, which was adopted by\u000a        Natural England and DEFRA, and launched in July 2007 by Sir Martin\u000a        Doughty, Chair of Natural England, supported by Joan Ruddock, Minister\u000a        for Biodiversity. Subsequently the WLGF has submitted BUGS-generated\u000a        evidence to a number of Government consultations, including the White\u000a        Paper \"The Natural Choice: securing the value of nature\" [2011] which\u000a        extensively referenced the importance of garden habitats, and led to the\u000a        Government providing public funding for the \"Big Wildlife Garden\" scheme\u000a        now managed by the Royal Horticultural Society and The Wildlife Trusts.\u000a    Following submissions by the WLGF and its members, we were delighted\u000a        that the 2012 publication of the NPPF [National Planning Policy\u000a      Framework] did reinstate considerable recognition and protection for\u000a        the garden environment. This would never have been possible without the\u000a        sound evidence base that the BUGS projects created.\u000a    In summary, the work of the Biodiversity in Urban Gardens studies has\u000a        revolutionised the ecological understanding of what we now recognise as\u000a        a key urban habitat, and this is reflected not only in action by\u000a        conservation agencies, but by national and local government, and\u000a        increasingly by studies in other countries. There can be few studies\u000a        which can have practically single-handedly created a new ecological\u000a        discipline, but this is certainly true of BUGS.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The BUGS research project (1999-2007) at Sheffield was the first\u000a      large-scale study to reveal the importance of domestic gardens for urban\u000a      biodiversity. The evidence gathered showed, for the first time, that the\u000a      extent of gardens, their unique features, and the biodiversity they\u000a      support makes them a nationally important ecological resource,\u000a      contributing enormously to conservation and human-nature interactions in\u000a      urban environments.

The BUGS project\u000a      was an application of this expertise to urban ecology, and specifically a\u000a      neglected topic: the role of domestic gardens in the maintenance of urban\u000a      biodiversity. The project was conceived by Prof Kevin Gaston, Prof Philip\u000a      Warren and Dr Ken Thompson, and funded by the NERC Urban Regeneration and\u000a      Environment (URGENT) programme in 1999. The 3-year project studied urban\u000a      gardens in Sheffield, and was the first large-scale systematic\u000a        scientific study of the extent and nature of the habitat provided by\u000a        gardens across an entire urban area, the patterns and determinants of\u000a        plant and invertebrate biodiversity, and the effectiveness of widely\u000a        cited advice on wildlife gardening.\u000a    The paradigm-shifting impact of the initial findings was such that\u000a      Natural England and the Countryside Council for Wales initiated a proposal\u000a      to extend the project to other cities. These agencies brought in the\u000a      Environment and Heritage Service (Northern Ireland), Scottish Natural\u000a      Heritage, The Scotland and Northern Ireland Forum for Environmental\u000a      Research and DEFRA to co-fund (without RCUK support) a second phase of\u000a      BUGS, which examined the extent to which the results from Sheffield could\u000a      be extended to five additional, very different, UK cities. DEFRA, in\u000a      commissioning this work stated: \"The project is necessary to help\u000a        underpin the policy of encouraging the use of domestic gardens as a\u000a        means of increasing public awareness and involvement in the maintenance\u000a        and improvement of biodiversity.\" This second BUGS project lasted 3\u000a      years, finishing in 2007.\u000a    The BUGS research addressed a fundamental knowledge gap in urban ecology,\u000a      providing important data on the extent and characteristics of garden\u000a      habitats for the first time. For example, the project showed that gardens\u000a      make up about 25% of a typical UK city [R6]; that small gardens are\u000a      disproportionately important because of their number [R6]; and that\u000a      because of the subdivision of gardens the cumulative numbers of habitat\u000a      features such as ponds, trees, nest boxes and compost heaps are\u000a      significant at the city scale [R3]. Analyses of biodiversity\u000a      revealed that plant diversity was both vastly higher within gardens and\u000a      across gardens than in any other UK habitat and, whilst non- natives are a\u000a      major component of this, native species are more widespread in gardens\u000a      than previously assumed [R1, R4]. Determinants of\u000a      invertebrate biodiversity were complex, and related both to internal\u000a      features (trees and structural complexity) and the adjacent land use [R5].\u000a      Results from the study challenged some widely cited ideas about garden\u000a      biodiversity, such as the importance of native plants over non-natives for\u000a      invertebrates, and experimental tests found that several widely advocated\u000a      `improvements' for wildlife (e.g. nesting sites created to encourage\u000a      bumble bees) had limited practical effect [R2]. Policy and planning\u000a      implications of the results were evaluated and reported in the published\u000a      outputs: for example demonstrating the effects of housing densification on\u000a      the loss of important, beneficial features of gardens, such as trees, with\u000a      reduced garden size.\u000a    Key findings from BUGS were summarised in two publications in British\u000a        Wildlife - a publication with a circulation of about 9000 designed\u000a      to make ecological and conservation science available to a wider audience\u000a      of conservation practitioners and naturalists than academic journals:\u000a    Gaston K J et al.

Our research in collaboration with the HA and\u000a      Environment Agency (EA) on the effects of routine road runoff on receiving\u000a      waters and their ecology, was used to develop a new Environmental Impact\u000a      Assessment tool designed to prevent adverse ecological effects in the\u000a      receiving water. The Highways Agency Water Risk Assessment Tool (HAWRAT)\u000a      uses toxicity thresholds established by our research that are consistent\u000a      with the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive and are agreed\u000a      with the EA. The HAWRAT forms part of the HA guidance published in the\u000a      Design Manual for Roads and Bridges (DMRB, HD45 Road Drainage and the\u000a      Water Environment) [S1]. The DMRB contains all current standards,\u000a      advice notes and other published documents relating to the design,\u000a      assessment and operation of the strategic road network in the UK. It is\u000a      used by all highway practitioners, including those working on the\u000a      non-strategic road network. Maltby's team's contribution to HD45 and the\u000a      risk assessment tool HAWRAT is evidenced by text in the manual:\u000a    \"Collaborative research has been undertaken by the HA and EA to\u000a        investigate the chronic effects of sediment-bound pollutants on the\u000a        ecology of receiving waters (Gaskell et al., 2008) [S2].\u000a        This research identifies the scenarios under which contaminated sediment\u000a        in runoff would be likely to have a negative impact on receiving water\u000a        ecology. The results have been used to develop Threshold Effects Levels\u000a        (TELs) and Probable Effects Levels (PELs) for metal and PAH\u000a        concentrations in sediment. ......This research is discussed in further\u000a        detail in Chapter 3 and forms the basis of the risk assessment procedure\u000a        discussed in Chapter 5.\" [S1]. Chapter 5 in the manual\u000a      introduces and explains the use of the HAWRAT tool, and again draws on our\u000a      research [S2].\u000a    Impacts on practitioners: Commenting on the impact of our\u000a      research, the HA has stated:\u000a    \"The outputs of this research have had a major impact on the policies\u000a        and practices of the HA, resulting in a more efficient and sustainable\u000a        use of resources and enhancing environmental protection. It has also\u000a        informed policy formulation by UK government departments and the\u000a        resulting guidance has been adopted by several other countries.\u000a    \"The HA guidance is issued through the Design Manual For Roads and\u000a        Bridges (DMRB) which is signed up to and used by the Devolved\u000a        Administrations (Scotland, Wales &amp; Northern Ireland). DMRB has also\u000a        been adopted elsewhere most notably in Ireland, Australia and most parts\u000a        of the Middle East. The Japanese have developed a hybrid version and the\u000a        Chinese have had it translated for their use. The Portuguese, via the\u000a        National Laboratory for Civil Engineering, used the outputs from this\u000a        research to develop \"Guidelines for the Integrated Management of Road\u000a        Runoff in Portugal.\" [S3]. Our research has also informed the\u000a      Norwegian Public Roads Administration's research and development programme\u000a      [S4].\u000a    In the UK, \"Since 2010, HD45 has been applied to approximately 5-10\u000a        major projects (&gt; &#163;10m) and 30-50 smaller improvement schemes\u000a        (&#163;0.5-5.0m). In the future it can be expected that there will on average\u000a        be 2-3 major projects and 10-20 improvement\/maintenance schemes that the\u000a        advice will routinely be applied to on an annual basis\" [S3].\u000a      The DMRB guidance and HAWRAT resulting from our research has been used in\u000a      a large number of environmental impact assessments of road projects across\u000a      the UK (e.g. in England [S5], Scotland [S6] and Northern\u000a      Ireland [S7]).\u000a    Economic impacts: \"The revised guidance has led to\u000a        rationalisation of design with significant cost savings on some projects\u000a        and more sustainable use of resources on others. It is not easy to\u000a        separate the savings from one element of a highway design as a scheme\u000a        progresses, however, as an example the updated approach to guidance was\u000a        in part attributable to a saving of c. &#163;1m on a widening scheme on the\u000a        M1\" [S3]. Savings accrue from more targeted use of\u000a      interventions. Our research contributed to an important change in the\u000a      Environment Agency's policy for dealing with road runoff, providing a\u000a      measured, risk-based approach to replace the blanket requirement for silt\u000a      traps and oil separators on all discharges from motorways and major trunk\u000a      roads. We enabled this risk-based approach to be extended from only\u000a      considering soluble contaminants (DMRB, 2006) to now including\u000a      sediment-bound contaminants (which we showed can have a much greater\u000a      impact on the ecology of receiving waters) in the most recent guidance\u000a      (DMRB, 2009) [S1].\u000a    Impacts on public policy: Our research strengthened\u000a      cooperation between the HA and EA, with the HD45\/09: Road Drainage and\u000a        the Water Environment forming part of the key commitments between\u000a      the two agencies specified in their 2009 memorandum of understanding [S8].\u000a      \"The research has contributed towards a shared\u000a        understanding between the HA and EA of the environmental impacts and\u000a        risks associated with routine non-urban highway runoff and an agreed\u000a        position on how to address risks\" [S3]. Through this, our\u000a      research input to HD45\/09 has influenced secondary legislation in\u000a      relation to Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SuDS) and \"has been\u000a        used to inform central government departments on policy formulation, in\u000a        particular development of the National SuDS Standards\" [S3].\u000a    \"The research was used to inform the development of secondary\u000a        legislation for Floods and Water Management Act 2010, which granted an\u000a        exemption to the HA from the SuDS Approval Board for its drainage\u000a        designs (The Sustainable Drainage (Approval and Adoption) (England)\u000a        Order 2012 (Clause 3(1)(b)(i)) [S3]. Prior to this exemption,\u000a      most of the HA's construction work would require approval under this Act,\u000a      a process that can have considerable time and cost implications. However,\u000a      because the HA uses the HAWRAT tool to guide assessment and design of\u000a      highway drainage systems, they are exempted from the need to seek\u000a      approval. The HA must comply with the requirements of the Act, but have\u000a      become their own approval board, saving time and money.\u000a    Impacts on the environment: \"The outputs of this\u000a        research are being used to assess the risk of pollution arising from\u000a        existing highway outfalls on the HA network that are a legacy of design\u000a        practices which, whilst appropriate at the time of construction, would\u000a        not meet today's stricter environmental requirements.\" \"The new\u000a        guidance is a more robust approach to environmental impact assessment\u000a        ensuring identified risks are mitigated effectively through the design\u000a        process, and that resources are directed and used in the most effective\u000a        way\" [S3].\u000a    Our research outputs are \"being used to develop a code of practice and\u000a        set of tools that can be adopted by Local Highway Authorities to assist\u000a        them with meeting their obligations under the EU Water Framework\u000a        Directive (WFD).\" \"This research has had considerable impact\u000a        beyond the HA. It has informed the EA's Source Apportionment Tool used\u000a        in WFD planning, contributes towards DEFRA's programme of work to tackle\u000a        non-agricultural sources of diffuse pollution and will inform the second\u000a        round of River Basin Management Planning and associated Programme of\u000a        Measures\" [S3].\u000a    In addition, our project partner at the EA has stated that \"Given the\u000a        recently announced &#163;28bn spending on roads, having the tools to identify\u000a        where mitigation measures are needed and where they provide no benefit\u000a        will have immense value. In the past, the Environment Agency has\u000a        demanded the provision of facilities such as oil separators at virtually\u000a        every site, which may not always provide good value for money. In the\u000a        future programme the Highways Agency guidance will enable both the\u000a        regulators and the highways operators to invest in protection of the\u000a        environment where it is needed and effective and not elsewhere\" [S9].\u000a    In conclusion, our research has played a crucial role in the development\u000a      and implementation of ecological risk assessment tools for road runoff\u000a      contaminants that have been widely used in the UK and internationally to\u000a      the benefit of the environment and greater cost-effectiveness.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research by Professor Maltby's group quantified the ecological impacts of\u000a      contaminants draining off road surfaces into surface waters, revealing the\u000a      importance of particulate-bound toxicants. We identified the key toxicants\u000a      involved, the concentration thresholds at which they pose significant\u000a      risks, and established the extent and the conditions under which they are\u000a      harmful.

Many of the pollutants\u000a      produced by road transport are washed off roads and discharged into\u000a      rivers, streams, ditches and ponds. The environmental costs of water\u000a      pollution in England and Wales have been estimated at up to &#163;1.3 billion\u000a      per year (National Audit Office 2010) and roads are a major contributor to\u000a      this pollution, especially in urban areas. Road runoff is a potentially\u000a      important source of environmental contaminants including heavy metals and\u000a      polyaromatic hydrocarbons, but the ecological impacts and toxicity of\u000a      these constituents in aquatic ecosystems had received little attention and\u000a      was poorly understood until we conducted research on this in the\u000a      mid-1990s.\u000a    How we addressed this problem: Prof. Maltby's group at the\u000a      University of Sheffield had established a strong track record of research\u000a      in aquatic ecotoxicology when commissioned and funded (&#163;187,000) by the\u000a      oil company Castrol to investigate ecological effects of road-runoff. Our\u000a      research approach involved an innovative multi-step combination of field\u000a      and laboratory studies both, to determine the ecological impacts of road\u000a      runoff, and to resolve the mechanistic basis of these effects [R1-R5].\u000a      We investigated how road runoff affected the structure and functioning of\u000a      stream ecosystems alongside the M1 motorway [R2] and undertook\u000a      extensive toxicity experiments with key bioassay organisms, sediment\u000a      manipulation studies and chemical analyses to identify and evaluate key\u000a      toxicants within the complex mixture of chemicals associated with road\u000a      runoff [R1,R3,R4]. Field and laboratory experiments\u000a      were then used to gain a mechanistic understanding of how toxicants\u000a      associated with contaminated sediments caused the ecological impacts\u000a      observed in freshwater communities [R5].\u000a    Through this research, we provided the first extensive and robust\u000a      demonstration of the ecological impact of road runoff on freshwater\u000a      organisms [R1-R5], established sediment-bound contaminants\u000a      as having major effects [R1], and identified the major toxicants,\u000a      in particular polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, as the causal agents [R3,R4].\u000a      These papers, which have a total of over 300 citations, characterised (i)\u000a      the nature and extent of the impact of road runoff, (ii) the\u000a      environmental conditions under which impacts occur, (iii) the key\u000a      toxicants causing the effects, (iv) their mode of transportation\u000a      (aqueous-suspended particulates), and (v) pathways of exposure\u000a      through sediment-bound pollutants acting as long-term reservoirs of\u000a      contaminants.\u000a    Our research conclusively demonstrated that it was the deposition of\u000a      contaminated particulate material washed off road surfaces that was\u000a      causing the most serious ecological impacts in adjacent surface waters [R1-R5].\u000a      Efforts to protect and improve the ecology of rivers alongside major roads\u000a      had previously focussed on controlling soluble contaminants. Our research\u000a      highlighted the need to monitor and control sediment-bound contaminant\u000a      transfer from roads into river systems across the thousands of miles of\u000a      strategic road network in England, and more widely across the millions of\u000a      miles of highways in the world.\u000a    Application of our research findings to policy and practice.\u000a      The importance of our research findings and their implications for\u000a      managing risks of water pollution from the motorway and trunk road network\u000a      was recognised by the Highways Agency and Environment Agency, especially\u000a      in relation to the increasing stringency of environmental protection\u000a      required by the EU Water Framework Directive (2000). It was clear that our\u000a      research provided essential new insights required for assessments of the\u000a      potential impact of road runoff on river ecosystems and for identifying\u000a      rivers most at risk from road runoff. It also could be used to inform the\u000a      selection of interventions to mitigate the impact of road runoff (e.g.\u000a      design and management of sediment traps, swales, sustainable urban\u000a      drainage systems) and the targeting of risk reduction measures in order to\u000a      improve environmental quality.\u000a    As a result, the Highways Agency, supported by the Environment Agency,\u000a      commissioned and funded (&#163;822,000) Maltby's group from 2002-08 to extend\u000a      the original study to a large number of sites to evaluate the generality\u000a      of the conclusions drawn from the studies on the M1 motorway, conduct\u000a      intensive site-specific studies to characterise the discharge pattern of\u000a      runoff-derived contaminated particles, and to investigate how river\u000a      hydrology and sedimentation processes influence the magnitude and nature\u000a      of their ecological impact. This enhanced understanding was combined with\u000a      the toxicity testing results of the initial research [R3-R5] to\u000a      develop risk assessment procedures and tools that would underpin revised\u000a      Highways Agency policy and practice, that has subsequently been adopted in\u000a      other countries. The programme was managed through ECUS (Environmental\u000a      Consultancy University of Sheffield) and led jointly by Prof. Maltby\u000a      (Sheffield 1984 - ) and Dr Ian Guymer (Sheffield 1990-2005, now Professor\u000a      at The University of Warwick).

Monitoring such pollutants\u000d\u000a      in water is a major challenge, but both regulators and the water industry\u000d\u000a      need to meet this challenge to fulfil statutory obligations placed upon\u000d\u000a      them. The development of passive samplers, such as the Chemcatcher, has\u000d\u000a      offered solutions to this challenge. The efficacy of the Chemcatcher was\u000d\u000a      proven in extensive European field trials(b,d), and this led to\u000d\u000a      significant interest for adopting the technology by end-users within the\u000d\u000a      environmental monitoring community. From 2008, Portsmouth has promoted and\u000d\u000a      facilitated the further uptake of the Chemcatcher technology, together\u000d\u000a      with other passive sampling techniques, which has resulted in important\u000d\u000a      impact as described below.\u000d\u000a    Impact on practice through development of new international standards:\u000d\u000a      The application of passive samplers, including the Chemcatcher, for\u000d\u000a      statutory monitoring of water quality required the development of new\u000d\u000a      standards. Portsmouth led the group that developed a British Standards\u000d\u000a      Institution Publicly Available Specification (BSI PAS 61: 2006) within the\u000d\u000a      STAMPS project(b), which informed the basis of a later ISO\/CEN\u000d\u000a      standard(viii) (2009) (leader and author R. Greenwood). These\u000d\u000a      two standards have ensured end-users employ the technology correctly in\u000d\u000a      the field thereby increasing the reliability and hence acceptability of\u000d\u000a      data by regulators. These standards also furthered the marketability of\u000d\u000a      Chemcatcher.\u000d\u000a    Use of passive sampling for monitoring surface water in Europe:\u000d\u000a      Our role in the SWIFT-WFD project(d) was to effect field\u000d\u000a      evaluations of all available passive samplers including the Chemcatcher.\u000d\u000a      This work involved dissemination workshops at demonstration sites [Eijsden\u000d\u000a      (2005), Ribble (2006), Lille (2007)] for end-users. The workshops showed\u000d\u000a      the reliability and cost effectiveness of this new approach. Subsequently\u000d\u000a      it led to the uptake of the technology by environmental agencies and\u000d\u000a      institutes (e.g. England and Wales, Finland, France, Norway, Slovakia(3))\u000d\u000a      across Europe, and to an improvement in the quality of information\u000d\u000a      available for guiding regulators in the design and location of sampling\u000d\u000a      campaigns. A further outcome was the inclusion of passive sampling as an\u000d\u000a      acceptable monitoring method, in a European Commission publication (Common\u000d\u000a      Implementation Strategy for the Water Framework Directive (2000\/60\/EC)\u000d\u000a      Guidance Document 19 Guidance on Surface Water Monitoring under the Water\u000d\u000a      Framework Directive &#8212; authors R. Greenwood and A.J. Allan). This has led\u000d\u000a      to the further uptake of Chemcatcher by environment agencies and water\u000d\u000a      companies across Europe, Australia and Japan (e.g. Environment Agency of\u000d\u000a      England and Wales(1) (now devolved into two Agencies), Scottish\u000d\u000a      Environmental Protection Agency, South West Water Ltd(2) and\u000d\u000a      Westcountry Rivers Trust, Finnish Environment Institute, Norwegian\u000d\u000a      Institute for Water Research, Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science\u000d\u000a      and Technology, CSIRO Australia(4)).\u000d\u000a    Specific examples of the use of passive sampling:\u000d\u000a      Monitoring contamination of drinking water by pharmaceuticals.\u000d\u000a      The presence of trace pharmaceutical residues in drinking water is an\u000d\u000a      international health concern. As the Chemcatcher can be deployed over\u000d\u000a      extended periods (weeks) it permits the detection of low concentrations of\u000d\u000a      chemicals that could otherwise be missed by other techniques. The device\u000d\u000a      was selected to monitor these chemicals by the Drinking Water Inspectorate\u000d\u000a      (2008-2010) in collaboration with University of York, Centre for Fisheries\u000d\u000a      and Aquaculture Science and Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. The data\u000d\u000a      obtained gave a better understanding of the presence and distribution of\u000d\u000a      pharmaceuticals and hence their overall risks to health. Results were\u000d\u000a      published in a national industry guidance document (Targeted Monitoring\u000d\u000a      For Human Pharmaceuticals In Vulnerable Source And Final Waters, Drinking\u000d\u000a      Water Inspectorate Project No. WD0805 (Ref: DWI 70\/2\/231)).\u000d\u000a    Detection and quantification of siloxanes. The expertise of\u000d\u000a      Portsmouth has led to impacts using samplers other than the Chemcatcher.\u000d\u000a      An example is the development and application of polyethylene samplers for\u000d\u000a      measuring methyl siloxanes in collaboration with Unilever (2008-2012).\u000d\u000a      These chemicals are used in personal care products and are ubiquitous,\u000d\u000a      persistent pollutants. Siloxanes are difficult to measure and many\u000d\u000a      governmental agencies have failed to implement methods for monitoring\u000d\u000a      these compounds. Our development lowered the limit of detection of these\u000d\u000a      pollutants, allowing their measurement at low concentrations and enabling\u000d\u000a      their fate in the environment to be determined more effectively.\u000d\u000a    Monitoring radioactive compounds. Collaborations with Chiba\u000d\u000a      Institute of Technology, Japan and 3M Tokyo have resulted in a modified\u000d\u000a      Chemcatcher for monitoring radio-caesium in waters near the Fukushima\u000d\u000a      reactor. A bespoke receiving phase with a high affinity for this element\u000d\u000a      lowers detection limits and removes the need to collect of large volumes\u000d\u000a      (c. 200 L) of potentially radioactive water.

For a\u000d\u000a      similar amount of field-work and laboratory analysis, passive sampling can\u000d\u000a      provide time- weighted average concentrations of pollutants over periods\u000d\u000a      of two to four weeks throughout the year. This information gives a more\u000d\u000a      representative picture of the chemical quality of environmental waters.\u000d\u000a      Further, since passive samplers accumulate pollutants over weeks of\u000d\u000a      deployment, their use enables measurement of pollutants that are present\u000d\u000a      only episodically and\/or that are present at concentrations that would\u000d\u000a      otherwise be below the limits of detection using low volume spot samples.\u000d\u000a    European funding(a) allowed us to develop a novel passive\u000d\u000a      sampler with a four component, machined PTFE body that was robust,\u000d\u000a      re-usable, easy to use, low cost, and that could be modified with\u000d\u000a      different combinations of receiving phase and overlaid diffusion limiting\u000d\u000a      membrane. Unlike any other available device, this new approach permitted\u000d\u000a      its use for all the major classes of environmental pollutant (non-polar\u000d\u000a      and polar organics, heavy metals). To facilitate adoption by end-users,\u000d\u000a      samplers were designed to be compatible with existing analytical\u000d\u000a      procedures used in commercial laboratories(1). The device,\u000d\u000a      subsequently called the Chemcatcher, was patented in the UK(vi)\u000d\u000a      and USA(vii), and a trademark registered (funded and led by\u000d\u000a      University of Portsmouth) in order to facilitate commercialisation (see\u000d\u000a      section 5).\u000d\u000a    To further extend the utility and applicability of the Chemcatcher,\u000d\u000a      additional development work at the European level(b) was\u000d\u000a      undertaken to expand the range of pollutants (e.g. mercury and\u000d\u000a      organo-metallic compounds) for which the sampler could be used, to provide\u000d\u000a      calibration data, and to develop in situ calibration methods to\u000d\u000a      compensate for the effects of temperature and turbulence that vary widely\u000d\u000a      in the field(2,3,4). Several designs of sampler were assessed,\u000d\u000a      and a prototype selected for laboratory calibration, and field evaluation(5)(c).\u000d\u000a    The introduction of the European Union's Water Framework Directive in\u000d\u000a      2000 (2000\/60\/EC) gave the incentive to look for alternative cost\u000d\u000a      effective methods to monitor water quality across the Community. In 2004,\u000d\u000a      we were invited to participate in a large European funded project(d)\u000d\u000a      that aimed to test a number of sampling techniques for their suitability\u000d\u000a      for use within the remit of the Directive. We tested passive samplers,\u000d\u000a      including the Chemcatcher, alongside a range of developing monitoring\u000d\u000a      tools and established spot\/bottle sampling methods. The studies were\u000d\u000a      designed to improve field application, provide understanding of the\u000d\u000a      factors affecting field performance, and to provide information for\u000d\u000a      regulatory agencies through extensive field trials across Europe(6)\u000d\u000a      involving participation by regulators and managers from the water\u000d\u000a      industry.

Major concerns over science\u000a      communication of GM and nuclear waste disposal were the key drivers of the\u000a      influential House of Lords Science and Technology Select Committee year\u000a      2000 report on Science and Society which led to the establishment of the\u000a      Science Media Centre (SMC). Smith's media work with the SMC, and direct\u000a      public engagement activities on nuclear issues, have made an outstanding\u000a      contribution to the scientific community's public response to the\u000a      Fukushima accident and to public understanding of nuclear and radiation\u000a      risk issues in general.\u000a    This case study is set within the context of Smith's long record of\u000a      commitment to public engagement activities on nuclear issues. Since 2008,\u000a      he has given eight talks to practising (for Institute of Physics, IoP) and\u000a      trainee physics teachers (total audience ca. 300), numerous lectures to\u000a      schoolchildren (total audience ca. 700) including a prestigious IoP\u000a      \"Physics in Perspective\" lecture. Lectures to general audiences (totalling\u000a      ca. 750) have included five well-attended Cafe Scientifiques. Until 2012,\u000a      he was on the organizing committee of the Institute of Physics (IoP)\u000a      Teachers' Update Course3.\u000a    In the immediate aftermath of the three explosions (12-15 March 2011) at\u000a      Fukushima, there was an urgent need by the international news media for\u000a      independent expert opinion on the accident's significance and its\u000a      consequences to people and the environment. The statement by the EU\u000a      Commissioner for Energy that \"There is talk of apocalypse... practically\u000a      everything is out of control\" was widely reported. This, together with\u000a      Germany and Italy's rapid renouncement of nuclear power, contributed to an\u000a      atmosphere of panic surrounding nuclear issues in Europe as well as Asia.\u000a    During the weeks after Fukushima, Smith made a key contribution to the\u000a      developing scientific understanding of the likely consequences of the\u000a      accident and to the worldwide dissemination of that understanding. This\u000a      made a real difference to news agencies' coverage of the event, as\u000a      evidenced by letters from Reuters4 and the BBC5.\u000a      Through dozens of media interviews reaching a global audience of many tens\u000a      of millions7, his knowledge of the environmental mobility of\u000a      radioactivity allowed accurate prediction of the likely impacts of marine\u000a      and terrestrial contamination, in particular the need for an extended area\u000a      of long term evacuation (e.g. Smith, J.T. Nature article6;\u000a      online 05\/04\/11). Importantly, his comments placed the likely health risks\u000a      from radiation in their proper context.\u000a    A partial analysis of Smith's Fukushima coverage7 identified\u000a      40 outlets including The Sun, Financial Times and BBC Six and Ten O'clock\u000a      News. It is likely that coverage in total ran to hundreds of media\u000a      outlets; for example, coverage by Radio 4's PM, USA Today and New Zealand\u000a      national public radio was not picked up by the clippings analysis. A\u000a      highly successful live online Q&amp;A session on Fukushima with Smith, run\u000a      by Nature (06\/04\/11) received more than 5000 hits8 and an\u000a      edited version appeared in Scientific American magazine. As a key expert\u000a      for the SMC1, Smith was one of four scientists in a press\u000a      briefing (29\/03\/11) to 11 national science journalists including Reuters,\u000a      The Guardian and the Today programme. This generated considerable science-\u000a      based press coverage on the environmental contamination, and, perhaps more\u000a      importantly, communicated the negligible health risks of plutonium\u000a      detected near the reactor, and of Fukushima radionuclides detected in the\u000a      UK and Europe. Averting unfounded scare stories on radiation is as\u000a      important an impact as the generation of science-based coverage, as\u000a      emphasised by Fox1,9:\u000a    \"The main event for the SMC in 2011 was the nuclear crisis at Fukushima\u000a      [it] was the only story in town and headlines about \"another Chernobyl\"\u000a      and \"nuclear apocalypse\" screamed out from front pages... [our] scientists\u000a      offered a considered assessment of complex and terrifying events. Because\u000a      of their efforts, alarmist headlines were at least partially balanced by\u000a      the kind of accurate, evidence-based science we desperately need in times\u000a      of media frenzy.\"\u000a    The research by the submitting unit clearly helped underpin the many\u000a      interviews given by Smith. The need for permanent evacuation and\u000a      assessment of health consequences needs an understanding of the\u000a      environmental mobility of radiocaesium and the evaluation of dose.\u000a      Prognosis of direct impacts on ecosystems is dependent on work on\u000a      radiation effects on organisms to which Smith has made an important\u000a      contribution. These research papers (5,6 above) themselves have generated\u000a      media coverage (despite being good news stories), including New Scientist,\u000a      BBC Radio Scotland and EURONEWS (broadcast worldwide).\u000a    Public engagement activities are \"of vital importance to an informed\u000a      public and political debate on the costs and benefits of nuclear power and\u000a      radioactive waste disposal\"1.

The research has been conducted at the\u000a      University of Portsmouth since 1999. It was led from 1999-07 by Dr David\u000a      Timms (Reader in Radiation Physics: deceased, 2007), in collaboration with\u000a      Prof. Jim Smith (Professor of Environmental Science from 2011), who joined\u000a      Portsmouth in 2007 (as Reader) from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology\u000a      and has led the research since then.\u000a    The body of research carried out by Timms and Smith has made a\u000a      significant contribution to understanding the long-term mobility of\u000a      radioactivity in the environment, external radiation dose and ecosystem\u000a      impacts. This provided key underpinning to Smith's public communication\u000a      work following the Fukushima accident, in particular allowing\u000a      evidence-based responses to issues concerning contamination of drinking\u000a      water sources, the extent and likely duration of evacuation of the\u000a      contaminated areas, and radiation impacts on wildlife.\u000a    The research has primarily focussed on radiocaesium (Cs-134 and Cs-137),\u000a      and radiostrontium (Sr-90), the most important long-term contaminants in\u000a      most major nuclear power plant accident scenarios. The long-term\u000a      consequences of radionuclide contamination depend on their rate of\u000a      transfer from contaminated land to surface waters, and the extent to which\u000a      they transfer into soils. These determine levels of contamination of\u000a      rivers, lakes and reservoirs, as well as redistribution and the radiation\u000a      dose from radioactivity absorbed to soil. Smith and Timms' research into\u000a      transfers of radiocaesium and radiostrontium from a wide range of river\u000a      catchments1 has allowed quantification of radionuclide\u000a      transfers to surface waters and their relation to soil characteristics.\u000a      Their model which for the first time incorporated a solution of the\u000a      advection-dispersion equation into an external dose model2\u000a      improves assessment of dose rate changes over time by accounting for\u000a      differing, and time-changing, radionuclide depth distributions in the\u000a      formation of external dose.\u000a    Research by the submitting unit into the long term impacts of radiation\u000a      on organisms has helped us to understand the ecological consequences of\u000a      both routine and accidental releases of radioactivity. The simplified\u000a      model (\"D-Max\") was developed to evaluate radiation doses to organisms in\u000a      both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Smith participated in the\u000a      International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Environmental Modelling for\u000a      Radiation Safety (EMRAS) aquatic3 and terrestrial4\u000a      model testing and inter-comparison exercises, providing international\u000a      validation of models and highlighting key areas of uncertainty. The first\u000a      population-level study of radiation effects on aquatic insects at\u000a      Chernobyl5 observed, perhaps surprisingly, no negative impacts,\u000a      even in the most contaminated lakes. A modelling study6 to\u000a      test, for the first time, the hypothesis that oxidative stress is a\u000a      mechanism for radiation damage in contaminated environments found that\u000a      production of reactive oxygen species by radiolysis was far too low to\u000a      cause direct radiation impacts.\u000a    This body of research has resulted in significant contributions by Smith\u000a      to two key IAEA technical reports on radionuclide transfer (TRS 472:\u000a      Handbook of Parameter Values for the Prediction of Radionuclide Transfer\u000a      in Terrestrial and Freshwater Environments, 2010) and post-accident\u000a      emergency response (TRS 475: Guidelines for remediation strategies to\u000a      reduce the radiological consequences of environmental contamination,\u000a      2012).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"15626","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["British Academy","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The dual impacts of this work lie in public engagement in evolutionary\u000d\u000a      science and in supporting the generation of more than $10 M income for the\u000d\u000a      UK TV and film industry.\u000d\u000a    Ever since the successful employment of modern CGI (computer generated\u000d\u000a      image) techniques in animating prehistoric reptiles, first in Steven\u000d\u000a      Speilberg's portrayal of Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park\u000d\u000a      (Universal Pictures 1993), and subsequently in the novel \"documentary\"\u000d\u000a      genre for Tim Hains' and Jasper James' Walking With Dinosaurs (BBC\u000d\u000a      1999), public interest in prehistoric reptiles, especially dinosaurs and\u000d\u000a      pterosaurs, has soared.

Martill and\/or Witton\u000d\u000a      were principal scientific consultants for these productions. In all of\u000d\u000a      these productions, the pterosaurs are animated with morphology and ecology\u000d\u000a      based directly on the work of the Portsmouth Group: the scientists\u000d\u000a      constructed the physical models which were then developed in CGI.\u000d\u000a    As documented below2, Sir David Attenborough has noted the\u000d\u000a      importance of this scientific work to such programmes: regarding Flying\u000a        Monsters, he states that `Dr Martill advised us throughout the\u000d\u000a        film's production and gave it great authority'. In a public\u000d\u000a      interview, Anthony Geffen, CEO Atlantic Productions, stated that \"the CG\u000d\u000a      team worked for months with scientists\"3.

In a new approach, the mass of the skeleton, muscle and viscera\u000d\u000a      was determined anatomically at ~250 kg for a ten metre wingspan pterosaur:\u000d\u000a      significantly higher than previously determined, and having considerable\u000d\u000a      effects on flight mechanics and stall speed. Witton and Naish (2008) then\u000d\u000a      evaluated the palaeoecology of giant pterosaurs, suggesting they were\u000d\u000a      analogous to modern storks (ref. 2). This study provided a novel\u000d\u000a      interpretation as azhdarchid pterosaurs were previously thought to have\u000d\u000a      been piscivorous oceanic gliders.\u000d\u000a    We also examined the hypothesis that pterosaurs fed by skimming (ref 3).\u000a      Such a feeding strategy is inefficient, requiring considerable energy\u000d\u000a      expenditure for limited resource capture. We combined calculated stall\u000d\u000a      speeds for pterosaurs previously considered to have been skim feeders, and\u000d\u000a      modelled the effects of skimming at speeds above this on water turbulence\u000d\u000a      and jaw strength in flume tanks. Our results excluded skimming for giant\u000d\u000a      pterosaurs. We determined a completely different lifestyle in which these\u000d\u000a      gigantic animals were dominantly terrestrial, and may have had an ecology\u000d\u000a      comparable to modern (though much smaller) ground hornbills and secretary\u000d\u000a      birds.\u000d\u000a    Many pterosaurs possess cranial crests located on the anterior rostrum,\u000d\u000a      posterior rostrum or both (ref. 4). The functionality of these is\u000d\u000a      controversial and includes possible involvement in thermoregulation,\u000d\u000a      species recognition and sexual selection. A primary function in flight\u000d\u000a      dynamics is considered unlikely, but a deleterious effect in flight\u000d\u000a      performance may be a trade off with sexual prowess. We analysed the growth\u000d\u000a      and development of a cranial crest in the genus Tupuxuara and\u000d\u000a      found that cranial crest development involves the growth of the premaxilla\u000d\u000a      over the cranium, including nasals, frontals and parietals, in progression\u000d\u000a      through ontogeny (ref. 5). This supports a behavioural function\u000d\u000a      rather than biomechanical.\u000d\u000a    The palaeobiology of prehistoric reptiles is derived entirely from\u000d\u000a      analysis of their fossil remains, and is severely limited by the\u000d\u000a      completeness of this record. New discoveries allow us to build on, or\u000d\u000a      challenge earlier ideas, while new methods of analysis such as CT\u000d\u000a      scanning, allow us to investigate aspects previously only studied using\u000d\u000a      destructive methodologies, or not studied at all. Our main findings have\u000d\u000a      overturned models of pterosaur life strategies (refs 2 and 4). We\u000d\u000a      have demonstrated that some achieved a wingspan &gt;9m, perhaps &gt;11m (ref.\u000a        3), and we have demonstrated that larger forms were far heavier than\u000d\u000a      previously thought (ref. 2). These new estimates do not exclude\u000d\u000a      larger pterosaurs from being volant (ref. 6).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"16105","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The Institute is widely recognised for its role in uncovering the threat\u000d\u000a      of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment, and for its influence on\u000d\u000a      shaping responses. Through engagement with policy makers, other regulators\u000d\u000a      and industry, Sumpter, Jobling and Routledge ensured their\u000d\u000a      findings were key components of evidence leading to regulation of\u000d\u000a      pharmaceuticals. In 2004, the UK government accepted evidence that steroid\u000d\u000a      oestrogens posed a significant risk to aquatic life. End-of-pipe\u000d\u000a        treatment of effluent was chosen as the risk management approach,\u000d\u000a      placing this responsibility on the water industry. In 2007, the\u000d\u000a      Environment Agency developed a draft environmental quality\u000d\u000a      standard (EQS) for ethinylestradiol &#8212; a target concentration which could\u000d\u000a      be used for regulatory compliance &#8212; based on a predicted no effect\u000d\u000a      concentration of 0.1ng\/L, albeit this was further refined to 0.035ng\/L by\u000d\u000a      the European Commission, based on the results of Professor Sumpter's\u000d\u000a      collaborative studies with the pharmaceutical industry (see Caldwell et\u000d\u000a      al., 2008 in the research section).\u000d\u000a    To quantify the wider consequences and costs to society of the proposed\u000d\u000a      management approach and balance them against the benefits, it was\u000d\u000a      necessary to evaluate the efficiency of various existing sewage\u000d\u000a      treatment approaches in removing steroid oestrogens and their biological\u000d\u000a      effects. The water industry, therefore, conducted The Endocrine Disruptor\u000d\u000a      Demonstration Programme (2006-2010), through which they gained an improved\u000d\u000a      understanding of the effectiveness of different treatment technologies and\u000d\u000a      the sources of chemicals entering the sewerage system. Jobling\u000d\u000a      (then a senior research fellow) and Dr Mark Scrimshaw (senior\u000d\u000a      lecturer) were both advisors to the Environment Agency during the\u000d\u000a      development of the experimental protocols for the \"Demonstration\u000d\u000a      Programme\" of work (budgeted &#163;40 million). The standardised test protocols\u000d\u000a      developed by Tyler, Routledge and Sumpter were used to test the\u000d\u000a      efficacy of sewage treatment technologies in this programme and Jobling\u000d\u000a      participated in the programme, performing testing for two water companies.\u000d\u000a      The information gathered is currently supporting regulators and the Water\u000d\u000a      Industry in defining the best environmental solution to the problem,\u000d\u000a      taking into account costs and carbon footprints. Sumpter and\u000d\u000a          Tyler's' fish tests now form the basis of two OECD standard\u000d\u000a          reproductive toxicity tests for (OECD tests 229 and 2301)\u000d\u000a          adopted in 2009. The US EPA (2009) has also adopted modified versions\u000d\u000a          of these tests for regulatory purposes.\u000d\u000a    In large part due to the Institute's research, for the first time in\u000d\u000a        history, the European Commission placed three pharmaceutical compounds\u000d\u000a        (the contraceptive pill hormones, ethinylestradiol and estradiol, and\u000d\u000a        the painkiller diclofenac) on a draft list2 of priority\u000d\u000a        chemicals (2012) thought to pose a risk to the safety of surface water.\u000d\u000a        Priority chemicals require control under the Water Framework Directive\u000d\u000a        (WFD; the primary legislation for protecting and conserving European\u000d\u000a        water bodies). Lobbying by the pharmaceutical industry recently\u000d\u000a      (2\/07\/2013) ensured movement of the three pharmaceuticals onto a new\u000d\u000a      'watch list'3 of emerging aquatic pollutants and an extension\u000d\u000a      of the deadline for achieving water quality targets for the\u000d\u000a      pharmaceuticals from 2021 to 2027. There is now a new article in the\u000d\u000a        text of the Water Framework Directive stating the EC's intention to\u000d\u000a        develop a strategic approach to pollution of water by pharmaceutical\u000d\u000a        substances \"aimed at reducing their discharges, emissions, and losses to\u000d\u000a        the aquatic environment\". Once implemented, the standards for\u000d\u000a      steroid oestrogens will be taken into account in the 2015 River Basin\u000d\u000a      Management Plans and associated `Programmes of Measures' for the Water\u000d\u000a      Framework Directive across Europe. In the UK alone, this change in\u000d\u000a      European law will eventually require the upgrade of almost 1400 sewage\u000d\u000a      treatment works in order to produce effluent that allows compliance with\u000d\u000a      the environmental standards set for pharmaceuticals and natural steroid\u000d\u000a      oestrogens.\u000d\u000a    There is currently a vigorous debate over the economic costs of\u000d\u000a      regulating pharmaceuticals (described in Owen and Jobling \"The hidden\u000d\u000a      costs of flexible fertility\" Nature, 485,\u000d\u000a          pp441, 24th May, 20124). The\u000d\u000a      pharmaceutical industry claims the combined pill is the most popular\u000d\u000a      contraceptive in the UK and the most effective; a loss of &#8364;4 billion\u000d\u000a        in sales, 217,000 additional unintended pregnancies and a social\u000d\u000a      cost of around &#163;26.2 million per year, equivalent to around &#163;382\u000a        million over 20 years would result if it was not used. The water\u000d\u000a      industry claims the total costs of treating the ~1,360 wastewater\u000d\u000a      treatment works in England and Wales with EE2 failures are between &#163;27-31\u000d\u000a      billion over the same period5.\u000d\u000a    Despite this debate, in some countries, full-scale treatments aimed at\u000d\u000a        removing pharmaceuticals have already been implemented, ahead of the\u000d\u000a        inevitable EU regulation. For example, such treatment technologies are\u000d\u000a        now operating on more than 100 Swiss WWTP, treating about 80 % of the\u000d\u000a        Swiss municipal wastewater. Comparable programmes have been carried\u000d\u000a      out in other European countries and in the USA, Japan and Australia,\u000d\u000a      through the Institute's efforts to promote the transfer of their knowledge\u000d\u000a      and practice in this area to many other countries. Practical examples of\u000d\u000a      knowledge transfer include the \"effect mapping techniques\", pioneered by\u000d\u000a      the Institute and now applied in projects in Japan and Australia (the\u000d\u000a      UK-Japan initiative http:\/\/www.uk-j.org\u000d\u000a      and the Australia-UK initiative www.ecotox.org.au\/edcsig\/history.html),\u000a      together with the dissemination of the yeast oestrogen screen (used to\u000d\u000a      identify pharmaceuticals as the oestrogenic culprits of the feminisation\u000d\u000a      of fish) to more than 200 laboratories across 32 countries of the world,\u000d\u000a      along with training in its use. The raised awareness of pharmaceuticals in\u000d\u000a      water has led to much media attention and to a study commissioned by the\u000d\u000a      Drinking Water inspectorate (DWI) to determine the worst case scenario of\u000d\u000a      potential human exposure to pharmaceuticals in drinking water in England\u000d\u000a      and Wales and a WHO report also on this topic6. In the USA,\u000d\u000a      steroid oestrogens are included on a list of 104 contaminants EPA will\u000d\u000a      evaluate to determine if national drinking water regulations are needed to\u000d\u000a      protect public health7. As a leading example of excellence in\u000d\u000a      impact, contributing to positive change on an international scale, the\u000d\u000a      Institute's work in this area was awarded a Queen's Anniversary Trust\u000d\u000a        Prize8 in November 2011. Professor Sumpter was\u000d\u000a      awarded the 2009 Toxicology Award from the Royal Society of Chemistry9\u000d\u000a      for transforming our view of ecotoxicity, particularly our understanding\u000d\u000a      of the role of pharmaceutical pollutants in the aquatic environment.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Over the past two decades, researchers at the Institute for the\u000d\u000a      Environment (hereafter, the Institute) at Brunel University have generated\u000d\u000a      substantive evidence supporting the case for regulation of discharges of\u000d\u000a      pharmaceuticals into rivers and estuaries throughout Europe and for\u000d\u000a      improved sewage treatment, with significant implications for water\u000d\u000a      quality, aquatic life and public confidence.

Subsequent environmental forensic studies by Dr Edwin Routledge\u000d\u000a      (then a postdoctoral researcher), using a newly-developed bench-top assay\u000d\u000a      (the yeast oestrogen screen), showed that steroid oestrogens excreted by\u000d\u000a      women, principally the contraceptive pill hormone, ethinylestradiol, were\u000d\u000a      responsible for the oestrogenic activity of the effluent (Desbrow et al.,\u000d\u000a      1998). In parallel, Professor Susan Jobling (then a postdoctoral\u000d\u000a      researcher) revealed widespread feminisation of wild male fish in many UK\u000d\u000a      rivers receiving these effluents (Jobling et al., 1998).\u000d\u000a    In a subsequent project funded by the UK Environment Agency, Jobling\u000d\u000a        and Sumpter (together with NERC scientists Johnson and Williams)\u000d\u000a      developed models predicting the effects of ethinylestradiol and other\u000d\u000a      pharmaceuticals across the UK river network. Effect maps for oestrogens\u000d\u000a      were compared with field data and were shown to correlate with real\u000d\u000a      impacts observed in fish populations throughout the UK (Jobling et al.,\u000d\u000a      2006). These findings provided the impetus for research showing similar\u000d\u000a      effects in more than ten countries, which contributed to the weight of\u000d\u000a      evidence for European regulation.\u000d\u000a    Laboratory studies carried out by Sumpter in collaboration with\u000d\u000a      the pharmaceutical industry (Schering) showed effects of ethinylestradiol\u000d\u000a      in fish at extremely low concentrations (L&#228;nge et al., 2001) and defined\u000d\u000a      no observed effect concentrations for this chemical (Caldwell et al.,\u000d\u000a      2008) that were later used in European regulation (see section on impact).\u000d\u000a      Collectively, the Brunel group has now published 68 papers on steroid\u000d\u000a      oestrogens. Professors Sumpter and Tyler (then a Brunel scientist)\u000d\u000a      also designed standard laboratory tests using fathead minnows that could\u000d\u000a      be used to test the effects of oestrogenic chemicals on pair-breeding fish\u000d\u000a      (Harries et al., 2000). These tests were used to measure the efficacy of\u000d\u000a      advanced wastewater treatment in removing the biological effects on fish\u000d\u000a      during a Water Industry-funded UK Demonstration Programme, designed to\u000d\u000a      demonstrate that existing wastewater treatment processes could remove\u000d\u000a      ethinylestradiol and other steroid oestrogens from wastewaters.\u000d\u000a    Sumpter's team have conducted pioneering work on a range of other\u000d\u000a      pharmaceuticals (35 papers during the period of assessment), including\u000d\u000a      other steroids (progestogens and glucocorticoids) as well as cytotoxic\u000d\u000a      drugs, leading to the development of a new area of ecotoxicology,\u000d\u000a      pharmaceuticals in the environment (PIE).

To achieve this,\u000d\u000atranslational work in the appropriate political context in the European Union was necessary.\u000d\u000aKortenkamp was actively involved in this translation and a State of the Art report on Mixture\u000d\u000aToxicology for the European Commission (published whilst Kortenkamp was at the London School\u000d\u000aof Pharmacy) had considerable impact. It cited the work carried out by Sumpter, Brian, Tyler and\u000d\u000aThorpe (Brunel staff and students at the time the research was carried out) as \"Ecotoxicology that\u000d\u000ahas played an important role in advancing mixture toxicology, with human and mammalian\u000d\u000atoxicology slowly catching up\" (Kortenkamp et al, 2009). Several recent pieces of European\u000d\u000achemicals legislation now require consideration of mixture effects, including the Plant Protection\u000d\u000aProduct Regulation, PPPR (1107\/2009) and the Biocidal Products Regulation (EU 528\/2012),\u000d\u000aREACH, the Water Framework Directive, and the Cosmetics Directive. In the Water Framework\u000d\u000aDirective, it states that mixtures can be considered when their qualitative and quantitative\u000d\u000acomposition is well described and that the concentration addition concept defined by Brunel's\u000d\u000aresearchers can be used as a default for setting quality standards. Indeed, it is now unanimously\u000d\u000aagreed that for chemical mixtures, a classical tiered approach should be used and that the concept\u000d\u000aof concentration addition (CA) described by Brunel researchers is a suitable approach for the first\u000d\u000atier assessment.\u000d\u000aImplementation of legislation is a separate step, requiring a framework and a methodology, that\u000d\u000ahas still not been taken for the Water Framework Directive, the PPPR, the Biocidal Products\u000d\u000aRegulation or REACH, albeit there have been many calls for action. For pesticides and biocides,\u000d\u000athe European Commission mandated the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) with working out\u000d\u000athe details for considering combination effects during the setting of maximum residue levels in food\u000d\u000aitems.\u000d\u000aTo this end, the EFSA Plant Protection Product Regulation (PPR) Panel instituted a working\u000d\u000agroup which Kortenkamp was called to join as an external expert. The task of this group was\u000d\u000ato draft a Scientific Opinion of EFSA which was to be adopted by the EFSA PPR Panel. The EFSA\u000d\u000aworking group began by deciding which chemicals should be considered together in mixtures risk\u000d\u000aassessment, in so-called common assessment groups usually made on the basis of specific\u000d\u000acriteria regarding common chemical structures and common toxicological mechanisms.\u000d\u000aThe EFSA working group, however, developed a novel grouping strategy that began not with\u000d\u000aconsiderations of mechanisms, but instead using common adverse outcomes as the starting point\u000d\u000afor creating common assessment groups. Novel grouping criteria, based on the concept of shared\u000d\u000atoxicity and common adverse outcomes, irrespective of mechanisms, were developed for\u000d\u000aapplication to the regulatory framework. With this new grouping approach, all pesticides that affect\u000d\u000ae.g. the thyroid gland are considered together. The resulting large groupings (around 100\u000d\u000apesticides in the case of the thyroid) can then be broken down into finer groupings, according to\u000d\u000aadditional mechanistic criteria, as and when they become available.\u000d\u000aThis strategy was chosen with explicit reference to work conducted by Kortenkamp and\u000d\u000acollaborators (Christiansen et al. 2012, Orton et al. 2012) showing that cocktail effects of\u000d\u000achemicals could occur independently of chemical and mechanistic similarity between the\u000d\u000aingredients of the cocktail. In June 2013, the EFSA PPR Panel adopted this Scientific Opinion\u000d\u000a(EFSA 2013, published in July). The adoption process involved rigorous reviews to which Dr\u000d\u000aDaniel Pickford of Brunel's IfE contributed substantially as an EFSA PPR Panel member.\u000d\u000aSome of the proposed new assessment groups consist of nearly 100 active pesticidal substances.\u000d\u000aThis marks a radical departure from practice in the USA, where up to now a maximum of 5\u000d\u000apesticides are included in the same assessment group. The novel approach taken by EFSA will set\u000d\u000aa precedent internationally, not only for pesticides regulation, but for the regulation of chemicals in\u000d\u000ageneral.\u000d\u000aThe Scientific Opinion (EFSA 2013) is shaping profoundly the way in which maximum\u000d\u000aresidue levels for pesticides in food items are set. For the first time, these decisions will be\u000d\u000amade by taking account of combination effects of pesticides. In certain cases, maximum residue\u000d\u000alevels may have to be lowered and this will lead to better protection of consumers from\u000d\u000apesticide residues. In turn, this will reduce total health impacts from pesticide use in Europe\u000d\u000a(currently estimated at around 2000 disability adjusted life years lost per year) and reduce EU\u000d\u000aconsumer concern regarding pesticide residues (currently the EU barometer states 72% of EU\u000d\u000aconsumers are worried about exposure to pesticide residues). The \"knock on\" effects\u000d\u000ainternationally, will also lower general public and occupational allowable exposures to pesticides in\u000d\u000aother countries, such as the USA and Japan.\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aHundreds of synthetic chemicals contaminate our food and water.

In 1999, Professors Sumpter and Tyler (then at Brunel) recognized this\u000d\u000amajor limitation and began to develop experimental strategies (Thorpe 2001, 2003) for assessing\u000d\u000athe joint toxicity of chemical mixtures in ecotoxicology. In 2001, Sumpter began to collaborate on\u000d\u000achemical cocktails with Drs Andreas Kortenkamp and Martin Scholze, at the School of\u000d\u000aPharmacy, University of London in an EU-funded project, ACE (Analysing combination effects of\u000d\u000amixtures of estrogenic chemicals in marine and freshwater organisms), led by Professor Sumpter.\u000d\u000aThe ACE project helped create a sound conceptual basis for the assessment of multi-component\u000d\u000amixtures using mathematical algorithms to derive prediction curves for combinations which could\u000d\u000abe used as a benchmark against which synergisms and antagonisms could be evaluated.\u000d\u000aSubsequently, many observations confirming the predictability of multi-component mixtures were\u000d\u000amade with in vitro assays, but information about mixtures of chemicals in entire organisms was\u000d\u000aneeded to make these ideas more credible in the arena of risk assessment. These concepts and\u000d\u000amethodologies were further developed in an EU-funded project awarded to Kortenkamp (Eden) in\u000d\u000awhich Sumpter participated. In 2005, Prof Sumpter, and Dr Jayne Brian published a landmark\u000d\u000apaper on the effects of five chemicals in fish, showing that the variability normally encountered in\u000d\u000aan in vivo system is no hindrance to predicting mixture effects accurately (Brian et al. 2005). It also\u000d\u000ademonstrated that taking account of mixture effects provided consistently higher risk estimates\u000d\u000athan approaches which do not consider combination effects. As a direct result, the idea that\u000d\u000amixture effects should be taken into account during chemical risk assessment gained credibility,\u000d\u000ahowever, the practicalities of doing so had to be worked out.\u000d\u000aA key issue was which chemicals should be grouped together for chemical risk assessment\u000d\u000aand which criteria should be used for grouping?\u000d\u000aEstablished practice was to group together chemicals with very similar structural features and\u000d\u000amechanisms. For example, the US EPA currently considers organophosphate pesticides and\u000d\u000acarbonate pesticides in separate groups, although both types of pesticides essentially work\u000d\u000athrough the same mechanisms, inhibition of acetylcholine esterase. In several key scientific papers\u000d\u000aand reports, Prof Kortenkamp's team (who joined Brunel in July 2011 with Silva, Martin, Evans,\u000d\u000aOrton, Ermler and Scholze) showed that these criteria are too narrow and might lead to\u000d\u000aunderestimations of risks by leaving out chemicals that in reality also contribute to a mixture effect.\u000d\u000aSeveral pesticides affecting male sexual development by totally different mechanisms were shown\u000d\u000ato act together and result in significant mixture effects despite their enormous chemical and\u000d\u000amechanistic diversity (Evans et al. 2012, Kortenkamp et al. 2012, Orton et al. 2012, Christiansen et\u000d\u000aal., 2012). This research was conducted as part of the EU-funded CONTAMED project headed by\u000d\u000aKortenkamp and had a profound impact on the thinking about grouping criteria for predicting the\u000d\u000aeffects of mixtures of pesticides found in food and water. It led to the realization that grouping\u000d\u000aaccording to chemical structural features and mechanisms would lead to underestimations of risk\u000d\u000aby ignoring chemicals that in reality also contribute to combination effects.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"16107","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    IfE research on endocrine disrupters has provided the scientific\u000a      underpinnings for decision making processes in the European Union, USA and\u000a      in organisations of the United Nations, specifically the UN Environmental\u000a      Programme. This took place through three distinct types of activity;\u000a      first, by raising awareness of endocrine disrupting chemicals, second, by\u000a      examining and demonstrating the strength of the scientific evidence for\u000a      harmful effects of endocrine disrupters, and third, by developing ways of\u000a      handling these chemicals within the framework of EU chemical regulations.\u000a    Critical analyses of the literature by IfE researchers (Kortenkamp et al.\u000a      2011, Weybridge +15) concluded that exposures to endocrine disruptors are\u000a      likely causal contributors to the total global endocrine-related disease\u000a      burden (e.g. hormonal cancers, declines in reproductive health) which is\u000a      now unprecedented (WHO \/ UNEP 2012). They also concluded that endocrine\u000a      disrupters should be regulated as strictly as carcinogens, mutagens and\u000a      reproductive toxicants. This work exposed a critical gap in EU chemicals\u000a      regulations with insufficient protection especially of mothers and their\u000a      unborn life.\u000a    In the European Union, three pieces of European Community legislation\u000a      deal explicitly with endocrine disrupters: The Plant Protection Product\u000a      Regulation, PPPR (1107\/2009); the chemicals regulation, Registration,\u000a      Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals, REACH (1907\/2006) and the new\u000a      Biocidal Product Regulation, BPR. Under all these regulations the European\u000a      Commission is now mandated with developing scientific criteria for the\u000a      identification of endocrine disrupting chemicals, with the aim of removing\u000a      them from use entirely, or restricting their use significantly. It is here\u000a      that IfE research also created impact by finding ways of implementing\u000a      better regulation for endocrine disrupters.\u000a    IfE research showed that the ways in which endocrine disrupters act pose\u000a      several challenges to the existing EU regulatory regime. The life stage\u000a      where exposure takes place is absolutely critical, but also whether the\u000a      toxicity is irreversible and whether endocrine-related toxicity occurs at\u000a      low exposures. This meant that a tailor-made matrix had to be developed to\u000a      translate the outcome of toxicity tests into decision criteria for\u000a      restricting the use of chemicals identified as endocrine disrupters.\u000a      Recommendations for such decision criteria were elaborated in Kortenkamp\u000a      et al. (2011) and have found entry into the blueprint of endocrine\u000a      disrupter regulation in the EU, the \"Report of the Endocrine Disrupters -\u000a      Expert Advisory Group (ED EAG)\" from the European Commission DG Joint\u000a      Research Centre (Munn and Goumenou 2013). The \"State of the Art Assessment\u000a      of Endocrine Disrupters\" (Kortenkamp et al. 2011) and the \"Weybridge +15\u000a      report\" (EEA 2012) were also listed as important reference documents for a\u000a      motion of the European Parliament which was passed on 14 March 2013 and\u000a      called on the European Commission to implement better protection from\u000a      endocrine disrupters (procedure reference 2012\/2066 INI). Professor\u000a      Kortenkamp has been called twice to brief MEPs on endocrine disrupters in\u000a      connection with the drafting of this motion, first on 18 September and\u000a      then again on 14 November 2012.\u000a    In autumn 2012, the European Commission DG Health mandated the European\u000a      Food Safety Authority (EFSA) with elaborating criteria for the regulation\u000a      of pesticides with endocrine disrupting properties, by end of March 2013.\u000a      The \"State of the Art Assessment of Endocrine Disrupters\" was one key\u000a      document for the deliberations of the EFSA scientific committee. Dr\u000a        Daniel Pickford was called to serve on the working group which\u000a      produced the EFSA Scientific Opinion on the topic (EFSA 2013).\u000a    Professors Susan Jobling and Andreas Kortenkamp engaged in\u000a      translational activities at the UN level and were called by the UN\u000a      Environmental Programme to present their research in support of a motion\u000a      to adopt endocrine disrupters as an emerging policy issue under the\u000a      Strategic Approach to Chemicals Management (SAICM). SAICM was adopted by\u000a      the International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM) of the UN\u000a      Environment Programme as a policy framework to foster the sound management\u000a      of chemicals. It supports achieving the goal of ensuring that by 2020\u000a      chemicals are produced and used in ways that minimize significant adverse\u000a      impacts on the environment and on human health. On the strengths of the\u000a      presentations by Jobling and Kortenkamp, the ICCM3 meeting in Nairobi\u000a      (17-21.9.2012) comprising 540 participants, representing more than 150\u000a      governments, other SAICM stakeholders from international organizations,\u000a      industry and civil society adopted endocrine disrupters as an emerging\u000a      issue under SAICM (UNEP 2012). The delegates decided to develop a workplan\u000a      for this group of chemicals, with a view of reducing health risks in\u000a      developing countries.\u000a    In summary, endocrine disrupter research at IfE has created global impact\u000a      by first making the scientific case for the need for regulatory action,\u000a      and second by developing regulatory approaches that pave the way for\u000a      restricting their use significantly. This will contribute to better health\u000a      protection. As much as 24% of human diseases and disorders globally are\u000a      estimated to be due to environmental factors, and many of the most\u000a      prevalent diseases are associated with the endocrine system. IfE\u000a      researchers have therefore catalysed the improvement of human and wildlife\u000a      health by influencing regulation that will lead to improvement in elements\u000a      of the environment that impact public and wildlife health.\u000a    For some groups of chemicals first labelled as endocrine disruptors by\u000a      IfE scientists, the strength of the incriminating evidence is such that\u000a      the use of these chemicals is no longer permitted in some countries. For\u000a      example some phthalates (identified as EDCs by Jobling) cannot be\u000a      used in toys and childcare articles in the EU and, in the USA, the\u000a      Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (2008) banned the use of six\u000a      phthalates in toys and child care articles at concentrations greater than\u000a      0.1% (Kortenkamp sits on the USA Chronic Hazard Advisory Panel on\u000a      Phthalates). In response to a European ban, plasticizers with no endocrine\u000a      disrupting properties have been developed. In 2011, the Danish government\u000a      decided to ban the use of some parabens (first identified as EDCs by Routledge)\u000a      in personal care products intended for children up to three years old as a\u000a      precautionary measure, as children might be especially vulnerable to\u000a      hormone-like effects. The Danish ban triggered a new assessment at EU\u000a      level which led in November 2011 to a recommendation by the EU's\u000a      Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) for an entire EU- wide ban\u000a      on parabens in products aimed at children under six months old. Growing\u000a      awareness about parabens has inspired a number of manufacturers to banish\u000a      them in favour of safer preservatives, while some have simply accepted a\u000a      shorter shelf life as the price of doing healthy business. You can often\u000a      find personal-care products labeled \"paraben free,\" Signers of the Compact\u000a      for Safe Cosmetics have committed to avoiding their use; the list of these\u000a      companies can be found at www.safecosmetics.org.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The burden of endocrine disease and disorders in global societies is\u000a      higher than ever before and The Institute for the Environment's (IfE)\u000a      research labelling chemicals in everyday use as endocrine disrupting\u000a      chemicals (EDCs) has been instrumental in closing a gap in chemicals\u000a      regulation that previously left pregnant mothers insufficiently protected\u000a      from exposures to endocrine disrupting chemicals that could cause\u000a      irreversible damage to their unborn life.

They were\u000a      also instrumental in identifying endocrine disruption as an issue of\u000a      environmental and public health concern.\u000a    More recent synthesis and critical analysis of the scientific literature\u000a      by IfE researchers (Kortenkamp, 2011; EEA, 2012; WHO\/UNEP 2012), as well\u000a      as original research conducted at IfE, has shown that approximately 800\u000a      chemicals in modern commerce are endocrine disrupting chemicals causing\u000a      irreversible disruption of hormonal processes in animal studies leading to\u000a      deleterious effects on health. On the strength of this work, they\u000a      subsequently synthesized accumulated scientific evidence on effects of\u000a      endocrine disrupting chemicals on human health and wildlife, with the aim\u000a      of assessing whether endocrine disrupters should be classed as substances\u000a      of a concern equivalent to carcinogens, mutagens and reproductive\u000a      toxicants. The weight of evidence linking exposure to these chemicals with\u000a      adverse effects in humans and wildlife was also assessed. This synthesis\u000a      took the form of reviews, published in several key reports.\u000a    Under the auspices of the European Commission and the Finnish EU\u000a      presidency in 2006, an international conference was held in Helsinki in\u000a      December 2006, to summarize scientific findings of regulatory relevance\u000a      produced by EU-funded projects. With organizational support from the\u000a      European Environment Agency (EEA), Professor Susan Jobling was\u000a      instrumental in finalizing the analysis, with collaborative efforts from\u000a      EEA staff (David Gee) and several coordinators of EU-funded projects,\u000a      including Professor John Sumpter. It resulted in a report,\u000a      entitled \"The Impacts of Endocrine Disrupters on Wildlife, People and\u000a      Their Environments\" (\"Weybridge+15 (1996-2011) report\", EEA 2012) which\u000a      was launched in May 2012 during a conference at Brunel University (Sumpter\u000a      was a contributor).\u000a    Between July 2011 and December 2012, Professor Andreas Kortenkamp,\u000a      Professor Susan Jobling and Dr Jayne Brian researched the\u000a      strength of evidence linking endocrine disrupting chemicals with human\u000a      health and wildlife effects by compiling and reviewing the scientific\u000a      literature published between 2002 and 2010. The analysis involved drawing\u000a      up systematic criteria for the attribution of adverse effects to an\u000a      endocrine disrupting mode of action. A concept was developed that allowed\u000a      the assessment of human health and wildlife observations in one coherent\u000a      framework. The results of this work were published as part of a World\u000a      Health Organisation \/ United Nation Environmental Programme report\u000a      entitled \"State of the science of endocrine disrupting chemicals 2012\"\u000a      (WHO\/UNEP 2013) edited by Jobling.\u000a    From July 2011 to December 2011, Professor Kortenkamp and Drs\u000a        Olwenn Martin (ECR) and Richard Evans (postdoc) assessed\u000a      scientific findings about endocrine disrupters in terms of their\u000a      regulatory relevance, in a European Union context. The suitability and\u000a      availability of tests for the identification of endocrine disrupting\u000a      properties were evaluated, in particular in terms of their ability to\u000a      cover various endocrine disrupting mechanisms. The results of this\u000a      analysis were published as \"The State of the Art Assessment of Endocrine\u000a      Disrupters\" (Kortenkamp et al. 2011). Its essence was the development of a\u000a      weight-of-evidence approach for endocrine disrupting chemicals which was\u000a      recommended as the basis for criteria to be used to designate endocrine\u000a      disrupters for regulation in the EU.\u000a    With an emphasis on chemicals that can disrupt the functioning of the\u000a      thyroid gland, Dr Daniel Pickford carried out a similar analysis\u000a      between December 2012 and March 2013. This work found entry into an\u000a      opinion of the European Food Safety Authority about endocrine active\u000a      chemicals (EFSA 2013).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17266","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The BP Institute research results have had an important impact on BP's\u000a      use of the Brightwater polymer and the way in which it has been deployed\u000a      in a number of oil fields throughout the world.\u000a    The research group's work has produced a direct impact on the design and\u000a      operation of polymer floods in two principle ways. Firstly, the improved\u000a      modelling capability now allows an assessment of the possible impact of\u000a      the polymer flood, secondly it provides a novel and effective approach for\u000a      monitoring a field during a polymer flood. This breakthrough has now been\u000a      implemented by BP.\u000a    The models and analogue experiments developed by the Cambridge BP\u000a      Institute have focused on the operation of the polymer as it flows through\u000a      a reservoir, heats up and gels. These feed directly into models for\u000a      selecting the optimal size and concentration of a slug of polymer to be\u000a      added to the injected water to optimize the diversion of the flow away\u000a      from swept zones of the reservoir in a given reservoir geology.\u000a      Presentation of the model results to BP engineers, in December 2011, June\u000a      2012 and December 2012, has informed the design of polymer floods in\u000a      specific oil fields. This new research underpins a new approach to\u000a      optimising the distribution of a given volume of the polymer in the\u000a      injected water and typically enables an additional diversion of between\u000a      several % to several 10's % of injected water into low permeability rock.\u000a      This increases oil production by several to several 10's %, which\u000a      increases the value of the production by US $ 3-30 million per well per\u000a      year. When applied to tens of oil fields, each with tens of wells, the\u000a      value of optimising the technology increases to US $300-3000 million per\u000a      year.\u000a    Prof Woods research has also led to the recognition that once the polymer\u000a      gels, there are changes in the temperature of the fluid produced from the\u000a      field. As a consequence, monitoring of well temperatures is now being used\u000a      routinely as a real-time indicator of flow behaviour in certain fields.\u000a      Such information enables real-time amendments to polymer injection to\u000a      increase the effectiveness and inform decisions about the value of\u000a      additional polymer treatment. Prior to this new approach monitoring the\u000a      gelling of the polymer and hence assessing its impact was practically\u000a      impossible. As a result of our work such monitoring can provide evidence\u000a      of successful polymer flooding, leading to decisions to use additional\u000a      polymer floods; the additional 1-10% oil production associated with this\u000a      is worth $US 3-30M per well per year. BP filed a patent for this novel\u000a      monitoring technique in 2012, with GB first filing number 1122027.4. The\u000a      content is confidential.\u000a    As well as providing reports on the research and application\u000a      developments, the research team in the BP Institute regularly interact\u000a      with the polymer flood team in BP, headed by Dr Ian Collins of BP, and\u000a      also reservoir engineers, to ensure the research is implemented and\u000a      incorporated in BP's reservoir management and engineering processes. These\u000a      meetings also ensure the research team focuses on challenges of direct\u000a      impact to the field applications. Meetings with BP reservoir engineers,\u000a      polymer chemists and enhanced oil recovery experts have been held on many\u000a      occasions, including workshops at the BP Institute of the University of\u000a      Cambridge during the months October 2009; March 2010; September 2010;\u000a      December 2011; June 2012 and December 2012.\u000a    The Advisor on Chemical Enhanced Oil Recovery, BP Exploration\u000a          Operating Ltd. will corroborate that: \"The research has\u000a        identified how the flow interacts with polymers as they gel within\u000a        porous rocks, and this is having a significant impact on the efficiency\u000a        of water floods for enhanced oil recovery, through improved modelling\u000a        capability and design of polymer treatments. In turn this is leading to\u000a        improved field recovery.\" \"In addition, the research has led to\u000a        identification of a new monitoring technique, which has been developed\u000a        by Prof Woods and which has been patented by BP\".\u000a    New results have also identified how such thermally sensitive polymers\u000a      can improve the effectiveness of heat recovery in inter-seasonal heat\u000a      storage by control of the flow fronts in complex permeable rock, and\u000a      especially to inhibit buoyancy-driven slumping of the hot injected fluid.\u000a      This enables 10's% more of the injected thermal energy to be recovered in\u000a      the early years of operation, which is a key time to help the economic\u000a      viability of aquifer thermal energy storage schemes. A typical well can\u000a      recover fluid 10-20&#176; C warmer if the dispersion is suppressed by a polymer\u000a      bank; this leads to an additional heat recovery of 2-4 GW hrs per year,\u000a      with a value of US $ 0.5-1.0 million.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Thermally sensitive polymers are injected into oil reservoirs to increase\u000a      the recovery of oil.

One major area of work involves developing a better understanding\u000a      of the factors controlling the evolution of flow in porous media; since\u000a      the late 1990's this has included the influence of thermal conditions in\u000a      oil reservoirs on enhanced oil recovery.\u000a    During the recovery of oil by injection of water, the layering or\u000a      heterogeneity of the rock causes injected water to travel at different\u000a      speeds through different layers. Water first arrives at the production\u000a      well in the more permeable zones; water subsequently injected tends to\u000a      short-circuit the remainder of the rock, preferring these high\u000a      permeability pathways. This impedes oil recovery from less permeable zones\u000a      in the reservoir which typically contain 25-75% of the oil in place, worth\u000a      US$2.5 billion in a typical 100 million barrel oil field. To recover some\u000a      of this oil, polymer additives are mixed into the injected water, thereby\u000a      blocking up the high permeability zones once they have been swept of oil;\u000a      in principle water subsequently injected will be diverted into the\u000a      remainder of the reservoir, displacing more oil. In order to control the\u000a      placement of the polymer in the reservoir, over the past ten years, BP\u000a      have developed and are now deploying a thermally sensitive polymer, known\u000a      as 'Brightwater'; this is designed to activate and viscosify within an oil\u000a      field as the temperature rises above a specific value.\u000a    In order to optimise the use of the Brightwater polymer, Professor Woods\u000a      and other researchers at Cambridge developed a research programme based on\u000a      their fundamental research into flow and heat transfer in porous media\u000a      (refs 1-6) which was carried out between 2000 and 2012. Given the high\u000a      cost of the polymer, a key issue concerns determination of the optimal\u000a      concentration and volume of polymer to maximise the sweep of oil. Since\u000a      heat exchange between the fluid and porous matrix causes the thermal\u000a      energy to migrate more slowly than fluid, the leading region of injected\u000a      fluid is heated to the reservoir temperature; near the injection well, the\u000a      rock is cooled to the injection temperature (refs 1,2). Since the density,\u000a      viscosity and reactivity of the fluid change across such thermal fronts,\u000a      the flow pattern and areal sweep of a reservoir also change (ref 3).\u000a    Since 2009, Professor Woods' work on the dynamic interaction of thermally\u000a      sensitive polymers with these thermal fronts has been built from\u000a      theoretical models and small-scale analogue experiments using PNIPAM (a\u000a      microgel) in a bead pack. The work has revealed, firstly, an instability\u000a      which arises when cold, polymer-laden injection fluid reaches the thermal\u000a      front, cools and gels, lowering the permeability; this can lead to\u000a      channelling and short-circuiting of the gel. Secondly, for a given polymer\u000a      volume, it has identified the optimal polymer distribution in the injected\u000a      water to maximise the diversion of the flow from a zone which has been\u000a      swept of oil. Professor Woods has developed a new technique to monitor the\u000a      onset of gelling of the polymer within the reservoir which enables\u000a      real-time management of the polymer flood; BP have filed a patent to\u000a      protect this invention (2012).\u000a    Members of the group working on this project and acting as co-authors on\u000a      publications have included: Professor Woods, (Cambridge 2000- present), Dr\u000a      Jupp (Cambridge 1996-2000), Dr Menand (Cambridge 2000 - 2003), Dr Nigam\u000a      (Cambridge 2000 - 2003), Raw (Cambridge 2000-2001), Verdon (Cambridge\u000a      2005-2006), Dr Rayward-Smith (Cambridge 2008-2012), Dudfield (Cambridge\u000a      2011-present)\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17271","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The main impact of this research has been to enable a multi-national oil\u000a      company (Shell) to\u000a      apply evidence-based research results to the major problem of\u000a          predicting the long-term\u000a          integrity of geological storage sites.\u000a    Our detailed and ground breaking research on the Green River site clearly\u000a      demonstrated to\u000a      Shell the value of research on a geological analogue for CO2\u000a      storage and was critical in\u000a      establishing the site's suitability for extensive investment. Shell Global\u000a      Solutions International\u000a      reallocated internal budgets to fund work on the Green River site and to\u000a      redeploy company\u000a      scientific staff to work on the project.

The work has allowed a new and improved assessment\u000a      for use in the\u000a      evaluation of risk in storage sites. In particular, the results of\u000a          the research have been used\u000a          to test and verify Shell's in-house reactive-transport modelling codes\u000a          which have\u000a          increased understanding of long-term CO2\u000a          plume migration e.g. for storage in the\u000a          Goldeneye field from the Peterhead project being assessed in the UK\u000a          North Sea as part\u000a          of the DECC-funded &#163;1 billion CCS Commercialisation Competition.\u000a    The unquantified risks of ensuring that `that the stored CO2\u000a        will be completely and\u000a        permanently contained' (DIRECTIVE 2009\/31\/EC) have been previously\u000a      cited as key obstacles\u000a      to implementation of geological carbon storage. The costs of such risks\u000a      include the significantly\u000a      enhanced insurance premiums against leakage from storage, a high cost\/low\u000a      risk event, the\u000a      costs of mitigating such leaks, as well as public opposition, engendered\u000a      by the concern that the\u000a      CO2 stores may leak.

The DECC CCS\u000a      Roadmap, 20122\u000a      lists `Improve understanding of geological seal integrity and\u000a        subsurface CO2 behaviour' as a\u000a      high priority under R&amp;D needs for storage. The APGTF Report, 20117\u000a      (Table 4) cites caprock\u000a      integrity as a high priority for immediate research. The FEED Report\u000a      (20118 ,Table 7.1.4-2),\u000a      the most authoritative assessment of a commercial storage site to date,\u000a      lists `post-closure\u000a        consent uncertainties' as risk No. 4, `adverse public reaction'\u000a      as risk No 9 and `migration of\u000a        CO2 from storage site' as risk No. 17, in\u000a      the list of the top 50 Post-FEED risks. Each of these\u000a      depend on demonstration of caprock and seal integrities. The outcomes of\u000a      the FEED report\u000a      are particularly important as this establishes that the long term risks\u000a      were one of the causes of\u000a      the failure of the first DECC &#163;1 billion CCS program.\u000a    The eventual importance of carbon capture and storage to the UK economy\u000a      has been\u000a      estimated at &#163;42 billion a year by 2050 (DECC interim report `The\u000a        potential for reducing the\u000a        costs of CCS in the UK', DECC, November 2012).

Our\u000a          work on caprock integrity is\u000a          a fundamental element in the risk assessments necessary for this\u000a          scheme to go ahead\u000a      and these new and improved methods of risk assessment and management have\u000a      been crucial\u000a      to ensuring the mitigation of potential future losses.\u000a    The Manager for CO2 Storage Technologies at\u000a        Shell Global Solutions\u000a        International will verify that \"the extensive field and\u000a        laboratory work on natural CO2 analogues\u000a        in Utah, together with an advanced process understanding, has led to the\u000a        decision by Shell\u000a        management to invest into drilling a research well into the CO2-charged\u000a        formations in Green\u000a        River\" and that the data generated \"will be used to test and\u000a        verify in-house modelling codes\"\u000a      for industrial scale CCS operation.

This led onto work, which\u000a      commenced in 2006,\u000a      on the natural CO2 system at Green River, Utah. Our work on\u000a      Green River entailed careful\u000a      documentation and interpretation of all the geological aspects that were\u000a      available for study at\u000a      the surface; these included fluids sampled from the CO2 geysers\u000a      as well as exhumed outcrop\u000a      which had previously held similar CO2 reservoirs. A key paper\u000a      on the Green River system,\u000a      published in 2009, demonstrated that it was possible to:\u000a    a) recover both the nature and rates of the fluid-mineral reactions in\u000a      the underlying CO2-\u000a      charged reservoir by sampling, analysing and modelling the fluid\u000a      compositions of cold\u000a      CO2 geysers sampled at surface;\u000a    b) show that reaction rate was critically dependent on the proximity of\u000a      the fluids to\u000a      chemical equilibrium with the reservoir minerals.\u000a    This and other work on the natural CO2 system gave the\u000a      Cambridge group an international\u000a      reputation for research on natural analogues for geological carbon\u000a      storage. Funding for our\u000a      CCS research came from a NERC national consortium CCS grant in 2005, a\u000a      Marie Curie\u000a      Training network (2006-2010) and a &#163;3.2 million NERC consortium grant\u000a      (2008-2015), led by\u000a      Cambridge.\u000a    The work was brought to the attention of Shell Global Solutions\u000a      International BV as a result\u000a      of a presentation of our research at a meeting of our Industrial\u000a      Associates Scheme in 2009\u000a      (see our impact template for information about this scheme) attended by\u000a      key company\u000a      employees. This led to their subsequent invitation to join an academic\u000a      consortium researching\u000a      geological analogues for CO2 storage. Shell recognised that\u000a      available studies of the caprocks\u000a      overlying geological CO2 reservoirs were totally inadequate for\u000a      addressing the key questions of\u000a      long-term reservoir integrity. On the basis of our earlier research, as\u000a      well as a review and a\u000a      field visit led by Cambridge, Shell chose the Utah site for a drill hole\u000a      to sample caprock.\u000a    The drilling was carried out by DOSECC, the US continental drilling\u000a      facility, and had 100%\u000a      core recovery through the critical caprock and reservoir intervals. Fluid\u000a      sampling was carried\u000a      out by Cambridge and led to the successful recovery of samples at\u000a      formation pressure\u000a      enabling the critical pH and dissolved CO2 concentration\u000a      measurements to be carried out at\u000a      pressure, the first such measurements in a drill hole to study geological\u000a      carbon storage.\u000a    Members of the group working on this project and acting as co-authors on\u000a      publications have\u000a      included: Professor Bickle, (Cambridge 1983-present and Professor of\u000a      Tectonics since 2000),\u000a      Dr Holland (Cambridge 1979-present, Reader in Petrology since 2001), Dr\u000a      Galy (Cambridge\u000a      2000-present, University Senior Lecturer since 2007), and Research\u000a      Associates Dr Chapman\u000a      (Cambridge 1984-present), Dr Becker (Cambridge 2001-2007), Dr Kampman\u000a      (Cambridge\u000a      2006-present) and Dr Dubacq (Cambridge 2010-2012).

It is important to be able to assess whether the eruption has\u000d\u000a      stopped, or has merely paused, in order for the local government to plan\u000d\u000a      development and to approve access to volcanic areas (both for domestic and\u000d\u000a      commercial purposes). A Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) was\u000d\u000a      commissioned by the UK Foreign Office to provide a risk assessment, based\u000d\u000a      on the monitoring data (between 2003 and present). There are three\u000d\u000a      criteria for recognising the end of the eruption (based on seismicity,\u000d\u000a      ground deformation and gas flux). The end of the eruption will be marked\u000d\u000a      by SO2 fluxes that are consistently less than 50 t\/d for more\u000d\u000a      than 12 months (in tandem with little or no ground deformation, and no\u000d\u000a      seismicity). Given that we believe that the SO2 flux at the\u000d\u000a      surface is a direct indicator of deep magma supply (see underpinning\u000d\u000a      research), and that it has been shown that the influx of magma at depth is\u000d\u000a      associated with only weak seismicity and ground deformation, the SO2\u000d\u000a      flux is the most important dataset for recognising the end of the eruption\u000d\u000a      (see SAC reports, particularly Report 13; www.mvo.ms).\u000d\u000a      So far, the SO2 flux has remained high, even during long\u000d\u000a      (&gt;24 months) pauses, which indicates that gas-rich magma is being\u000d\u000a      supplied at depth and that the eruption will probably resume. This\u000d\u000a      assessment allows local government to make decisions about where to build\u000d\u000a      new infrastructure (they have focussed their efforts in the north of the\u000d\u000a      island, away from volcanic areas) and whether to attempt large projects\u000d\u000a      with commercial value, which might bring in revenue but must be weighed\u000d\u000a      against the possibility of a resumption in volcanic activity, which will\u000d\u000a      bring them to a halt (e.g. geothermal power and aggregate mining, both in\u000d\u000a      volcanic areas, and both requiring dredging of the area around the jetty).\u000d\u000a    The Director of the Disaster Management Coordination Agency,\u000d\u000a      Government of Montserrat (http:\/\/dmca.gov.ms\/),\u000d\u000a      will \"provide independent assessment and corroboration of the societal\u000d\u000a        impact of the scanning spectrometer system for the measurement of\u000d\u000a        volcanic gas fluxes, developed by University of Cambridge researchers,\u000d\u000a        on the island of Montserrat in the West Indies.\" He will also\u000d\u000a      corroborate the value of the SO2 monitoring network, initiated\u000d\u000a      by this group of Cambridge scientists, for risk assessment, risk\u000d\u000a      mitigation and planning and that \"The reports of the Scientific\u000d\u000a        Advisory Committee rely heavily on these kinds of monitoring data to\u000d\u000a        produce probability-based forecasts, which are then used by the civil\u000d\u000a        authorities to make decisions on hazard mapping, exclusion zone\u000d\u000a        management, land use planning, development and investment.\"\u000d\u000a    Specific details can be found in the Reports of the Scientific\u000d\u000a        Advisory Committee, commissioned by the Foreign Office for\u000d\u000a      Government of Montserrat, Montserrat;\u000d\u000a      www.mvo.ms\/resources\/downloads.\u000d\u000a    Report 13, based on a meeting held 7-9 September 2009, executive\u000d\u000a      summary, page ii: \"...Measurements of the flux of SO2 and\u000d\u000a      deformation of the ground surface on and around the volcano have, unlike\u000d\u000a      the seismicity, shown signals as strong as ever.

This work was initially led by Pyle\u000d\u000a      and Oppenheimer and the group started to develop monitoring methods to\u000d\u000a      forecast volcanic activity in the mid 2000s. Pyle moved to Oxford in 2006\u000d\u000a      and Edmonds, who had collaborated with him in this work since the mid\u000d\u000a      1990s, was appointed to a University Lectureship at Cambridge in 2007; she\u000d\u000a      has played a vital part in the development of the instruments central to\u000d\u000a      this work and her input to the interpretation of the data as well as the\u000d\u000a      improvement and refinements of the approach have been central to the wide\u000d\u000a      application of these monitoring methods. The group's research findings\u000d\u000a      have been used to interpret the data acquired by these instruments in\u000d\u000a      order to provide Edmond's input to the Scientific Advisory Committee\u000d\u000a      commissioned by the UK Foreign Office.\u000d\u000a    The development of the scanning UV spectrometer network was underpinned\u000d\u000a      by several years of field measurements and the analysis of volcanic gases\u000d\u000a      and erupted tephra from Soufriere Hills Volcano, in Montserrat carried out\u000d\u000a      by Dr Edmonds and Cambridge co-workers. The eruption of Soufriere Hills\u000d\u000a      Volcano began in 1995 and between 1997-2001 we collected a long time\u000d\u000a      series of gas emissions data, focussing on SO2 and HCl\u000d\u000a      emissions. Microanalysis of melt inclusions in erupted tephra confirmed\u000d\u000a      that S-rich gases are generated at magma chamber depths (&gt;5 km), whilst\u000d\u000a      HCl gas is generated at much shallower levels in the system. The emission\u000d\u000a      of SO2 is strongly decoupled from magma eruption, whilst the\u000d\u000a      emission of HCl is strongly coupled. This work led to the proposal of a\u000d\u000a      degassing model, whereby deep magma generates sulphur-rich vapour, leading\u000d\u000a      to a relatively constant SO2 flux at the surface regardless of\u000d\u000a      eruptive activity; whilst HCl gas emissions are generated during magma\u000d\u000a      ascent, and often only first detected at the onset of eruptive activity.\u000d\u000a      These insights led to the recognition that SO2 flux is an\u000d\u000a      effective proxy for deep magma supply, and HCl flux a proxy for eruption\u000d\u000a      rate [see reference 1 in section 3].\u000d\u000a    During the collection of gas samples at Soufriere Hills, it became clear\u000d\u000a      that, whilst gas monitoring data were essential for hazard assessment,\u000d\u000a      there was a need to improve the methodology for data acquisition. At that\u000d\u000a      time the SO2 flux data at Montserrat were acquired by\u000d\u000a      traversing a bulky correlation spectrometer beneath the plume by boat,\u000d\u000a      which took 3-4 hours for 2-3 data points, at substantial cost. Flux\u000d\u000a      measurements were collected once per week at best and there were periods\u000d\u000a      of months where no data were collected at all.\u000d\u000a    The advent of small UV spectrometers, manufactured by Ocean Optics\u000d\u000a      (Amsterdam; www.oceanoptics.com)\u000d\u000a      and developments in the field of differential optical absorption\u000d\u000a      spectroscopy, opened up new possibilities for volcano monitoring. The new\u000d\u000a      spectrometers had low power requirements and were based on a CCD array of\u000d\u000a      the type used in digital cameras, so the instrument could be small and\u000d\u000a      portable. Edmonds and Oppenheimer recognised that, with further\u000d\u000a      development, these systems had the potential to allow the acquisition of\u000d\u000a      considerably more complete datasets than was previously possible. A\u000d\u000a      collaboration was initiated in 2000 with Bo Galle, a colleague from\u000d\u000a      Chalmers University, Sweden, to develop a scanning spectrometer system for\u000d\u000a      this purpose.\u000d\u000a    A successful field trial of the spectrometers was carried out in 2001 and\u000d\u000a      work commenced on designing, building and implementing a network of three\u000d\u000a      spectrometers, completed in its first iteration in 2003. Between 2003 and\u000d\u000a      2012, the data collected by the network has produced the most detailed\u000d\u000a      time series of volcanic SO2 emissions from any volcano,\u000d\u000a      worldwide. The dataset has been a key input to bi-annual risk\u000d\u000a        assessments by the Scientific Advisory Committee, made up of\u000d\u000a      volcanological experts, commissioned by the UK Foreign Office. The\u000d\u000a      Government of Montserrat base much of their planning decisions on the risk\u000d\u000a      assessment. Between 2003 and 2012, the automated scanning spectrometer\u000d\u000a      design was implemented at 20 volcanoes worldwide. Edmonds has been\u000d\u000a      directly involved with advising and collaborating with schemes for White\u000d\u000a      Island (New Zealand), Etna and Stromboli (Italy) and Tungaragua (Ecuador).\u000d\u000a    Members of the Cambridge group working on this project and acting as\u000d\u000a      co-authors on publications have included:\u000d\u000a      Dr Edmonds (Cambridge: 1994-2001, 2007-present), Dr Humphreys (Cambridge\u000d\u000a      2006-2010),\u000d\u000a      Dr Martin (Cambridge 2004-present), Dr Mather (Cambridge 2001-2006), Prof\u000d\u000a      Oppenheimer (Cambridge: 1993-present), Prof Pyle (Cambridge 1986-2006).\u000d\u000a    External Collaborators include:\u000d\u000a      Dr Christopher (previously at Cambridge now at University of the West\u000d\u000a      Indies), Prof A.

The major beneficiaries\u000a      have been hydrocarbon companies who explore for oil and gas in frontier,\u000a      high risk, regions such as the UK continental shelf, the Gulf of Mexico\u000a      and the South Atlantic margins. The know-how, techniques and capability\u000a      developed during this on-going research effort have helped to reduce the\u000a      geological uncertainty of a dramatically escalating financial risk. The\u000a      impact of this research has been to aid materially the decision-making\u000a      process by assessing hydrocarbon potential and by identifying promising\u000a      exploration targets. In this way, economic strategy has been firmly\u000a      coupled with scientific knowledge. With regard to BP Exploration, this\u000a      research has yielded significant financial impact in the following\u000a      deep-water regions:\u000a    (a) Beaufort Sea, offshore Alaska: two-dimensional subsidence and\u000a      crustal thinning model enabled a series of heatflow scenarios to be\u000a      tested. A major question centred on the thickness of the lithospheric\u000a      plate undergoing stretching. The success of these tests played a vital\u000a      role in helping the decision-making process for acreage access. [October &#8212;\u000a      December 2009].\u000a    (b) Brazil-Angola conjugate margins: combined modelling of data\u000a      from both margins showed that plate deformation occurred by uniform\u000a      thinning which affected thermal maturation of the sub-salt play which has\u000a      been the focus of exploration effort since Petrobras made significant\u000a      discoveries. Results have impacted exploration strategies. [May 2008 &#8212;\u000a      September 2012].\u000a    (c) Ceduna delta, offshore South Australia: two-dimensional\u000a      subsidence modelling of this margin demonstrated the existence of dynamic\u000a      drawdown which has affected in-house thermal modelling strategies and\u000a      changed play concepts. [September &#8212; December 2012].\u000a    The success of Prof. White's approach has resulted in a long-term\u000a      multi-phase collaboration with BP Exploration. Phase I of this\u000a      collaboration started in October 2006 and lasted for 5 years with funding\u000a      of &#163;350,000. Since 2008, specific projects have also been carried out\u000a      which helped BP to leverage acreage access in different countries (see 5\u000a      below). The reach of this impact has been global, affecting BP's\u000a      international operations. Individual projects typically involved the\u000a      application of Prof. White's software tools for analysis, interpretation\u000a      and modelling of seismic profiles and well-log data at the Cambridge\u000a      Department of Earth Sciences. Results were incorporated into BP's in-house\u000a      workflow and culminated in an improved understanding of structural\u000a      evolution and thermal maturation. BP themselves state that it is difficult\u000a      to assign a precise value to this work, the financial implications of\u000a      these studies have however, been substantial. Industry acreage access and\u000a      drilling decisions are typically made on the basis of person-years or\u000a      -decades of in-house technical work, incorporating impactful University\u000a      research as appropriate. Offshore exploration is expensive, with seismic\u000a      programs often costing in excess of $10 million and individual wells\u000a      frequently costing in excess of $100 million. The depth of our\u000a      contribution is demonstrated by the level of BP's engagement in formal\u000a      project meetings with the Cambridge research group; these are held twice a\u000a      year with on average around 20 BP representatives attending each meeting.\u000a      In addition more informal meetings and working relationships between BP\u000a      and Cambridge occur regularly.\u000a    The Access Manager, East Africa at BP International Limited will\u000a      corroborate that \"BP's assessment of the economic potential of a range\u000a        of frontier, high risk regions has been influenced by the research on\u000a        sedimentary basins and continental margins which has been carried out by\u000a        the group led by Dr Nicky White\" and that \"White's ideas and\u000a        insights have had impact in BP and the wider hydrocarbon industry.\u000a        White's river inversion profile tool is particularly relevant to\u000a        industry; because of the ability to predict sediment flux through time\u000a        it has added a new set of constraints in the development and refinement\u000a        of dynamic topographic models. By using this and other tools developed\u000a        in Cambridge, the group has supplied BP with modelled datasets and other\u000a        information on basins and margins which we have been actively assessing\u000a        worldwide. This work has been incorporated into the decision making\u000a        process in a number of areas globally including Alaska, Australia,\u000a        Brazil and West Africa.\"\u000a    As well as the two annual day conferences attended by BP personnel, the\u000a      fruits of this collaboration have been published and disseminated more\u000a      widely in BP in several ways:\u000a    i) by the development, at Cambridge, of an electronic atlas which was\u000a      supplied for BP's internal usage. This was initiated in 2006 and we have\u000a      continued to provide regular updates;\u000a    ii) quarterly activity reports and presentations sent to BP management;\u000a    iii) a two week field excursion to teach BP personnel the principles of\u000a      dynamic topography and basin dynamics. This hands-on learning experience\u000a      is based in western North America; White contributed to the original\u000a      design of this and to the delivery and leadership of the training on each\u000a      occasion it has been held, in September 2011, 2012 &amp; 2013.\u000a    The impact of White's work and its significance in decision-making at BP\u000a      is reinforced by:\u000a    \u000a      the comprehensive electronic atlas which was developed for use at BP\u000a        Exploration. It is \"widely used by at least 30 personnel on an\u000a          on-going basis\". This 5 terabyte atlas contains sets of digital\u000a        maps, analyses of well-log data, interpretations and models (based on\u000a        the Cambridge research) of deep-seismic reflection and wide-angle\u000a        profiles.\u000a      Multiple electronic reports on basins and margins worldwide which are\u000a        referred to by BP personnel. Typically, these reports contain a\u000a        collation of modeled datasets.\u000a      The development and implementation of a two-week-long field-based\u000a        training course within BP specifically for their personnel. A pilot\u000a        excursion was run for senior staff in September 2011. The first full\u000a        excursion was run in September 2012 and a second in 2013. It features\u000a        localities throughout Arizona, Utah and Colorado. Six quantitative\u000a        exercises were developed for evening sessions. This hands-on learning\u000a        experience was originally developed for North American personnel within\u000a        BP.\u000a    \u000a    These on-going activities have been accompanied by recruitment of &gt;12\u000a      undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral personnel from Cambridge into BP\u000a      Exploration. An important consequence has been that software packages\u000a      developed and tested at Cambridge are now routinely used by BP staff. The\u000a      success of Phase I led to setting up of Phase II in 2010 which is a 4 year\u000a      project with funding of &#163;513,167. This project generated a new set of\u000a      novel software tools for assessing the global importance of dynamic\u000a      topography produced by the convecting mantle.

His research has\u000a      concentrated on interrogating the stratigraphic record of deep-water\u000a      sedimentary basins and continental margins to develop a quantitative\u000a      understanding of their thermal evolution in time and space. The approach\u000a      of this group has been to: (i) use innovative theoretical insights to\u000a      develop associated algorithms and quantitative models; and (ii)\u000a      demonstrate their use in interpreting sub-surface seismic and\u000a      stratigraphic data.\u000a    Key steps in the development of this research are:\u000a    \u000a      The formulation in 1993, and subsequent development, of a novel\u000a        one-dimensional inversion algorithm which relates the subsidence history\u000a        of a well to the duration, timing and rate of lithospheric extension at\u000a        that location within a sedimentary basin or margin [1, see references in\u000a        section 3].\u000a      Applications of this algorithm to well data and seismic reflection\u000a        surveys in sedimentary basins to determine histories of subsidence,\u000a        uplift and deformation, and to validate geological interpretations [2].\u000a      The development in 2000 of a two-dimensional inversion algorithm to\u000a        model the history of subsidence, normal faulting and crustal thinning\u000a        along profiles across highly extended continental margins; its\u000a        application to calibrated regional seismic profiles worldwide, and\u000a        calculation of its associated consequences for thermal evolution\u000a        [3,4,5].\u000a      Development of a three-dimensional inverse algorithm to model\u000a        subsidence history, in a way which allows for, but does not require,\u000a        depth-dependent thinning of crust and lithosphere [6].\u000a    \u000a    These advances were achieved by development of the underlying\u000a      theoretical, mathematical and algorithmic insights and software tools at\u000a      Cambridge. The tools were tested on high-quality seismic and well data\u000a      made available through industrial collaborators, who are the only people\u000a      with access to data of the appropriate quality. As a result, Prof. White's\u000a      research group has had continuous and strong links with the hydrocarbon\u000a      industry for over 20 years and has continued to nurture and develop these\u000a      links throughout the period of this impact case. The closeness of this\u000a      interaction, and the resulting exchange, discussion and criticism of\u000a      insights, data and interpretations between industry and academia, spawned\u000a      many novel intellectual developments in this subject area, as well as the\u000a      articulation of problems and gaps in knowledge [e.g. 3].\u000a    The group working on this project has been led by Prof. Nicky White\u000a      (Cambridge: 1984-present Reader in Basin Analysis since 2003, Professor\u000a      from 2013) and has involved several young researchers, many acting as\u000a      co-authors on publications summarising the research outcomes.

The major beneficiaries\u000a      have been oil companies exploring for hydrocarbons in frontier areas such\u000a      as the northwest margin of Europe, the Brazilian margin of South America\u000a      and the continental margins of India. Approximately 70% of all continental\u000a      margins contain significant volcanic flows, so as oil exploration extends\u000a      into deeper waters of frontier areas the techniques discussed here have\u000a      become increasingly important.\u000a    The process by which our research has been disseminated was initially by\u000a      presentations at regular one-day meetings with the oil companies who\u000a      contributed to the iSIMM project. This gave the participating oil\u000a      companies advance knowledge of progress, and thus a commercial edge and\u000a      which some incorporated into their exploration programmes. Exchange of\u000a      personnel between companies, and the way so many expensive exploration\u000a      activities like drilling wells are often joint enterprises, means that a\u000a      6-month lead is often all they expect or need to obtain a commercial\u000a      advantage. Our results from the Faroes-Shetland Basin were used in the 3rd\u000a      Faroes Licensing Round in November 2008 at which companies bid for\u000a      exploration rights, and continue to be used by oil companies to help plan\u000a      drilling targets. The Director of the Faroese Earth and Energy\u000a      Directorate (Jar&#240;feingi) will verify \"that several\u000a      companies bidding for exploration rights have applied this approach and\u000a      these techniques continue to play an important role in the hydrocarbon\u000a      exploration effort in the Faroese region\".\u000a    The other main route of dissemination to a wider audience was through\u000a      presentations at conferences, and particularly those attended by oil\u000a      companies. These oral presentations often preceded the formal publication\u000a      in international refereed journals, which often took 12 months, and we\u000a      typically gave talks on results as fast as they became available. None of\u000a      our work was restricted from publication in any way, and we believe that\u000a      this led rapidly to its becoming widely known and used. On several\u000a      occasions oil companies (specifically Shell, Amerada Hess, Total), having\u000a      seen presentations of our results, directed the seismic contractors\u000a      acquiring data under contract to use the same parameters as we worked out\u000a      for iSIMM. Many other companies have also adopted the same principles we\u000a      developed in planning their surveys. Schlumberger\u000a      Cambridge Research will attest that this work \"motivated\u000a      clients to purchase proprietary acquisition by Schlumberger of at least\u000a      5,000 line-km of low-frequency, long-offset seismic data in the\u000a      basalt-covered regions of the Atlantic Margin\" and will provide\u000a      evidence of the impact of our work on sub-basalt imaging, the importance\u000a      of the patents taken out, and the connection with US Patent 7,961,549,\u000a      which was granted on 14 June 2011, describing low frequency data\u000a      acquisition and processing approaches for seismic acquisition in areas of\u000a      sub-salt and sub- basalt exploration.\u000a    The benefits of improved survey design were clear in subsequent surveys\u000a      shot by oil companies from 2003 onwards. Since 2008 the long-offset, low\u000a      frequency strategy is now widely used as standard in surveys on\u000a      volcanically-dominated continental shelves, and new acquisition\u000a      technologies continue to be developed to generate and record\u000a      low-frequency, broad-band data. Further advances also come in improved\u000a      methods of processing, modelling and inverting the data. This is seen\u000a      already from the fact that older seismic surveys, albeit with shorter\u000a      maximum offsets (typically only 2.4 km) have been reprocessed commercially\u000a      by oil companies to bring out the low frequency information, with\u000a      noticeable improvement in the sub-basalt image. The Exploration\u000a      Team Leader at GDF-Suez will corroborate that \"broad-spectrum\u000a      seismic sources as developed for sub-basalt imaging by the Cambridge\u000a      group and related seismic processing techniques have gone on to be\u000a      applied widely across other areas of the UK including the Central North\u000a      Sea where the additional frequency content can reduce risk on the\u000a      exploration process\" and that \"Several wildcat exploration wells\u000a      costing &#163;50M + have been drilled in areas where the sub-basalt imaging\u000a      techniques pioneered by the Cambridge group have been applied, for\u000a      example Lagavulin (217\/15-1 in 2010\/2011).\"\u000a    The precise financial value of the work is difficult to quantify but the\u000a      typical licencing costs for broadband 3D seismic surveys are now in the\u000a      range of &#163;10,000 per km2 (with a typical survey being\u000a      200-1000km2). It is estimated that over 8,000 km of\u000a      low-frequency 2D long-offset data, directly informed by the techniques we\u000a      developed, have been acquired on the northwest European continental margin\u000a      alone, with revenue of $80 million for the seismic contractors. Worldwide,\u000a      the sub-basalt imaging market is much greater with important basins\u000a      offshore South America, West Africa, Greenland and India. On land the\u000a      Siberian Traps, Karoo, Columbia River and Parana basins have major\u000a      sub-basalt prospectivity. The ability to image beneath basalts developed\u000a      by this research has led to increased industrial activity to exploit\u000a      sub-basalt oil reservoirs.\u000a    A further important benefit has been the supply of trained researchers\u000a      into industry. Many oil companies tell us that this is of equally great\u000a      importance to the research results we obtain. Three out of four postdocs\u000a      employed on this research at Cambridge University now work in the\u000a      hydrocarbon industry and are still active in sub-basalt research. This has\u000a      led to continued interaction between the industry and academics. The oil\u000a      companies and contractors have benefitted from the much longer periods of\u000a      time and more focussed effort that the academic postgraduate and\u000a      postdoctoral researchers are able to devote to a single study, free from\u000a      the commercial deadlines in a corporate setting which require industry\u000a      workers to move on to other projects. The academic research has benefitted\u000a      from access to state-of-the-art seismic acquisition systems owned by oil\u000a      company contractors, which are otherwise out of their reach.\u000a    Destinations of researchers after they left the Department of Earth\u000a      Sciences, Cambridge University: OMV; PriceWaterhouse Coopers; Universities\u000a      of Auckland, Cambridge and Durham; Dalhousie; Statoil; BP; GXT;\u000a      WesternGeco; 3DGeo; UK Civil Service (Environment).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Approximately 70% of the continental margins contain significant volcanic\u000a      flows, created when continents broke apart.

For example, drawing on his experience in academic surveys of\u000a      obtaining large offset profiles by using two ships instead of one, Prof\u000a      White designed a large two-ship experiment on the Faroes shelf which was\u000a      acquired in 1996, using well-equipped commercial vessels. Results showing\u000a      successful sub-basalt imaging were announced in October 1997 at the\u000a      prestigious 4-yearly conference on the Petroleum Geology of the NW\u000a      European shelf by the CEO of Amerada Hess. As a result of the success of\u000a      this 1996 survey, Professor White continued to refine the technique,\u000a      working with Amerada Hess to design another survey which was shot in 1998.\u000a      This recognition led in 2001 to setting up a large academic consortium\u000a      (called iSIMM, for `integrated Seismic Imaging and Modelling of Margins'),\u000a      jointly with another HEI (Prof N.J. Kusznir of Liverpool University) and\u000a      two contractor companies, Badleys and Schlumberger Cambridge Research Ltd\u000a      (SCR). This attracted 8 oil companies to sign up, WesternGeco donated &#163;1\u000a      million of ship time and processing to acquire long-offset data (12000\u000a      metre streamer) across the Faroes shelf and continental margin.\u000a    The survey parameters were designed by Dr Phil Christie (SCR) and Prof\u000a      White. In addition to a long offset streamer, they deployed 85 3-component\u000a      ocean bottom seismometers to obtain offsets out to 120 km. The source\u000a      design focussed on generating low frequencies because work, directed by\u000a      Prof White, on seismics recorded down boreholes had shown that low\u000a      frequencies were required to propagate through basalts. The actual source\u000a      wavelet was recorded in deep water using a vertical array of hydrophones\u000a      deployed for the purpose, and compared to the theoretical modelled\u000a      waveform. SCR subsequently took out a patent on an aspect of modelling the\u000a      signature from the novel source design (UK patent 2 425 838, in 2007; US\u000a      patent 7,551,515, in 2010) and another (US Patent 7,961,549, which was\u000a      granted on 14 June 2011) describing low frequency data acquisition and\u000a      processing approaches for seismic in applications of sub-salt and\u000a      sub-basalt exploration.\u000a    Much of the research was done during 2002-2010 by a team which included\u000a      several early career researchers, many of whom now work in the UK\u000a      hydrocarbon or commercial sectors (see section 5). Members of the group\u000a      working on this project and acting as co-authors on publications have\u000a      included: Professor White, (Cambridge academic staff: 1981-present),\u000a      Professor McKenzie (Cambridge academic staff 1969-2012), Dr Jon Smallwood\u000a      (Cambridge 1993-1997 and later employed by Amerada Hess), Dr Jenny Maresh\u000a      (Cambridge 2000-2004), Dr Zoe Lunnon (Cambridge 2001-2005), Dr Lindsey\u000a      Smith (Cambridge 2002-2006), Dr Alan Roberts (Cambridge 2002-2008), Dr\u000a      Jennifer Eccles (Cambridge 2004-2008), Dr Helen Lau (Cambridge 2006-2009),\u000a      Dr Moritz Fliedner (Cambridge 1997-2001), Dr Roman Spitzer (Cambridge\u000a      2002-2006).

Through close collaboration with numerical modellers\u000d\u000a      Burchard and Bolding, the results were incorporated into the General Ocean\u000d\u000a      Turbulence Model (GOTM), the vertical exchange scheme used within\u000d\u000a      the main UK and international-community oceanographic models including\u000d\u000a      GETM (General Estuarine Transport Model), POLCOMS (Proudman Oceanography\u000d\u000a      Lab Community Ocean Model), FVCOM (Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model),\u000d\u000a      SHYFEM (Shallow Water Hydrodynamic Finite Element Model) and NEMO (Nucleus\u000d\u000a      for European Modelling of the Ocean). By providing the essential test bed\u000d\u000a      for model validation, the Bangor research allowed for the first time\u000d\u000a      accurate representation of mixing processes in shelf-sea models, resulting\u000d\u000a      in significant improvements to their capacity to provide predictions for\u000d\u000a      specific policy and ocean management decisions [1].\u000d\u000a    Through the numerous applications of these models, and the ADCP\u000d\u000a      turbulence measurement techniques, this research has had direct impacts on\u000d\u000a      policy formulation, European law enforcement, off-shore renewable energy\u000d\u000a      development and the sustainable exploitation of shelf sea environments, as\u000d\u000a      evidenced by the examples provided below.\u000d\u000a    1. Economic impacts of novel Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler\u000d\u000a        applications in marine renewables industry developments\u000d\u000a    The application of ADCPs to measure turbulence, as pioneered by Rippeth\u000d\u000a      et al., has been applied widely in marine infrastructure programmes and in\u000d\u000a      particular the development of tidal energy projects, including the\u000d\u000a      world's largest tidal array (2011) currently being built in Scotland (total\u000d\u000a        cost &#163;40M). The turbulence data collected using the Bangor method\u000d\u000a      fed directly into the Environmental Impact Assessment on the effect of the\u000d\u000a      current turbines on the environment &#8212;; crucial in the authorisation of the\u000d\u000a      project [9]. The techniques are further applied by environmental survey\u000d\u000a      companies to select the optimum position for tidal energy devices for\u000d\u000a      maximised power output and minimised risk [3, 4], providing direct\u000d\u000a      economic benefits to these companies whilst helping reduce costs\u000d\u000a      for the tidal energy industry. For example the technique reported in (vii)\u000d\u000a      directly facilitates commercial surveys by Titan Environmental Surveys\u000d\u000a      Ltd, contributing significantly to its &#163;3M turnover and employment of 37\u000d\u000a      FTE members of staff [3]. Additionally, the research (ii, iv) directly\u000d\u000a      enables Partrac, one of the largest UK marine survey companies,\u000d\u000a      commissioned by (amongst others) Scottish Power Renewables, to regularly\u000d\u000a      collect water column turbulence data for commercial projects of &#163;150-350k\u000d\u000a      in value [4]. Additionally, the techniques were deployed for understanding\u000d\u000a      the distribution of matter in the ocean for Charting Progress 2; the\u000d\u000a        improved UK framework for advances towards clean, healthy, safe,\u000d\u000a        productive and biologically diverse oceans and seas [8], which\u000d\u000a      \"provides a solid foundation for policy-makers to make the strategic and\u000d\u000a      far reaching decisions needed to meet our legislative obligations and to\u000d\u000a      protect our marine resources\". The report highlights how this work\u000d\u000a      facilitated a \"major advance\" and \"has provided previously unavailable\u000d\u000a      information on how SPM (suspended particulate matter) responds to physical\u000d\u000a      processes and new data on the reasons for variations in turbidity in UK\u000d\u000a      shelf waters\" [8].\u000d\u000a    2. Economic and policy impacts through applications of the General\u000d\u000a        Ocean Turbulence Model and General Estuarine Transport Model to public\u000d\u000a        services\u000d\u000a    Models incorporating the GOTM vertical exchange scheme have been used for\u000d\u000a      a variety of applications across Europe. These include environmental\u000d\u000a      impact assessments for power plants, predictions for the sustainable\u000d\u000a      management of shelf seas and short-term forecast and warning systems.\u000d\u000a    In the UK, GETM is used, for example, by the UK Nuclear Inspectorate\u000d\u000a      for modelling thermal plumes in shallow water and has contributed to a\u000d\u000a      decision on permissions to build new marine infrastructure with a value of\u000d\u000a      &#163;10Bn [5]. Within the Defra centre, Cefas, GETM is central to the coupled\u000d\u000a      physical-biogeochemical model used to estimate carbon and nutrient flows\u000d\u000a      in shelf seas [5]. This has been instrumental in tracking the distribution\u000d\u000a      of plankton as part of the Marine Ecosystems Connections programme, which\u000d\u000a      provides essential indicators of healthy, productive and\u000d\u000a      biologically-diverse European shelf seas for compliance with international\u000d\u000a      targets for reducing rate of biodiversity loss in ecosystems susceptible\u000d\u000a      to change. Moreover GETM predictions have been used to define\u000d\u000a      ecohydrodynamic regions in UK shelf seas that underpin the application of\u000d\u000a      the UK Government Marine Strategy Framework Directive [5]. POLCOMS\u000d\u000a      has, for example, been used to develop short-term storm flood warning\u000d\u000a        systems as part of the 2008-2011 EU Program Mi-Core.\u000d\u000a    The Danish Defence Centre for Operational Oceanography (DCOO) applies\u000d\u000a      GETM for its ocean forecasts around Denmark which, for example, play a\u000d\u000a      crucial role in search and rescue activities, daily sailing forecasts and\u000d\u000a      ice forecast warnings [7]. In Germany, GETM has, for example, been used to\u000d\u000a      assess the impact of cooling plumes from new coal-fired power stations.\u000d\u000a      GETM predictions were used by German government regulatory authorities to\u000d\u000a      require alterations in cooling water discharge plans and to estimate the\u000d\u000a      potential nature and fisheries compensations. Many other examples of\u000d\u000a      applications of GETM, including direct referencing to research by Simpson\u000d\u000a      et al. at Bangor, can be found on the GETM website [6].\u000d\u000a    3. Impact on second generation ocean model applications\u000d\u000a    The vertical exchange algorithms originally tested and implemented into\u000d\u000a      GOTM (i), have now been applied to the development of new models. Although\u000d\u000a      the new models are superior in computing architecture and power, the\u000d\u000a      turbulence parameterisations underpinned by the Bangor measurements remain\u000d\u000a      central to them. In NEMO, GOTM was superseded by a generic length scale\u000d\u000a      model (GLS) in 2010, and it is used by the UK Met Office for their\u000d\u000a      short-range ocean and climate forecasting and to provide the daily coastal\u000d\u000a      seas and ecosystem forecasts. According to the Lead Scientist in the Ocean\u000d\u000a      Modelling group at the Met Office, GOTM is regarded as \"the absolute gold\u000d\u000a      standard in turbulence modelling\" [2].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    New techniques for measuring, and novel measurements of, turbulence in\u000d\u000a      continental shelf seas and estuaries, developed by Bangor University's\u000d\u000a      Turbulence and Mixing Group, have revolutionised the representation of key\u000d\u000a      vertical exchange processes within state-of-the-art numerical ocean\u000d\u000a      models. These measurements have directly improved modelling accuracy of\u000d\u000a      coastal sea mixing dynamics and the forecasts produced are directly\u000d\u000a      applied in development of government policy, marine energy technology, and\u000d\u000a      search and rescue activities in the UK (e.g. Met Office, Cefas) and Baltic\u000d\u000a      Sea regions of Europe.

For the first time in Europe, they used\u000d\u000a        free-fall shear probes in contrasting tidally energetic shelf-sea\u000d\u000a      environments to generate extensive data sets of turbulent energy\u000d\u000a      dissipation [ii, iii, vi]. These provided important reference data\u000d\u000a        sets for improved parameterisation of turbulence mixing models [i,\u000d\u000a      vi].\u000d\u000a    Since 1999, their NERC-funded research developed novel techniques for the\u000d\u000a      measurement of turbulence parameters using relatively low cost acoustic\u000d\u000a      doppler current profilers (ADCPs) from fixed moorings. The parameters\u000d\u000a      include Reynolds stresses, shear production [iii, iv] and dissipation\u000d\u000a      using a structure-function technique [vii]. They enable long\u000d\u000a        time-series measurements that were not previously possible using\u000d\u000a      shear probes on account of prohibitively high ship costs.\u000d\u000a    The group's measurements in seasonally stratified areas of the shelf revealed\u000a        that low levels of mixing in the thermocline exert a key control on\u000d\u000a        primary production, a large proportion of which occurs in the\u000d\u000a      sub-surface chlorophyll maximum (SCM). The accurate simulation of primary\u000d\u000a      production in the SCM, a key process in global biogeochemical cycles, is\u000d\u000a      therefore dependent on the improved parameterisation of turbulent mixing\u000d\u000a      within the thermocline.\u000d\u000a    The dispersion of freshwater from rivers exerts a strong influence on\u000d\u000a      water column structure and circulation in adjacent coastal seas (termed\u000d\u000a      ROFIs, Regions of Freshwater Influence). In collaboration with the\u000d\u000a      National Oceanography Centre Liverpool and numerical modeller Prof.\u000d\u000a      Burchard (Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research), the Bangor group\u000d\u000a        has provided the crucial, first and still widely used data to test and\u000d\u000a        elucidate the interaction between freshwater and stirring in\u000d\u000a      controlling stratification and flow in these regions [ii, v]. The ROFI\u000d\u000a      regime is a particularly subtle and important component of the shelf seas\u000d\u000a      where lateral gradients of salinity interact with the tidal flow, in the\u000d\u000a      process of \"tidal straining\", which produces periodic stratification and\u000d\u000a      intensifies density-driven circulation. Bangor's contribution in\u000d\u000a      unravelling this process has led to the designation of the principal\u000d\u000a        controlling parameter as the \"Simpson Number Si\",\u000d\u000a      after John Simpson. This designation is in recognition of both his\u000d\u000a      fundamental work and subsequent contribution to model development. This\u000d\u000a        work established the need for the numerical models to resolve tidal\u000d\u000a        timescales in these systems [ii, v].\u000d\u000a    Our measurements, in parallel with elucidation of the forcing mechanisms,\u000d\u000a      have provided the essential test bed for model developments [i, v, vi].\u000d\u000a      Prior to this work, there was no basis for testing and validation of\u000d\u000a      numerical models of marine turbulent processes. Our novel ADCP measurement\u000d\u000a      techniques allow for the first time reliable, long time-series\u000d\u000a      measurements of turbulence in the marine environment [iii, iv, vii].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18045","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research and collaboration undertaken by the O'Nions group at Oxford\u000d\u000a      led to the development of a new generation of MC-ICP-MS and of other mass\u000d\u000a      spectrometers. The resulting new UK company, Nu Instruments [7] saw\u000d\u000a      significant growth and sales between 2008 and 2013.\u000d\u000a    The initial collaborative venture with PAF Consultants was driven by the\u000d\u000a      research requirements of the O'Nions group at Oxford. The need for an\u000d\u000a      instrument that could simultaneously measure isotopes of many different\u000d\u000a      elements quickly and accurately resulted directly in the prototype Nu\u000d\u000a      Plasma machine, which was co-designed and built by the two organisations.\u000d\u000a      To quote the founder and director of Nu Instruments, \"Without Oxford,\u000d\u000a        Nu Instruments wouldn't exist.\" [8].\u000d\u000a    The 1997 Nu Plasma instrument had a number of completely new features\u000d\u000a      which made it attractive to those needing high-functioning mass\u000d\u000a      spectrometers in academia and industry. It was the first MC-ICP-MS that\u000d\u000a      was fully double focusing with a Nier-Johnson geometry and a laminated\u000d\u000a      magnet, and included the use of ion pumps. Critically, it made use of zoom\u000d\u000a      optics, allowing the deployment of fixed-position collectors and switching\u000d\u000a      between different elements instantaneously. These design innovations,\u000d\u000a      coupled to proof of the instruments capabilities provided by Oxford\u000d\u000a      University research, allowed Nu Instruments to flourish so that, by the\u000d\u000a      beginning of the REF impact period, they had a turnover of &#163;5.2M [9].\u000d\u000a    The design of the Nu Plasma was updated in 2007, to include modifications\u000d\u000a      that had arisen from discussion between Oxford University and Nu\u000d\u000a      researchers. For example, this generation of instrument featured\u000d\u000a      adjustable slits, allowing higher resolution measurement and the more\u000d\u000a      accurate analysis of some important stable isotope systems such as Fe, Ca,\u000d\u000a      and Si. These design improvements led to a marked increase in sales of the\u000d\u000a      Nu Plasma, from an average of 6 per year in the previous five years to an\u000d\u000a      average of 9 per year in the period 2008-2012 [9].\u000d\u000a    The Nu Plasma remains a major-selling product for Nu instruments and has\u000d\u000a      contributed to the continued success of the company since 2008. High sales\u000d\u000a      are aided by the demonstration, by Oxford University scientists, of the\u000d\u000a      successful research application of the instrument to a wide range of\u000d\u000a      isotope systems. This research also helped Nu Instruments sell the Nu\u000d\u000a      Plasma into new analytical markets beyond geochemistry (for example, the\u000d\u000a      nuclear industry; [9]).\u000d\u000a    Nu Instruments subsequently developed four further mass spectrometer\u000d\u000a      designs, two with the active involvement of Oxford University scientists.\u000d\u000a      The Astrum is a new glow-discharge mass spectrometer developed using the\u000d\u000a      expertise of Karla Newman, who initially worked for Oxford University's\u000d\u000a      Department of Earth Sciences and collaborated in several research areas\u000d\u000a      with Nu Instruments. In October 2007 she transferred to Nu to work on the\u000d\u000a      Astrum instrument, the first of which was shipped in 2010. This instrument\u000d\u000a      has enabled Nu to enter a new customer base in industrial materials\u000d\u000a      characterisation [9]. Nu Instruments have thus benefited by drawing on the\u000d\u000a      highly-specialised research and development skills of staff from Oxford\u000d\u000a      University. Oxford University staff (Belshaw) also contributed to software\u000d\u000a      development for the AttoM instrument, launched in 2005 and sold to more\u000d\u000a      than 24 customers in academia and industry during the REF period [9].\u000d\u000a      Belshaw now provides consultancy services to the company on software and\u000d\u000a      product design [10].\u000d\u000a    Between 2008 and 2012 Nu Instruments sold a total of 157 instruments\u000d\u000a      around the world (including Europe, Australasia, China and the USA).\u000d\u000a      Oxford University contributed to the development of 55% of these. Nu has\u000d\u000a      grown significantly since 2008 and has a thriving company base in Wrexham,\u000d\u000a      North Wales, as well as being serviced by offices in five countries.

The success of the company, and its importance to the\u000d\u000a      local economy, was recognized by the local MP, who selected Nu Instruments\u000d\u000a      as the best company to represent manufacturing innovation within their\u000d\u000a      constituency [11].\u000d\u000a    Aside from commercial success, the development of their products has\u000d\u000a      revolutionized inorganic mass spectrometry and enabled new discovery in a\u000d\u000a      wide range of academic and commercial disciplines. Nu Instruments has\u000d\u000a      become an internationally leading mass spectrometry company, having\u000d\u000a      started through collaboration with Oxford University, and now continuing\u000d\u000a      to benefit from research undertaken at Oxford University.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Nu Instruments is a successful mass spectrometer company set up in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with geochemists at the University of Oxford.

While powerful, this\u000d\u000a      technique is limited in the range of elements for which it can provide\u000d\u000a      precise isotope measurements, because of the difficulties of efficient\u000d\u000a      ionisation of a thermionic source. In the mid-1990s, new mass\u000d\u000a      spectrometers that combined a plasma source with multiple collectors were\u000d\u000a      developed.

Precise and rapid measurement of Pb isotopes (e.g. Belshaw et al. 1998\u000d\u000a      [1]): Lead isotopes were an established mainstay of isotope geochemistry.\u000d\u000a      This research demonstrated that the Nu MC-ICP-MS could rapidly provide\u000d\u000a      measurements at higher precision than normally possible with TIMS.\u000d\u000a    ii. Measurement of transition-metal isotopes, including Fe isotopes (e.g.\u000d\u000a      Belshaw et al. 2000 [3], Zhu et al. 2000 [4]): Isotope measurement of\u000d\u000a      these metals had been extremely challenging but was of major interest to\u000d\u000a      geochemists given the importance of these elements for earth and life\u000d\u000a      processes. This research demonstrated the success of the Nu MC-ICP-MS for\u000d\u000a      such measurement, and provided the first concrete indication of the huge\u000d\u000a      potential of these isotope systems for the earth sciences.\u000d\u000a    iii. Measurement of Ca isotopes (e.g. Halicz et al. 1999 [2]): This\u000d\u000a      research demonstrated the potential of the Nu MC-ICP-MS for analysis of\u000d\u000a      lighter elements and, in a series of subsequent papers, the utility of Ca\u000d\u000a      isotopes to investigate oceanographic and carbon cycle processes. Work in\u000d\u000a      the UoA also demonstrated the power of Nu MC-ICP-MS analysis of Li and Mg\u000d\u000a      isotopes.\u000d\u000a    iv. Measurement of U and Th isotopes (e.g. Robinson et al. 2004 [5]):\u000d\u000a      This research demonstrated the potential for the Nu MC-ICP-MS to improve\u000d\u000a      on TIMS for Th-isotope analysis, and the success of its innovative\u000d\u000a      multiple ion-counting system. MC-ICP-MS has subsequently replaced TIMS as\u000d\u000a      the major tool for U-Th geochemistry. The demonstration of successful\u000d\u000a      measurement of radionuclides also contributed to recognition by the\u000d\u000a      nuclear industry of the power of the Nu MC-ICP-MS.\u000d\u000a    Such papers also established the chemical separation methods and mass\u000d\u000a      spectrometry protocols needed for precise isotopic measurements using the\u000d\u000a      Nu MC-ICP-MS.\u000d\u000a    More recently, University of Oxford researchers have worked with Nu\u000d\u000a      instruments to improve ICP mass-spectrometry design. For example, Karla\u000d\u000a      Newman, working at Oxford with Prof. Alex Halliday (and collaborating with\u000d\u000a      Nu instruments) helped develop prototype high-sensitivity skimmers for the\u000d\u000a      Nu Plasma instrument and worked on the physics of plasma sources and\u000d\u000a      extraction (Newman et al. 2009 [6]). This research has influenced design\u000d\u000a      of new Nu Instruments products.\u000d\u000a    Names of the key researchers and positions they held at the\u000d\u000a        institution\u000d\u000a    Prof Keith O'Nions, Chair of Mineralogy, 1995 - 2000\u000d\u000a      Dr Nick Belshaw, Senior Technician, 1995 - present\u000d\u000a      Prof Gideon Henderson, Prof of Earth Sciences, 1998-present\u000d\u000a      Prof Alex Halliday, Chair of Geochemistry, 2004-2012\u000d\u000a      Dr Karla Newman, PDRA, 2006 - 2007.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18049","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research described above has shaped and influenced international\u000a      mercury policy. The combination of diverse expertise in the University of\u000a      Oxford's Department of Earth Sciences (i.e. understanding of mercury\u000a      emissions and cycling; expertise in environmental remediation; and skill\u000a      in the use of science to inform environmental policy) led to the formation\u000a      of the IKIMP initiative in October 2008. IKIMP was led by researchers in\u000a      the UoA, relying on their scientific expertise and contacts, and funded by\u000a      NERC. Its aim was to ensure that scientific evidence and expertise was\u000a      used to inform public policy relating to mercury.\u000a    In October 2008, the EU banned exports of mercury with effect from March\u000a      2011. This required that a report be submitted to the European Parliament\u000a      by January 2010, reviewing safe mercury disposal options. Defra (the lead\u000a      UK department on mercury) asked the newly-formed IKIMP to gather\u000a      scientific evidence to help inform them of UK storage options and to\u000a      communicate the UK's position to the EC during preparation of its report.\u000a      IKIMP also worked with Defra and the United Nations Environment Programme\u000a      (UNEP) as they developed a legally-binding Multilateral Environmental\u000a      Agreement (MEA) to reduce global mercury use and pollution (the Minimata\u000a      Convention). IKIMP helped develop robust policy guidance, and synthesized\u000a      science evidence, to inform negotiations at UN Intergovernmental\u000a      Negotiating Committees (INCs) leading to the Minimata Convention.\u000a    Between 2009 and 2011, IKIMP hosted three successful workshops, each\u000a      leading to the writing of influential reports on the science and policy of\u000a      mercury. These workshops built on Oxford University research, and on the\u000a      reputation and contacts of Oxford University researchers.\u000a    1. Safe Storage and Disposal of Redundant Mercury\u000a      IKIMP's October 2009 workshop was the first international event to address\u000a      the question of mercury storage following the decision to draw up a MEA.\u000a      The resulting report was delivered to Defra, who sponsored the event.\u000a      Outcomes of this workshop and report include:\u000a    - Production of a decision-making framework for the safe management of\u000a      redundant mercury in developing countries; a framework quickly adopted and\u000a      built upon by UNEP;\u000a    - Presentation of a revised strategic framework for storage and disposal\u000a      of mercury to an EC meeting in Brussels in November 2009 [8];\u000a    - Influence on the 2010 EU report on safe mercury storage;\u000a    - IKIMP's presentation of the report at UNEP's first INC on mercury in\u000a      June 2010 [9];\u000a    - UNEP implementation of two Mercury Storage Projects in South America\u000a      using IKIMP's framework for decision making, following presentation to the\u000a      UNEP Inception Workshop on Mercury Storage and Disposal in Latin America\u000a      [10].\u000a    These developments marked the beginning of pre-ratification\u000a      implementation of the Minimata Convention. A UNEP science advisor confirms\u000a      that IKIMP was, `extremely active in helping UNEP develop the decision\u000a        making framework for the long-term storage and disposal of redundant\u000a        mercury' [11]. The 2009 workshop and report drew on Holmes' science\u000a      and policy research, and were informed by the University of Oxford teams'\u000a      wider understanding of mercury behaviour in the environment.\u000a    2. Mercury arising from oil and gas production in the UK and UK\u000a        continental shelf\u000a      IKIMP co-hosted the sixth `Mercury Emissions from Coal' conference in\u000a      2009, which highlighted the lack of data on mercury releases from the oil\u000a      &amp; gas industry. IKIMP published a subsequent report in January 2012\u000a      [7] drawing together all available data on mercury emissions from the UK\u000a      oil and gas industry, and identifying a paucity of data in the public\u000a      domain. This report informed UNEP policy discussions, as confirmed by a\u000a      UNEP representative [11]: `when it comes to sources such as oil and\u000a        gas, the data are extremely limited. In fact, the report by IKIMP is\u000a        perhaps the only recent and relevant report on this subject. [It] is\u000a        used as the basis for the argument that the oil and gas sector need to\u000a        be encouraged to have greater representation during negotiations.'\u000a      The report has also been influential at national level. For example, the\u000a      Director of the Center for Ecology and Economics at the Norwegian\u000a      Institute for Air Research, has used the report, `to convince [the] oil\u000a        and gas industry in Norway and Abu Dhabi ... to arrange projects that\u000a        will help estimating the contribution of this industry to the Hg\u000a        emission budgets' [12].\u000a    3. Current understanding of the global mercury cycle: implications in\u000a        the context of reducing anthropogenic emissions\u000a      IKIMP's second major workshop (Oxford, May 2011) brought together experts\u000a      to consider natural emissions and the global mercury cycle. Discussion of\u000a      critical volcanic and marine mercury fluxes was directly informed by\u000a      University of Oxford research. Defra representatives at the meeting sought\u000a      a document outlining baseline natural emissions of mercury and their\u000a      variability, to contextualize future guidance on anthropogenic mercury\u000a      emissions. The resulting IKIMP policy-briefing document influenced a\u000a      subsequent UNEP INC on mercury. A Defra's Senior Scientific Officer\u000a      confirmed that the document, `enabled policy makers to establish\u000a        practical emission and release objectives for the UN Convention'\u000a      [13]. A UNEP representative comments that, `the IKIMP work to evaluate\u000a        emissions from natural sources [...] and exposing the knowledge gaps in\u000a        the global mercury cycle has been a valuable tool when putting global\u000a        mercury emissions into perspective' [11].\u000a    Research and knowledge exchange activities led by Oxford University have\u000a      thus led to major impacts on national and international policymakers and\u000a      regulators, including helping to shape the Minimata Convention, which was\u000a      agreed by national governments in January 2013 and represents a\u000a      significant advance in global management of mercury. Defra's Senior\u000a      Scientific Officer for Chemicals and Emerging Technologies states that, `IKIMP\u000a        has been very successful in transferring knowledge and technical\u000a        expertise to policy developers at national, European and UN levels. It\u000a        has proved an invaluable asset in a wide range of negotiations and has\u000a        certainly helped expedite the development of the Minimata Convention.'\u000a      [13]\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Mercury is extremely toxic and there is a worldwide need to limit its use\u000a      and manage redundant stocks. Diverse research in the UoA on mercury in the\u000a      environment led to a knowledge-exchange initiative: `Integrating Knowledge\u000a      to Inform Mercury Policy' (IKIMP). Since 2009, IKIMP's policy briefings\u000a      and reports have had a significant impact on mercury policy at UK,\u000a      European and global levels. The United Nations Environment Programme\u000a      (UNEP) adopted IKIMP's decision-making framework to help countries deal\u000a      with their redundant mercury.

Exposure to\u000a      mercury and its compounds has a range of serious health impacts including\u000a      brain and neurological damage, especially among young people and unborn\u000a      children. Mercury poses a particular ecological and human health risk due\u000a      to its volatility, solubility and mobility in the environment, where it\u000a      often forms organo-metallic compounds.\u000a    With an atmospheric lifetime of around a year, the impact of mercury\u000a      sources can be felt at considerable distance, making mercury pollution a\u000a      global as well as local issue. It is therefore important to know the\u000a      sources and fluxes of anthropogenic mercury emissions as accurately as\u000a      possible, and to set these in the context of the natural mercury cycle.\u000a    Research conducted in the UoA has advanced understanding of the natural\u000a      cycling of mercury, and developed microbial\/mineralogical remediation\u000a      strategies for mercury contamination. Other research, also conducted in\u000a      the UoA, has identified approaches to improve the transfer of relevant\u000a      scientific understanding into policy at an international level, and\u000a      utilised these approaches to communicate the latest research on mercury\u000a      cycling to relevant policy organisations.\u000a    Natural volcanic mercury emissions\u000a      Since 2006, University of Oxford researchers (Pyle, Mather, Witt) have\u000a      transformed the understanding of global volcanic mercury emissions. In\u000a      collaboration with the University of Palermo, they provided the first\u000a      systematic analysis of the various forms of mercury (gaseous and\u000a      particulate) in volcanic emissions, and established that Mount Etna alone\u000a      contributed &#8776;5% of all mercury emissions in the Mediterranean region\u000a      (Bagnato et al. 2007 [1]). Further research showed that the volcanic\u000a      mercury flux is ~100 t yr-1, and primarily emitted as gaseous\u000a      elemental mercury with an extended atmospheric lifetime, but may undergo\u000a      rapid reaction as it is transported, leading to local deposition and hence\u000a      affecting environmental mercury levels (Witt et al. 2008 [2]).\u000a    Marine mercury cycle\u000a      Oceanic cycling of mercury is significant, but remains poorly constrained\u000a      due to the challenges of measurement in remote marine areas. The resulting\u000a      lack of data restricts scientists' ability to predict the response of\u000a      ocean and atmospheric reservoirs to changing emissions and climate.\u000a      University of Oxford researchers, in collaboration with UEA, measured\u000a      atmospheric and aqueous mercury in remote marine environments, extending\u000a      the global data coverage of mercury measurements to the Indian Ocean for\u000a      the first time (Witt et al. 2010 [3]).\u000a    Environmental microbiology\u000a      Other Oxford researchers (Jackman, Gardner, Porcelli) investigate the\u000a      possible use of microbes for remediation of chemical pollution, including\u000a      that of mercury.

The examination of seismic waves is one of the principal\u000a      methods by which this detection can be achieved. A major component of\u000a      detection is the ability to distinguish reliably between seismic waves\u000a      generated by naturally occurring earthquakes and those from man-made\u000a      explosions &#8212; the seismic discrimination problem. A closely related\u000a      operation is \"event-screening\", the process whereby those seismic events\u000a      that can be confidently identified as earthquakes are discounted as\u000a      potential violations of the Treaty.\u000a    The forensic seismology involved in seismic discrimination is a\u000a      continually evolving field. As more, and higher-quality data become\u000a      available, scientists seek to lower the threshold at which detection of\u000a      tests can be achieved. A fundamental part of this evolution is to discover\u000a      new discrimination techniques, key among which are the determination of\u000a      depth and geographical location of the events.\u000a    The potential for applying Woodhouse's fundamental research to\u000a      improvement of source location, thereby enhancing event screening, was\u000a      recognized by Oxford University (Woodhouse) and AWE Blacknest scientists\u000a      in the early 2000s. To quote the Team Leader of Forensic Seismology at AWE\u000a      Blacknest:\u000a    \"John conducted fundamental work in the late 1990s and early 2000s to\u000a        improve observational databases and 3-D models of earth structure.\u000a        Resulting earth models enable more accurate interpretation of seismic\u000a        waveforms and, through a number of novel algorithms developed in\u000a        Woodhouse's research group, have considerable relevance for the accurate\u000a        characterisation, depth determination and location of seismic events\"\u000a      [7]\u000a    AWE Blacknest subsequently sponsored focused research at Oxford\u000a      University in the period 2003-2010, to modify the algorithms developed by\u000a      Woodhouse's group for specific use in the CTBT context. This work involved\u000a      a graduate studentship sponsored by AWE (Heyburn) and a NERC studentship\u000a      with AWE CASE support (Fox). Both students were supervised by Woodhouse\u000a      and worked closely with him. Heyburn subsequently joined AWE Blacknest as\u000a      a Junior Scientist and continues to use the algorithms developed at Oxford\u000a      University in event screening as part of AWE's work in support of the\u000a      CTBT. Fox also worked for some years at AWE following completion of his\u000a      Ph.D. He presented his joint Oxford-AWE work at several international\u000a      conferences and, together with Woodhouse, recently published the key\u000a      findings of his portion of the collaborative Oxford-AWE research on\u000a      identification of source location [6].\u000a    This collaborative work between the University of Oxford and AWE built on\u000a      the fundamental work of Woodhouse to achieve significant advances,\u000a      including:\u000a    1) A technique based on intermediate seismic surface waves to investigate\u000a      the focal mechanism and depth of shallow earthquakes [6]. This work\u000a      compares observed and theoretical amplitude spectra using state-of-the-art\u000a      methods and models for the calculation of theoretical seismograms.\u000a    2) An algorithm for constraining depth using body-wave data. The method\u000a      uses advanced signal processing techniques to detect correlated signals as\u000a      a tool for identifying depth phases and thereby constraining the depth of\u000a      a seismic event.\u000a    3) Studies of measurement and model uncertainties in seismic travel\u000a      times. The resulting method is in regular use at Blacknest for assessing\u000a      event location.\u000a    Blacknest routinely makes use of the methods developed from this research\u000a      and has done so throughout the REF period (2008-13), including the\u000a      adoption of new techniques developed from the collaborative work in\u000a      2008-2009. These methods are used for the analysis of specific events, and\u000a      to further understanding the background seismicity in areas of interest\u000a      for CBTB monitoring. A particular example was the use of research derived\u000a      from the University of Oxford to constrain uncertainties in the locations\u000a      of the North Korean explosion of 2009. Further research at Blacknest\u000a      continues to build on such University of Oxford research.\u000a    Quoting: \"...techniques developed from John's fundamental research,\u000a        have been extensively used by AWE Blacknest. They were used, for\u000a        instance, to assess the location of the 2009 Korean nuclear test and the\u000a        uncertainty on that location. These techniques help us to fulfil our UK\u000a        obligation within the CTBT &#8212; a key role of AWE Blacknest.\" [7]\u000a    The primary beneficiaries of this work are those involved in\u000a      identification of explosions which may contravene the CTBT. In the UK,\u000a      this has specific relevance to AWE Blacknest who are tasked by the MoD to\u000a      fulfil national obligations for such event screening. Given AWE\u000a      Blacknest's international leadership in the field, this work also has\u000a      wider significance for the CTBT internationally. The full benefits of the\u000a      CTBT are to world security and the limiting of radionuclide contamination\u000a      of the environment.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Comprehensive nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) is the leading tool for\u000a      minimizing the high-magnitude threats posed by nuclear weapons to the\u000a      environment and to world peace. A major impediment to monitoring\u000a      compliance with the CTBT is the difficulty of distinguishing natural\u000a      earthquakes from man-made explosions: the seismic discrimination problem.\u000a      Seismological research at Oxford University into fundamentals of\u000a      theoretical and computational seismology led to the development of new\u000a      methods and algorithms that are now integrated into discrimination for\u000a      CTBT monitoring.

Spatial variations in the wave speeds in the earth act as a\u000a      distorting lens when one seeks to image seismic earthquakes and\u000a      explosions. Armed with better knowledge of wave speed variations in the\u000a      Earth's interior, it is possible to obtain a better image of seismic\u000a      events.\u000a    Key developments in understanding the nature of the earth's interior have\u000a      come from large-scale measurement campaigns which provide seismological\u000a      data required to construct and improve earth models (e.g. Trampert and\u000a      Woodhouse, 1996 [1]). Theoretical and computational methods, pursued by\u000a      Woodhouse and collaborators, built three-dimensional models of earth\u000a      structure (e.g. Ritsema et al. 2011 [2]) from unprecedentedly large and\u000a      diverse observational datasets (e.g. Trampert and Woodhouse, 2001 [3])\u000a    In a related line of research, new methods and algorithms were developed\u000a      at the University of Oxford to assess the influence of earth structure on\u000a      received seismic waveforms, with reference to the nature of the source and\u000a      its location. For example, this work assessed the influence of the source\u000a      on received seismic waves given variable earth models (Ferreira and\u000a      Woodhouse 2006 [5]), including those produced by Woodhouse and colleagues.\u000a      It also assessed the role of upper-mantle attenuation on received wave\u000a      amplitudes, with particular reference to the nature of the seismic source\u000a      (e.g. Selby and Woodhouse 2002 [4]). This latter work was developed\u000a      further by scientists at AWE Blacknest to assess the geographical\u000a      variation of Ms magnitudes (e.g. Selby et al, 2003. Empirical path and\u000a      station corrections for surface-wave magnitude, Ms, using a global\u000a      network. Geophys. J. Int., 155, 379-390). Coupled to the improved earth\u000a      models developed by Woodhouse and collaborators, this work identified\u000a      novel approaches that could be used to more accurately locate the source\u000a      of the events generating seismic waves.\u000a    Source characterization, location, and depth determination are of high\u000a      utility in the seismic discrimination problem. Determining with confidence\u000a      that the depth of an event is greater than 10 km may be used to rule out\u000a      an anthropogenic source. Similarly, the geographical location, and good\u000a      understanding of location uncertainties, can help to define the region to\u000a      be investigated during an on-site inspection to support the CTBT.\u000a      Understanding the effect of three-dimensional earth structure on the\u000a      propagation of seismic waves can improve the capability to estimate source\u000a      mechanisms and discriminate between natural and man-made seismic sources.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18052","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of this research has been in public communication of science,\u000a      and in protection of the environment. In particular, the research\u000a      contributed to the designation of the Chengjiang fossil site as a\u000a      protected UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2012.\u000a    The 2004 book on the Chengjiang Biota (Hou et al. [2]) was an important\u000a      publication, flagging the significance of the Chengjiang site\u000a      internationally to a wide ranging readership. In the same year, Chinese\u000a      Premier Wen Jiabao issued instructions to \"protect the Chengjiang biota\u000a        as a world treasure and natural heritage of significant scientific value\"\u000a      [9] and the idea of submitting the Chengjiang fossil site for world\u000a      heritage status was first considered. In 2010, Gao Jinsong the Mayor of\u000a      Yuxi City, suggested that the central government support the nomination of\u000a      the Chengjiang biota for inclusion in the Chinese list of World Heritage\u000a      nominations; a suggestion subsequently supported by Wen Jiabao. In 2011,\u000a      Jiang Weixin, Chinese Minister of Housing and Urban-Rural Development,\u000a      nominated the Chengjiang Fossil Site to UNESCO for World Heritage status\u000a      with bid papers that included those that Derek Siveter had played a\u000a      significant part in writing.\u000a    Siveter was invited in 2010 by the Yuxi City Government to act as one of\u000a      three official scientific external consultants to help write a\u000a      World-Heritage bid for the Chengjing fossil-site [7]. He had specific\u000a      responsibility for drafting parts of the bid, including descriptions,\u000a      illustrations and statements of significance for all the major groups of\u000a      Chengjiang fossils; work that relied heavily on his previous knowledge and\u000a      research [e.g. 1-6]. He also helped draft the scientific rationale of the\u000a      bid [7]. In addition to writing parts of the bid, Siveter provided advice\u000a      to Chinese colleagues during its progress, enabling them to address\u000a      questions from UNESCO during the bid's scientific and field assessment. On\u000a      1st July 2012 the bid proved successful, and the site was\u000a      admitted to the World Heritage list at the UNESCO Ratification Meeting in\u000a      St Petersburg [10]. This success gave China its first palaeontologically\u000a      based World Heritage site.\u000a    World Heritage is the designation for places on Earth that are of\u000a      outstanding universal value to humanity and as such, have been inscribed\u000a      on the World Heritage List to be protected for future generations to\u000a      appreciate and enjoy. UNESCO states of the Chengjiang site that it \"...presents\u000a        an exceptional record of the rapid diversification of life on Earth\u000a        during the early Cambrian period, 530 million years before present. In\u000a        this geologically short interval almost all major groups of animals had\u000a        their origins. The property is a globally outstanding example of a major\u000a        stage in the history of life, representing a palaeobiological window of\u000a        great significance\" [10].\u000a    World Heritage status has benefitted the Chengjiang region. As it was\u000a      being put forward for such status, the Chengjiang site was established as\u000a      a Geopark, leading to some 3,000-5,000 people visiting the Chengjiang site\u000a      in 2009, including those from around China and overseas. UNESCO projects\u000a      that World Heritage status will lead to an increase of annual visitors to\u000a      40,000 in the next five years [10], and a new museum has been built within\u000a      the World Heritage Site, opening in 2010. In a province where tobacco\u000a      production and mining offer the only main industries, the site is\u000a      diversifying and boosting local and regional economies, with the county\u000a      town of Chengjiang and the Fuxian Lake Provincial Scenic Area providing\u000a      accommodation for the increasing number of visitors.

As the prime example, Siveter played\u000a      a fundamental role in production of a major public exhibition on the\u000a      Chengjiang biota in the Oxford University Museum of Natural History in\u000a      2010. This involved the loan, with appropriate government permission, of\u000a      some 150 excellent specimens from the Key Laboratory for Palaeobiology,\u000a      Yunnan University. The exhibition was the first time that Chengjiang\u000a      material of this quantity and importance has been exhibited outside China.\u000a      The exhibition was cited in the UNESCO World heritage application to\u000a      support the bid. The museum was visited by 304,770 people during the\u000a      period the exhibition was open (17 May - 14 November 2010), giving some\u000a      indication of numbers who will have witnessed the exhibition.\u000a    The broader world community has also benefitted. A key site for our\u000a      understanding of life on Earth and the roots of biodiversity, including\u000a      our own vertebrate origins, has been internationally recognised as having\u000a      universal value, and will be managed and protected as a consequence. If\u000a      the site had not gained such international recognition, it is probable\u000a      that its paleontological treasures would have been lost to phosphate\u000a      mining. A truly exceptional scientific resource has been maintained for\u000a      palaeobiologists, evolutionary biologists, students of the history of life\u000a      and the general public, to investigate and enjoy.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research carried out at Oxford University has helped demonstrate the\u000a      extraordinary significance of a fossil site in Yunnan Province (China) for\u000a      understanding evolution at the time of the Cambrian explosion.

Such sites of\u000a      exceptional preservation &#8212; fossil Lagerst&#228;tten &#8212; provide far more\u000a      information about the palaeobiology, evolution, and history of life on\u000a      Earth than do typical fossil sites. Even fewer of these fossil\u000a      Lagerst&#228;tten happen to represent a time of major faunal and\/or floral\u000a      change. One site that fulfills all these rare criteria is the Chengjiang\u000a      (Cambrian) Lagerst&#228;tte in Yunnan Province, China.\u000a    The lower Cambrian fossils of Chengjiang represent one of the world's\u000a      most important fossil assemblages. This &#8776;525-million-year-old marine fauna\u000a      is contributing fundamentally to our understanding of one of the most\u000a      important periods in the history of life on Earth, the Cambrian\u000a      `explosion'. This event heralded the first appearance in the fossil record\u000a      of most of the major animal groups that comprise global present-day marine\u000a      biodiversity. Especially noteworthy amongst the Chengjiang fauna is the\u000a      earliest vertebrate. The fauna also provides representation of early\u000a      animal body plans, and as a whole indicates the earliest, most complete,\u000a      animal community. Over 200 species ranging across 16 phyla have been\u000a      recognized since discovery of the fauna in 1984. They occupy, even at this\u000a      relatively early geological time, most major marine ecological niches, and\u000a      represent a wide range of feeding types, indicating an elaborate\u000a      ecosystem. The majority of the species are known only from the Chengjiang\u000a      biota.\u000a    Important research on the Chengjiang Lagerst&#228;tte has been conducted by\u000a      Professor Derek Siveter at Oxford University's Department of Earth\u000a      Sciences and Museum of Natural History. He has formed part of a small team\u000a      of UK palaeobiologists (with two other scientists from Leicester\u000a      University) who have researched the Chengjiang biota together with the\u000a      discoverer of the Lagerst&#228;tte, Professor Hou Xianguang (Director of the\u000a      Yunnan Key Laboratory for Palaeobiology, Yunnan University, Kunming,\u000a      China).\u000a    This research has resulted in a series of high-profile publications in\u000a      peer-reviewed journals. These publications have added to the fossil\u000a      database and outlined the evolutionary and ecological significance of\u000a      various parts of the Chengjiang fauna. They include an investigation of\u000a      the morphology and phylogenetic position of the earliest vertebrates (Hou\u000a      et al. 2002 [1]) and the description of soft-part morphology and affinity\u000a      of bivalve (bradoriid) crustaceans (Hou et al. 2010 [3]). They also\u000a      identified very early collective behaviour in arthropods (Hou et al. 2008,\u000a      2009 [4-5]) and reported the discovery of an important early-Cambrian\u000a      hemichordate zooid (Hou et al. 2011 [6]).\u000a    Siveter's research also contributed to a book, which he coauthored; \"The\u000a      Cambrian fossils of Chengjiang, China\" (Hou et al. 2004 [2]) published by\u000a      Blackwells Scientific. This book presents a wide range of research and\u000a      illustration providing full details of the fauna and flora of Chengjiang.\u000a      It has received more than 200 citations in the research literature, and a\u000a      second edition is now in preparation.\u000a    The detailed paleontological research conducted on the Chengjiang\u000a      Lagerst&#228;tte has provided important advances in our knowledge of the\u000a      evolution of life at the time of the Cambrian explosion, and has firmly\u000a      outlined the critical significance of the Chengjiang biota.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18948","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"226074","Name":"Uganda"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The LECHe project narrative\u000a    The importance of \"lived experience\" as experiential meaning framed within\u000a    specific cultural and environmental contexts evolved from two\u000a    conference\/workshops held in Uganda in 2004 and 2006 (Conference Report,\u000a    2006) between academics and NGO development practitioners. This led to a\u000a    joint Sustainable Development Network for OU academics and MSc Management\u000a    Masters alumni Sub-Saharan Africa to which U0A7 (Prof Abbott) was invited to\u000a    join. Simultaneously, UOA7 was invited to explore how formal education\u000a    reflects on development practice at a \"grassroots\" level in a consultancy to\u000a    analyse some 60 MSc projects. These were written mostly by world-wide\u000a    practitioners from NGOs, public and private services who had studied OU MSc\u000a    Development Management courses resulting in an important paper \"Development\u000a      management as a reflexive practice\" (D. Abbott, S. Brown and Wilson,\u000a    G. 2006).\u000a    It became increasingly clear that there was much knowledge value in\u000a      academic and practitioner partnerships from multidisciplinary fields,\u000a      evident in the production of a seminal collection of targeted papers , Environment,\u000a        development and sustainability: perspectives and cases from around the\u000a        world (2009). A key feature is the book's diverse authorship,\u000a      spanning 12 countries, and bringing together 33 social and \"pure\"\u000a      scientists and practitioners in one volume &#8212; thus unifying an\u000a      epistemological narrative drawing on cultural and disciplinary diversity,\u000a      and expanding the concept of interdisciplinarity by demonstrating the\u000a      validity of practitioner and academic partnerships.\u000a    These partnerships further revealed the importance of \"lived\"\u000a      experiential meanings of climate change. For instance, NGOs such as Food\u000a        for the Hungry working in the various conflict and food insecure\u000a      regions in the Pader region of Northern Uganda, reported that climate\u000a      chaos and unpredictable events had exacerbated hunger crisis to increasing\u000a      hunger to the point of desperation to which the poor could only respond\u000a      through their \"lived experiences\" (which were also \"lay rationalities\".\u000a      Arguably, the rich do the same (e.g. no wind turbines in my back yard!)\u000a      (See also Abbott 2009). It is therefore \"lay rationalities\" (rather than\u000a      scientific ones) that give credence to policy legitimisation and changes\u000a      in citizenery behaviour, poor or rich. Yet, practitioners needed to\u000a      articulate the needs of the poor to a global forum but they lacked\u000a      capacity and educational opportunities to build academic knowledge,\u000a      especially in developing countries.\u000a    The arguments for (i) the recognition of experiential knowledge in\u000a      meeting global policy challenges, and (ii) OERs that could reach\u000a      practitioners and world universities easily were presented to the European\u000a      Association of Distance Teaching Universities (EADTU) Task Force on\u000a      Sustainable Development for innovative pathway for teaching and research\u000a      by Prof Wilson (OU) in 2008, leading to successful funding by the EU.\u000a      Derby UOA7 actively contributed to all above aspects.\u000a    The significance and reach beyond academia\u000a      The project ended only a year ago (2011) and as yet it is in its infancy.\u000a      Its reach has to be understood within that context. A mix of dissemination\u000a      and exploitation strategies have been utilised to extend reach beyond\u000a      academia, references and links to which are identified in the section\u000a      below. For instance\u000a    \u000a      14 representatives from European Regional Centres of Expertise (RCEs)\u000a        with policy remits on climate and environmental change, together with\u000a        NGO representatives accepted invitations to participate in a joint month\u000a        long e-forum with project academics and pilot students (June-August\u000a        2011) Through collaborative group work in e-forums, they created a joint\u000a        briefing paper on the importance of \"lived experience\" of climate change\u000a        for informing policy (VCSE link).\u000a      March 2012 a policy workshop was held at the European Commission in\u000a        Brussels and attracted significant interest from policy makers within\u000a        the EU Erasmus Programme and a wider group of higher education\u000a        institutions who are concerned with the creation of OER,\u000a        operationalizing virtual mobility and linking virtual mobility to\u000a        transboundary competence (Public report of project link).\u000a      Use by practitioners (who were also students) in their work of skills,\u000a        knowledge and understanding at were developed in the pilot. One\u000a        commented explicitly in the evaluation of the pilot: `Skills such as\u000a        creating a CBA [cost benefit analysis] and writing an EU report [were]\u000a        really excellent and something I can transfer into my working life.'(VCSE\u000a          link- evaluation forum).\u000a      Production of a video about the project by Universidad Aberta for a\u000a        national television audience which clearly indicates a reach to policy\u000a        makers and citizenry (Promotional video link).\u000a      Currently the workpackage developed by UOA7 (Prof Abbott) on\u000a        interdisciplinary methodology is being used by 42 institutions of higher\u000a        education and practitioner agencies (Google scholar link).\u000a      The LECH-e project has been nominated for an award by the Spanish\u000a        National Education for the best OERs through public voting (Universia\u000a          Foundation link).\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Lived experiences of ordinary people and how they rationalise events\u000a      provides rich insights for several disciplines e.g. medicine.

It became\u000a      increasingly evident that whilst ordinary people take some note of\u000a      scientific analysis of climate change, both in the global South and the\u000a      North, it is their own \"lived experiences\" that shape how they rationalise\u000a      climate change and respond to it. Many in the South who live in poverty,\u000a      rely on subsistence cropping, for instance, are likely to tap into\u000a      existing indigenous knowledge that is not underpinned by academia. Equally\u000a      in the North, whilst there may be recognition of wider climate change\u000a      events, people may not be so keen to make changes that impinge \"in their\u000a      backyard\". It is therefore critical to recognise the \"lived experiences\"\u000a      of a diverse global citizenry and how this influences the lay\u000a      rationalities which influence behaviour and action around of climate\u000a      change.\u000a    A successful application for funding (October 2009- October 2011) to\u000a      develop the concept and theory of \"lived experiences of climate change\"\u000a      was developed through a collaborative partnership between eight EU\u000a      universities and the European Association of Distance Teaching\u000a      Universities. The project created a climate change postgraduate curriculum\u000a      (LECH-e) which would allow a global reach through virtual learning\u000a      communities aiming to (a) contribute to an informed, active European\u000a      citizenry and the United Nations Decade on Education for Sustainable\u000a      Development; and (b) inform European Union policy. As \"climate change\"\u000a      cannot be reduced to a singular disciplinary understanding, LECH-e drew on\u000a      different disciplinary strands including physics, chemistry, economics,\u000a      political sciences, sociology, engineering, natural resource management\u000a      and development geography. It also ensured that both academics and\u000a      practitioners were involved in the production of Open Resources for\u000a      virtual communities across the world as well as research publications that\u000a      arose from it (see http:\/\/www.leperiodche.open.ac.uk\/people).\u000a    Critical insights from the above and research publications that followed\u000a      are about the importance of knowledge diversity and public legitimacy\u000a      including:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aKnowledge diversity with respect to climate change is a key\u000a          resource for effective policy and practice: It is important to\u000a        cross cultural, methodological and subject boundaries for multi-level\u000a        analysis and transboundary competences to create inclusive, effective\u000a        policy and practice.\u000a      That the knowledge created by both natural and social scientists is\u000a        necessary but insufficient. The ways in which public throughout the\u000a          world engage with scientific knowledge about climate change is through\u000a          experiential \"lived experiences\" (a very under researched area).\u000a      \u000aKnowledge derived from \"lived experiences\" is instrumental in\u000a          public legitimacy for climate change policy and action.\u000a      \u000aClimate change knowledge therefore requires new methodological\u000a          approaches as a synthesis of scientific understanding and \"lived\u000a        experience\".\u000a    \u000a    This necessitates innovative approaches to draw out experiences of\u000a        people framed around citizenry participation through virtual\u000a      interaction and virtual communities.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"19107","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The work with the USGS described above is ongoing and contributing to the\u000a      Pliocene Data Intercomparison Project, a recently established theme\u000a      (complementing a Model Intercomparison Project) within the Pliocene\u000a      Research, Interpretation and Synoptic Mapping (PRISM) project, centred in\u000a      the USGS. For the last 20+ years PRISM scientists have been engaged in\u000a      compiling successive generations of a worldwide proxy database of Pliocene\u000a      environmental conditions, particularly surface temperature. This has been\u000a      used in both the construction and testing of numerical climate models for\u000a      the Pliocene, and is featured in Assessment Report 5 (draft, 2013) of the\u000a      Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change because of its relevance to\u000a      prediction of future climate. PRISM work cited in AR5 (e.g. Dowsett et\u000a        al. 2012, Nature Climate Change 2, 365-371) makes reference\u000a      to the mollusc-based technique developed under Johnson's direction at\u000a      Derby. The high-resolution data obtained through it have contributed to a\u000a      `paradigm shift' in the PRISM approach to climate reconstruction (ref. 6\u000a      above), whereby attention will be given to fluctuations in climate (at\u000a      various timescales) within the context of the generally warm Pliocene\u000a      world. This will enable refinement and more rigorous testing of models,\u000a      ultimately leading to increased accuracy in predictions of future climate.\u000a      The leader of the PRISM group, Dr H.J. Dowsett, has supplied a letter\u000a      (submitted alongside this) confirming the contribution of Johnson and his\u000a      team to PRISM research featured in AR5 and to planned work for AR6.\u000a    As well as feeding into international research and policy development, the\u000a    work at Derby described above has had more general impact in that it has\u000a    figured in TV and radio broadcasts, YouTube videos, lectures and an exhibit\u000a    dealing with climate change in general. In these the emphasis has been on\u000a    demonstrating to a lay audience the existence of past climate change and\u000a    scope for accurate documentation of it. Initial interest was in many cases\u000a    created by the `green' methods of travel used by Johnson for research. Two\u000a    lengthy research visits (summer 2007 and summer 2011) to the USA exclusively\u000a    involved travel by container ship, train and bicycle in order to avoid the\u000a    large carbon-footprint associated with conventional plane and car travel.\u000a    The first of these led to invitations to appear on BBC Radio Derby\u000a    (03\/04\/2008) and BBC TV East Midlands (27\/05\/2008), the creation of two\u000a    YouTube videos (Container\u000a      ship &#8212; 60 Seconds of Science and Green\u000a      travel: 1339 and 758 `hits', respectively, by 06\/11\/2013) and\u000a    (05\/03\/2008) and Derby Cycle Touring Club (11\/03\/2008).

Studies of regional\u000a      mid-Pliocene climate can therefore potentially provide accurate insights\u000a      into future climate of the areas concerned in circumstances of similarly\u000a      elevated global temperature, as predicted for the end of the present\u000a      century. The main finding of the UoA, derived from stable-isotope and\u000a      microgrowth-increment studies of bivalve molluscs, is that over at least\u000a      significant parts of the mid-Pliocene interval winter temperatures in the\u000a      North Sea area were little different from now. This does not agree with\u000a      outputs from numerical climate models for the mid-Pliocene North Sea and\u000a      therefore calls into question the accuracy of regional temperature\u000a      predictions for the end of the present century made using the same models.\u000a    Doctoral research at Derby from 1994-1997 by Jonathan Hickson, under the\u000a      supervision of Andrew Johnson, established that modern examples of the\u000a      marine bivalve Aequipecten opercularis faithfully record a signal\u000a      of ambient water temperature in the oxygen stable-isotopic composition of\u000a      their shells. Serial sampling through the shell was shown to provide an\u000a      accurate profile of seasonal temperature variation through the lifetime of\u000a      the organism (ref. 1 below). Subsequent investigations by Johnson and\u000a      Hickson, whilst the latter was employed in a temporary lecturing capacity\u000a      at Derby, yielded cool winter temperatures (similar to now) from\u000a      mid-Pliocene examples of A. opercularis collected in eastern\u000a      England (ref. 2), contrary to other estimates (mostly much warmer) for the\u000a      area based on other proxies (mainly the composition of biotic assemblages)\u000a      and on numerical modelling. Initially, it was suspected that the low\u000a      temperatures were erroneous: a possible reflection of chemical alteration\u000a      of the shells. However, work conducted in 2008 by Johnson in collaboration\u000a      with a research assistant, Annemarie Bird (now Valentine), and adding\u000a      study of microgrowth increments to stable-isotope investigations, showed\u000a      that the shells were unaltered and the temperature results valid (ref. 3).\u000a      As well as confirming cool winter temperatures the study indicated that\u000a      summer surface temperatures were elevated above present. An isotopic\u000a      investigation of another bivalve species (Arctica islandica) from\u000a      the mid-Pliocene of eastern England, conducted in collaboration with Prof.\u000a      Bernd Sch&#246;ne (University of Mainz) in 2005, provided results similar to\u000a      those from A. opercularis (ref. 3). As a doctoral student\u000a      supervised by Johnson, Valentine has obtained isotopic evidence of similar\u000a      winter temperatures to now, and elevated summer surface temperatures, from\u000a      bivalves of the Belgian and Dutch mid-Pliocene, confirming the generality\u000a      of such conditions in the North Sea area (ref. 4). Bivalve-based isotopic\u000a      (and growth-increment) work on mid-Pliocene climate has also been carried\u000a      out by the UoA in collaboration with colleagues at the University of\u000a      Leicester (material from Antarctica; ref. 5), United States Geological\u000a      Survey (material from the US Atlantic Coastal Plain) and, in almost all\u000a      the above cases, the NERC Isotope Geosciences Laboratory. An important\u000a      result from work conducted in collaboration with the USGS is that\u000a      isotopically determined winter temperatures from a Pliocene unit in\u000a      Virginia and North Carolina, equivalent in age to that studied in England,\u000a      are no warmer than those recorded on the US eastern seaboard now. This\u000a      probably reflects reduced Gulf Stream heat transport and therefore affords\u000a      an explanation for the similar winter temperatures to now in the North Sea\u000a      region (an area influenced by Atlantic heat supply), alongside warmer\u000a      summer conditions.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"20048","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The TRG has been active since 1992.

TRG research outputs were incorporated into workflows for appraisal\u000a      and development of\u000a      the Britannia Field by Britannia Operator Ltd (BOL: jointly owned by\u000a      ConocoPhillips and\u000a      Chevron). Reservoir complexity and potential reservoir variability away\u000a      from well control\u000a      have been key issues on Britannia, accounting for significant volumetric\u000a      uncertainty and\u000a      representing the primary risk for new drilling opportunities. TRG research\u000a      [5] led to a new\u000a      model for the spatial variation of rheology within the particulate\u000a      sediment gravity flows\u000a      responsible for depositing the main reservoir interval, which directly\u000a      impacted predictions\u000a      of spatial variation in primary rock quality. These anticipated variations\u000a      were explicitly\u000a      incorporated into the reservoir model rebuild, providing a more robust\u000a      depositional\u000a      framework upon which to base new well prognoses. New well locations have\u000a      been\u000a      planned under the guidance of this improved depositional framework.\u000a      Because infill wells\u000a      cost upwards of $20M each, the decision to sanction each new one is\u000a      significant.\u000a      Significant new reserves were booked as a result of this programme. To\u000a      date,\u000a      subsequent drilling has corroborated the revised depositional framework in\u000a      the upper\u000a      reservoir intervals. TRG research also [6] led to a reassessment\u000a      of the significance of\u000a      debris flow deposits interleaved with sand beds in the lower Britannia\u000a      reservoir intervals\u000a      and a greater appreciation of the potential role of large-scale\u000a      remobilisation processes.\u000a      To this end, revisions to the existing correlation scheme were made and\u000a      incorporated into\u000a      the subsequent reservoir model updates for the Britannia field. These\u000a      changes represent\u000a      a significantly improved representation of the field's depositional\u000a      architecture, and have\u000a      aided its profitability [A].\u000a    ii. Research results from the TRG field programme [1,2] played a\u000a      key role in the sanction\u000a      decision and modelling of the BG-operated Blake Field. TRG provided a\u000a      field workshop\u000a      for the asset team, and company geologists used TRG field data to gain\u000a      management\u000a      support for the geological model and sanction development. Sanction\u000a      involves the\u000a      decision to go forward and develop a discovery for production - an\u000a      investment of\u000a      hundreds of millions of dollars. The Blake Field has subsequently been a\u000a      production\u000a      success [B]. Additional consultancy work was focused on building a\u000a      model to justify\u000a      extension drilling in the field \"Blake Flank\" (2005-present). The key\u000a      insights were based\u000a      upon the constraint of excisional channel geometries, the anisotropy of\u000a      the depositional\u000a      elements comprising the channel fill and the nature of the contacts\u000a      between the channel\u000a      fill and substrate sheet-form sandstones into which the channel incised.\u000a    iii. The TRG was commissioned to review two cores taken from an oil field\u000a      off Australia and\u000a      investigate the impacts of any revision in interpretation upon the\u000a      inherited model\u000a      (deposition in a relatively small sandy turbidite fan). The TRG core\u000a      review, drawing upon\u000a      underpinning research [4, 6] resulted in two new insights into the\u000a      sedimentology of the\u000a      field, which contributed to a re-interpretation of the depositional model\u000a      in terms of a\u000a      hybrid-event-prone fan. The revised depositional model raised concerns\u000a      regarding the\u000a      abundance and continuity of net pay within the reservoir. TRG insights\u000a      contributed to the\u000a      operator's internal assessment, which culminated in the proposal of a\u000a      single well\u000a      development plan focusing only on the gas contained in the field. Given\u000a      the improved\u000a      geological understanding of the field, appraisal was not seen as a viable\u000a      economic option\u000a      and development was only considered feasible in the context of the\u000a      operator's other\u000a      close-by assets and infrastructure. The TRG's work thereby contributed to\u000a      making multi-million dollar decisions such as avoiding the costs of\u000a      drilling an additional appraisal well\u000a      and, potentially, of committing to an uneconomic oil development [C].\u000a    Approach to following through on impact:\u000a    The TRG business model entails the development of research and\u000a      consultancy, and the\u000a      provision of bespoke databases that allow structured access to the\u000a      literature and to\u000a      metadata on sedimentary architecture. Sponsors have joined and re-joined\u000a      the TRG\u000a      because of their perceived benefits in each of these categories. TRG\u000a      outputs are\u000a      delivered via a KE-oriented website, described by sponsors as\u000a      industry-leading through\u000a      its impact on key workers. This model has been cloned to develop three new\u000a      industry-facing research groups at the University of Leeds; the Fluvial\u000a      Research Group (FRG), the\u000a      Shallow Marine Research Group (SMRG), and the Basin Structure Group (BSG).\u000a      The\u000a      effectiveness of this cloning in widening research impact is illustrated\u000a      by the level of\u000a      company support for these new ventures; the FRG is now in its second\u000a      three-year phase,\u000a      currently with seven sponsor companies, and the SMRG and the BSG have just\u000a      launched, with one and four sponsor companies, respectively.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    University of Leeds Research has been used by its specialist Turbidites\u000a      Research Group (TRG) to\u000a      underpin consultancy work for oil companies that has, in turn, steered\u000a      them to make high-value\u000a      decisions. Examples include an oil well placement, the development of an\u000a      oil field, and a decision\u000a      to only partially develop another.

Gas and oil\u000a      can be found in such marine sedimentary systems, and improved\u000a      understanding of the processes\u000a      involved in deposition leads to a better capacity to characterise and\u000a      predict the properties of gas\u000a      and oil reservoirs, which is of critical economic benefit to the oil\u000a      industry.\u000a    The presence of channels in sedimentary systems has an important bearing\u000a      on the architecture of\u000a      the system and on reservoir characteristics. To obtain insights into the\u000a      formation of these\u000a      submarine channels and to be able to predict the patterns of sediment\u000a      deposition within and\u000a      around them, McCaffrey led field research into sedimentary rock\u000a      channel formations in the French\u000a      Alps as an analogous system [1, 2]. The research has resulted in\u000a      improved understanding of\u000a      processes such as channel incision, infill dynamics and other\u000a      characteristics that can be applied to\u000a      deep marine environments, and led British Gas (BG) to part-fund the work\u000a      of Rufus Brunt (PhD\u000a      student, University of Leeds 2000-2003)\u000a    In 2003, McCaffrey and collaborators from University College\u000a      Dublin were the first to recognise a\u000a      previously unknown type of deposit, the hybrid event bed phenomenon [3].\u000a      This type of sediment\u000a      deposition gives rise to a range of sandstone architectures, which in turn\u000a      affect the potential oil- or\u000a      gas-bearing properties of the rock. This model of hybrid sediment flow was\u000a      subsequently\u000a      integrated with other models and refined by McCaffrey and\u000a      co-workers in 2009 [4] to create a\u000a      generic model of hybrid sediment gravity flow deposits that can be used to\u000a      predict sediment\u000a      architectures - and hence reservoir characteristics - in a wide range of\u000a      settings.\u000a    In 2008, the TRG developed new models to account for patterns of\u000a      deposition in sedimentary\u000a      systems, providing key insights into the observed sandstone architectures\u000a      and their spatial\u000a      distribution [5]. In this work, co-authored by McCaffrey\u000a      with collaborators from University College\u000a      Dublin and industry, sedimentological analysis of Britannia core showed\u000a      that spatial variability in\u000a      the depositing particulate gravity currents produced corresponding spatial\u000a      variability in the\u000a      deposited reservoir sandstones in a way that was predictable and which\u000a      could be exploited.\u000a    Between 2006 and 2009, new research led by McCaffrey has led to\u000a      the finding that large scale\u000a      slope failure could leave behind a newly defined \"evacuated\" bathymetric\u000a      morphotype [6]. This\u000a      bathymetry can be shown to control the location and orientation of the\u000a      elongated sandstones\u000a      comprising the middle part of the Britannia reservoir.

Its cofounders (Ogden and McEwing) went on to\u000d\u000a      establish the NGO TRACE Wildlife Forensics Network in 2007. Through\u000d\u000a      expansion of the TRACE Network, and in association with Bangor University,\u000d\u000a      its Programme Director, Ogden, has applied the outcomes of the Bangor\u000d\u000a      research (3.1-3.3) in major international wildlife forensics initiatives\u000d\u000a      that have been instrumental in expanding this pioneering field and in improving\u000a        the effectiveness of the enforcement of wildlife crime law. For\u000d\u000a      example, DNA-based sexing markers developed at Bangor (3.3) are being used\u000d\u000a      for identification of poached rhino carcasses in South Africa and are\u000d\u000a      incorporated in the Rhino DNA Index System (RhODIS): a database where,\u000d\u000a      since 2011, DNA profiles for all South African rhinos are being\u000d\u000a      accumulated. In its first year, over 5000 rhinos had been profiled and\u000d\u000a      1900 test kits including the Bangor markers were distributed as part of\u000d\u000a      the programme to halt poaching.2 These markers are also\u000d\u000a      included in the Scottish database launched in April 2013, that aims to\u000d\u000a      include every rhino (artefact) at Britain's zoos and museums to counter\u000d\u000a      the growing criminal threat of these horns being stolen for the black\u000d\u000a      market through increased risk of detection and successful prosecution2.\u000d\u000a    Additionally, global organisations such as the Royal Society for the\u000d\u000a      Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Partnership for Action against\u000d\u000a      Wildlife crime (PAW) use the research in prosecutions against wildlife\u000d\u000a      crimes such as poaching and illegal trade1,10. Bangor research\u000d\u000a      on birds of prey in particular (3.1) has been fundamental for the Animal\u000d\u000a      Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA), in prosecutions\u000d\u000a        linked to the illegal capture and breeding of endangered birds and\u000d\u000a      investigations on the legitimacy of ownership of birds of prey in the UK.\u000d\u000a      Between 2009 and 2012, the work has led directly to two convictions (2009,\u000d\u000a      2010)10, and 220 samples have been analysed in so-called\u000d\u000a      compliance cases that did not proceed to court. Of these, 61 were from two\u000d\u000a      interlinked cases but a total of 39 keepers had birds tested, with a\u000d\u000a        well-recognised deterrent effect on illegal trade. The Bangor method\u000d\u000a      was chosen because of the quality of the markers, ease of use and\u000d\u000a      transparency and the DNA analyses were crucial in determining the\u000d\u000a      legitimacy of ownership of the birds. The method (3.1) has further been\u000d\u000a      used to develop tests for golden eagle, peregrine falcon, merlin, goshawk,\u000d\u000a      barn owl, common buzzard and palm cockatoo: advances which further empower\u000d\u000a      restriction of the illegal bird trade1.\u000d\u000a    Impacts on IUU regulation and sustainable fisheries management\u000d\u000a      The traceability tools created by the FishPopTrace (FPT) research have directly\u000a        impacted international stock management of fisheries. The Marine\u000d\u000a      Stewardship Council (MSC) uses the regional identifiers for Atlantic\u000d\u000a        cod (Gadus morhua) developed by FPT to provide assurance\u000d\u000a        that MSC-certified products are correctly labelled, and to identify\u000d\u000a      any areas of concern in the supply chain9. In 2012, 86 products\u000d\u000a      were tested using the FPT identifiers, verifying correct labelling of 99%\u000d\u000a      of MSC-labelled cod. Furthermore, the DNA testing program also helps to\u000d\u000a      deter MSC-certified companies from mislabelling products, which lowers\u000d\u000a        the likelihood of fraud in the supply chain. The MSC will continue\u000d\u000a      to carry out an annual DNA testing program using the FPT markers and is\u000d\u000a      collaborating with TRACE (since 2011) to expand the range of tests.9\u000d\u000a      Further evidence for the importance of the Bangor work for MSC efforts on\u000d\u000a      sustainable fishing, comes from their recent (2013) appointment of\u000d\u000a      Carvalho as an independent advisor on DNA testing in relation to fisheries\u000d\u000a      certification.\u000d\u000a    Key mechanisms by which FPT has had constructive, political impact on\u000d\u000a        individual member states decision-making to apply novel technologies to\u000d\u000a        fisheries regulations are through the provision of data,\u000d\u000a      information, and dissemination of infrastructure directly resulting from\u000d\u000a      the FPT proceedings. For example, in April 2012, the UK Government\u000d\u000a      launched a novel Defra-funded programme to implement the use of FPT\u000d\u000a      research outputs to improve fish traceability in UK stocks of four\u000d\u000a      economic priority fish species (Geographic traceability tools for\u000d\u000a      commercial fish and fish products - FA0118). The programme transfers the\u000d\u000a      FPT novel forensic DNA marker systems directly to stocks relevant to\u000d\u000a      government, industry stakeholders and non-governmental organisations in\u000d\u000a      the UK, enabling self-regulation, monitoring and enforcement of the\u000d\u000a      fishing industry at a scale not previously possible.\u000d\u000a    Impacts on EU Council regulations through the FishPopTrace project\u000d\u000a      In line with its commitment to engage with policy, the FishPopTrace (FPT)\u000d\u000a      consortium translated its research and technological advances into policy\u000d\u000a      recommendations and accessible information to managers and stakeholders.\u000d\u000a      The consortium created a concise policy document which analyses the\u000d\u000a        current policy framework for traceability of fish and fish products to\u000d\u000a        their geographic origin, tackling fish piracy and consumer fraud\u000d\u000a      (available on the FPT website). Specifically targeting policies and\u000d\u000a      legislation of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) on the key CFP aim of\u000d\u000a      promoting sustainability through conservation of genetic resources, the\u000d\u000a      consortium further submitted two contributions to the public consultations\u000d\u000a      launched by the European Commission (EC) for the CFP Control Reform and\u000d\u000a      the CFP Reform. These contributions have had a demonstrable direct\u000d\u000a        impact on the reform of the policy: the EU's decision to endorse the\u000d\u000a      use of advanced genetic and morphometric tools for fisheries management.\u000d\u000a      The project is specifically highlighted in the Impact Assessment report\u000d\u000a      that followed the consultation and underpinned the major proposal for\u000d\u000a      reform of the CFP control regime3-5. The project's methodology\u000d\u000a      and findings are also cited throughout in the 2011 reference report of the\u000d\u000a      Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (JRC) on deterring\u000d\u000a      illegal activities in the fisheries sector6.\u000d\u000a    Impacts on policy debate and pathways to impact\u000d\u000a      Additional impact of Bangor research on EU fisheries policy comes from influencing\u000a        policy debate through FPT's highly valued participation in\u000d\u000a      international meetings and workshops on traceability and control in the\u000d\u000a      fisheries sector, organised by JRC, Food and Agriculture Organization\u000d\u000a      (FAO) and other global authorities on fisheries management. Here, the\u000d\u000a      potential of advanced technologies and appropriate strategies for transfer\u000d\u000a      into more efficient fisheries control schemes was discussed directly with\u000d\u000a      relevant authorities on fisheries management at a political and industry\u000d\u000a      level7.

Thorpe (1996\u000d\u000a      - present) and Prof. G. Carvalho (2005 - present) et al. was born from the\u000d\u000a      need for a legal framework and validation of traceability tools, in which\u000d\u000a      DNA could be recovered from animal parts and products. Wildlife crime is\u000d\u000a      now the world's third largest illegal trade and DNA forensic techniques\u000d\u000a      are increasingly used in its prosecution. Crucial early research\u000d\u000a      demonstrating the potential of this field for conservation programs and\u000d\u000a      law enforcement was conducted at Bangor, in collaboration with Dr R. Ogden\u000d\u000a      and Dr R. McEwing, co-founders of a Bangor University spin-out company in\u000d\u000a      2003 called Wildlife DNA Services and both Honorary Research Associates at\u000d\u000a      Bangor since 2007. Specifically, novel genetic markers suitable for\u000d\u000a        forensic analyses were developed (3.1) and for species\u000d\u000a      identification in Asian black bear, badger, rhinoceros and birds of prey\u000d\u000a      (e.g. 3.2; 3.3). In a substantial further development, Bangor University\u000d\u000a      led an important (2008-2011) EU FP7 project \"Traceability of fish\u000d\u000a      populations and fish products\" (FishPopTrace &#8212; FPT) coordinated by\u000d\u000a      Carvalho, with significant collaboration from TRACE Wildlife Forensics\u000d\u000a      Network, an NGO established by Ogden and McEwing.\u000d\u000a    Led and coordinated by Carvalho, the &#8364;4M international FPT consortium\u000d\u000a      comprised 15 different institutes in Europe. Contributing project\u000d\u000a      researchers at Bangor were Dr M. Taylor (Lecturer 2005-2011, Senior\u000d\u000a      Lecturer 2011-2012) and Research Fellow Dr S. Helyar (2008-2011). Aimed\u000a      specifically at bridging the gap between academic science, policy makers and\u000d\u000a        end-users, it focused primarily on identifying, mapping and\u000d\u000a        monitoring fish stocks for policy makers and fisheries managers, in\u000d\u000a      relation to traceability and Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing\u000d\u000a      (IUU). The project's research generated applications and tools to enable\u000d\u000a      control and enforcement of fisheries management strategies by developing a\u000d\u000a      traceability framework based on molecular genetics, otolith chemistry and\u000d\u000a      morphometrics: traceability tools up to forensics standards for the\u000d\u000a        whole stock-to-fork chain. The first research step was to develop\u000d\u000a      genetic markers for four marine fish species (cod, herring, sole and hake;\u000d\u000a      all economically important EU priority species for enforcement and\/or\u000d\u000a      conservation that are relatively widespread and known to exhibit\u000d\u000a      population structure) to enable detection of their populations of origin\u000d\u000a      and assess their diversity (3.4). Significant research outputs\u000d\u000a        validated the new traceability tools for specific stocks of these\u000d\u000a      four species (e.g. 3.5; 3.6), after which they could be directly applied\u000d\u000a      for IUU regulation purposes.\u000d\u000a    FPT was the first major project to produce tests that identify the\u000d\u000a        geographic origin of marine fish for fisheries enforcement with\u000d\u000a        sufficient certainty and level of validation to meet forensic standards\u000d\u000a        in court.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21954","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research at Newcastle has influenced the way that the global\u000a      petroleum industry models and\u000a      predicts exploration, production and drilling issues associated with\u000a      mud-rich sediments. It is used\u000a      to predict pore pressure pre- and post-drill, has been incorporated into\u000a      industry-standard, basin-\u000a      scale fluid flow modelling software and has reduced exploration risk by\u000a      improving seal risk\/column\u000a      height prediction. Context and an overall assessment of how the research\u000a      has influenced BP's\u000a      work on exploration risk is given by a Senior Petroleum Systems Analyst at\u000a      BP [E1]: \"The research\u000a        has improved our understanding of fine grained lithologies and provided\u000a        scientific breakthroughs,\u000a        and software which is now used routinely by a wide range of users across\u000a        the world. These\u000a        mudrock concepts have been integrated into BP workflows and hence used\u000a        to influence business\u000a        decisions. The monetary value of research is always difficult to\u000a        quantify; however, clearly the\u000a        mudrock concepts have been used to reduce exploration risk and to avoid\u000a        drilling dry holes and\u000a        unnecessary sidetracks. Given the cost of an exploration well, which is\u000a        often $100million, then the\u000a        value resulting from this work is very considerable and obvious to\u000a        geoscientists\".\u000a    Below, representatives of some of the major companies who use the\u000a      research state how it has\u000a      impacted their business in terms of (a) Pore Pressure Estimation, (b) Seal\u000a      Risk and Column Height\u000a      Prediction, (c) Petroleum Systems Modelling and (d) Training.\u000a    Pore Pressure Estimation\u000a    Pore pressure prediction for well design is a critical activity within\u000a      petroleum companies, firstly to\u000a      ensure the safety of drilling operations and secondly for financial\u000a      reasons. Maersk's Team Lead for\u000a      Global Pressure Prediction Team [E2] points out that typical UK\u000a      HPHT wells cost in excess of\u000a      $100 million, so that \"accurate pressure prediction for well design and\u000a        to limit non-productive time\u000a        during drilling has huge cost implications\". When Maersk \"works\u000a        on pressure prediction and basin\u000a        modelling studies the starting point for the shale rock property models\u000a        used are those developed at\u000a        Newcastle University. These models underpin our assessment of pore\u000a        pressure generation and\u000a        retention and form an integral part of the final pressure predictions\u000a        made\".\u000a      Representatives of other international petroleum companies give similar\u000a      testimonies. BG Group's\u000a      Technical Authority on Petroleum Systems [E3]: \"predicting\u000a        subsurface pressures ahead of drilling\u000a        is of extreme importance in the safe drilling of wells; \"the research\u000a        undertaken in GeoPOP made\u000a        huge advances in our ability to do this\". A Geoscience Fellow and\u000a      highly respected pore pressure\u000a      expert at ConocoPhillips [E4] states: \"the basic research of\u000a        GeoPoP has......improved our drilling\u000a        efficiencies by avoiding pressure related problems which can run into\u000a        tens of millions of dollars per\u000a        event and in some cases can increase the risk of a release of high\u000a        pressure fluids at the surface\".\u000a    Seal Risk and Column Height Prediction\u000a    Seal failure is one of the main reasons why petroleum accumulations are\u000a      lost and expensive dry\u000a      holes drilled. A Principal Geologist at BHP Billiton [E5] points\u000a      out that \"the Caprocks consortium\u000a        has helped us tremendously in understanding sealing rocks, including\u000a        column height potential, and\u000a        is used constantly by us to evaluate top seal risk in our multi-billion\u000a        dollar oil and gas exploration\u000a        programs\". Likewise, ConocoPhillips' say that its seal\u000a      evaluation process \"has largely adopted\u000a        workflows and concepts based on Caprocks research and the mud rock data\u000a        base developed in\u000a        the GeoPOP program. ShaleQuant is one of our standard tools for\u000a        assessing mud rock properties\u000a        that lead to column height prediction for our exploration risk\u000a        assessment of plays and prospects\"\u000a      [E4]. And at BP, \"much of the research has formed the\u000a        foundation of our own internal research\u000a      efforts. The technology is currently used to assess hydrocarbon column\u000a        heights, helping us to\u000a        make informed decisions to select prospects where our exploration wells\u000a        do not fail due to column\u000a        height prediction\" [E1].\u000a    Petroleum Systems Modelling: Pore Pressure, Charge and Retention\u000a    Many petroleum companies use sophisticated software to model fluid flow\u000a      and thus to predict pore\u000a      pressure and petroleum charge before drilling wells. BG's Technical\u000a      Authority on Petroleum\u000a      Systems states that the Newcastle research has impacted that process and\u000a      points out that the\u000a      methodology is widely accepted by the industry in that it has been coded\u000a      into standard, basin-scale\u000a      fluid flow simulation software: \"A key paper published by the\u000a        Newcastle Group (P6) led to\u000a        widespread awareness of the (mudstone) methodology and soon resulted in\u000a        it being incorporated\u000a        into high end Petroleum Systems Modelling software. Thus it became\u000a        possible to predict pore\u000a        pressure more accurately ahead of drilling\" [E3].\u000a    BP's Team Leader in Petroleum Systems comments on how the research has\u000a      helped exploration\u000a      in particularly challenging geological settings: \"The use of the basic\u000a        approaches inspired by\u000a        Newcastle research helped us to build and populate complex 3D basin\u000a        models to predict pore\u000a        pressures in new areas such as beneath salt canopies in the Gulf of\u000a        Mexico, and at great depths in\u000a        the Caspian Sea. Without (Newcastle's) reliable lithological inputs to\u000a        basin modelling we would be\u000a        unable to unlock the significant resources we believe exist in these\u000a        settings\" [E1].\u000a    Training and Knowledge Dissemination within Companies\u000a    Both BP and ConocoPhillips have indicated that they use the Newcastle\u000a      research routinely for\u000a      training purposes, thus spreading the impact widely within their\u000a      organisations:\u000a    BP [E1]: \"The technology is taught routinely in BP as part of\u000a        the petroleum systems and PPFG\u000a        courses and an overburden characterisation course.\"\u000a    ConocoPhillips [E4]: \"Materials that have been generated by GeoPoP\u000a        and more recently\u000a        Caprocks have been an exceptional resource for developing our training\u000a        courses for seal\u000a        evaluation and overpressure.

The research was used to\u000d\u000a      underpin the coral\u000d\u000a      transplant strategy for this US$5 billion plant construction:\u000d\u000a    \"[B]because these [damaged] areas were too large to be integrally\u000d\u000a      transplanted and to increase the\u000d\u000a      chances of coral survival, it was decided a priori to selectively\u000d\u000a      transplant the largest colonies, the\u000d\u000a      rare or uncommon species, the slow growing species, and only the colonies\u000d\u000a      in good health.\u000d\u000a      Edwards and Clark (1998)1 argued that there has been too much\u000d\u000a      focus on transplanting fast-\u000d\u000a      growing branching corals instead of slowly recruiting massive species,\u000d\u000a      which generally survive\u000d\u000a      transplantation well but often recruit slowly.\" This ensured only minor\u000d\u000a      transient reef damage and\u000d\u000a      healthy reefs have since spawned an estimated 100,000 - 140,000 coral\u000d\u000a      recruits onto new\u000d\u000a      substrates created by the development [E5].\u000d\u000a    Impacts on the International shipping industry\u000d\u000a    CTL Consult Ltd based in the UK has made use of the guidelines and manual\u000d\u000a      in 4 international\u000d\u000a      ship-grounding cases.

This body of work led to a\u000d\u000a      number of influential\u000d\u000a      papers [P1, P3 - P6] which were incorporated\u000d\u000a      directly into reef restoration guidelines, manuals and\u000d\u000a      advisory papers which are used extensively by practitioners and policy\u000d\u000a      makers.\u000d\u000a    The key research insight from Newcastle work in the Maldives was that\u000d\u000a      coral communities are\u000d\u000a      resilient when not under anthropogenic stress [P4, P6].\u000d\u000a      Provided that a stable substrate is\u000d\u000a      available they are able to recover quickly (typically within a decade)\u000d\u000a      from disturbance without\u000d\u000a      active restoration interventions such as coral transplantation. Previously\u000d\u000a      reef managers had\u000d\u000a      emphasised transplantation as essential to the recovery strategy.\u000d\u000a      Newcastle's research showed\u000d\u000a      that this strategy was often not cost-effective and sometimes did more\u000d\u000a      harm than good [P1]. The\u000d\u000a      research also showed that the current practice of transplanting weed-like\u000d\u000a      fast-growing branching\u000d\u000a      coral species which grew readily to bare artificial substrates within\u000d\u000a      months of deployment [P6] were\u000d\u000a      very susceptible to climate change related bleaching events [P3].\u000d\u000a      They showed that if active\u000d\u000a      restoration was adopted, then more attention should be devoted to\u000d\u000a      transplanting slow-growing,\u000d\u000a      slowly recruiting massive coral species that survive bleaching, disease\u000d\u000a      and transplantation\u000d\u000a      significantly better than faster-growing branching species.\u000d\u000a    Subsequent research in the Philippines (2005-2008) focused on an area\u000d\u000a      which had seen\u000d\u000a      significant human disturbance (through overfishing) where there had been\u000d\u000a      negligible natural\u000d\u000a      recovery from a mass-bleaching in 1998 and which therefore warranted\u000d\u000a      active interventions to\u000d\u000a      accelerate recovery. Thus, in the face of climate change [P2, P3]\u000d\u000a      there had to be effective\u000d\u000a      management of local human impacts so that natural recovery processes could\u000d\u000a      occur. The\u000d\u000a      Newcastle research bridged knowledge gaps in active restoration; primarily\u000d\u000a      how to reduce\u000d\u000a      collateral damage to healthy reefs from transplantation using asexual and\u000d\u000a      sexual rearing\u000d\u000a      technologies [P5]. Following the development and testing of these\u000d\u000a      new technologies, results were\u000d\u000a      disseminated and then used by Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and\u000d\u000a      local governments.\u000d\u000a    Newcastle's research was the first to contest active restoration\u000d\u000a      techniques as a panacea for coral\u000d\u000a      reef conservation and instead stress their use as a last resort.

Improved production strategies for heavy oil reservoirs\u000d\u000a    The identification and explanation of biodegradation-induced oil viscosity\u000d\u000a      gradients in heavy oilfields has impacted substantially on production\u000d\u000a      technology. \"Vertical compositional gradients of biodegradation\u000d\u000a        susceptible compounds, another product of biodegradation identified by\u000d\u000a        the Newcastle\/Calgary researchers, have also very rapidly been utilized\u000d\u000a        by industry for predicting behaviour (rate) of steam growth in thermal\u000d\u000a        recovery processes\" [E1]. Evaluation of viscosity gradients\u000d\u000a      in heavy oil reservoirs now forms an important part of production process\u000d\u000a      design in the oil industry with several major oil companies (e.g. Statoil,\u000d\u000a      Woodside, Shell) with a global footprint incorporating these insights into\u000d\u000a      their heavy oil businesses [E1-E4]. One project sponsor\u000d\u000a      specifically highlights how the science developed in the Bacchus project\u000d\u000a      has had a direct influence on the value of a specific field, \"understanding\u000d\u000a        of the reasons for fluid property variability influenced the decision to\u000d\u000a        sell the field to another company and also added significant value\u000d\u000a        (probably in the $10's of millions) to the asset\" [E3]. Well\u000d\u000a      placement to avoid highly viscous oil in poorly producing zones is\u000d\u000a      informed by knowledge of oil property gradients. It allows detection of\u000d\u000a      barriers in reservoirs and allocation of the source of production in\u000d\u000a      complex compartmentalised reservoirs [E1- E3, and E8].\u000d\u000a      These are now important components of cold and thermal heavy oil recovery\u000d\u000a      in many parts of the world (e.g. Canada, Oman, Cameroon, Mauritania; E1-E3,\u000d\u000a        E8). Improved recovery efficiencies with existing heavy oil recovery\u000d\u000a      processes have resulted from avoiding difficult to recover hydrocarbons\u000d\u000a      and well placements that could not have worked, improving cost-benefit\u000d\u000a      ratios and project net present value (NPV) &#8212; \"the improved picture of\u000d\u000a        the reservoir fluid state saved the drilling of at least one well at the\u000d\u000a        cost of ~ $US 50 Million\" [E3] and \"Considering the number\u000d\u000a        of projects and tens of billions of dollars of investment in oil sands,\u000d\u000a        the impact of their new findings can be estimated to be measured in\u000d\u000a        hundreds of million and perhaps even billions of dollars in the long\u000d\u000a        term\" [E1]. Moreover principles developed from our research\u000d\u000a      are \"routinely used as (i) a screening criterion for caprock integrity\u000d\u000a        for thermal recovery processes (i.e. presence of gas indicates good\u000d\u000a        caprock under reservoir conditions) (ii) a tool for evaluating the\u000d\u000a        geometry and size of these zones and their volumetrics. This is a\u000d\u000a        critical development risk (water and gas are `thieves' for injected\u000d\u000a        steam in reservoir and significantly impact the economics of thermal\u000d\u000a        operations\" [E1] and \"Numerous projects that have suffered\u000d\u000a        in the near past would have been a success stories if these principles\u000d\u000a        had been applied!\" [E1].\u000d\u000a    2. New methods for fluid property (viscosity) determination\u000d\u000a      Design of optimum production processes requires high quality data on oil\u000d\u000a      heterogeneity across a reservoir. Understanding the detailed chemical\u000d\u000a      changes in oil composition during degradation has allowed the development\u000d\u000a      of geochemical methods for assessing oil viscosity, enabling reliable\u000d\u000a      viscosity logging from drill cuttings in heavy oilfields \"The\u000d\u000a        temperature-viscosity relationships elucidated in the Bacchus project\u000d\u000a        helped us predict that traps flanking the anticlinal structures and\u000d\u000a        hence at slightly higher temperature could contain producible oil\" [E3].\u000a      This technology is now routinely deployed around the world [E1-E3],\u000d\u000a      and is being used to reduce costs by providing a low cost alternative to\u000d\u000a      expensive well testing procedures that rely on obtaining cored reservoir\u000d\u000a      material that is costly and technically challenging.\u000d\u000a    3. A biodegradation module for basin modelling software\u000d\u000a      The fundamental principles developed from our research and specific models\u000d\u000a      developed have been incorporated into practical software tools developed\u000d\u000a      in-house by oil company sponsors [E2- E4], for example, \"A\u000d\u000a        predictive framework resulted from the synthesis of data from laboratory\u000d\u000a        simulations and field studies, and this provides a basis for our\u000d\u000a        in-house development of improved basin modeling tools\" [E4].\u000d\u000a      Permedia, a company that develops and markets basin modelling software [E5]\u000d\u000a      worked closely with Bacchus researchers to couple Permedia's high\u000d\u000a      resolution modelling software with the science base from our oil\u000d\u000a      biodegradation research. The product is a 3D fluid property prediction\u000d\u000a      tool that integrates the dynamics of active oil charging with biological\u000d\u000a      degradation of oil in reservoirs across individual accumulations or for\u000d\u000a      whole basins. This substantial technical challenge has been met and a tool\u000d\u000a      (\"BaccPath\") within Permedia's MPath software platform can effectively\u000d\u000a      predict oil density and viscosity for accumulations through time and\u000d\u000a      space. An interrogation tool (\"Gnawd\") developed within our research\u000d\u000a      spin-out company, Gushor Inc. [E6], models individual reservoir\u000d\u000a      segments and estimates vertical compositional gradients related to\u000d\u000a      biodegradation [E6]. Permedia has recently been acquired by\u000d\u000a      Halliburton and BaccPath has been incorporated into Halliburton's\u000d\u000a      proprietary software [E5].\u000d\u000a    4. A successful spin out company providing services to the heavy oil\u000d\u000a        sector\u000d\u000a      In 2006, the research led to the formation of a successful spin out\u000d\u000a      company, Gushor Inc., [E6] which provides services to the heavy oil\u000d\u000a      industry. Gushor develops reservoir characterisation technologies for\u000d\u000a      heavy oil reservoirs and specialises in applying understanding of\u000d\u000a      in-reservoir petroleum biodegradation and its impact on petroleum fluid\u000d\u000a      properties to design and monitor heavy oil production systems. Gushor\u000d\u000a      quickly dominated the Canadian heavy oil fluid property characterisation\u000d\u000a      market and won both technical and commercial accolades including an\u000d\u000a      Alberta government ASTech award for commercial success in 2009 [E6].\u000d\u000a      One of the services Gushor provides, ProxViscTM, provides high\u000d\u000a      resolution oil viscosity data based on geochemical measurements conducted\u000d\u000a      on drill cuttings and a range of geochemical analysis services for the\u000d\u000a      heavy oil sector. It also provides the biodegradation modelling software,\u000d\u000a      Gnawd, and bespoke viscosity reduction technology (BRUTUSTM).\u000d\u000a      In 2012-2013 Gushor Inc. employed 19 staff and had a turnover of C$3.4\u000d\u000a      million (&#163;2.08 million). It has provided services to the heavy oil\u000d\u000a      operations of many major oil companies in China, the North Sea, Columbia,\u000d\u000a      Brazil, Oman, the Gulf of Mexico, California and Canada [E6]. This\u000d\u000a      not only underlines the success of Gushor Inc. itself, but provides\u000d\u000a      evidence of the global application of knowledge and technology that has\u000d\u000a      been developed as part of our research on biodegraded petroleum reservoirs\u000d\u000a      and heavy oil. In June 2013, Gushor Inc. was sold to the world's leading\u000d\u000a      oilfield services provider, Schlumberger, for an undisclosed sum [E7].\u000d\u000a    5.

The AER have used our research to\u000d\u000a      \"teach Applications staff the basic principles of oil-sands geology and\u000d\u000a        technology\" and specifically contribute to \"understanding bitumen\u000d\u000a        viscosity variations, and determining recovery factors of bitumen and\u000d\u000a        heavy oil in oil sands reservoirs to give realistic estimates of\u000d\u000a        reserves numbers that go into the Province of Alberta budgets\" [E8].\u000d\u000a    6.

Heavy oil is formed by\u000d\u000a      biodegradation of crude oil in situ in petroleum reservoirs over\u000d\u000a      geological timescales but the factors that lead to in-reservoir\u000d\u000a      biodegradation were poorly understood prior to this Newcastle University\u000d\u000a      led research. Our research was aimed at understanding the controls on the\u000d\u000a      occurrence of biodegraded crude oil, initially in the context of\u000d\u000a      exploration to avoid targeting biodegraded reservoirs, but subsequently to\u000d\u000a      understand the effects of biodegradation on petroleum fluid properties and\u000d\u000a      production strategies.\u000d\u000a    The research by Newcastle University overturned decades of conventional\u000d\u000a      wisdom in the oil industry which suggested that in-reservoir\u000d\u000a      biodegradation was driven by oxygen delivered in meteoric waters, when it\u000d\u000a      is actually an anaerobic process driven by water-hydrocarbon reactions at\u000d\u000a      an oil-water contact (OWC) zone [P1-P3]. The key\u000d\u000a      anaerobic process driving in-reservoir oil biodegradation is, in many\u000d\u000a      cases, methanogenic crude oil degradation and our research showed that\u000d\u000a      patterns of methanogenic oil degradation in laboratory incubations are\u000d\u000a      similar to oils from degraded oil fields that have developed over\u000d\u000a      geological timescales [P3]. Biodegradation of oil at the OWC at a\u000d\u000a      rate greater than diffusion from the oil column leads to gradients in the\u000d\u000a      oil composition and its related fluid properties (e.g. oil viscosity) in\u000d\u000a      biodegraded petroleum reservoirs [P1, P4]. Furthermore, oil\u000d\u000a      compositional gradients and viscosity are dictated by the interplay\u000d\u000a      between reservoir filling and biodegradation over geological timescales [P4].\u000a      Understanding the detailed chemical changes in oil composition during\u000d\u000a      degradation has allowed the development of geochemical means of assessing\u000d\u000a      oil viscosity enabling reliable viscosity measurements in heavy oilfields,\u000d\u000a      obviating the need for expensive coring and facilitating the avoidance of\u000d\u000a      poorly producing viscous zones [P4, P6].\u000d\u000a    We identified reservoir temperature history as a primary control on\u000d\u000a      degradation flux, showing that in-reservoir crude oil biodegradation is\u000d\u000a      prevented if a reservoir has been exposed to temperatures in the region of\u000d\u000a      80 to 90&#186;C. This concept that we formulated, is now known as\u000d\u000a      Palaeopasteurization [P5]. Reservoir geometry, oil water contact\u000d\u000a      area, oil volume and oil mixing are other important factors affecting oil\u000d\u000a      biodegradation in reservoirs, and the resulting large fluid property\u000d\u000a      gradients produced have a major impact on oil recovery processes [P6].\u000d\u000a      Knowledge of these compositional gradients can be used to target regions\u000d\u000a      of biodegraded oil fields where the flow properties and hence production\u000d\u000a      of the oil are most favourable. The same principles also allowed barriers\u000d\u000a      in reservoirs to be identified permitting the source of production for\u000d\u000a      individual wells to be determined.\u000d\u000a    The underpinning research came from a project funded in 3 phases by an\u000d\u000a      oil company consortium (Bacchus; http:\/\/www.ucalgary.ca\/prg\/bacchus).\u000a      Phase I and II were based in Newcastle and Phase III was a joint\u000d\u000a      enterprise between Newcastle and the University of Calgary (UoC) when one\u000d\u000a      of the PIs (Larter; Professor of Geology - 1989-present, 2006 joint\u000d\u000a        appointment with UoC) took up a joint appointment. The research has\u000d\u000a      generated 54 publications (including 4 nature papers) which collectively\u000d\u000a      have been cited 1396 times.

This restoration linked up\u000d\u000a      existing patches of good quality habitat and conservation value e.g.\u000d\u000a      recovery of silver-studded blue and Stone curlew populations; this\u000d\u000a      resulted in a significant improvement in the conservation of the\u000d\u000a      landscape, which was reported by RSPB staff in British Wildlife describing\u000d\u000a      the RSPB's restoration program on lowland heathland on the Suffolk coast;\u000d\u000a      six of the 11 cited references were produced by Marrs' group and the soil\u000d\u000a      chemical data quoted in the paper are their results.

The\u000d\u000a      methods developed, although geared towards this site, are generic and can\u000d\u000a      be applied to any former agricultural land.\u000d\u000a    (b) Development of methods for the use of prescribed burning on upland\u000d\u000a        moors (2005-2012)\u000d\u000a    There are several ways that Marrs' group has been involved in influencing\u000d\u000a      policy and practice. In 2006 Marrs was the only practising vegetation\u000d\u000a      scientist to sit on the DEFRA panel which reviewed the policy for \"Heather\u000d\u000a      and grass burning in England and Wales\". Marrs was included because of his\u000d\u000a      upland vegetation experience and specifically knowledge of long-term\u000d\u000a      burning experiments on Moor House National Nature Reserve. One of the\u000d\u000a      reasons for this review was a concern over the potential for earlier bird\u000d\u000a      nesting as a result of climate change and the potential need for revised\u000d\u000a      burning dates, specifically making the latest date for burning earlier in\u000d\u000a      Spring. This was not substantiated by evidence. However, at the same time\u000d\u000a      the impact of prescribed burning on both biodiversity and ecosystem\u000d\u000a      services were reviewed. The output was a complete revision of the \"DEFRA\u000d\u000a      Burning Code\", and led to changes in the law affecting heather and grass\u000d\u000a      burning, effective 1 October 2008. Compliance with the Burning Code is\u000d\u000a      required (inter alia) for estate owners receiving Higher Level\u000d\u000a      Stewardship grants for land management.\u000d\u000a    This review work led to the formulation of many of the hypotheses tested\u000d\u000a      in the FIREMAN project and advisory work done since.\u000d\u000a    In 2012, Marrs has provided expert witness testimony on prescribed\u000d\u000a      burning (based on 30-years research-experience on moorlands and especially\u000d\u000a      work associated with the FIREMAN project) at a landmark Public Inquiry\u000d\u000a      (PI) run by DEFRA. The PI tested some aspects of the need for prescribed\u000d\u000a      burning and hence examined some of the guidance within the Burning Code\u000d\u000a      (see above). The PI was to hear an appeal against a \"Notice of\u000d\u000a      modification of consent (NoMoCo)\" where Natural England (statutory\u000d\u000a      conservation body) was attempting to change the burning rotation interval\u000d\u000a      (along with several other practices) on an upland estate in the Pennines.\u000d\u000a      Indeed, the preferred stated case of Natural England was to ban burning\u000d\u000a      all together (the subject of a second NoMoCo). After evidence was\u000d\u000a      presented, but before closing speeches, a settlement was reached where\u000d\u000a      Natural England agreed conditions that were agreeable to the estate owner\u000d\u000a      with sensible burning rotations allowed. This allowed the estate owner to\u000d\u000a      manage for commercial grouse production whilst maintaining a more\u000d\u000a      sustainable upland landscape which included a wildfire resilience\u000d\u000a      strategy. Mr David Elvin QC stated \"Marrs' evidence came from\u000d\u000a        rigorously analysed long-term studies ... I found his scientific\u000d\u000a        analysis, objectivity and rigour particularly welcome ..... The\u000d\u000a        conclusion [of the PI] was to a significant extent the result of\u000d\u000a        evidence we presented, a significant part of which was that of Professor\u000d\u000a        Marrs.\"\u000d\u000a    Marrs' has continued to translate his long-term research on\u000d\u000a      heathland\/moorland management to end-users through Knowledge Exchange.\u000d\u000a      Apart from helping to revise the Burning Code, he helped establish a\u000d\u000a      series of Demonstration Moors and through this implemented\u000d\u000a      \"Good-practice-management training days\"; here up-to-the-minute research\u000d\u000a      has been translated to end-users (farmers, estate owners, land agents,\u000d\u000a      gamekeepers and conservation agency staff). Some of this has been done in\u000d\u000a      partnership with the Heather Trust and the International Bracken Group.\u000d\u000a      Between 2008-2012, five training days have been run reaching over 400\u000d\u000a      end-users. Simon Thorp (Director, Heather Trust) stated that \"His\u000d\u000a        research work based on a combination of surveys, modelling and both\u000d\u000a        current and past experiments, where he has an obvious \"hands-on\"\u000d\u000a        approach endears him to practitioners.

One of these was headed up by\u000d\u000a      the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) at their Minsmere\u000d\u000a      reserve where two lowland heaths were separated by two major blocks of\u000d\u000a      former heathland that had been converted to arable use. Heathland tend to\u000d\u000a      occur on infertile soils and the arable soils had been very heavily\u000d\u000a      fertilized and limed leaving a residual fertility issue. The RSPB policy\u000d\u000a      was to restore the arable fields to lowland-heathland. Using field surveys\u000d\u000a      of the arable soils Marrs' group established that (a) the main problems\u000d\u000a      were soil pH, Ca and P, and (b) there was no layer-stratification that\u000d\u000a      would allow topsoil stripping as a method for reducing fertility.\u000d\u000a      Thereafter a series of field-based experiments produced techniques for\u000d\u000a      acidifying the soils (essentially titrating with elemental S) and\u000d\u000a      seed-additions to restore the arable areas to either Calluna-dominated\u000a      lowland heath or grass heath (REF.3.1-3.3). The RSPB took this\u000d\u000a      research and scaled it up in an implementation phase.\u000d\u000a    (b) Development of methods for the use of prescribed burning on upland\u000d\u000a        moors (2005-2012)\u000d\u000a    In 2012 the IUCN \"Commission on peatlands\" reviewed the status of\u000d\u000a      peatlands in the UK and one of the areas of concern was the impact of\u000d\u000a      prescribed burning. UK moorlands provide a range of ecosystem services\u000d\u000a      including carbon sequestration in peat, water provision, agricultural and\u000d\u000a      sheep outputs and recreation. Prescribed burning is applied under a code\u000d\u000a      of good practice and is mainly implemented for grouse management, but\u000d\u000a      there is increasing evidence it may need to be used in the future for\u000d\u000a      wildfire control if climate warms. Based on earlier work testing both\u000d\u000a      prescribed burning, cutting, herbicide use and re-seeding on Molinia\u000d\u000a        Caerulea (Yorkshire Fog) infested ground Marrs was asked by a land\u000d\u000a      manager to start work on prescribed burning and offered his estate for\u000d\u000a      study. This work has expanded into a NERC\/DEFRA- funded project under the\u000d\u000a      Biodiversa program (FIREMAN) that encompasses field studies and modelling;\u000d\u000a      the latter being applied to historic, contemporary and future burning\u000d\u000a      scenarios. Here, Marrs' group has produced information on change in (i)\u000d\u000a      species composition in the post-fire burning cycle and (ii) the biomass\u000d\u000a      (fuel load). Moreover, matrix modelling studies has provided predictions\u000d\u000a      of the optimal prescribed burning rotation length to minimize carbon\u000d\u000a      losses from the above-ground vegetation. His group has also re-visited a\u000d\u000a      long-term experiment (Marrs was involved in monitoring in the 1980s) and\u000d\u000a      produced a long-term assessment of impacts of prescribed burning on (a)\u000d\u000a      the vegetation including supposed \"fire-sensitive\" species and (b) the\u000d\u000a      restoration potential after wildfire.

As a respected\u000d\u000a        professional figure and research leader, Mason was\u000d\u000a        responsible for establishing contacts between UK and Chinese clinical\u000d\u000a        units and facilitated negotiations for the introduction, establishment\u000d\u000a        of clinical trials and delivery of the equipment to the UK.

He played an integral part in securing the\u000d\u000a        very first operational High Intensity Focused Ultrasound equipment to be\u000d\u000a        delivered from China to the Western world\" [a]. This featured in the\u000d\u000a      Research Councils UK 2011 publication \"Big ideas for the future\" [b].\u000d\u000a    Impacts on the Environment\u000d\u000a      Mason and Joyce's position as experts in the ultrasonically\u000d\u000a      assisted purification of drinking and wastewater in municipal systems has\u000d\u000a      led them to provide advisory and consultancy research services to two\u000d\u000a      companies in Germany in the wastewater treatment sector.\u000d\u000a    In the first instance, Professor Uwe Neis (Ultrawaves GmbH) stated that Mason's\u000a      work regarding the practical application of ultrasound technology and his\u000d\u000a      cooperation in disseminating advances in sonochemistry through a series of\u000d\u000a      conferences in the second half of the 1990s were of fundamental importance\u000d\u000a      [c]. He stated they informed the development of the approaches that Neis\u000d\u000a      introduced to the German market and which are currently operational in\u000d\u000a      over 150 locations around the world. According to Neis, Ultrawaves,\u000d\u000a      founded in 2001 in Germany, and with subsidiaries in the UK and in the\u000d\u000a      Baltic states, has become a world leader in the market for\u000d\u000a      ultrasound-based treatment of water, wastewater and biomass. The\u000d\u000a      technology developed by Ultrawaves takes into account advances in the\u000d\u000a      practical application of ultrasound technology developed at Coventry\u000d\u000a      University which has allowed the company to steadily grow since 2001 to a\u000d\u000a      current yearly turnover of &#8364;2 million.\u000d\u000a    Ultrasonic Systems GmbH stated that collaboration with Mason to\u000d\u000a      test the combined ultrasound with ozone technologies previously developed\u000d\u000a      at a start-up stage were of fundamental importance in establishing a\u000d\u000a      successful business [d]. Mason's input was to take the 4-inch\u000d\u000a      prototype testing machine that Ultrasonic Systems currently uses and test\u000d\u000a      it in various ways in his laboratory. Dr Ulla Poeltsch, Director of the\u000d\u000a      company stated that the testing and validation research that Coventry\u000d\u000a      conducted and published was crucial as it showed that the technology was\u000d\u000a      independently validated by a world-leading group. Furthermore, Mason\u000d\u000a      went on to help them develop their own 4-inch prototype which has allowed\u000d\u000a      Ultrasonic Systems to pilot test solutions for clients before they have to\u000d\u000a      commit to buying the large-scale system. Thus small-scale ozone units,\u000d\u000a      developed with the Unit principally for enabling piloting of larger\u000d\u000a      projects, have proved to constitute a separately marketable product.\u000d\u000a    In addition, Mason has taken the experimental work on control of\u000d\u000a      algae from the laboratory out to a local test site, through cooperation\u000d\u000a      with Coventry City Council and Aquatic Plant Management. Over the last\u000d\u000a      year a local park lake has been monitored for natural algal growth and\u000d\u000a      subsequently ultrasonic equipment will be installed. This project will\u000d\u000a      monitor the effects of ultrasound for one year followed by the same period\u000d\u000a      of monitoring in the absence of ultrasonic treatment. As Mark Yates of\u000d\u000a      Coventry City Council stated \"... using ultrasound to thwart the growth\u000d\u000a        of algae in ponds will prevent considerable threats to public health\".\u000d\u000a        Although the study is still in an early stage, initial laboratory based\u000d\u000a        results indicate that ultrasound will significantly reduce the amount of\u000d\u000a        algae and hence the health risks to humans and animals as well as the\u000d\u000a        environmental damage cause by mechanical skimming and disposal of the\u000d\u000a        algae. Yates, stated that \"the ultrasound technology developed ...will\u000d\u000a        circumvent the use of environmentally harmful chemical algaecides, which\u000d\u000a        endanger wildlife and contaminate the surrounding environment by leaking\u000d\u000a        in to the soil\".\u000d\u000a    Economic Impacts\u000d\u000a      Through sustained relationships, the group has contributed to validating,\u000d\u000a      testing and developing new methods of applying ultrasound technology in\u000d\u000a      different sectors. The significance for the partner companies varies from\u000d\u000a      small inputs such as testing existing processes, to more significant\u000d\u000a      impacts that have resulted in new companies being formed, global markets\u000d\u000a      opened, and the accrual of both economic and environmental benefits.\u000d\u000a    Joyce and Mason have also been involved in the formation\u000d\u000a      of multidisciplinary partnerships supporting a number of SMEs in their\u000d\u000a      research and development functions, thus sustaining the SMEs'\u000d\u000a      competitiveness. Key in these projects is the knowledge exchange between\u000d\u000a      partners, SMEs and Coventry University, allowing partners access to\u000d\u000a      scientific expertise and University facilities. Examples of SMEs involved\u000d\u000a      in such research include Chestech Ltd (UK) and Dioxi Ltd (UK) in addition\u000d\u000a      to Ultrawaves GmbH (Germany) and Ultrasonic Systems GmbH (Germany)\u000d\u000a      mentioned in the earlier section on impacts on the environment.\u000d\u000a    Jonathan Sellars of Chestech Ltd stated his company lacks an R&amp;D\u000d\u000a      division, so that collaboration with Mason and Joyce\u000d\u000a      allowed them to address particular customer problems. An example is the\u000d\u000a      case of the improved and greener electroless coating technology for GPS\u000d\u000a      antennae. This technology is sold to global companies such as TomTom and\u000d\u000a      Garmin through Sarantel. The flexibility and quality of Coventry\u000d\u000a      University's work allowed the company to retain and expand their market\u000d\u000a      share.\u000d\u000a    In some cases the work of Mason and Joyce has helped\u000d\u000a      companies in deciding not to proceed with ultrasonic technologies. Thus\u000d\u000a      Dioxi Ltd was interested in using ultrasound-enhanced ozone fogging\u000d\u000a      technologies as a new way of sanitation for hospital rooms. After\u000d\u000a      preliminary trials Joyce and Mason advised Dioxi Ltd that\u000d\u000a      ultrasound would not be an economically feasible method thus preventing\u000d\u000a      economic loss. As Bray, Dioxi Ltd, stated the \"...research has been\u000d\u000a        fundamental in correctly testing the bacteriological impact of their\u000d\u000a        technology and will inform its future development. Joyce\u000d\u000a        and Mason had ideas about where the technology\u000d\u000a        could be applied in the livestock sector and this has enabled the\u000d\u000a        company to move into a new market\" [e]. This shows that\u000d\u000a      collaborating with Joyce and Mason has improved the\u000d\u000a      company's ability to test business ideas independently and practically in\u000d\u000a      order to develop a commercially viable product. There are numerous\u000d\u000a      examples of Mason and Joyce and their team helping SMEs to\u000d\u000a      benefit from their expertise. However, the research is not just limited to\u000d\u000a      SMEs; their research has helped larger companies. For example,\u000d\u000a      GlaxoSmithKline in the field of food technology, a long-time specialism at\u000d\u000a      Coventry, and Sibelco in terms of mineral washing.\u000d\u000a    It can be argued that without Mason's research and help,\u000d\u000a      Chongqing Haifu Ltd's High Intensity Focused Ultrasound technology would\u000d\u000a      not have established as quickly in the Western world as it has. There are\u000d\u000a      now 20 Haifu units throughout Europe in four different countries.\u000d\u000a      Therefore, Mason's research and endorsement contributed to the\u000d\u000a      business development of this global company by facilitating its access to\u000d\u000a      new markets. According to Nick Yin, Chongqing Haifu Ltd., in the past 5\u000d\u000a      years the company has generated a cumulative turnover of &#8364;40 million from\u000d\u000a      the sales of new machines, and from operating existing installations in\u000d\u000a      Europe [f].\u000d\u000a    Public Engagement\u000d\u000a      Mason has been a passionate advocate for increasing public\u000d\u000a      awareness of the science and the application of ultrasound. Over the years\u000d\u000a      he has delivered numerous School and Public lectures to explain the\u000d\u000a      benefits of this technology. The research of Mason and Joyce\u000d\u000a      was selected as an exhibit in the form of an interactive exposition unit\u000d\u000a      entitled \"the Power of Sound\" at the 2009 Summer Science Exhibition of the\u000d\u000a      Royal Society, an event visited by more than 5000 people and widely\u000d\u000a      covered by popular media throughout the UK [g].\u000d\u000a    Conclusion\u000d\u000a      Over the last 30 years Mason and latterly Joyce have\u000d\u000a      undertaken research to explore the potential uses of power ultrasound to\u000d\u000a      make an impact in terms of it use in health, environmental protection and\u000d\u000a      economic benefits. In addition, both have contributed to public engagement\u000d\u000a      by increasing the awareness of science and in particular the use of power\u000d\u000a      ultrasound to improve and maintain the environment by making processes\u000d\u000a      cleaner, more efficient and safer.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case study describes over 30 years research by Mason and Joyce\u000d\u000a      in high powered ultrasound.

Joyce completed\u000d\u000a      her PhD at Coventry in 2003 and returned as a Research Fellow in 2007 to\u000d\u000a      work with Mason. In contrast to low intensity diagnostic\u000d\u000a      ultrasound which is used for medical scanning, ultrasound can be used at\u000d\u000a      higher powers to treat cancer, purify water, clean the surface of printed\u000d\u000a      circuit boards, or extract medicinal and other useful compounds from\u000d\u000a      plants and algae.\u000d\u000a    Research into therapeutic applications of ultrasound at Coventry dates\u000d\u000a      back decades [1] with two major research thrusts in this area. The first\u000d\u000a      relates to the use of focused ultrasound as both a direct non-invasive\u000d\u000a      treatment for the removal of solid carcinomas and also as a method for\u000d\u000a      targeted drug delivery [2]. As the name implies, the non-invasive\u000d\u000a      treatment of cancer avoids the need for a surgical operation to remove\u000d\u000a      carcinomas and hence reduces patient trauma and the risk of infection. A\u000d\u000a      second research area, in the application of focused ultrasound, provides a\u000d\u000a      method of targeting the release of encapsulated chemotherapy agents\u000d\u000a      directly at the site of a carcinoma [3]. This reduces the side effects\u000d\u000a      associated with the more general delivery of drugs through the\u000d\u000a      bloodstream.\u000d\u000a    Ultrasound also offers a cleaner and greener alternative to many existing\u000d\u000a      technologies for environmental remediation. The powerful collapse of\u000d\u000a      acoustic cavitation bubbles in water generates hydroxyl radicals that can\u000d\u000a      oxidise chemical pollutants and this, together with the intense localised\u000d\u000a      shear forces produced, can also destroy biological contamination through\u000d\u000a      weakening or direct rupture of the cell walls [4]. For many years Joyce\u000d\u000a      and Mason have used ultrasound either alone or in combination with\u000d\u000a      other technologies e.g. UV light, catalysts and biocides for water\u000d\u000a      remediation. More recently they have addressed two specific types of\u000d\u000a      chemical and biological contamination. Firstly, the research used a\u000d\u000a      combination of ozone and ultrasound to remove chemicals capable of\u000d\u000a      affecting the hormonal activity in fish and mammals known as endocrine\u000d\u000a      disruptors [5]. The second area involves the control of biological\u000d\u000a      contamination in the form of algae, particularly blue green varieties\u000d\u000a      (cyanobacteria), which present a serious risk to human health from the\u000d\u000a      toxins which they produce [6].\u000d\u000a    Mason and Joyce also carried out research into the use of\u000d\u000a      ultrasound to reduce the need for harmful chemicals in manufacturing and\u000d\u000a      to improve the efficient extraction of valuable products from algae. The\u000d\u000a      leMRC funded-research (&#163;208,415) explored the preparation of the surface\u000d\u000a      of printed circuit boards using ultrasound in place of harsh chemicals\u000d\u000a      during manufacturing. This work showed that the process was cost effective\u000d\u000a      and, more significantly, replaced the caustic chemicals originally used,\u000d\u000a      with water. Joyce and Mason were also members of a\u000d\u000a      consortium of 13 UK universities funded (&#163;106,650) by the Carbon Trust as\u000d\u000a      part of the Algae Biofuels Challenge. Joyce and Mason's\u000d\u000a      contribution was to develop cost effective techniques to extract oils and\u000d\u000a      valuable co- products from algae using ultrasound and ionic liquids. This\u000d\u000a      research identified that ultrasound can be used to improve significantly\u000d\u000a      the efficiency of the extraction process.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23140","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    This pioneering research has informed NGOs, industry and managers\u000a      about the ecosystem effects of fishing, different fishing gear-habitat\u000a      interactions and the consequences of displacing fishing activity on seabed\u000a      biota as a result of area closures (marine protected areas, MPA). The\u000a      research improved fisheries management in two main areas:\u000a    1) Impacts on fisheries industries and Special Area of Conservation\u000a        management\u000a    The research has been crucial to the development of sustainable\u000a        management of the UK's largest mussel fishery (since 1999) and Isle\u000a      of Man (IoM) (since 2006) and Cardigan Bay (since 2009) scallop\u000a        fisheries, and is ongoing. The research has significant economic\u000a        impacts on these fisheries and improved relationships between\u000a      fishermen, conservation bodies and local governments, as illustrated\u000a      below.\u000a    Through implementation of management strategies, the research has an\u000a      ongoing and direct positive impact on yield for the Menai Strait\u000a      mussel industry. Through reduced losses to crab predation and costs of\u000a      excessive stocking, it has increased harvested mussel:seed ratios by 50%,\u000a      without harmful impacts on the environment1. Importantly, the\u000a      research demonstrated the lack of harmful environmental effects of the\u000a      fishery and allayed the concerns of government regulators (Countryside\u000a      Council for Wales and North Western North Wales Sea Fisheries Committee)\u000a      regarding impacts of the fishery on birds. The research and reports\u000a      delivered by Kaiser et al. continue to provide the science-base for\u000a        new management decisions, area closures and fishery practices.\u000a    Statutory nature conservation bodies, e.g. Countryside Council for Wales\u000a      (CCW)9, Natural England (NE)2, have used Bangor\u000a      research on mussels and scallops to inform policy with respect to\u000a        fishing in Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and other marine\u000a      protected areas. Our quantification of the effects of mussel cultivation\u000a      on diversity of associated benthic communities demonstrated that these\u000a      impacts were entirely restricted to within the cultivated areas. This\u000a      finding has been applied to many management decisions for the\u000a      Menai East and West Fisheries, including the 2009 lease renewals and\u000a      ongoing applications for new and renewed Fishing Orders to Government10.\u000a      Similarly, our Defra-funded research (Kaiser et al. 2006, Hinz et al.\u000a      2011) benefited the relationship between SAC managers (CCW, NE) and Welsh\u000a      Government and provided them with empirical scientific evidence that the\u000a      mussel seed and scallop fishing practices were compatible with the Menai\u000a      Strait (2010), Morecambe Bay (2008) and Cardigan Bay (2009\/2010) SACs and\u000a      therefore could continue without further intervention2.\u000a    Bangor research was fundamental in the reorganisation of the Isle of\u000a        Man scallop fishery since 2006; leading to the first catch quota for\u000a      scallops in Europe (2010), and implementation of five new closed areas to\u000a      underpin sustainable fisheries. It provided the science evidence for a by-\u000a      law introduced in August 2010, critical in protecting the fishery, and for\u000a      improved management3. As a result landings have increased\u000a        by around 30% and scallop abundance has more than doubled. These led\u000a      directly to recent improvements to the processing sector, by justifying\u000a      the long-term &#163;5-M redevelopment of the Isle of Man food park (2012-2014),\u000a      resulting in 30% more jobs in the processing sector within the REF period\u000a      (an additional 100 jobs are expected by 2014). The current value of the\u000a      fishery is in excess of &#163;2.5M and of the entire sector an estimated &#163;12M3.\u000a      In 2011, the fishery won the prestigious Billingsgate Sustainable\u000a      Fisheries award, in recognition of the innovative ways in which it\u000a      implemented research findings towards sustainability.\u000a    In 2010 implementation of the Bangor research evidence led directly to MSC\u000a        accreditation of sustainability of the Menai Strait mussel fishery,\u000a      becoming the first enhanced fishery in the world to be certified1,6.\u000a      The MSC ecolabel provided the industry with access to better quality\u000a      markets and ensured the future of its 20 employees. Accreditation of the\u000a      IoM scallop trawl fishery followed in 20113,6. Close\u000a        linkage of Bangor research with both fisheries is on-going, continuously\u000a        improving knowledge on fishing impacts and advising on best sustainable\u000a        practices1,3. In addition, the research has benefitted\u000a      the majority of benthic fisheries that have passed the MSC assessment\u000a      process, by providing evidence of their environmental footprint, as\u000a      indicated by referencing in the certification reports of a further 28\u000a      MSC-certified fisheries4,6.\u000a    2) Impact on industry sustainable food sourcing and public knowledge\u000a    Global companies cite our research as evidence to inform the public about\u000a      their choices of food origin. For example: our research is central to the\u000a      public documentation of Young's Seafood, the UK's leading frozen fish\u000a      brand with over &#163;200M sales per year7, and it contributes to\u000a      the scientific reference base of 11 fisheries represented on FishSource,\u000a      the global online fisheries database of the Sustainable Fisheries\u000a      Partnership that is used by major seafood buyers to inform on the\u000a      sustainability of fisheries, and other publically-available databases informing\u000a        market supply chains, consumers and retailers on sustainable fish\u000a        sourcing [e.g. 8]. Through this research, Kaiser has become\u000a      established as a world-leading authority in the field as reflected by his\u000a      board membership (since 2006) of the Seafish Industry Authority and board\u000a      membership (since 2012) of the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, and\u000a      his frequent representation in the media as an authority on sustainable\u000a      fishing.\u000a    In 2008, Kaiser and the team supplied the essential expertise that\u000a        allowed the Cooperative supermarket to introduce a risk assessment\u000a        framework for wild caught fish and introduce a sustainable fish sourcing\u000a        policy. In addition to Kaiser's crucial role in the development of\u000a      the policy, the Bangor Research Vessel Prince Madog was used to `launch'\u000a      the brand and help publicise the cooperative approach. The ship, with\u000a      Bangor scientists and journalists on board, was taken to London and up the\u000a      Thames, which exposed the journalists and public to the science behind\u000a      sustainable fisheries and led directly to greater dissemination and public\u000a      awareness of the Cooperative's approach to sustainable fish sourcing. The\u000a      policy is still used today and has formed the cornerstone of the\u000a        Cooperative's pioneering responsible fish sourcing policy, and their\u000a        claims that all own brand fish is responsibly sourced. Since its\u000a      introduction, the Cooperative has twice topped the MCS Supermarket\u000a      Sustainable Fish ratings exercise, and was also named as one of only five\u000a      worldwide recipients of a prestigious Seafood Champion Award for 2010; in\u000a      recognition of their outstanding leadership in promoting environmentally\u000a      responsible seafood, and directly resulting from input from Kaiser's\u000a      research5.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Bangor Research since 1998 has pioneered, through experimental,\u000a      comparative and modelling studies and industry collaborations,\u000a      quantification of the wider ecosystem effects of fishing, specifically on\u000a      seabed habitats. Novel findings gave policy and economic benefits to the\u000a      fishing industry and led to the sustainable, continued profitable\u000a      development of the UK's largest blue mussel fishery and Isle of Man\u000a      scallop fishery, with a combined value of &#163;22M.

Prior to this work,\u000a      virtually no evidence was available for fisheries managers, policy makers\u000a      and conservationists to utilise in assessing fishing impacts on marine\u000a      benthic habitats, potential recovery rates, or to prioritise sustainable\u000a      management and conservation issues. This research has innovated in three\u000a      main areas:\u000a    Main innovations of the research\u000a    a) A global meta-analysis of published empirical studies (Collie\u000a      et al. 2000 &#8212; revised in Kaiser et al. 2006) quantified the mortality rate\u000a      of benthic biota associated with trawling by different fishing gears in\u000a      different habitats. These remain the only quantitative meta-analyses of\u000a      fishing impacts on benthos, and this work provided the essential tool for\u000a      assessing habitat sensitivity and vulnerability to fishing disturbance to\u000a      inform science-based fisheries management plans.\u000a    b) This synthesis also provided the underpinning mortality and recovery\u000a      rates for size-based ecological modelling approaches to predict\u000a        trawling impacts on benthic communities, developed in collaboration\u000a      with the Centre for Environment, Fisheries &amp; Aquaculture Science\u000a      (CEFAS) Lowestoft and Jennings (University of East Anglia) and extended by\u000a      Hiddink in collaboration with Jennings (e.g. Hiddink et al. 2006). We then\u000a      applied this ecological modelling approach to evaluate how different\u000a      management approaches could mitigate the wider ecosystem effects of\u000a        fishing on the seabed through area closures or other measures.\u000a    c) The Menai Strait is home to the UK's largest blue mussel fishery that\u000a      utilises bottom fishing dredges to collect seed mussels from the wild, and\u000a      to harvest the crop from cultivated sub-tidal plots after a period of\u000a      relaying on the seabed. Our research extended into collaborations with\u000a      Government Agencies (Countryside Council for Wales and Natural England)\u000a      and shell-fishing industries to deliver specific advice and management\u000a      tools. Early research (since 1999, NERC-LINK funded) focused on improving\u000a        yield and minimising environmental impacts of the Menai Strait fishery.\u000a      This demonstrated how the implementation of a novel mussel seed stocking\u000a      strategy in the high intertidal areas stimulates thick shell growth,\u000a      thereby reducing losses by predation and improving yield (Beadman et al.,\u000a      2003). We further demonstrated that changes in benthic invertebrate\u000a      communities were restricted to the footprint of the cultivated plots and\u000a      that mussel cultivation had no negative effects on other species but\u000a      enhanced populations of oyster catchers (Beadman et al., 2004). Subsequent\u000a      research (BBSRC-funded) focused on the wider ecosystem effects of\u000a      shellfish cultivation in a restricted body of water, demonstrating the low\u000a      environmental impact of mussel fishing in the Menai Strait and the\u000a      resilience of species and communities on mussel beds. Follow-up research\u000a      to determine optimal mussel stocking densities was funded by Defra and the\u000a      Seafish authority). Similarly, specific research in other important shell\u000a      fishing areas (Isle of Man, Cardigan Bay) has resulted in extensive\u000a      research-based advice to the Isle of Man scallop fishery (IoM Government\u000a      funded) since 2006 and to the management of the Cardigan Bay Special Area\u000a      of Conservation (SAC) with regard to its scallop fishery (e.g. Lambert et\u000a      al. 2011).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23148","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research of Freeman and colleagues has strongly influenced ongoing\u000d\u000a      and major developments in wetlands policy and peatland management and\u000d\u000a      restoration by international organisations, UK government, industry and\u000d\u000a      NGOs.\u000d\u000a    Impact on water Industry\u000d\u000a    Freeman's discovery that peatland degradation is the cause of increasing\u000d\u000a      DOC levels in water provided the explanation to water companies for rising\u000d\u000a      costs of water treatment. It formed the evidence base for strategic\u000d\u000a      planning and management decisions to reduce water DOC levels, through\u000d\u000a      improved land management of peatland catchments, and restoration\u000d\u000a      activities such as ditch blocking. Freeman's findings have made it\u000d\u000a      possible, for the first time, to address these water quality problems at\u000d\u000a      the source; the upland catchments themselves, rather than focusing on\u000d\u000a      costly end-of-pipe technological water treatment solutions. This has\u000d\u000a      directly led to new jobs through the creation of specialised catchment\u000d\u000a      management teams and new water treatment measures by the water industry,\u000d\u000a      including water companies Welsh Water and United Utilities &#8212; improving\u000d\u000a      drinking water quality for at least 5 million households in England and\u000d\u000a      Wales [2]. According to Welsh Water's Operations Director: \"through\u000d\u000a        implementation of management adjustments to rising trends in DOC, every\u000d\u000a        UK customer receiving water from upland catchments, has benefitted from\u000d\u000a        improved water quality through this research\" [2]. The research\u000d\u000a      findings have been the justification for millions of pounds of funding\u000d\u000a      secured by the water companies, and central to further investments driven\u000d\u000a      by their increasing recognition of ecosystem services and the importance\u000d\u000a      of peat carbon storage [1].\u000d\u000a    Impact on international and national wetlands policy and restoration\u000d\u000a        measures\u000d\u000a    As a result of the impact of his 2001 and 2004 Nature papers, Freeman was\u000d\u000a      invited onto several international committees on wetland restoration and,\u000d\u000a      unusually, to act as an international advisor to the US National Science\u000d\u000a      Foundation on the allocation of $36M of funding in the field of climate\u000d\u000a      change and carbon cycling. Freeman's recent work, including his 2013\u000d\u000a      Nature paper, has already had a significant impact on the international\u000d\u000a      debate about the net benefit of using palm oil as a biofuel for climate\u000d\u000a      change mitigation and the role of peatlands in post-2012 climate change\u000d\u000a      legislation in the Kyoto Protocol [10] and is referenced in the 2013\u000d\u000a      Supplement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. Freeman's research was key in\u000d\u000a      underpinning future UK scenario forecasts on water quality and in making\u000d\u000a      the case for the importance of peatland restoration in combatting climate\u000d\u000a      change [e.g. 6-8]. Engagement with UK policy makers has continued to be\u000d\u000a      integral to Freeman's research. E.g., with team member Dr Joanne Clark,\u000d\u000a      Freeman edited a special Issue of Climate Research (\"Climate\u000d\u000a      Change and the British Uplands\", Vol. 45, December 2010) targeted at\u000d\u000a      informing policy makers about safeguarding wetland ecosystem services\u000d\u000a      (water purification, C storage and mitigating climate change) [7]. The\u000d\u000a      Welsh Assembly Government has used the research repeatedly in identifying\u000d\u000a      further research needs and developing policy on natural resource planning\u000d\u000a      since 2008, such as the agri-environment scheme, Glastir, and the Welsh\u000d\u000a      Soils Action Plan [3].\u000d\u000a    Impact on peatland conservation and restoration measures\u000d\u000a    Freeman's research has provided a scientific evidence base for land\u000d\u000a      conservation managers, trusts and NGOs, often in close collaboration with\u000d\u000a      water companies, for their decisions to focus resources and efforts\u000d\u000a      towards peatland conservation and restoration [1,2]. In particular, the\u000d\u000a      resulting knowledge of the enzymic \"latch\" had a major global impact &#8212; the\u000d\u000a      role of phenol oxidase inhibition for C sequestration in peat has \"helped\u000a        conservation bodies to demonstrate the need for early restoration work\u000d\u000a        to bring peatland sites into the best possible condition\" [4]. It\u000d\u000a      has evidenced one of the most feasible means to reduce degradation and C\u000d\u000a      loss from C-rich wetlands through ditch blocking and floatable organic\u000d\u000a      structures that capture inorganic pollutants by making use of the enzymic\u000d\u000a      latch system (patent pending). This has justified significant funding for\u000d\u000a      peatland restoration in intensively managed catchments [1,4,9] and by the\u000d\u000a      peat moss industry internationally [5]. For example, the Llyn Fens LIFE+\u000d\u000a      project awarded to the Countryside Council for Wales (2009-2014) that\u000d\u000a      restores 751 ha of important European wetland habitat, makes extensive use\u000d\u000a      of constructed wetland technology developed by Freeman to help intercept\u000d\u000a      and retain nutrient inputs to semi-natural wetland sites, and draws on\u000d\u000a      Freeman's expertise by incorporating practical recommendations on\u000d\u000a      restoration techniques from his research [4,9]. Freeman's research led\u000d\u000a      directly to acknowledgment of the important function of peatlands in water\u000d\u000a      purification, C storage and combatting climate change, leading directly to\u000d\u000a      improved conservation, with consequences for increased biodiversity value\u000d\u000a      and ecosystem services, of these globally important habitats [4]. As an\u000d\u000a      example of the international impact of this work: the Canadian Sphagnum\u000d\u000a      Peat Moss Association, dedicated to preservation and responsible\u000d\u000a      harvesting of Canadian peatlands, has in March 2013 commenced the world's\u000d\u000a      first large-scale field trials of the enzymic latch approach, investing a\u000d\u000a      total of $175,000 in the approach to improve peatland re-vegetation and\u000d\u000a      increase C-sequestration [5].\u000d\u000a    Impact on public awareness\u000d\u000a    The findings of Freeman's research have been disseminated widely in the\u000d\u000a      public arena. He has a consistent record of high level engagement with\u000d\u000a      stakeholders and peer recognition for his research achievements since 1997\u000d\u000a      which has, cumulatively, led to the major impact of his research since\u000d\u000a      2008 on stakeholder and public awareness. Freeman was awarded the Lindeman\u000d\u000a      Award of the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography (1997),\u000d\u000a      invited by Lord May, Past President of the Royal Society, to discuss\u000d\u000a      research with HRH Prince of Wales (2001), awarded the Royal Society Brian\u000d\u000a      Mercer Feasibility Award (2004), invited to the Queen's Reception for\u000d\u000a      Scientists (2005) and awarded the Royal Society Mullard Medal (2007) in\u000d\u000a      recognition of his significant contributions to knowledge on climate\u000d\u000a      change and the importance of peatlands and to the significance of this\u000d\u000a      work for national prosperity. In 2013, Freeman was elected a Fellow of the\u000d\u000a      Society of Wetland Scientists, based in the USA: something that had only\u000d\u000a      happened 23 times since 1980 within an organisation of 3500 members. His\u000d\u000a      research has been featured before and since 2008 in articles by the BBC\u000d\u000a      and Huffington Post and on television. Continued viewings of his footage\u000d\u000a      on YouTube [10] (over 7000 views since 2008) reflect an ever-increasing\u000d\u000a      impact on public awareness of the importance of peatland conservation.\u000d\u000a      According to the principal Peatland Ecologist of the Countryside Council\u000d\u000a      for Wales (now Natural Resources Wales), the fact that \"someone of\u000d\u000a        Freeman's reputation and status actually uses publically owned\u000d\u000a        conservation sites as research facilities helps make the case for the\u000d\u000a        retention of these very important but quite expensive to run assets\"\u000d\u000a      [4]. Therefore, in addition to the research itself, the prestigious\u000d\u000a      reputation Freeman has gained, is in itself contributing to the\u000d\u000a      conservation of these important areas [4].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Our research has impacted on UK and international policy on\u000d\u000a      peatland\/wetland conservation and restoration for climate change\u000d\u000a      mitigation and water purification, by showing how peatlands function as a\u000d\u000a      major global carbon sink and regulator of climate and water quality.\u000d\u000a      Additionally, our discovery that peatland carbon release, from local to\u000d\u000a      global scales, is controlled by a single enzyme system has provided a tool\u000d\u000a      to prevent carbon loss from degraded peat.

Jones (Research Officer May 1990 &#8212;\u000d\u000a      October 2000) and Dr M.A. Lock (Reader at Bangor since October 1988,\u000d\u000a      Honorary Reader since September 2007), identified experimental procedures\u000d\u000a      that can overcome the interferences on microbial activity that are\u000d\u000a      responsible for the lack of degradation of organic matter in peat. This\u000d\u000a      breakthrough opened up the entire field of peatland enzymology,\u000d\u000a      revolutionising our understanding of the regulation of peatland carbon\u000d\u000a      cycling. Their subsequent research has shown that phenolic compounds\u000d\u000a      suppress soil microbial metabolism and impair decomposition, fostering\u000d\u000a      sequestration of a vast global peatland carbon store (455 Gt), whilst\u000d\u000a      occupying just 3% of the Earth's land area (Freeman, P.I. with Royal\u000d\u000a      Society, NERC and Leverhulme Trust funding). Freeman and Dr N. Fenner\u000d\u000a      (Research Officer since 2003, Lecturer since January 2011) found that\u000d\u000a      exports of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from peatland have approximately\u000d\u000a      doubled since 1988, and are predicted to increase further with global\u000d\u000a      warming (Freeman et al. 2001a). This trend is being accelerated by\u000d\u000a      increased primary production, including the impact of elevated CO2\u000d\u000a      (Freeman et al. 2004). They subsequently discovered synergy\u000d\u000a      between elevated-CO2 and warming effects on the rate of\u000d\u000a      peatland C cycling, now interpretable through their finding that Sphagnum\u000d\u000a      retains C for orders of magnitude longer than vascular plant species.\u000d\u000a      Since elevated CO2 greatly favours vascular plants over Sphagnum,\u000d\u000a      they predict a further acceleration of C losses (Fenner et al.\u000d\u000a      2007).\u000d\u000a    Freeman discovered the mechanism controlling peatland C losses through\u000d\u000a      decomposition of organic matter: phenol oxidase is one of the few enzymes\u000d\u000a      capable of eliminating phenolic inhibitors (Freeman et al. 2001b).\u000d\u000a      The team then made the first molecular study of enzymes in peatlands\u000d\u000a      (Fenner et al. 2005), discovering that drought increased the\u000d\u000a      diversity of microbes able to eliminate phenolic inhibitors, further\u000d\u000a      undermining the stability of peatland C stores. They showed that this\u000d\u000a      effect is compounded by increased N deposition, promoting both DOC- and CO2-mobilisation\u000a(Bragrazza\u000a      et al. 2006). The importance of this research has been recognised\u000d\u000a      by prestigious funding from the Royal Society and Wolfson Foundation to\u000d\u000a      establish a carbon capture laboratory (2010). The &#163;398k grant was the\u000d\u000a      largest that the committee has awarded to date.\u000d\u000a    Recently, the research has extended to tropical peatlands, one of the\u000d\u000a      planet's largest terrestrial C stores. Findings have demonstrated that\u000d\u000a      since 1990, peat-swamp conversion to palm oil plantations in SE Asia is\u000d\u000a      releasing ancient carbon stores previously retained by the enzymic latch,\u000d\u000a      and increasing fluvial C flux by over half of the total fluvial flux from\u000d\u000a      European peatlands, which offsets C-sequestration benefits associated with\u000d\u000a      biofuels (Moore et al. 2013).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23612","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"3378535","Name":"Guyana"},{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Degradation of wood by marine wood boring species causes major economic\u000d\u000a      losses world-wide. For example, over &#163;400K was spent recently to remedy\u000d\u000a      damage by marine borers to Yarmouth Pier, Isle of Wight, while in Seattle,\u000d\u000a      repairs of $290M have been required due to borer damage to timbers in the\u000d\u000a      seawall. Traditional wood preservatives, such as chromated copper\u000d\u000a      arsenate, are prohibited in Europe (Commission Directive 2003\/2\/EC) for\u000d\u000a      use in marine construction due to risks to aquatic organisms, and\u000d\u000a      established construction timbers, such as greenheart and ekki, are a\u000d\u000a      diminishing resource. Lesser-utilised species (LUS) and novel treatments\u000d\u000a      therefore need to be evaluated for their suitability in the marine\u000d\u000a      environment.\u000d\u000a    Impact 1. Acceleration of evaluation of protection methods while\u000d\u000a        reducing testing costs\u000d\u000a    The European standard for marine testing of natural durability of wood\u000d\u000a      and the protective value of wood treatments (BS EN 275) requires the\u000d\u000a      exposure and annual inspection of wooden panels in situ for five years.\u000d\u000a      The cost of maintaining each field testing site can be as high as &#8364;12K\u000d\u000a      p.a. (S3) and generation of results is slow. Standard rapid\u000d\u000a      laboratory screening methods were previously available for testing\u000d\u000a      resistance to fungi and wood boring insects, but not to marine wood\u000d\u000a      borers.\u000d\u000a    Cragg's team developed a novel laboratory protocol that quantifies\u000d\u000a      resistance to marine wood borers in naturally durable timbers and timbers\u000d\u000a      with protective treatments. This method has been validated against in situ\u000d\u000a      testing (S1) and confers the ability to perform rapid,\u000d\u000a      statistically-robust evaluations, reducing both the duration and the cost\u000d\u000a      of testing. In 2008, the Timber Research and Development Association\u000d\u000a      (TRADA), with Portsmouth, used this method to expand their portfolio of\u000d\u000a      marine timber testing, generating over &#163;200,000 additional income from\u000d\u000a      contracts with the Forestry Commission of Ghana, the Guyana Forestry\u000d\u000a      Commission and the Environment Agency (S2). Similarly, the method\u000d\u000a      has been used to assess the efficacy of alternative timber modifications\u000d\u000a      on behalf of commercial companies (Kebony ASA, Norway) and to perform\u000d\u000a      rapid iterative evaluation of furfurylation methods on behalf of\u000d\u000a      governmental organisations (Technical Research Institute, Sweden) (S3).\u000a      The suite of methods developed at Portsmouth underpins a current,\u000d\u000a      extensive evaluation programme of novel wood-polymer composites for use in\u000d\u000a      marine construction by a Scandinavian consortium of government and\u000d\u000a      commercial timber organisations.\u000d\u000a    Impact 2. Evidence of durability backs EA procurement policy\u000d\u000a    In 2009, the Environment Agency (EA) and TRADA jointly commissioned\u000d\u000a      Portsmouth researchers to examine the performance of 18 LUS tropical\u000d\u000a      hardwoods, benchmarked against greenheart and ekki. This enabled TRADA to\u000d\u000a      make specific recommendations to its members on specific LUS species as\u000d\u000a      suitable alternatives to greenheart (S1) and the EA to publish\u000d\u000a      (2011) authoritative guidance aimed at structural and civil engineers,\u000d\u000a      design consultants, building contractors, asset managers and procurement\u000d\u000a      professionals (S4). Subsequently, the EA has changed its\u000d\u000a      procurement procedures to include a mandatory requirement to consider LUS\u000d\u000a      and to follow the methodology within the EA guidance. It has also set up a\u000d\u000a      framework contract with two UK-based LUS timber suppliers (this contract\u000d\u000a      is also open to other government agencies and public sector bodies) and\u000d\u000a      has used LUS in a range of freshwater and marine applications that have\u000d\u000a      delivered cost savings and sustained performance (S5).\u000d\u000a    Impact 3. Evaluations have been used to market less well-known timber\u000d\u000a      species Evaluations of the resistance to borer attack of Guyanese timbers\u000d\u000a      conducted at Portsmouth indicated that several LUS performed as well as\u000d\u000a      traditional marine construction species.

As a result,\u000d\u000a      the Mary Rose Trust immediately introduced a number of physical methods of\u000d\u000a      protection against borer attack at the site and initiated an enhanced\u000d\u000a      programme of monitoring (S9).

In 1997, Dr S. Cragg (Reader in Zoology)\u000d\u000a      joined the biodeterioration team, initially working with Dr. R. Eaton\u000d\u000a      (Reader in Biodeterioration, University of Portsmouth 1970-2008). Since\u000d\u000a      2006, Cragg has led a team of Portsmouth-based researchers in this area to\u000d\u000a      develop internationally-recognised expertise in the identification,\u000d\u000a      biology and husbandry of marine wood borers.\u000d\u000a    At Portsmouth, Cragg developed quantitative methods for assessing the\u000d\u000a      vulnerability of wood to crustacean wood-borer activity by measuring\u000d\u000a      faecal pellet production rate. Method development involved research on the\u000d\u000a      role of wood surface hardness in conferring resistance to Limnoria\u000d\u000a      attack (1), resulting in the inclusion of a denser,\u000d\u000a      non-durable wood species in routine testing, and the optimisation of\u000d\u000a      environmental and animal-related conditions for the use of L.\u000d\u000a        quadripunctata as a test organism (2). This protocol\u000d\u000a      provided the first standardised laboratory test for the rapid and\u000d\u000a      consistent assessment of the resistance of timbers to attack by Limnoria\u000d\u000a      spp. It was used by the Portsmouth team to evaluate over 60 species of\u000d\u000a      hardwoods from Ghana, Guyana, Guyane, Brazil, South Africa and Europe (3)\u000d\u000a      and to assess a number of alternative wood preservation methods, including\u000d\u000a      epoxy resin treatment, treatment with furfuryl alcohol (furfurylation) and\u000d\u000a      chemical modification (4). Researchers at Portsmouth, under\u000d\u000a      the direction of Cragg, developed an abrasion testing protocol which\u000d\u000a      yielded performance data that complemented the borer resistance\u000d\u000a      measurements. A protocol to test effects of furfurylation on settlement\u000d\u000a      and growth of another category of marine wood borer (shipworm) was\u000d\u000a      developed which demonstrated that furfurylation prevents shipworm growth.\u000d\u000a      The work on marine borers at Portsmouth, and, in particular, the benefits\u000d\u000a      of the protocol, prompted an invitation in 2013 for Cragg to join\u000d\u000a      Technical Committee 38 of the European Standards Commission (CEN) charged\u000d\u000a      with revision of current standards for testing resistance to\u000d\u000a      biodegradation (BS EN 350-1 and 2: 1994). Cragg is giving guidance\u000d\u000a      on predicting performance of wood in the sea for the provisional standard,\u000d\u000a      pEN 350.\u000d\u000a    The research expertise of the Portsmouth team in the ecology and\u000d\u000a      biogeography of wood borers has been used to link laboratory performance\u000d\u000a      data with field assessments, and to predict borer hazard in different\u000d\u000a      areas of the world. The team has demonstrated the importance of life\u000d\u000a      history strategies in borer infestation (5) and the\u000d\u000a      potential of tropical species to arrive in the Mediterranean from the\u000d\u000a      Caribbean and the Red Sea (5, 6). One key crustacean wood-borer, L.\u000a        quadripunctata, was found by Cragg to be invasive, with the\u000d\u000a      potential to spread to further temperate areas (CABI, 2011;\u000d\u000a        Section 4 Source 10). A wood boring bivalve at the Mary Rose wreck\u000d\u000a      site in the Solent was identified by Cragg as a species whose range was\u000d\u000a      expanding northwards, with subsequent implications for conservation of\u000d\u000a      this unique artefact. Another key bivalve borer species was shown to\u000d\u000a      actually be two cryptic species (6), meaning that studies\u000d\u000a      with this nominal species need to be re-evaluated.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23922","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Lettered references relate to corroboration sources in Section 5.\u000d\u000a    Enhanced public engagement with Scotland's cartographic heritage\u000d\u000a     Pathway: Communication of research findings to the public has\u000d\u000a      occurred through:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The publication in September 2011 of a highly successful book, Scotland:\u000d\u000a          Mapping the\u000d\u000a          Nation, for which Withers was co-author with Fleet (National\u000d\u000a        Library of Scotland, NLS) and\u000d\u000a        Wilkes, (Royal Scottish Geographical Society).

Two studies published by Withers\u000d\u000a      in 2001 used this analysis\u000d\u000a      to place Pont's work in intellectual context [1,2].\u000d\u000a    The second phase (1999 - 2004) focussed upon the `Charting the Nation'\u000d\u000a      project, funded in part\u000d\u000a      through the Research Support Libraries Programme.

This led to a shortening of the period and extent of\u000a      closed airspace, which independent sources estimate was affecting up to\u000a      ten million travellers and costing the airline industry up to &#163;130M per\u000a      day [C].\u000a    Strategic planning for future volcanic hazards (Primary Impact)\u000a    Pathway: Thordarson's research on historical Icelandic eruptions\u000a      has underpinned advice to UK Government on the economic, health and\u000a      environmental impacts that may arise from future events that are much\u000a      larger than E2010. In particular, Thordarson was invited to join the UK\u000a      Cabinet Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (SAGE), chaired by the\u000a      Chief Scientific Adviser, during the E2010 eruption.

This work has\u000a      focussed on: the dynamics and effects of very large eruptions; the\u000a      compilation of up-to-date records of historic and Holocene eruptions in\u000a      Iceland; and the use of ground-based data to evaluate state-of-the-art\u000a      atmospheric transport models. Taken collectively, the findings allow\u000a      better understanding and quantification of the risks associated with\u000a      Icelandic volcanism, in terms of both future eruptions and the real-time\u000a      assessment of on-going eruptions.\u000a    Key research findings that underpin the subsequent impact\u000a    The release of volcanic gases during very large volcanic eruptions, of\u000a      which the 1783-84 Laki eruption is an example, have large and widespread\u000a      impacts both within the atmosphere and the land surface environment. Work\u000a      published by Thordarson between 2009 and 2011 utilised computer modelling\u000a      approaches to better quantify potential European mortality in response to\u000a      any future Laki-style eruption [1] and the intricate system\u000a      responses following such events, including impacts on cloud formation,\u000a      which may double the atmospheric perturbation [2,3]. Thordarson\u000a      has also compiled up-to-date records of historic and Holocene eruptions in\u000a      Iceland, which forms the basis of a highly cited 2007 publication\u000a      cataloguing the frequency, style, and magnitude of historical Icelandic\u000a      eruptions and highlighting the need to understand why ash generation by\u000a      explosive eruptions differs by several orders of magnitude between events\u000a      [4].\u000a    Thordarson led and participated in the fundamental responsive research to\u000a      the Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull April 2010 (E2010) eruption, including establishing\u000a      key eruption parameters from ground-based measurements (funded through a\u000a      NERC Emergency Grant with Thordarson as PI). These ground-based studies\u000a      provided the benchmark data to verify and refine the remote sensing\u000a      methods and atmospheric transport models used in real-time assessment and\u000a      predictions of the atmospheric ash loading, all elements crucial to\u000a      determining the restrictions placed on aviation by Icelandic eruptions.\u000a      Research findings published in 2012 by a team including Thordarson,\u000a      Stevenson and colleagues from the University of Iceland showed that\u000a      current remote sensing methods underestimated the atmospheric mass loading\u000a      of ash during the E2010 eruption by an order of magnitude [5].\u000a      Parallel work by Stevenson in partnership with the British Geological\u000a      Survey characterised the ash fallout within the UK and showed that ash\u000a      deposition in the UK was dominated by grains too coarse to be recognised\u000a      by satellite techniques [6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23924","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Lettered references relate to corroboration sources in Section 5.

Three such\u000a      examples are given here:\u000a    \u000a      Applied research by Underhill (encapsulated in output [4], Section 3)\u000a        demonstrated the\u000a        viability of, and formed the basis for, a successful bid in 2003 by\u000a        Xcite Energy Ltd (UK) to\u000a        produce the Bentley oil Field. That this bid was underpinned by the\u000a        Edinburgh research can\u000a        be confirmed by the Chief Operating Officer [A]. The first well\u000a        was drilled in December 2007\u000a        - January 2008 and since then Xcite has continued to develop the site.\u000a        The most recent\u000a        drilling programme, pre-production wells 9\/3b-7 and 7Z (cost ~&#163;10\u000a        million each), began in\u000a        2011 and concluded in September 2012, having flowed for 68 days,\u000a        demonstrating that the\u000a        viscous and heavy oil is movable, as described on the Xcite website [B].\u000a      The Scram Discovery was first made in the Southern North Sea in 1967\u000a        but lay dormant\u000a        primarily because the Upper Permian Zechstein Group carbonate reservoir\u000a        was considered\u000a        anomalous. The applied research by Underhill's group (encapsulated in\u000a        output [6], Section\u000a        3) led directly to Tullow Oil plc (Rep.

High flow rates resulted from the\u000a        optimal exploitation of newly\u000a        interpreted fracture networks derived from 3D seismic methods and this\u000a        led to Tullow\u000a        bringing the field &#8212; now rechristened the Wissey gas field &#8212; on stream\u000a        in August 2008 [D].\u000a      The discovery of carbon dioxide in UKCS license block 49\/30 was\u000a        initially treated as an\u000a        exploration failure, christened Fizzy because of its gas composition.\u000a        The discovery lay\u000a        dormant, passing from one operator to another until it was eventually\u000a        relinquished by Tullow\u000a        in 2008. However, Tullow acted on the implications of Underhill's\u000a        research (encapsulated in\u000a        output [5], Section 3) that such sites could act as carbon storage\u000a        opportunities and\u000a        successfully re-applied for the block in the recent 27th licensing round\u000a        (October 2012)\u000a        [C,E].\u000a    \u000a    Significance and reach:\u000a    \u000a      Independent trade sources confirm that over the period 2011 - 2012\u000a        47,000 barrels of oil\u000a        (value ~$4.7M) were produced at the Bentley Oil Field [F].

This involved\u000a      analysis and joint\u000a      interpretation of well-calibrated analogue and digital geophysical and\u000a      geological data to establish\u000a      correlations in seismic and well data relating to stratigraphic boundaries\u000a      and to elucidate the\u000a      sedimentary and structural processes involved, the latter also being\u000a      informed by studies of outcrop\u000a      from onshore analogues. This body of research has been conducted in close\u000a      collaboration with\u000a      industry, including two sabbatical periods for Underhill (one at BP and\u000a      the other in Norsk Hydro's\u000a      Bergen research facility) during which the research findings were used to\u000a      specifically advance\u000a      understanding and correlation of North Sea reservoirs.\u000a    Key research findings that underpin the subsequent impact\u000a      The fundamental tools used to establish the stratigraphic correlations\u000a      between North Sea\u000a      reservoirs were developed in the 1990s (e.g. Partington et al., 1993).\u000a      This stratigraphic framework\u000a      formed the basis by which the development and evolution of the North Sea\u000a      could be deduced, and\u000a      elucidated the gross depositional environment palaeo-geographies and\u000a      reservoir play `fairways'\u000a      that underpin successful exploration in the North Sea Jurassic to this\u000a      day. A major discovery\u000a      underlying this approach was that the North Sea basin and its associated\u000a      volcanism resulted from\u000a      North Sea doming, rather than the product of rifting, as first described\u000a      in a 1993 study published by\u000a      Underhill [1]. This work made use of a major methodological\u000a      innovation, the extension of previous\u000a      analysis of clastic sand bodies (the reservoir rocks) to shales, which\u000a      enabled the identification of a\u000a      new type of stratigraphic horizon in the form of marine condensed horizons\u000a      [1]. Such `maximum\u000a      flooding events' are useful as correlative tools and also in calibrating\u000a      sea level changes through\u000a      geological time. The use of such features has been important in\u000a      demonstrating the role of fault\u000a      growth and propagation in the North Sea and similar rift systems, as\u000a      described in 1997 - 2000\u000a      publications by the group [2,3].\u000a    Applied research on the North Sea published by Underhill in 2001\u000a      identified a four-way dip closure\u000a      of the Lower Eocene and Upper Palaeocene Dornoch sandstone reservoir,\u000a      resulting from doming\u000a      associated with the initial pulse in the development of the Iceland plume\u000a      [4], a structure now known\u000a      as the Bentley oilfield. Further applied work published by the group in\u000a      2009-2010 demonstrated I)\u000a      the `Fizzy' gas field to be a safe, proven site for carbon storage [5],\u000a      and II) the previously\u000a      unrealised commercial potential of the `Scram' gas field (now known as the\u000a      Wissey gas field) [6].\u000a      This latter work combined geophysical attribute analysis derived from dip\u000a      azimuths and coherency\u000a      obtained through 3D seismic mapping with geological ground-truthing.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23925","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2464461","Name":"Tunisia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Lettered references relate to corroboration sources in Section 5.\u000d\u000a    Economic benefits derived from the MTEM Limited spin-off company\u000d\u000a    Pathway: The successful creation of MTEM Limited in November 2004\u000d\u000a      [A] (funded by &#163;7.4M from three equal investors: HitecVision,\u000d\u000a      Energy Ventures, and Scottish Equity Partners) was a direct result of the\u000d\u000a      initial research and subsequent Proof of Concept work by the Edinburgh\u000d\u000a      research team. In 2007 PGS acquired MTEM Limited for $275M and in August\u000d\u000a      2012 the company became PGS EM Limited [A]. Evidence of the use,\u000d\u000a      application and development by PGS of the MTEM approach, with extensive\u000d\u000a      citation of the underlying research basis, can be found on the PGS website\u000d\u000a      and in PGS technical documents [B].

An MTEM survey conducted in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast\u000d\u000a        of Tunisia in 2008 on behalf of ENI (Italy) showed a resistive target\u000d\u000a        that was drilled immediately, and confirmed the presence of\u000d\u000a        hydrocarbons, as described in subsequent publicly available workshop\u000d\u000a        proceedings [C]. Other offshore surveys over the period 2008 &#8212;\u000d\u000a        June 2013 have shown that apparently promising reservoirs were not\u000d\u000a        resistive and thus not worth drilling. Land surveys over the same period\u000d\u000a        were undertaken in India and over the Athabasca tar sands in Canada, as\u000d\u000a        stated by the President of PGS EM Limited [B]. The marine MTEM\u000d\u000a        system was also used in 2008 over a number of currently producing North\u000d\u000a        Sea fields, including the Harding Field in the UK sector, then owned by\u000d\u000a        BP and Maersk, a repeat of a survey performed in 2007 [D].\u000d\u000a       PGS has invested heavily in R+D related to MTEM technology since\u000d\u000a        2008, with particular emphasis on the development of a fully-towed\u000d\u000a        system for marine applications. The 2012 PGS annual report indicates a\u000d\u000a        total R+D spend across the whole company of $38.3M.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Significance and reach:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a       Over the period January 2008 &#8212; December 2012 there were between 25\u000d\u000a        and 49 MTEM Limited employees in the Edinburgh office, which continues\u000d\u000a        to undertake much of the R+D work. Over this period we estimate that\u000d\u000a        approximately 180 man-years of employment have been undertaken in\u000d\u000a        Edinburgh, with indicative staffing cost figures in excess of $15M, as\u000d\u000a        evidenced in the published company accounts [E]. Furthermore,\u000d\u000a        many former employees at Edinburgh have moved to jobs in PGS's offices\u000d\u000a        in Oslo and Weybridge to work on the development, operation, and\u000d\u000a        marketing of MTEM technology.\u000d\u000a       The 2008 Tunisian application demonstrated the potential of the MTEM\u000d\u000a        method to identify hydrocarbons before drilling. The results of this\u000d\u000a        important commercial application were acknowledged by the oil company\u000d\u000a        ENI (Italy) in 2010 workshop proceedings stating that: \"this\u000d\u000a          represents a first important result that seems to confirm the value of\u000d\u000a          MTEM methodology for relatively deep hydrocarbon exploration purposes\"\u000d\u000a        [B].\u000a\u000d\u000a       The 2008 Harding study established that the MTEM method has the\u000d\u000a        potential to monitor the production of hydrocarbons in a producing\u000d\u000a        field, showing where hydrocarbons are being produced, and where\u000d\u000a        by-passed hydrocarbons remain. This is very important for the production\u000d\u000a        of remaining hydrocarbons in the North Sea, where about one third of the\u000d\u000a        producible reserves remain in-place.

Seismic signals do not distinguish\u000d\u000a      oil-saturated from water-saturated reservoirs, so exploration wells are\u000d\u000a      drilled. Most (~75%) find no hydrocarbons and are \"dry.\" Since\u000d\u000a      hydrocarbons are electrically resistive, whereas salt water is conductive,\u000d\u000a      ElectroMagnetic (EM) methods have the potential to determine fluid content\u000d\u000a      and thus reduce the number of dry wells. Research at the University of\u000d\u000a      Edinburgh since 1999 has focussed on developing an EM approach that works:\u000d\u000a      the Multi-Transient ElectroMagnetic `MTEM' method. This is based on a\u000d\u000a      major research-led innovation: separation of the complete scattered field\u000d\u000a      impulse response from the total measured response by deconvolution &#8212;\u000d\u000a      removing the effect of the measured source time function. This invention\u000d\u000a      was first published as part of a patent application filed by the\u000d\u000a      University of Edinburgh in 2001 and granted in the United States in 2005 [1].\u000d\u000a    Key research findings that underpin the subsequent impact\u000d\u000a      During PhD work under the supervision of Ziolkowski and Hobbs, Wright\u000d\u000a      worked on novel methods to process existing data from a European\u000d\u000a      Commission-funded THERMIE project (1992 - 1998) that was led by\u000d\u000a      Ziolkowski. The resultant analysis, published in 2002, showed a clear\u000d\u000a      horizontal event, corresponding to resistive hydrocarbon gas in an\u000d\u000a      underground gas storage reservoir 500 m beneath the survey line (Figure\u000d\u000a      16, [2]). A critical processing step was to use the impulsive air\u000d\u000a      wave travelling at the speed of light to correct timing errors, of as much\u000d\u000a      as 3 m, generated in the recording system [2]. The Edinburgh team\u000d\u000a      realised immediately that such a method, described as MTEM, had the\u000d\u000a      potential for detecting hydrocarbons from the surface before drilling.\u000d\u000a      Following a successful Scottish Enterprise Proof of Concept project based\u000d\u000a      on a gas storage reservoir in France (2003 - 2004), MTEM Limited was\u000d\u000a      created in November 2004 and continued the French survey in collaboration\u000d\u000a      with Total and the University of Edinburgh. Two key results from these\u000d\u000a      initial surveys, described in a 2007 publication, were suppression of\u000d\u000a      cultural noise &#8212; 50 Hz and its harmonics - and inversion of the\u000d\u000a      deconvolved data to identify the presence of known gas 500 m below the\u000d\u000a      surface [3]. In 2007 - 2009, with &#163;500k DTI funding, BP as\u000d\u000a      collaborator and the University of Edinburgh as subcontractor, MTEM\u000d\u000a      Limited developed time-lapse technology for monitoring production and\u000d\u000a      identifying by-passed hydrocarbons. Two key results, described in a 2010\u000d\u000a      publication on the application of such methods to the North Sea Harding\u000d\u000a      Field, were attenuation of magnetotelluric noise by up to 20 dB, and\u000d\u000a      better repeatability than time-lapse seismic data [4].\u000d\u000a    Petroleum Geo-Services (PGS) acquired MTEM Limited in 2007 and have since\u000d\u000a    developed a fully- towed marine transient EM system for vastly improved data\u000d\u000a    acquisition efficiency. A 2009 trial of this system compared square-wave and\u000d\u000a    Pseudo-Random Binary Sequence (PRBS) source signatures. Ziolkowski and\u000d\u000a    Wright (who returned to the University of Edinburgh in March 2010) analysed\u000d\u000a    these data with J. Mattsson of PGS and showed in a 2011 publication that the\u000d\u000a    PRBS signature was clearly superior both for resolution and for\u000d\u000a    signal-to-noise ratio [5]. Recently published work has described a\u000d\u000a    Bayesian approach to inverting MTEM data, using rock physics models, in\u000d\u000a    order to compute background resistivity models from seismic and well-log\u000d\u000a    data [6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23926","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Lettered references relate to corroboration sources in Section 5.\u000a    Public policy and service provision related to earthquake risk\u000a        reduction (Primary Impact)\u000a    Pathway: The research undertaken by the Edinburgh group led to the\u000a      appointment of Main, as the sole UK representative to the International\u000a      Commission on Earthquake Forecasting for Civil Protection (ICEF), which\u000a      was established following the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake. The Findings and\u000a      Recommendations of ICEF were presented to the public in September 2009 [A]\u000a      and re-affirmed current practice in earthquake forecasting for civil\u000a      protection, including long-term planning for building regulation and the\u000a      lack of accurate prediction methods sufficient to justify general\u000a      evacuation. Recommendations centred on the implications of statistically\u000a      significant but low absolute probability (&lt;1%) forecasts due to\u000a      earthquake clustering, along with the communication of uncertainty in risk\u000a      estimation, topics for which the underpinning research in Section 2 is\u000a      directly relevant. The direct influence of Main's research work on their\u000a      appointment to the panel and its subsequent findings can be verified by\u000a      the chair of ICEF [B], as well as Main's co-authorship of the\u000a      subsequent peer-reviewed scientific report ([5], Section 3). The\u000a      international profile of the ICEF report has then led to multi-national\u000a      developments in public policy and the provision of operational services\u000a      for earthquake forecasting (2011 &#8212; May 2013). The ICEF report was also\u000a      cited in the UK government Foresight programme report (2012) on `Anticipation\u000a        of Geophysical Hazards' [C].\u000a    Significance and reach:\u000a    \u000a      The Italian Department of Civil Protection (DPC) took the ICEF\u000a        recommendations seriously and acted quickly. In a letter to the ICEF in\u000a        June 2012, the head of the Italian DPC wrote \"many DPC activities\u000a          are descending from your findings and recommendations\" which\u000a        include: \"a ten-year research programme on operational earthquake\u000a          forecasting\" and \"one billion Euros in seven years were\u000a          allocated by the Italian Government for seismic prevention\" [D].\u000a        The practical implementation of these commitments can be verified by\u000a        independent experts in Italy [E]. The letter also confirmed that\u000a        DPC had implemented \"your suggestion to convene a special advisory\u000a          structure reporting to the head of DPC...while reorganising the\u000a          Commissione Grande Rischi, appointed by the Prime Minister\" [D],\u000a        which will act to separate scientific advice from operational decision\u000a        making and risk communication.\u000a      The following countries have also made changes to policy and\/or\u000a        service provision based on direct citation of the ICEF report. In 2011 a\u000a        U.S. National Research Council report on National Earthquake Resilience\u000a        called for a program of operational earthquake forecasting [F]\u000a        and in 2012 the U.S. Geologic Survey began such a program [B].\u000a        In 2012, it was confirmed that: I) the \"Russian Geophysical Survey\u000a          has begun a new project on earthquake forecasting in Kamchatka\" [G]\u000a        and II) the Greek national authority for the co-ordination of\u000a        anti-seismic policy would undertake actions for the implementation of\u000a        the ICEF's recommendation. In May 2013, a Japanese government task force\u000a        re-examined hazard mitigation policy for large earthquakes along the\u000a        Nankai trough [H].\u000a    \u000a    Public engagement with, and understanding of, earthquake risk science\u000a        (Secondary Impact)\u000a    Pathway: Following the L'Aquila disaster, legal proceedings were\u000a      begun against the officials involved in communicating the earthquake risks\u000a      and the subsequent trial (in which the ICEF report was cited in evidence\u000a      by the defence team) generated much media discourse.

This\u000a      body of research has provided a clear theoretical framework for the\u000a      practical difficulty of accurately predicting individual earthquakes &#8212;\u000a      `the holy grail of earthquake science' [1,2,3] &#8212; while also\u000a      allowing a finite degree of low-probability forecasts of populations of\u000a      events, including triggering processes [4]. It has established\u000a      appropriate theories and methodologies for the evaluation of long-term\u000a      earthquake hazard [5] and for constrained earthquake nucleation\u000a      processes [2,3]. Based on this wide-ranging expertise, Main was\u000a      also a co- author on the 2011 International Commission on Earthquake\u000a      Forecasting for Civil Protection (ICEF) scientific report [6].\u000a    Key research findings that underpin the subsequent impact\u000a    Research published by Main in 1996 demonstrated that the theory of\u000a      self-organised criticality for earthquake population dynamics had\u000a      significant implications for practical aspects of earthquake hazard\u000a      estimation and earthquake predictability [1]. In summarising a\u000a      subsequent 1999 Nature website debate on earthquake prediction,\u000a      Main concluded that while prospects for the reliable prediction of\u000a      individual earthquakes seemed remote, probabilistic forecasting above the\u000a      background hazard rate was feasible and was consistent with the theory.\u000a    Subsequent work, published between 2003 and 2006, has gone on to\u000a      investigate statistical aspects of earthquake predictability in more\u000a      detail. Quantification of the probability of earthquake clustering by\u000a      triggering as a function of time and distance using global digital\u000a      earthquake data demonstrated and quantified a significant probability gain\u000a      over the random background at distances up to 150 km [4]. In a\u000a      second study, formal statistical model selection techniques in the\u000a      presence of uncertainty have revealed on-going difficulties in the\u000a      practicalities of detecting reliable, statistically significant,\u000a      earthquake precursors, specifically changes in seismic anisotropy [2].\u000a      A third study demonstrated significant epistemic uncertainty to\u000a      probabilistic forecasting of extreme events through the use of a\u000a      frequency-magnitude distribution, by demonstrating that a single\u000a      earthquake &#8212; the 2004 Boxing Day event in Sumatra &#8212; completely changed the\u000a      best-fitting distribution to a pure power law in seismic moment [5].\u000a    Within a complementary rock physics approach, the development of a model\u000a      for the quasi-static nucleation of unstable fracturing and slip has shown\u000a      that such a model can be consistent with those from material science and\u000a      percolation theory [3]. The resulting highly non-linear behaviour\u000a      provides a rationale for the practical difficulty of accurately\u000a      forecasting the failure time in brittle failure events, even in controlled\u000a      laboratory and engineering settings.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23927","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Lettered references relate to corroboration sources in Section 5.\u000a    Improved professional practice related to the financial accounting of\u000a        carbon\u000a    Pathway: The underpinning research findings have had major\u000a      implications for regulatory practice, audit and common agreement on how\u000a      carbon accounting is to proceed in governmental and industrial contexts.\u000a      Pathways to impact were generated through interactions with stakeholder\u000a      institutions, development of international standards and policy, and\u000a      through facilitating communication between financial accounting sectors\u000a      and the carbon markets. These include:\u000a    \u000a      The interview research on the Fungible Carbon project led to\u000a        an invitation in 2009 for Lovell to join the Climate Disclosure\u000a        Standards Board (CDSB) Technical Working Group, an international group\u000a        of accounting and climate change experts drawn from industry,\u000a        accountancy firms and academia [A]. In the aftermath of the Accounting\u000a          for Carbon report, the Executive Director of the CDSB notified\u000a        Lovell that they were interested in formally adding financial accounting\u000a        issues to their agenda. A factual statement provided by the Executive\u000a        Director states that the subsequent (2012) incorporation of financial\u000a        accounting into their work programme was directly underpinned by the\u000a        Edinburgh research [B].\u000a      Lovell has been instrumentally involved in bringing together key\u000a        stakeholders across the CDSB, IETA and IASB over the period 2009 - 2013,\u000a        to resolve the confusing diversity of financial accounting practices and\u000a        to agree best practice standards in the future. Following interest\u000a        within CDSB for developing a voluntary carbon financial accounting\u000a        standard, Lovell contacted the Emission Trading Schemes (ETS) project\u000a        leader at the IASB and in December 2011 led meetings between the IASB\u000a        and the CDSB to discuss such a standard. Lovell also led the submission\u000a        from the CDSB to the 2011 IASB Agenda Consultation, providing\u000a        research-led evidence from the Accounting for Carbon project of\u000a        significant (material) diversity in carbon financial accountancy\u000a        practice and reporting [C]. Following this consultation, in May\u000a        2012 the IASB signalled its renewed support for the ETS project,\u000a        identifying it as a `priority research project' [D]. Further\u000a        corroboration of the underpinning role of the Edinburgh research can be\u000a        provided by the IASB Project Manager [E].\u000a      Lovell also coordinated an Expert Workshop in Edinburgh, held in\u000a        January 2013, for the first time bringing together representatives from\u000a        CDSB and the IETA and also attended by one of the sixteen IASB Board\u000a        Members, as evidenced in the meeting schedule and list of attendees [F].\u000a        The workshop discussed objectives in carbon financial accounting, with\u000a        the aim of resolving uncertainty in standards for carbon financial\u000a        accounting. The workshop led to the notification of the European\u000a        Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG) of the importance of\u000a        variability in carbon financial accounting. Corroboration of this\u000a        interaction and the influence of the Edinburgh workshop can be seen in\u000a        the May 2013 joint response of the CDSB and IETA to an EFRAG draft\u000a        comment paper on ETS, an output agreed at the Expert Workshop [G].\u000a    \u000a    Significance and reach:\u000a      The organisations impacted by the research are of international reach and\u000a      great significance for professional practice in the field of carbon\u000a      accounting.

Lovell has\u000a      been continuously employed in the School of GeoSciences since 2007.\u000a    Research overview and context\u000a      Research by Lovell at Edinburgh has sought to better understand how\u000a      financial accountants classify and disclose greenhouse gas emission\u000a      allowances, why there has been so much variation in how they do this, and\u000a      where they seek advice and guidance in the absence of an existing\u000a      international financial accounting standard. The research centres around\u000a      two inter-related projects. Firstly, `Fungible Carbon' a Nuffield\u000a      Fellowship (2008 - 2013) held by Lovell with Prof. Mackenzie (School of\u000a      Social and Political Science), which involved 20 expert interviews plus\u000a      documentary and pod-cast analysis of the International Accounting\u000a      Standards Board (IASB) Board Meetings and reports of professional\u000a      accountancy bodies. Secondly, `Accounting for Carbon' (2009 -\u000a      2010), which was funded by Association of Chartered Certified Accountants\u000a      (ACCA) and the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) and led\u000a      by Lovell with project partners in the UK and Spain. This project\u000a      principally involved a survey of major European companies participating in\u000a      the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). Across these two\u000a      projects, Lovell has established an international reputation for\u000a      pioneering research on the financial accounting of carbon, exemplified by\u000a      the 2010 publication of a high-profile report of the Accounting for\u000a        Carbon project [1].\u000a    Key research findings that underpin the subsequent impact\u000a      The research identified six important new findings, as described in four\u000a      peer-reviewed studies published over the period 2011 - 2013.\u000a    \u000a      There is significant variation in European financial accounting\u000a        practices for emission allowances and that this diversity hampers the\u000a        effective functioning of the EU ETS because market-relevant information\u000a        is not being disclosed by companies [2].\u000a      There are low levels of corporate disclosure of emission allowances\u000a        amongst the companies surveyed in Europe (ranging from 23% to 77%\u000a        non-disclosure across different accounting categories), despite the fact\u000a        that such differences are material (i.e. financially significant) to\u000a        these companies &#8212; with emission allowances calculated as worth between\u000a        14% and 85% of profit\/loss before tax for a subset of eight European\u000a        companies [2].\u000a      In the continued absence of an international standard for carbon\u000a        financial accounting, accountants are seeking advice and guidance from a\u000a        number of different sources &#8212; specialist industry groups, national\u000a        accounting standard setters, and auditors. The proliferation of regional\u000a        and sectoral standards has the potential to undermine the authority of\u000a        the IASB and makes international standardisation difficult [3].\u000a      There has been limited engagement by financial accounting\u000a        professionals in the early years of carbon market design and operation [4].\u000a      There has been little communication between the professional sectors\u000a        of financial accounting and carbon markets and that this has been shown\u000a        to be a key explanation for the lack of progress towards the development\u000a        of a workable international carbon financial accounting standard [4].\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23928","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1694008","Name":"Philippines"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Lettered references relate to corroboration sources in Section 5.\u000d\u000a    Enhanced public engagement with, and understanding of, climate\u000d\u000a        mitigation by individuals\u000d\u000a    Pathway: One pathway arises through the continuing popularity and\u000d\u000a      influence of the Climate\u000d\u000a        Change Begins at Home book [A], much of the content of which\u000d\u000a      is underpinned by the work\u000d\u000a      encapsulated in research output [1], Section 3.

The study has\u000d\u000a      also gone on to be reproduced in book chapter form in a Royal Society\u000d\u000a      volume [2]. This work\u000d\u000a      established that emission cuts of &gt;80% for the domestic sector were\u000d\u000a      possible via behavioural\u000d\u000a      changes and increased energy efficiency, providing a developed world cut\u000d\u000a      in total emissions from\u000d\u000a      all sectors of approximately 30%. The household-level emission cuts\u000d\u000a      detailed in the research could\u000d\u000a      also be achieved at negative net cost to the individual, with a `climate\u000d\u000a      aware' lifestyle accruing\u000d\u000a      savings of approximately &#163;80k (net present value) over the course of a\u000d\u000a      lifetime [1,2,3].\u000d\u000a      Reay has also investigated climate change mitigation by individuals in\u000d\u000a      specific sectors, including\u000d\u000a      transport, technology, agriculture and waste. Work co-authored by Reay and\u000d\u000a      Grace in 2006\u000d\u000a      focussed on the transport sector and the relationship of emissions with\u000d\u000a      household income [4],\u000d\u000a      identifying a strong correlation between income and transport emissions.\u000d\u000a      Co-authored work by\u000d\u000a    Reay has also examined the role of technology in mitigating emissions\u000d\u000a      from the transport sector,\u000d\u000a      identifying the potential of virtual meetings to significantly reduce\u000d\u000a      business travel emissions [2]. In\u000d\u000a      the agriculture sector, Reay was a lead author for the European Nitrogen\u000d\u000a      Assessment (2008-2011),\u000d\u000a      investigating the potential for, and barriers to, reductions in nitrogen\u000d\u000a      wastage and nitrous\u000d\u000a      oxide emissions through behavioural change [5].

Research at the University of Edinburgh led by\u000a      Patenaude since 2005 has investigated two aspects of such processes.\u000a      Firstly, examining and understanding the techniques available (the\u000a      combination of financial and technical instruments) to meet carbon market\u000a      requirements. This work has led to the development of new ways of\u000a      monitoring and modelling carbon gains and losses in woodlands. Secondly,\u000a      investigating the engagement of business leaders in addressing climate\u000a      change and in responding to carbon markets. This work demonstrated the\u000a      generally low-level awareness of business leaders to: I) the financial\u000a      consequences of climate change, and II) recognising the responsibilities\u000a      attendant upon managing forests as one major risk element in the financial\u000a      and ecosystems services markets.\u000a    Key research findings that underpin the subsequent impact\u000a    In the 2003 IPCC Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land Use Change and\u000a      Forestry protocols, Patenaude summarised the potential of remote sensing,\u000a      especially LiDAR, to quantify carbon gains and losses in woodlands. Pre\u000a      2005 research by Patenaude investigated the potential of such techniques\u000a      to meet the carbon market requirements set by the Kyoto Protocol and\u000a      demonstrated that LiDAR offered the best approach for 3-D accounting of\u000a      carbon, which constituted a significant advance towards the inclusion of\u000a      forest carbon in a global carbon market. Building upon these findings, the\u000a      Edinburgh teams led by Patenaude and Woodhouse have gone on to develop new\u000a      remote-sensing data analysis techniques, as published in 2008 [1]\u000a      and a new multi-spectral canopy LiDAR designed to monitor carbon stocks in\u000a      forests, for which an international patent application was published in\u000a      2009 [2] and demonstration project results were published in 2011\u000a      [3]. These research findings have emphasised the innovative\u000a      potential of LiDAR in forest monitoring applications, such as are those\u000a      required for the UN-led Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest\u000a      Degradation (REDD) programme.\u000a    Research by Patenaude has also investigated the climate change and carbon\u000a      market education available to corporate leaders. A study published in 2011\u000a      demonstrated that meeting the managerial challenges that climate change\u000a      brings requires knowledge which is, currently, poorly addressed in\u000a      business education and in managerial scholarship [4]. The issues\u000a      of deficient education, limited communication, and poor take-up within\u000a      individual sectors were identified &#8212; in a commissioned piece published in\u000a      Nature in 2010 &#8212; as of pressing concern [5]. A second\u000a      commissioned piece, published in 2011, also addressed the risks of forest\u000a      loss for the financial sector, such as those associated with fire, wind,\u000a      pests and diseases, anthropogenic interference and regulation [6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23930","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Lettered references relate to items in Section 5.\u000d\u000a    Public and private sector investment into technologies for CCS\u000d\u000a        (Primary Impact)\u000d\u000a    Pathway: SCCS research outputs, as described in Sections 2 and 3,\u000d\u000a      have been directly used in national and European level policy formation.\u000d\u000a      Furthermore, the research has led to Haszeldine being a recognised CCS\u000d\u000a      expert and advisor, regularly consulted by decision-makers within both\u000d\u000a      government and the electricity generation industry.

Since 1999, Haszeldine has\u000d\u000a      developed in Edinburgh one of the world's leading centres of research\u000d\u000a      expertise on these issues. Work by the group has demonstrated the ability\u000d\u000a      for deep geological storage of carbon around many parts of the globe,\u000d\u000a      including the UK North Sea, demonstrating that it is possible to globally\u000d\u000a      enact Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) to reduce the rate of industrial\u000d\u000a      and power plant emissions to the atmosphere. A &#163;2M award from the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Funding Council in 2010 established the Scottish Centre for Carbon Capture\u000d\u000a      and Storage (SCCS), which has facilitated the continued delivery of CCS\u000d\u000a      research in close collaboration with partners in academia and industry.\u000d\u000a      The global leadership and expertise of Haszeldine is illustrated by a 2009\u000d\u000a      review article commission from Science evaluating the present and\u000d\u000a      future development of CCS globally [1].\u000d\u000a    Key research findings that underpin the subsequent impact\u000d\u000a      Research published in 2006 by Haszeldine demonstrated the ability for deep\u000d\u000a      geological storage of carbon around many parts of the globe [2].\u000d\u000a      Following from this, a 2009 report for the Scottish Government published\u000d\u000a      by SCCS provided the first comprehensive quantification of CO2\u000d\u000a      storage potential around the UK, showing the UK to have 70 x 109\u000d\u000a      tonnes CO2 storage capacity (a figure confirmed in 2012 by the\u000d\u000a      Energy Technologies Institute UKSAP project at &#163;3.5M cost) [3]. A\u000d\u000a      second influential report, undertaken jointly with Arup for the European\u000d\u000a      Commission and published in 2010, produced the first-ever Europe-wide map\u000d\u000a      of onshore and offshore CO2 storage [4].\u000d\u000a    The secure retention of buried CO2 for CCS is vital and has\u000d\u000a      been investigated by the research team from several perspectives. The\u000d\u000a      interrogation of a natural CO2 occurrence deep beneath the UK\u000d\u000a      North Sea, as described in a 2009 study co-authored by Wilkinson and\u000d\u000a      Haszeldine, showed that if the correct geology is chosen then storage site\u000d\u000a      performance can be excellent [5]. In particular, a mud-rock seal\u000d\u000a      in a North Sea oil field has retained natural CO2 for 70 - 80\u000d\u000a      million years, with chemical changes due to CO2 penetration\u000d\u000a      limited to just 12m above the porous reservoir, giving high confidence in\u000d\u000a      engineered storage of CO2 for times of tens of thousands of\u000d\u000a      years. This study established the potential for the UK North Sea to become\u000d\u000a      a CO2 storage hub for the entire EU. A complementary 2011\u000d\u000a      study, co-authored by Wood and Haszeldine, examined natural carbon storage\u000d\u000a      sites in Italy and showed that even if engineered CO2 stores do\u000d\u000a      leak, the surface impact is very small, with associated death rates less\u000d\u000a      than 36x10-6 [6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23931","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3582678","Name":"Belize"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Lettered references relate to corroboration sources in Section 5.\u000d\u000a    Improved provision of environmental services in Belize\u000d\u000a    Pathway: Darwin Initiative grants require that the research should\u000d\u000a      create information and\u000d\u000a      resources that will have lasting impact in the host country.

However, the botany\u000d\u000a      of the lowland savannas of\u000d\u000a      Belize was relatively unexplored until 1996 when an expedition led by\u000d\u000a      Stuart, Furley and\u000d\u000a      Bridgewater, a tropical ecologist at the Royal Botanical Gardens Edinburgh\u000d\u000a      (RBGE), discovered a\u000d\u000a      unique diversity of plant species in this region [2,3].

During\u000d\u000a      this work (2009-2012), Goodwin and Lopez of UB worked with Stuart and\u000d\u000a      Furley to catalogue over\u000d\u000a      10,000 plant specimens. As a result of these surveys, 54 plant species\u000d\u000a      were found for the first time\u000d\u000a      in Belize [6]. Savannas were shown to contain approximately 33% of\u000d\u000a      the total floristic diversity of\u000d\u000a      the country and, importantly, 43% of all national endemic species [6].\u000d\u000a      The findings from this\u000d\u000a      research have challenged the popular impression of savannas as areas of\u000d\u000a      low biodiversity and\u000d\u000a      established the importance of this ecosystem for the plant diversity of\u000d\u000a      Belize.

Through extensive forest plot networks and linked\u000a      remote-sensing observations, research by the Edinburgh group\u000a      (2004-present) has better quantified carbon stocks in a range of African\u000a      environments, notably miombo woodlands and mangroves, which has led to\u000a      production of the first digital maps of forest degradation with\u000a      uncertainty estimates.\u000a    Key research findings that underpin the subsequent impact\u000a    In 2004, Grace, Williams and Ryan initiated a series of Permanent Sample\u000a      Plots (PSP) in Mozambique to monitor biodiversity, forest structure and\u000a      biomass, and soil carbon stocks [1]. Further plots were then\u000a      established in Kenya (2007, Mencuccini) and Tanzania (2011, Williams,\u000a      Ryan). These plot networks constitute the longest running and most\u000a      extensive within the 2.7 M km2 of southern African miombo\u000a      woodland \/ mangroves. Experimental fire research on the vulnerability of\u000a      stems in the miombo has been linked to a forest gap model, in order to\u000a      characterise fire effects on biomass dynamics. Results from Mozambique,\u000a      published in 2011, indicate that fire is a major driver of biomass loss in\u000a      woodlands and that fire management to reduce intensity and likelihood of\u000a      loss of large stems is a potentially viable method to enhance carbon\u000a      stocks [2]. Field campaigns led by Mitchard between 2007-2012 in\u000a      tropical forests in Cameroon, Uganda and Gabon set up and re-measured PSPs\u000a      (including a plot in Uganda first measured in 1932), which revealed\u000a      significant changes in vegetation structure. In 2009 Mitchard published\u000a      the first study comparing radar backscatter-biomass relationships across\u000a      multiple sites in the tropics, showing significant similarity in the fit\u000a      across four different forest-savanna boundary and woodland sites [3].\u000a      Mitchard also played a key role in a subsequent NASA-led study that\u000a      produced a pan-tropical biomass map at an unprecedented 1 km resolution [4].\u000a      Work published by Ryan and the Edinburgh team in 2012 showed how radar\u000a      data allows landscapes to be characterised for forest degradation [5].\u000a      Research involving Mencuccini has extended these techniques into mangrove\u000a      ecosystems, which are notoriously difficult to restore after degradation,\u000a      with a 2010 publication showing the positive impact of species diversity\u000a      on mangrove ecosystem recovery following deforestation [6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"25249","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2245662","Name":"Senegal"},{"GeoNamesId":"357994","Name":"Egypt"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Impacts on production and industry\u000a      Results were presented to Technical Directors of all major supermarkets in\u000a      2008, and as a result a\u000a      number (e.g. Waitrose, Marks &amp; Spencer) used the findings as an evidence-base\u000a        to modify\u000a        sourcing policy and production chains to account for complex\u000a      relationships between food\u000a      production and GHGE2,8.

RELU highlighted the\u000a      project as an exemplary case study for\u000a      researchers linking to industry bodies6.\u000a    This research created a spin-out company (Footprints for Food - F4F) in\u000a      2009. The activity to date\u000a      of F4F identifies the major hotspots of energy waste and has calculated\u000a      GHGE for commercial\u000a      clients on over 200 horticultural products and production pathways\u000a      worldwide. This continues to\u000a      feed directly into the practices of major producers, distributors and\u000a      supermarkets, catalysing policy\u000a      changes and measures to reduce carbon footprints and improve food\u000a        production efficiency1,2.\u000a    Specific examples of impact of the Bangor research and consequent F4F\u000a      activity include changes\u000a      in policy implemented by G's Fresh, the UK's largest fruit and vegetable\u000a      production and distribution\u000a      company (yearly turnover &#163;350M)1. For example, in 2008\/9 G's\u000a      developed its salad onion\u000a      production in Senegal with transport by ship to replace air-freight supply\u000a      from Mexico and Egypt.\u000a      This reduced GHGE by nearly 8000 kg CO \/tonne of produce (over 90%)1.\u000a      In collaboration with\u000a      2 Marks &amp; Spencer, G's introduced a new plastic grocery jar\u000a      for 18 products in 2010, that the\u000a        Bangor methodology shows to reduce GHGE by 50% compared with\u000a      traditional glass jars. As a\u000a      further impact, informed by the Bangor carbon footprinting model, in 2011\u000a      G's improved storage\u000a      efficiency by their UK onion growers: this has already delivered\u000a      reductions of up to 10% in carbon\u000a      emissions for numerous growers. The Bangor carbon footprint analysis has\u000a      also increased the\u000a      focus on waste reduction and recycling which has resulted in a reduction\u000a      of landfill waste of over\u000a      15%. Combined, these and other measures resulting from the Bangor research\u000a      and carbon\u000a      footprinting analyses provided the catalyst for, and made a major\u000a        contribution to, G's\u000a        progress towards a target of 30% reduction in GHGE by 2020, through\u000a      improving production\u000a      efficiency and sustainable, low-carbon product sourcing and transport1.\u000a    The benefit of this research perceived by its commercial beneficiaries is\u000a      indicated by their\u000a      investment in further Bangor research: (1) G's funded a Bangor PhD\u000a      (2010-2013) investigating\u000a      GHGE reduction and enhancing economic and environmental sustainability1.\u000a      (2) Waitrose\u000a      Supermarkets have funded since 2008 Bangor research and extension of\u000a      carbon footprinting into\u000a      glasshouse crops, air freight legumes and tropical fruit. Evaluation of a\u000a      total of 50 fruit, vegetable\u000a      and horticultural products by F4F has led to reductions in the carbon\u000a        footprint of Waitrose and\u000a        its suppliers2. In 2010, Waitrose disseminated the\u000a      research findings to its entire supply base, e.g.\u000a      through specific meetings with growers, suppliers and Waitrose managers,\u000a      with presentations by\u000a      Bangor scientists and F4F to adapt methods of crop production and handling\u000a      to minimise GHGE.\u000a      The research also provided evidence to justify long-term investments\u000a        in environmental\u000a        improvements made by Waitrose, such as changing refrigerant gases\u000a      used to chill products2.\u000a    Impacts on the process of policy development\u000a      Bangor's research was presented to the Welsh Assembly Government9\u000a      (2010) and the House of\u000a      Commons3 (2012), and was part of the RELU response to the Defra\u000a      discussion paper on shaping\u000a      the nature of England10 (2010). Findings on the use of food\u000a      miles and the implications of carbon\u000a      labelling for sustainable and ethical aspects of food sourcing were\u000a      highlighted as future challenges\u000a      to reduce the UK's footprint and formed part of the policy\u000a        recommendations presented in these\u000a      documents3,9,10. Because of the relevance of the research,\u000a      since 2008 GEJ was further invited by\u000a      NGO's to write documentation that informed policy, including Fairtrade\u000a      International, the\u000a      Horticultural Development Society, International Institute for\u000a      Environment and Development and\u000a      Food Ethics Council (e.g. ref. 6). GEJ was invited to co-author the UK\u000a      National Ecosystem\u000a      Assessment 2011, that underlies many of the recommendations being used by\u000a      Defra and adopted\u000a      in the Natural Environment White Paper5, and commissioned for\u000a      several World Bank publications in\u000a      2010 with recommendations on how to make emerging carbon labelling schemes\u000a      fairer for\u000a      developing countries4. As a direct impact of the research and\u000a      its findings, since 2008 he joined\u000a      several Defra committees, including the Food Policy Council, the Fruit and\u000a      Vegetable Task Force\u000a      and the Rural Climate Change Forum.\u000a    Impacts on consumer awareness and debate\u000a      The research was broadly disseminated to the public, e.g. through regular\u000a      RELU briefing papers,\u000a      media coverage (e.g. by BBC, Channel 4 and national newspapers), and\u000a      because of its\u000a      significance for a range of policy-, industry- and public stakeholders,\u000a      since 2008 GEJ was invited to\u000a      speak on various radio shows (e.g. on New Zealand radio, Mar 200911),\u000a      at conferences (e.g. at\u000a      Food Security and Environmental Change, 2008 and The Nutrition Society,\u000a      2009) and debates\u000a      (e.g. RELU's \"Power &amp; Responsibility-Who decides? You decide\"),\u000a      creating enhanced media and\u000a      public understanding of issues surrounding calculation and use of carbon\u000a      footprints of food. RELU\u000a      also promoted the project as one of its major achievements in its\u000a      publications both for stakeholders\u000a      and the general public7,8.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Bangor research has significantly affected vegetable sourcing and\u000a      distribution policies and practice\u000a      of major fresh producers and UK supermarkets.

ESRC grant of\u000a      &#163;869,067, GEJ Principal Investigator) funded by the Rural Economy and Land\u000a      Use (RELU)\u000a      programme. Other Bangor researchers working on the project include Prof.\u000a      David Jones (1996-\u000a      present), Ian Harris (Lecturer at Bangor since 1993) and Dr Paul Cross\u000a      (then PhD student,\u000a      Research Officer 2008-2011, Lecturer 2011-2013, Senior Lecturer\u000a      2013-present). At the time, there\u000a      was considerable uncertainty regarding the environmental impacts of food\u000a      production in different\u000a      countries, and an absence of reliable methods for comparison. \"Food miles\"\u000a      were a commonly used\u000a      and widely accepted indicator of the carbon footprint of food products.\u000a      Accompanied by a strong\u000a      lobby for local food, food miles were symbolic of the negative\u000a      environmental effects of eating\u000a      imported foods, despite the almost complete absence of scientific evidence\u000a      to support or refute\u000a      these claims.\u000a    Bangor led the first ever rigorous Life Cycle Assessment of the entire\u000a        crop production chain,\u000a      including farming, transport, storage and cooking. It included\u000a      measurements of greenhouse gas\u000a      emissions (GHGE) from cabbage and broccoli; peas and beans; lettuce and\u000a      leafy salad grown in\u000a      different locations in the UK, Spain, Kenya and Uganda; interviews with\u000a      focus groups in rural areas\u000a      and a large-scale survey of urban consumers; assessment of farmer\/worker\u000a      health status, and the\u000a      nutritional quality of food produced. Life Cycle Assessment was jointly\u000a      undertaken by Bangor and\u000a      Surrey Universities to test whether environmental impacts of UK-grown food\u000a      were different to those\u000a      grown overseas. Through the RELU project this was reported first in\u000a      working papers and project\u000a      reports (e.g. 2, 6) and then in peer-reviewed papers (e.g. 3, 5).\u000a    Major findings\u000a      The production of vegetables such as lettuce in the UK was shown to\u000a      produce higher GHGE than\u000a      other types of crops such as wheat (6, 5). The rigorous LCA showed that\u000a      there is no\u000a        straightforward relationship between transport distance and the\u000a        environmental impact of\u000a        food or its nutritional status (2). The widely accepted concept of\u000a      \"food miles\" was shown to be\u000a      an inaccurate indicator of GHGE or overall environmental impact of produce\u000a      (2, 3). For example,\u000a      although intercontinental transport of vegetables contributes\u000a      significantly to GHGE, growing\u000a      vegetables in the UK in greenhouses throughout the winter was found to be\u000a      less energy efficient\u000a      than transporting them from Spain where they are grown outside (5).\u000a      Furthermore, the research\u000a      showed that the health of farmers in developing countries was enhanced by\u000a      their participation in\u000a      commercial agriculture for export of vegetables to the UK (1).

Since 2008, over 15\u000d\u000a      companies (including E.On,\u000d\u000a      Scottish Power, and Scotrenewables Tidal Power), have used the test\u000d\u000a      facility at EMEC.\u000d\u000a      Scotrenewables Tidal Power Ltd (SRTP) and associated companies in Orkney\u000d\u000a      now employ over\u000d\u000a      25 people locally having raised over &#163;17m capital in the development tidal\u000d\u000a      turbine designs. Initial\u000d\u000a      designs were developed through a Royal Society of Edinburgh Enterprise\u000d\u000a      Award to an ICIT PhD\u000d\u000a      student. The Fellow, now a senior company spokesman [S2] attests \"My\u000d\u000a        research on the Heriot-Watt\u000d\u000a        Campus provided the vital springboard in the field of marine renewables\".\u000d\u000a      SRTP have\u000d\u000a      developed an innovative floating tidal energy converter known as the\u000d\u000a      Scotrenewables Tidal\u000d\u000a      Turbine. Nine different scale models of the device have been tested\u000d\u000a      extensively over the past 10\u000d\u000a      years both offshore and in laboratory environments. The culmination of\u000d\u000a      this development work has\u000d\u000a      been the construction of the 250kW prototype which weighs 100 tonnes and\u000d\u000a      measures 33 metres\u000d\u000a      long towards the end of 2010. The device was successfully connected to the\u000d\u000a      national grid at the\u000d\u000a      European Marine Energy Centre at the end of March 2011.\u000d\u000a    In March 2010, the Crown Estate announced 1.2GW of marine energy leases\u000d\u000a      in Orkney waters\u000d\u000a      and the wider Pentland Firth, which included an estimated &#163;3 billion of\u000d\u000a      related capital investment, A\u000d\u000a      senior member of Orkney Islands Council [S3], observed that \"none of it\u000d\u000a        would have happened\u000d\u000a        without the foresight of Heriot-Watt University and its presence in\u000d\u000a        Orkney\".\u000d\u000a    Development of Marine Energy: Planning, and socio-economic &amp;\u000d\u000a        environmental impacts\u000d\u000a    European legislators have adopted ambitious policy initiatives relevant\u000d\u000a      for the oceans, seas and\u000d\u000a      coasts, to be implemented in the next 10 to 20 years. These initiatives\u000d\u000a      include the 2008 Marine\u000d\u000a      Strategy Framework Directive (2008\/56\/EC), the 2009 Renewable Energy\u000d\u000a      Directive (2009\/28\/EC)\u000d\u000a      and more recently the Proposal for a Directive to establish a framework\u000d\u000a      for maritime spatial\u000d\u000a      planning and integrated coastal management (COM 2013:133). The MESMA\u000d\u000a      Project deliverables\u000d\u000a      and associated publications make an important contribution to the draft\u000d\u000a      Directive. MESMA\u000d\u000a      research is focused on development of a generic marine spatial planning\u000d\u000a      framework to inform\u000d\u000a      policy and practice in Europe and beyond. The Pentland Firth and Orkney\u000d\u000a      Waters (PFOW). PFOW\u000d\u000a      area is a UK designated `Marine Energy Park' in 2012, and the Marine\u000d\u000a      Spatial Plan is a pilot which\u000d\u000a      sets the standard for all Scottish waters. A member Marine Scotland's\u000d\u000a      Marine staff responsible for\u000d\u000a      managing the development of the Plan [S4] notes the significant \"work\u000d\u000a        put into the workshops and\u000d\u000a        public consultation events during July 2013 [by ICIT] for the Planning\u000d\u000a        Issues and Options and draft\u000d\u000a        Environmental Report consultation papers for the Pentland Firth and\u000d\u000a        Orkney Waters (PFOW)\u000d\u000a        marine spatial plan.

They pay particular\u000d\u000a      attention to ICIT's\u000d\u000a      \"willingness to increase their understanding of end-user needs\" and\u000d\u000a      this has been instrumental in\u000d\u000a      determining \"the extent of future marine renewables development, and\u000d\u000a        clarify our understanding of\u000d\u000a        the ecological impacts of these technologies\".\u000d\u000a    Wider Economic Impacts in Orkney\u000d\u000a    \"Activity at the Orkney campus is predominantly research driven\"\u000d\u000a      and accounts for \"nearly 6% of\u000d\u000a        the Gross Value Added (GVA) of the Orkney economy and supports more than\u000d\u000a        2% of employment\u000d\u000a        on the Islands\" (Biggar Economics 2012[S6]).\u000d\u000a    The Orkney campus has been a particularly significant source of start-up\u000d\u000a      activity.

Across the\u000d\u000a      North East Atlantic, Caribbean and Eastern Pacific, nine Marine Protected\u000d\u000a      Areas (MPAs) have been designated based on HWU research and a further six\u000d\u000a      are under consideration since the inception of the CBD at the 1992 Rio\u000d\u000a      Earth Summit.\u000d\u000a    1. Mair's research with the Colombian government agency Coralina\u000d\u000a      led (in combination with Kerr and Side) to the designation\u000d\u000a      of the San Andres archipelago as a United Nations Man and Biosphere\u000d\u000a      Seaflower Reserve in 2000 (Mitchell et al. 2001 [4]). At the\u000d\u000a      United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity Conference in Nagoya, in\u000d\u000a      October 2010, Coralina won the International Union for the Conservation of\u000d\u000a      Nature's (IUCN) Countdown 2010 Biodiversity Award for the work in San\u000d\u000a      Andres.

HWU researchers (Mair, Sanderson and Lyndon) have a track record of\u000d\u000a      research on temperate biogenic structures that has led to the designation\u000d\u000a      of European MPAs called SACs under the EU Habitats Directive. Before 2008,\u000d\u000a      these have been designated at Loch Sunart, Loch Creran, Loch Duich Long\u000d\u000a      and Alsh and Sullom Voe based on their work. Since 2008, the Isle of Man\u000d\u000a      government have used work by Sanderson and Porter (Cook et al. 2013 [1])\u000d\u000a      as a core component to the permanent protection of 6 km2 of horse mussel\u000d\u000a      (Modiolus modiolus) reef in the Irish Sea. \"This research [Cook et\u000d\u000a      al. 2013 [1]] supported the permanent protection of the reef as part\u000d\u000a        of the Ramsey Marine Nature Reserve, designated in October 2011.\",\u000d\u000a      [S3]. In November 2012, the cold water corals of East Mingulay became part\u000d\u000a      of another MPA of European importance (a candidate SAC) based on Robert's\u000d\u000a      on-going biodiversity research (Roberts et al. 2009 [6]).

Based on a track record of 23 commissioned projects from Scottish\u000d\u000a      Government's scientific and statutory conservation advisors, Scottish\u000d\u000a      Natural Heritage and Marine Scotland Science continue to commission HWU to\u000d\u000a      undertake research, survey and evaluate marine habitats as potential MPAs.\u000d\u000a      Since 2008 research by Lyndon, Mair, Porter, Roberts and Sanderson (and\u000d\u000a      other colleagues) has been key to policy implementation in the form of MPA\u000d\u000a      proposals under the Marine (Scotland) Act (2010) in Blue Mull Sound, Wyre\u000d\u000a      and Rousay Sounds, Noss Head, Southern Trench, Lochs Linnhe, Etive, Leven\u000d\u000a      and Eil (www.scotland.gov.uk\/marineconsultation).\u000d\u000a      A senior marine advisor at Scottish Natural Heritage, [S5] confirms \"HWU\u000d\u000a        involvement in survey, research and assessment ... has contributed to\u000d\u000a        the designation and sustainable management of a number of Special Areas\u000d\u000a        of Conservation (SAC)\".\u000d\u000a    4. Biogenic habitat research by Mair, Porter, Sanderson\u000d\u000a      and Roberts has underpinned MPA policy within the North East\u000d\u000a      Atlantic for 'threatened and\/or declining species and habitats' under the\u000d\u000a      Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East\u000d\u000a      Atlantic (the OSPAR Convention). The research was widely assimilated in\u000d\u000a      assessments published between 2008 and 2010 on the status and key threats\u000d\u000a      for deep water sponge aggregations, horse mussel beds and cold water coral\u000d\u000a      habitats. These assessments have led to an international policy to protect\u000d\u000a      biogenic habitats as 'Priority Marine Habitats' in an MPA network across\u000d\u000a      15 North East Atlantic countries. For deep water sponge aggregations,\u000d\u000a      their significance has been recognised globally through Roberts'\u000d\u000a      work under the United Nations Environment Programme (Section 5: Hogg et\u000d\u000a        al., 2010 [S6]) and these and other habitats have been identified in\u000d\u000a      Ecologically or Biologically Significant Marine Areas (EBSMAs) beyond\u000d\u000a      national jurisdictions in the North-East Atlantic through Roberts'\u000d\u000a      work on the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (Advice\u000d\u000a      Drafting Group June 2013, Copenhagen).\u000d\u000a    5. Research to support sustainable development, especially protected\u000d\u000a      areas, has been enhanced through a programme of outreach. MPA biogenic\u000d\u000a      habitats have been widely promoted at three annual Dunbar Science\u000d\u000a      Festivals (2011-13) by Sanderson, Porter, Mair and Roberts\u000d\u000a      (each &gt;3,000 visitors), the 2013 Orkney International Science Festival\u000d\u000a      (Sanderson, Porter, Mair) and the Edinburgh Science\u000d\u000a      Festival during National Science and Engineering Week in March-April 2013\u000d\u000a      (Mair, Porter, Roberts). Roberts integrated\u000d\u000a      a school visit in the Outer Hebrides (Benbecula) into an MPA research\u000d\u000a      cruise on RV James Cook in May 2012.\u000d\u000a    6. HWU has a strong track record of environmental indicator development\u000d\u000a      under the Water Framework Directive (Fernandes). Research by Lyndon,\u000d\u000a      Mair, Porter Sanderson and Roberts since 2008 has\u000d\u000a      been widely cited in the development of the UKs biodiversity indicators of\u000d\u000a      Good Environmental Status for biogenic structures under the EC Marine\u000d\u000a      Strategy Framework Directive (see section 5: Moffat et al. 2011\u000d\u000a      [S7]), an area where Sanderson provides on-going advice to the UK\u000d\u000a      and EU (through DEFRA and OSPAR Benthic Expert Groups).\u000d\u000a    7. Kerr and Side's research in the Galapagos (e.g. Davos\u000d\u000a      et al. 2007 [2]) provided baseline data (fisheries and\u000d\u000a      socio-economic) for the establishment of the Seaflower biosphere reserve\u000d\u000a      in San Andres and on-going fisheries management in the Galapagos Marine\u000d\u000a      Reserve (GMR). Capacity building exchanges included training for Charles\u000d\u000a      Darwin Research Station (CDRS) and Coralina (San Andres) [S2] research\u000d\u000a      staff at ICIT. Additionally an ICIT PhD student (Alex Hearn) was in post\u000d\u000a      as Co-ordinator of Fisheries Research at CDRS 2002-2008. Kerr was\u000d\u000a      recently invited back to the Galapagos to present at a 2010 UNESCO\u000d\u000a      workshop exploring socio-economic aspects of future management of the GMR.\u000d\u000a    Overall, the beneficiaries of HWUs sustained research into biogenic reef\u000d\u000a      habitats are a number of government agencies, NGOs and communities\u000d\u000a      involved in protected area management throughout Central America and North\u000d\u000a      Western Europe. Sustainable protected area management can be highly\u000d\u000a      socially valuable to communities and economies beyond conventional\u000d\u000a      resource extraction because the ecosystem services of biogenic reefs can,\u000d\u000a      for example, stabilise sediment, maintain water quality and sequester\u000d\u000a      carbon as well as providing human food and recreation.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Based on biogenic reef research at Heriot-Watt University (HWU), nine\u000d\u000a      Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) have been designated and established in the\u000d\u000a      Northeast Atlantic, Caribbean and Eastern Pacific, and a further six are\u000d\u000a      under consideration.

Specifically the models provide better prediction\u000a      of lithologies directly from seismic reflection data, which are the only\u000a      data commonly available in hydrocarbon exploration. Global use of the\u000a      models have steered exploration in rift basins worldwide.\u000a    The combination of concept-driven prediction of reservoir rock\u000a      positioning and timing of deposition with quantitative measurements of\u000a      geometries and architecture has had the threefold impact of (a) success in\u000a      exploration in rift settings, including the South Atlantic conjugate\u000a      margins, North and East Africa, (b) harnessing of additional reserves in\u000a      `near field exploration' that required the linked structural-stratigraphic\u000a      understandings and (c) optimal siting of wells based on the quantitative\u000a      reservoir models made possible through the geometrical databases developed\u000a      from VRGS, thus reducing the number of $50M-$100M wells needed per\u000a      development.\u000a    Pathways to Impact\u000a    I. Research on normal fault growth and syn-rift sedimentation was\u000a      undertaken as part of the Rifts Analogues Project (TRAP) headed by\u000a      Gawthorpe and Hodgetts and funded by Statoil, BP and ConocoPhillips.\u000a      Outcrop observations and measurements from modern and ancient rift\u000a      settings were distilled into tectono-stratigraphic models. This new\u000a      knowledge was embedded into sponsor company workflows through professional\u000a      training workshops in classroom and field and supported by the development\u000a      of numerical modelling procedures. The pathway has been consolidated by\u000a      several generations of project PhDs joining the oil industry.\u000a    II. The Virtual Reality Geological Studio (VRGS) software has being\u000a      commercialised by UMIP (who manage Manchester University's IP portfolio).\u000a      VRGS provides a new innovative tool for reservoir analogue studies to\u000a      generate new sedimentological and structural data and interpretations,\u000a      centered around LiDAR scanning of outcrops. This allows the quick and\u000a      accurate capture of data on reservoir body geometries and spatial\u000a      architecture, which has been used to feed reservoir modelling software\u000a      used by the industry. This has resulted in more realistic reservoir\u000a      models. VRGS has been licenced to Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Fugro\u000a      Robertson for in-house reservoir characterisation and modelling projects\u000a      [A], [B],[C}.\u000a    Reach and Significance of the Impact\u000a    1. The results of the research are embedded in the global exploration\u000a      models of Statoil, for example.\"Innovative new exploration concepts\u000a        have resulted from the research that has led to exploration successes\"\u000a      [D] In addition, the results of this research \"are very much in use in\u000a        defining new exploration plays and concepts, and are recently used for\u000a        the new concession round application in the North Sea and were also used\u000a        for the 27th Concession Round application on\u000a        the UK Continental Shelf\" [D]. The concepts have also directly\u000a      influenced exploration for the last 15 years in BP, who state \"the\u000a        technical impact of this research has been substantial, particularly in\u000a        relation to understanding of depositional processes in rift systems\"\u000a      [E]. The models have been used by the industry in frontier exploration\u000a      along the South Atlantic conjugate margin, with successful new discoveries\u000a      in completely new areas (e.g. French Guyana, Ghana). The new exploration\u000a      models have improved business performance across the exploration sector.\u000a    2. The new concepts for hydrocarbon reservoir prediction have been\u000a      embedded into the professional workforce of many oil companies including\u000a      Statoil and BP by a series of bespoke knowledge transfer training courses\u000a      in Norway, Egypt and Greece. Statoil \"estimate \"that at least 200\u000a        Statoil geoscientists have attended these workshops\" [D]. BP state\u000a      that `the incorporation of integrated structural-stratigraphic rift\u000a        models in BP's in-house training programs has been achieved through\u000a        knowledge transfer from Manchester via field courses for BP over the\u000a        last 15 years [2]. We regard the production of a highly trained\u000a      doctoral workforce for the industry as an impact as well as a pathway to\u000a      impact because it has led to changes in practices and improvements in\u000a      processes. This argument is supported by the UK Government Oil and Gas\u000a      Industrial Strategy and the plans for a NERC Centre for Doctoral Training\u000a      in oil and gas, both of which are responses to an identified skills\u000a      shortage in engineering and geoscience.\u000a    3. The impact of VRGS has been an improved ability to develop models of\u000a      subsurface reservoirs by constraining in outcrop analogues: a) the\u000a      geometry of key stratal surfaces defining the boundaries of reservoir\u000a      zones, and b) the geostatistics of sedimentary bodies that occur within\u000a      the reservoir zones. This has reduced the time taken to capture analogue\u000a      data and has allowed statistically more sophisticated conditioning to be\u000a      developed. The impact is in enabling better and more constrained\u000a      understanding and characterisation of uncertainty in subsurface reservoir\u000a      descriptions, allowing the creation of alternate scenarios. A direct\u000a      application is in refined well placement, where the saving of a single\u000a      well can save $50m - $100m from a development project of commonly 5-50\u000a      wells.\u000a    As explained by BP [E], it is not possible to fully quantify the global\u000a      savings from the increased geological understandings because other factors\u000a      also influence well positioning but the saving of one well per field\u000a      across the industry in which several hundred wells have been completed in\u000a      rift basin prospects over the last 5 years is considerable. When this work\u000a      started, over 200 billion barrels of recoverable hydrocarbons was known to\u000a      be hosted in rift basins and one of the most significant new plays is the\u000a      syn-rift pre-salt succession of the South Atlantic basin, currently\u000a      thought to contain 38 Billion barrels of oil equivalent. With an oil price\u000a      of $100+ per barrel, this is a multi billion dollar industry.\u000a    The research has involved training company personnel in data collection\u000a      and interpretation, placing members of the research team within the\u000a      sponsors' offices for work periods and the employment of the highly\u000a      skilled researchers by the global industry.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Our research has had a global impact on understanding the tectonic\u000a      development and fill of rift basins, providing a predictable spatial and\u000a      temporal template for the distribution of hydrocarbon reservoir rocks.

This work was\u000a      fundamental in turning sequence stratigraphy from a 2-D treatment of\u000a      simple passive margins into a rigorous 3-D analysis of the structural\u000a      template across which accommodation varies in 3-D over time, as function\u000a      of the basic mechanics of crustal stretching [1, 2]. The work has shown\u000a      the importance of relay zones in delivery of sediment into rifts, at\u000a      points of low accommodation (fault tips) and was pivotal in the\u000a      appreciation that depositional dip at the end of a relay can be\u000a      multidirectional. The Group went on to convolve 3-D subsidence uplift\u000a      patterns with eustatic sea level changes and ideas on sediment supply to\u000a      produce the first holistic tectono&#8212;sequence stratigraphic models for rift\u000a      basins [3, 4, 5]. This work provided a deeper understanding of how stratal\u000a      geometries and reservoir rocks are distributed with a rift basin and\u000a      therefore a better prediction of lithologies directly from seismic\u000a      reflection data.\u000a    The work programme was extended to carbonates following appointment of\u000a      Hollis, which has included the linking of fault-related fluid movement to\u000a      dolomitisation, which has predictive power in porosity\/permeability\u000a      generation during diagenesis. Extensive studies of basins across North\u000a      Africa by Redfern (North Africa Research Group) have applied and\u000a      critically tested the concepts [5] and have influenced exploration\u000a      activities across the region.

The development of software (Virtual\u000a        Reality Geological Studio, VRGS) by Hodgetts allows integration and\u000a      interpretation of terrestrial laser scanning, satellite data, digital\u000a      imagery and geological datasets in a series of outcrop analogue studies\u000a      funded by the oil industry, to refine subsurface reservoir models.

Our research showed that improved\u000a      data quality was\u000a      required and highlighted the failings of existing monitoring equipment\u000a      that had neither been\u000a      designed for specific environmental settings nor to function as an\u000a      extensive network. Best practice\u000a      had hitherto consisted of temporally and spatially limited data\u000a      collection. The identification of the\u000a      potential improvement in best practice as provided by a network of Clams\u000a      has led to the claimed\u000a      impact.\u000a    Pathways to Impact\u000a    The research led to establishment of Salamander Ltd in 1996. Its initial\u000a      role was to develop\u000a      commercial products but from 2002 onward, subsequent to licensing the\u000a      products, it became\u000a      specifically to develop methodologies for their use and demonstrate these\u000a      to be \"best practice\". Dr\u000a      Boult founded the company and all the staff have studied at The University\u000a      of Manchester.\u000a      The research allowed specific market opportunities in increasing the\u000a      resolution of environmental\u000a      data to be recognised, and also gave the opportunity to develop and test\u000a      the requisite\u000a      instrumentation in difficult environments (1-6). Initially the research\u000a      contributed in the design and\u000a      development of a data logging system for environmental applications by Dr\u000a      Boult and his team\u000a      including a wide range of sensors (1,2). As these products matured into\u000a      the specific Clams, each a\u000a      patented award-winning device for effective extensive monitoring, research\u000a      continued to contribute\u000a      to development of telemetry systems. The team's research into organic\u000a      contamination of\u000a      sediments (5,6) demonstrated a need for in-situ gas monitoring and\u000a      led to the development of\u000a      GasClam&#174;.\u000a    Research has continued since the development of the Clams into optimal\u000a      product usage to\u000a      optimise data collection, understand the system and maximise the\u000a      cost-benefit (3).\u000a      Iterative interaction between Salamander and ongoing research has\u000a      maximised impact by allowing\u000a      the product to be refined and the market to be identified and developed.\u000a      &#163;600k equity was raised\u000a      by Salamander for product and market development and Hydraclam&#174;\u000a      and ChloroClam&#174; have been\u000a      licensed to Siemens (Hydraclam&#174; UK license 2005 and a\u000a      Chloroclam&#174; global license in 2010,\u000a      revised to a global license for both products in 2012) and GasClam&#174;.to\u000a      Ionscience in 2010.\u000a      Water quality monitoring: Workshops (2011, 2012) involving all UK\u000a      water companies, 100's of\u000a      presentations direct to water companies, to conferences and professional\u000a      bodies in the UK and\u000a      10's globally.\u000a    Ground-gas monitoring: 100's of workshops and presentations in the\u000a      UK to Local Authorities and\u000a      leading environmental consultancies.

Conditions of\u000a      the licensing to Siemens are minimum sales of 35,000 units worldwide by\u000a      2017, this is likely to\u000a      include monitoring water quality for all UK consumers and generating\u000a      royalties of &#163;18m solely from\u000a      the UK. Royalties from Gasclam&#174; were &#163;350k (equivalent to sales\u000a      of &#163;2.8m at the current royalty\u000a      rate). Royalty income can be regarded as Gross Value Added (GVA) and given\u000a      the likely re-investment\u000a      rate and R&amp;D status of Salamander, its activity alone &#8212; not including\u000a      licensees and\u000a      customers &#8212; has been responsible for &#163;2.32m GVA during the ref period [a].\u000a    Salamander has employed 14 people since 1996, also the 2 postdoctoral\u000a      researchers involved in\u000a      the research have become employed by the licensees since 2011. Siemens\u000a      employ several staff\u000a      specifically to manufacture and market the Hydraclam&#174; and\u000a      Chloroclam&#174; [b]. The availability of the\u000a      products has so far resulted in the employment in at least one water\u000a      company being specifically\u000a      related to their use. Furthermore, a consultancy based solely on Gasclam&#174;\u000a      use and employing 7\u000a      people was established in 2010 (www.ground-gassolutions.co.uk),\u000a      also a similar Australian\u000a      company has received major investment and launched in 2013. Thus\u000a      Salamander has had direct\u000a      influence on the sector in providing training and employment to skilled\u000a      technicians and scientists.\u000a    Water monitoring\u000a    Water quality monitoring in-distribution is a regulatory requirement that\u000a      could not be met\u000a      extensively because practicable means were not available, such monitoring\u000a      is also a pre-requisite\u000a      of the type of proactive network maintenance now required to manage an\u000a      ageing asset.\u000a      Consequently the availability and research-led demonstration of the\u000a      utility of Hydraclam&#174; and\u000a      Chloroclam&#174; have had a pervasive impact on the UK water\u000a      industry [b]. At Workshops in 2011 and\u000a      2012 Water Service Providers (WSPs) presented the findings of their trials\u000a      to each other and\u000a      recognised that extensive quality monitoring is possible and that data\u000a      collection will have a cost\u000a      benefit.\u000a    The successful investigations of specific problems have direct impact and\u000a      some WSPs have\u000a      already made general changes in management practices. Severn Trent Water,\u000a      which supplies 8\u000a      million people have made extensive use of Hydraclam to limit disruptions\u000a      to customers supply and\u000a      to minimise expense in mains cleaning. The resulting improved efficiency\u000a      has important financial\u000a      consequences as it has fed through into their Price Review submission to\u000a      OFWAT [b].\u000a      Furthermore, Chloroclam has been successfully used in a large project and\u000a      is now being written\u000a      into Asset Management Plan 6 (AMP) the industry-wide 5 year funding cycle\u000a      [b]. The finished\u000a      product only became available towards the end of AMP5.\u000a    Siemens have invested a significant amount of resource into\u000a      productionisation &#8212; tooling, training\u000a      and calibration rigs at a major Siemens production facility in Poole UK &#8212;\u000a      and marketing [b]. The\u000a      products were presented to the All Party Parliamentary Water Group at the\u000a      House of Lords in 2009\u000a      to showcase proactive network management.\u000a    Gas monitoring\u000a    Gasclam&#174; has changed \"best practice\" in ground-gas monitoring.\u000a      Salamander and UoM were\u000a      funded by Technology Strategy Board 2006-8 to develop and disseminate a\u000a      new methodology for\u000a      ground-gas monitoring, CL:AIRE and an expert advisory group consisting of\u000a      several of the authors\u000a      of present guidance were involved. Use of Gasclam&#174; and\u000a      methodologies using high temporal\u000a      resolution gas concentration data with high time resolution have now\u000a      (2008-2013) been included in\u000a      the latest guidance documents [c-g]. A specific guidance document has also\u000a      been widely\u000a      disseminated in the UK and the USA which defines novel \"purge and recovery\u000a      tests\" and\u000a      \"concentration duration curves\" which are [h] are now widely used. The\u000a      latest ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials)\u000a        Standard \"Evaluating potential hazard due to methane in the\u000a        vadose zone\" has been informed by Gasclam&#174; data; it\u000a        recommends the collection of high temporal\u000a        resolution data and explains its use [i].\u000a      The use of Gasclam&#174; has begun to be recommended by\u000a        regulators e.g Staffordshire Local\u000a        Authorities 2012 [g].

Most recently,\u000a      the research demonstrated\u000a      that high temporal resolution measurements are necessary to fully resolve\u000a      the relationship\u000a      between water turbidity (and hence discolouration) in a distribution\u000a      network, the hydraulic flow\u000a      disturbance and sediment availability (3).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28080","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Context\u000a    Forecasting by the original Met Office's NAME model of the transport and\u000a      deposition of particulate material is crucial to the modelling of natural\u000a      and man-made chemical releases, and nuclear accidents. Without accurate\u000a      representation of particle loss to the surface accurate prediction is\u000a      impossible. The Met Office has national responsibility to provide\u000a      specialist advice about the atmospheric dispersion of chemicals and\u000a      pollutants. NAME is used to provide predictions of release incidents, for\u000a      example the Fukushima nuclear plant failure after tsunami damage in 2011,\u000a      and is used to provide pollutant deposition maps across the UK for DEFRA.\u000a    Low visibility, snowfall and rainfall impact on road, rail, marine and\u000a      airborne transport. Improved prediction of low-visibility events is\u000a      valuable in safety and economic terms. For example, winter-time fogs cause\u000a      flight cancellations due requiring increased spacing between take-off and\u000a      landing slots. To provide such prediction the Met Office has developed a\u000a      simple visibility diagnostic that is computationally efficient for use in\u000a      operational forecasting, routinely used in the transport sector.\u000a    Accurate short-range numerical weather prediction forecasts and\u000a      climatological climate projections of cloud-cover and precipitation are\u000a      central to the Met Office core mission. Inaccurate forecasts of\u000a      stratocumulus cloud cover have a large effect on short range surface\u000a      temperature forecasts, which are important to many customers for Met\u000a      Office models. They are also of great importance to the climate system due\u000a      to radiative effects and potential feedback mechanisms in a perturbed\u000a      climate.

Through the shared facility, Manchester\u000a      aerosol and cloud physics research has been closely linked to Met Office\u000a      providing considerable synergy for many years. By aligning these\u000a      activities with Met Office model development and testing objectives we\u000a      have used our data to directly test the products in the Met Office\u000a      operational model and improve the process descriptions in it.\u000a    In response to Manchester's novel measurements of aerosol composition\u000a      around the UK, the Met Office implemented a new emission source inventory\u000a      and used it to show that the revised predicted aerosol has a significant\u000a      effect on the visibility prediction in the model. This tool was tested and\u000a      shown to operationally robust and is now providing significantly improved\u000a      visibility forecasts compared to the previous model.\u000a    Reach and Significance\u000a    The Met Office is the national weather service provide for the UK and\u000a      services the needs of Government in the areas of Defence, Government\u000a      Services and the Public Weather Service. It received &#163;172m in revenue from\u000a      Government for these activities and is measured annually on its ability to\u000a      meet service targets for its products. Forecasts of rain and snowfall are\u000a      core Met Office model products and Manchester has worked closely with the\u000a      Met Office to ensure that model improvements are tested against measured\u000a      data and strategically developed from such observations. Manchester's\u000a      relationship with the Met Office has been developed over the last decade\u000a      to be the main provider of airborne cloud and aerosol measurements to the\u000a      Met Office for this task. Implementation of Met Office model development\u000a      into the operational products has led to significant improvement in\u000a      predictive skill over this period and this in turn has allowed the Met\u000a      Office to drive growth in commercial revenue in 2011\/12 by 6% to &#163;33m,\u000a      largely in the Commercial Aviation, Utilities, Road and Rail sectors\u000a      (statement B). This revenue can be used as an indication of the worth of\u000a      the operational products to the commercial end-user. Furthermore, the\u000a      worth of Public Service Weather forecasting to the UK economy was\u000a      independently estimated to be &#163;634m in 2007 (statement C) and is not\u000a      foreseen to have reduced across the REF period.\u000a    Manchester research in atmospheric particulate measurements have directly\u000a      fed Met Office models in all relevant processes at all relevant scales. In\u000a      each of the cases detailed below our input has made a major contribution\u000a      to the development of parameterisations within the relevant Met Office\u000a      model and has been evaluated as improving the model performance and\u000a      representation of the underlying physical process beyond the previous\u000a      process treatment. As emphasised by our corroborating Met Office project\u000a      partners, the improvement in model skill attributable to any single\u000a      process improvement is impossible to quantify owing to model complexity.\u000a      However, rigorous stability and accuracy criteria are applied before\u000a      adoption of any process description in Met Office models and each of the\u000a      following have been widely adopted in the appropriate scale of model.\u000a    Impact from the development of the NAME model\u000a    The research contributed to the development of the original Met Office's\u000a      forecasting tool NAME. NAME is used to model a wide range of UK and\u000a      European scale atmospheric dispersion events including chemical and\u000a      radiological releases, pathogen dispersion, greenhouse gas emissions and\u000a      air pollution trend analyses. Customers of the information include Fire\u000a      Brigade, Police, Health Protection Agency, Health Protection, Scotland\u000a      Environment Agency Scottish, Environment Protection Agency, Food Standards\u000a      Agency (statement D)\u000a    Impact of improved Visibility and Precipitation forecasts\u000a    In collaboration with the Met Office, CAS have produced a description of\u000a      the snow size distribution and hence improved the parameterisation within\u000a      the 1.5 km resolution operational NWP model. This new model has produced\u000a      improvements in the forecast skill for snowfall and precipitation issued\u000a      to a wide range of public and private sectors. In recent tests (statement\u000a      E) this new model has been delivered skill scores 30% better than the\u000a      North Atlantic European model and also significantly better than the UK4\u000a      model (statement F). These improvements in forecasting, routinely\u000a      available to the UK population of 70 million, are of major benefit across\u000a      a wide range of activities and public and private sectors. For example the\u000a      cost of the snow to the UK economy was estimate at &#163;500M per day in\u000a      January 2013 (statement G) and improved forecast skill enhances mitigation\u000a      strategies to offset these costs.\u000a    The CAS airborne aerosol measurements (described in the pathway)\u000a      contributed to testing and improvement of the predictive capability of\u000a      atmospheric visibility in the Met Office Operational 1.5 km and 4 km\u000a      resolution NWP models, used since 2008 (statement H). Thus they have been\u000a      able to provide visibility forecasts that are based on the most up to date\u000a      assessments of chemical composition of the aerosol for a host of public\u000a      and private sectors such as military low flying aircraft operations,\u000a      search and rescue, aviation, fisheries, sea freight, coastguard,\u000a      mountaineering, hiking and other recreational activities (statement B).\u000a      One of the stated targets reported annually by the Met Office is the\u000a      accuracy of the Terminal Airfield Forecasts (TAFs), which are made\u000a      available to both civil and military airfields.

This led to development of one of\u000a      the first airborne AMS instruments being installed on the UK FAAM research\u000a      aircraft, and its subsequent use to quantify atmospheric aerosol\u000a      composition around the world (6) with airborne AMS measurements used to\u000a      test visibility prediction in an operational weather forecasting model\u000a      (3). Our direct measurements revealed that the aerosol was a complex\u000a      mixture of organic, sulphate and nitrate with a very different water\u000a      content to the ammonium sulphate previously assumed in the model (6). This\u000a      directly led to development of a new UK emission inventory.

During this\u000a      period, the Met Office's London Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) was\u000a      tasked with delivering information on affected regions of the atmosphere\u000a      to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) using numerical dispersion\u000a      modelling. As a result of these model predictions, the International Civil\u000a      Aviation Organization (ICAO) guidance, based on a zero threshold for ash\u000a      in air, was that it would no longer support service to commercial air\u000a      traffic into the affected region. As a result of the impact on the\u000a      industry, the VAAC predictions became the subject of intense scrutiny from\u000a      the airlines and it became imperative to verify the accuracy of the\u000a      forecasts.\u000a    Pathways to Impact\u000a    The Centre for Atmospheric Sciences has a long track record of developing\u000a      ground based and airborne instruments for sensing aerosol and cloud\u000a      properties and it has applied these to a wide range of atmospheric\u000a      research problems over the last decade and more. This leading research has\u000a      meant CAS hosts the aerosol and cloud physics measurement capability for\u000a      the NERC National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS) on the FAAM\u000a      aircraft in Manchester and was therefore central to the volcanic ash\u000a      response during the eruption. The combination of the development of cloud\u000a      physics probes and lidars and their application has placed this group as\u000a      international leaders in the field and it is this research strength and\u000a      experience that enabled the group to rapidly respond to the National Civil\u000a      Emergency through the novel application of instrumentation and\u000a      interpretation of the data and having the capability to develop the\u000a      methods rapidly at the time of the crisis to apply them to a new research\u000a      problem.\u000a    Prior to the deployment of the FAAM aircraft for the response, the first\u000a      British detection of the ash cloud over the UK was from Manchester's LiDAR\u000a      system at Cardington on 15 April [B]. The data was immediately relayed to\u000a      the Met Office's London Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre. At the Capel Dewi\u000a      field facility, the Raman and mobile DIAL lidars were operated by\u000a      Manchester for NCAS [F] alongside a Met Office sun photometer to derive\u000a      ash mass throughout the eruption. To verify the model predictions during\u000a      the first week of the eruption, the NERC Dornier 228 aircraft was\u000a      mobilised but initially did not have the measurement capability to detect\u000a      ash particles. NERC asked Manchester's Centre for Atmospheric Sciences to\u000a      install and operate its cloud physics probes for this purpose [F]. From\u000a      April 16 until April 23 the Dornier flew five flights into the ash plume.\u000a      These measurements provided initial verification of the Met Office model.\u000a    During the first week of the eruption there was no safe operating limit\u000a      for ash and therefore the no-fly zone was extensive, severely restricting\u000a      air traffic. On April 20 the Civil Aviation (CAA), in cooperation with\u000a      engine manufacturers and regulators, was able to agree new procedures\u000a      which allowed flights into areas of ash with concentrations predicted by\u000a      VAAC to be below 2000 03bcgm-3, with extended maintenance\u000a      procedures to be applied for concentrations above 200 03bcgm-3.\u000a      The CAA technical report [C] details how the technical basis for the\u000a      decision was significantly influenced by the data from Manchester's Centre\u000a      for Atmospheric Science (CAS) airborne and LiDAR measurements.\u000a    The introduction of this safe operating limit set further challenges for\u000a      the Met Office model, which from this point on needed to deliver accurate\u000a      and verifiable ash mass forecasts. CAS performed intensive LiDAR\u000a      monitoring from the Aberystwyth site throughout the period of the\u000a      eruption. These measurements were used by the Met Office, in conjunction\u000a      with its sun photometer, to deliver estimates of ash mass. This ultimately\u000a      provided the main verification of the Met Office model, although as the\u000a      methodology was indirect, direct measurements were still required to\u000a      provide evidence that the approach was robust.\u000a    The Facility for Airborne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM) had its\u000a      aircraft operational by April 20 and flew five flights up until May 18.\u000a      CAS, using the FAAM aircraft, delivered measurements of the size\u000a      distribution of the ash particles and used this to develop a method with\u000a      the Met Office of assessing ash mass. This data, coupled with shape\u000a      analysis delivered by analysis of ash on filters by the Manchester\u000a      researchers, was used to confirm the assumptions made using the ground\u000a      based and satellite remote sensing retrievals of ash mass and so verify\u000a      the Met Office model development. This work increased the model\u000a      reliability and the CAA was able to vastly reduce the region of closed\u000a      airspace, allowing commercial air traffic around northern Europe to be\u000a      effectively re-routed and to return to near full operation.\u000a    Reach and Significance\u000a    Manchester data saves airline industry billions\u000a    The ability of CAS to rapidly respond and provide robust verification,\u000a      allowed policy change to be implemented quickly, leading to a reduction in\u000a      the number of days affected, the total financial losses and also\u000a      disruption to the lives of UK nationals at home and overseas. The shutdown\u000a      of airspace was estimated to cost the airline industry worldwide $400m per\u000a      day at the height of the closures and caused a total loss of revenue to\u000a      the industry of $1.7bn [D]. From April 20 onwards, the new procedures had\u000a      the immediate effect of re-opening airspace and it remained substantially\u000a      open up to the end of the eruption around 21 May except for a brief and\u000a      predicted period between 3 and 5 May. It can be estimated that the\u000a      implementation of the new ash thresholds produced a saving of up to $10bn\u000a      to the global airline industry, based on extrapolating the average daily\u000a      financial losses during the first 6 days before the new thresholds were\u000a      introduced throughout the remaining active phase of the eruption. The\u000a      University of Manchester measurements played a vital role by providing the\u000a      Met Office with verification of their forecast model to allow such a\u000a      threshold to be implemented.\u000a    Manchester team advises Government\u000a    Throughout this time Manchester provided advice directly to the\u000a      Government as Professor Coe was a member of the Government Office for\u000a      Science's Scientific Advisory Group in Emergencies (SAGE), which reported\u000a      through the Chief Scientist to COBRA and the Cabinet Office throughout and\u000a      following the event [E]. SAGE advised the Government of the issues and\u000a      risks surrounding the on-going volcanic ash event, the necessary\u000a      predictive capability at the time and in the future and sought to\u000a      establish the risk of future events. Since June 2012, the responsibility\u000a      for reviewing volcanic ash threat on behalf of the Government has passed\u000a      to the Volcanic Ash Observation Review Group (VAORG), which reports to the\u000a      Department for Transport. Professors Vaughan and Coe are members of VAORG.\u000a      Professor Vaughan has also advised the Met Office on the specification of\u000a      their lidar network and is evaluating the tenders as an external advisor.\u000a    Manchester measurement capability taken up by Met Office Volcano\u000a        Response Aircraft Facility\u000a    An outcome of the SAGE reports was the need for a ground based lidar\u000a      network and an airborne volcano response facility that was capable of\u000a      delivering a similar response to that provided by the FAAM aircraft on a\u000a      continuous, year on year basis. The Met Office has taken on this role and\u000a      commissioned lidars and an aircraft for the purpose. The technologies\u000a      employed are exactly those supplied by Manchester during the response and\u000a      the developed capability is now being maintained operationally should\u000a      further eruptions affect airspace over the UK VAAC region [A].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Technology developed at UoM on clouds and aerosols proved vital in\u000a      deriving ash mass concentrations during the 2010 eruption of the Iceland\u000a      volcano, verifying the Met Office model that was defining the airspace\u000a      exclusion zone and predict ash loadings for the Civil Aviation Authority.\u000a      The shutdown of airspace cost the airline industry worldwide an estimated\u000a      $1.7bn, reaching $400m per day on April 19th.

This was augmented by further research [4, 6] during the\u000a      Eyafyallaj&#246;kull eruption to address specific challenges relevant to ash\u000a      detection. Key findings\/insights were:\u000a    \u000a      Better calibration techniques for cloud particle imager probes. These\u000a        have enabled more accurate measurement of the sizes of cloud particles\u000a        and improved our ability to image them correctly. For example, as cloud\u000a        particles move through the imaging region their images may become\u000a        blurred, leading to mis-sizing.

This is because a dune could migrate on to a pipeline and\u000a      bury it, or migrate away\u000a      from a pipeline and leave it suspended (`free-spanning'), which could\u000a      result in a fracture and a\u000a      damaging leak of oil or gas. Wind-blown sand is also a hazard to pipelines\u000a      as it causes abrasion\u000a      and blocks filters. In addition, safety regulations in the countries\u000a      concerned often demand that\u000a      pipelines be buried to a specific depth (e.g. 2m in Algeria), which is\u000a      difficult to achieve in a mobile\u000a      dune field.\u000a    The method developed by Birkbeck's Vermeesch allows hydrocarbon companies\u000a      to use COSI-Corr\u000a      to identify desert areas with the greatest sand flux (where dunes are most\u000a      active) and areas with\u000a      low sand flux (where dunes are least active). They can then use this\u000a      information to plan the\u000a      location of pipelines and other desert infrastructure to militate against\u000a      damage from wind-blown\u000a      sand.\u000a    The determination of the thickness of active dunes using GPR, as first\u000a      demonstrated in Birkbeck\u000a      research, is also useful to the hydrocarbon industry. It helps to\u000a      constrain pipeline construction cost\u000a      estimates, which depend on the volume of sand that has to be moved during\u000a      construction, and also\u000a      helps determine the safe burial depth for a pipeline. Past practice was to\u000a      route pipelines around\u000a      dune fields, but this is not possible in parts of Arabia and the Sahara\u000a      where oil and gas fields are\u000a      directly overlain by dune fields. Given typical construction costs of\u000a      $1-$5 million per kilometre,\u000a      deviating pipelines is inherently expensive, so it is critical to know the\u000a      safest, most direct route.\u000a    Following publication of the underpinning research and presentations at\u000a      conferences, links were\u000a      formed in 2009 with a geomorphology consultancy, Ebor Geoscience Ltd.,\u000a      which advises the\u000a      hydrocarbon industry on the natural hazards posed by migrating sand dunes.\u000a      This led to a number\u000a      of pilot studies being commissioned by leading hydrocarbon companies to\u000a      evaluate the commercial\u000a      benefits of the new methodologies.\u000a    In 2010, BG commissioned and invested &#163;68,818 in a study (through\u000a      Birkbeck's research office) of\u000a      sand dunes in the Grand Erg Occidental using the GPR method. The aim of\u000a      the study was to\u000a      determine the thickness of active sand dunes within a sand sea where dune\u000a      migration is identified\u000a      as a hazard for oil and gas pipelines and the construction of processing\u000a      facilities. Within the Grand\u000a      Erg Occidental, GPR was used to determine if dune sands were thick enough\u000a      for pipeline\u000a      construction, to test models of dune stratigraphy and to determine if\u000a      there is a layer of mobile\u000a      dunes migrating over older stabilised dunes, as well as to pick sample\u000a      points for OSL dating to\u000a      determine longer-term rates of sand dune migration. The results provided a\u000a      demonstration that the\u000a      methodology is suitable for identifying areas that are most prone to\u000a      wind-blown erosion and sand\u000a      accumulation (i.e. where dunes are most active), as well as for locating\u000a      stable areas that are better\u000a      suited to construction. Companies also commissioned and invested money in\u000a      pilot studies using\u000a      the COSI-Corr method in Algeria and Libya in 2010-11: &#163;13,000 by BP,\u000a      &#163;5,000 by ARUP\u000a      Consulting and &#163;3,500 by Pipeline Routing Ltd.\u000a    The Director of Ebor Geoscience, which served as an intermediary between\u000a      the companies (BP,\u000a      BG, ARUP and Pipeline) and the Birkbeck researchers who conducted the\u000a      pilot studies, reports\u000a      that these studies \"confirmed that GPR and COSI-Corr represent a\u000a      cost-effective way to quantify\u000a      the mobility of sand dunes over annual to millennial time scales,\u000a      providing key constraints on the\u000a      assessment of geo-hazards in arid areas.\" [A]\u000a    Although recent political instability in North Africa has set back many\u000a      new infrastructure projects,\u000a      with some companies withdrawing from the area, companies have recognised\u000a      from the pilot\u000a      studies that these new methods provide an advantage over competitors, and\u000a      have therefore\u000a      adopted the technology. ARUP has used the new techniques on two separate,\u000a      very large multi-million\u000a      pound pipeline engineering projects in the Algerian desert in 2010 (In\u000a      Salah Gas for BP [B]\u000a      and Hassi Ba Hamou for BG [B, C]). Both methodologies were used to inform\u000a      the recommended\u000a      alignment of the route for construction of the pipelines [B]. The work has\u000a      also informed decisions\u000a      that will result in long-term maintenance cost savings, estimated by ARUP\u000a      to be in the order of\u000a      several millions of US dollars. The feedback from their clients (BP and\u000a      BG) on the results of these\u000a      techniques has been very favourable [B]. The Associate Director of ARUP\u000a      reported: \"Our clients\u000a      benefit from application of these techniques through the better informed\u000a      decisions and subsequent\u000a      cost savings that are made by refining the alignment of major\u000a      infrastructure.\" [B]\u000a    Furthermore, as a result of these initial studies and the recognition\u000a      that these methods provide an\u000a      advantage over competitors, companies have changed their practices to\u000a      include assessment of\u000a      future damage by wind-blown sand in their tender documents for\u000a      infrastructure projects in desert\u000a      regions.\u000a    For example, Pipeline Routing Ltd. has changed their business model and\u000a      will include the COSI-Corr\u000a      methodology in future tender documents. In addition, they are developing\u000a      an asset\u000a      management model based on constant modelling of sand dune migration [D].\u000a      The company's\u000a      Director said: \"COSI-Corr has had a tangible impact on our work because we\u000a      can now quantify the\u000a      movement of the `terrain', enabling a classification process to feed in to\u000a      a Geo-Hazard risk register\"\u000a      [D].

This geophysical technique is effective at imaging the\u000a      large-scale sedimentary\u000a      structures in sand dunes, and can also be used to identify buried objects\u000a      within a dune and to\u000a      locate the base of a dune so that its thickness can be estimated.\u000a    Bristow's first GPR study of sand dune stratigraphy, conducted in 1996,\u000a      imaged sedimentary\u000a      structures within dunes in Abu Dhabi, and included a comparison of the\u000a      radar images with\u000a      trenched sections to provide ground truth and to check the accuracy of the\u000a      radar interpretation [1].\u000a      This work was followed by an investigation of the structure of linear\u000a      dunes in Namibia, which found\u000a      clear evidence that this type of dune can migrate laterally [2]. Further\u000a      investigation of the migration\u000a      of sand dunes was then conducted using a novel combination of GPR with\u000a      optically stimulated\u000a      luminescence (OSL), a technique that enables dune sands to be dated. GPR\u000a      profiles were used to\u000a      deduce a relative chronology of the sands within a dune, and then this\u000a      data was used to design an\u000a      efficient strategy for dune dating using OSL [3], enabling the longer-term\u000a      rates of dune migration to\u000a      be determined. This new methodology was then used to document long-term\u000a      (greater than 1,000\u000a      years) dune aggradation and to test models of dune stratigraphy [4]. This\u000a      work was conducted in\u000a      collaboration with Geoff Duller at the University of Wales, who conducted\u000a      the OSL dating, and Nick\u000a      Lancaster at the Desert Research Institute in the US, who participated in\u000a      the fieldwork.\u000a    Whilst the migration of sand dunes over long timescales can be\u000a      effectively quantified using\u000a      Bristow's GPR technique, their short-term dynamics have traditionally been\u000a      monitored through\u000a      detailed field surveys or long-term surveillance of stakes planted in dune\u000a      fields. Recognising that\u000a      short-term surveys are labour and time intensive, Birkbeck's Pieter\u000a      Vermeesch (RCUK Academic\u000a      Fellow 2007-2011; Senior Lecturer 2012) developed a new and more\u000a      convenient approach to\u000a      monitor the speed and sand flux of migrating dunes, building on the\u000a      hand-based methods\u000a      employed by King's College's Nick Drake, who introduced the then-current\u000a      methodology to\u000a      Vermeesch [5]. The approach uses a change detection algorithm, known as\u000a      COSI-Corr (Co-registration\u000a      of Optically Sensed Images and Correlation), that extracts displacement\u000a      fields from\u000a      pairs of optical satellite imagery. COSI-Corr was developed in 2007 by\u000a      Caltech geophysicists\u000a      Sebastien Leprince and Francois Ayoub, and has been applied in various\u000a      fields of geomorphology,\u000a      the most important of which are studies of earthquakes, glaciers and\u000a      slow-moving landslides.\u000a    By applying the COSI-Corr change detection algorithm to pairs of\u000a      high-resolution optical satellite\u000a      images taken at different times, Vermeesch was able to monitor the\u000a      migration of dunes in the\u000a      Bod&#233;l&#233; Depression of northern Chad over time intervals of one month to 6.5\u000a      years [5]. The\u000a      displacement maps generated from each pair of satellite images were then\u000a      used to automatically\u000a      distinguish dunes from interdunes. By interpolating a surface between the\u000a      interdune areas and\u000a      subtracting it from the surface observed by the satellite images, dune\u000a      heights and volumes were\u000a      then obtained over fine spatial and temporal scales. From this,\u000a      pixel-by-pixel estimates of sand flux\u000a      were generated, confirming that the Bod&#233;l&#233; contains some of the world's\u000a      fastest moving dunes [5].\u000a      Dune migration rates are a sensitive proxy for the `effective windiness'\u000a      of desert areas because\u000a      sand flux scales with the cube of wind speed. To take advantage of this\u000a      proxy, Vermeesch\u000a      extended the COSI-Corr algorithm to compare several satellite images\u000a      sequentially. In\u000a      collaboration with Caltech's Sebastien Leprince, who provided access to\u000a      COSI-Corr's source code,\u000a      the new technique was then applied to a 26-year long sequence of archival\u000a      satellite imagery from\u000a      the Bod&#233;l&#233; Depression [6]. The results showed for the first time that dune\u000a      velocity, and therefore\u000a      wind speed, have remained remarkably constant in this region since 1984.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"29358","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research has led to the commercialisation of new pest-control\u000a        products.

In contrast\u000a      to pesticides, at that time no clear risk assessment guidelines existed\u000a      for biological control agents\u000a      (BCAs), impeding their registration and use.\u000a    Butt and Research Assistants Shah (1999-2006) and Wang\u000a      (1999-2004) characterised the\u000a      chemical compounds (metabolites) secreted by the insect-killing fungi Beauveria\u000a        brongniartii and\u000a      Metarhizium anisopliae. They established that these fungi, found\u000a      naturally in soils around the\u000a      world, produce a vast array of metabolites [R2], and that the range of\u000a      compounds (e.g. potentially\u000a      cytotoxic alkaloids and cyclic peptides) produced differed between species\u000a      and strains. They found\u000a      that specific metabolites, such as destruxins, can serve as markers of the\u000a      fungal species. This\u000a      work was funded by the European Union under [G1]. Regulators responsible\u000a      for risk assessment\u000a      and approval of plant protection products require information on all\u000a      metabolites generated by\u000a      insect-killing fungi. Given the large number of metabolites produced by\u000a      the two fungi tested, risk\u000a      assessment would have been prohibitively expensive, and deterred industry\u000a      from developing these\u000a      products. More in depth analysis of the risks of these metabolites was\u000a      investigated and studies\u000a      extended to other species of fungal BCAS. This work was funded by the EU\u000a      [G2]).\u000a    Butt and Research Assistants Skrobek (2001-2011), Wang and Shah\u000a      carried out research to\u000a      determine the potential risk to human and animal health of metabolites\u000a      generated by M. anisopliae\u000a      and other insect-killing fungi, and to establish whether these metabolites\u000a      entered the food chain.\u000a      Specifically, they optimised metabolite isolation methods and evaluated\u000a      different toxicity testing\u000a      systems (using protozoa, crustaceans and other invertebrates) to identify\u000a      the most ecologically\u000a      sensitive indicator species as an ethical and experimentally tractable\u000a      alternative to mammalian\u000a      models [R3, R4]. Following this, they investigated the persistence\u000a      of key fungal metabolites in field\u000a      trials, residues were undetectable in plant and soil samples even at a\u000a      100-fold increased\u000a      application rate. It was concluded that the metabolites would not enter\u000a      the food chain and\u000a      therefore did not pose a risk to human and animal health [R3-R5].\u000a      It was also shown the\u000a      insect-killing fungi examined did not produce genotoxic compounds [R6].\u000a    The research group then determined the quantity of selected metabolites\u000a      in the formulated (spore\u000a      coated rice grain) and unformulated (pure spores) product as well as in\u000a      the insects treated with M.\u000a        anisopliae and how environmental factors contributed to their\u000a      degradation in soil samples [R5, R6].\u000a      Overall, the research showed that metabolites of M. anisopliae and\u000a      other insect-killing fungi did not\u000a      enter the food chain or persist in the environment.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"29570","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2029969","Name":"Mongolia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1282988","Name":"Nepal"},{"GeoNamesId":"1220409","Name":"Tajikistan"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Understanding changing patterns of biodiversity and the ramifications\u000a      those changes have for economies, resource infrastructure, ecosystem\u000a      services, social development and human well-being is central to\u000a      environmental policy. There is growing recognition that biological\u000a      diversity is a global asset of tremendous value to present and future\u000a      generations, and consequently the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)\u000a      has been established as an international legal instrument for the\u000a      conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. All bar six\u000a      nations are signatory to this convention. Research undertaken at IOZ has\u000a      achieved significant impact through its unique contribution to the\u000a      development of environmental and biodiversity policy, particularly under\u000a      the auspices of the CBD, by developing the IUCN Red List and Living Planet\u000a      Index biodiversity indicators that enable better quantified and more\u000a      effective measures to be included in evaluations of biodiversity change [a].\u000a    The IUCN Red List Index and the Living Planet Index were adopted by the\u000a      CBD in 2005 to help measure progress towards the target of `reducing the\u000a      rate of biodiversity loss' by the year 2010 [b], and 193 nations\u000a      are signatory to this globally binding legislation. IOZ research has had\u000a      direct impact in evaluating whether and how the biodiversity target was\u000a      met, linking science directly to global biodiversity policy, and in\u000a      informing countries about how national biodiversity is faring. The\u000a      indicators developed by IOZ underpinned the main CBD report published in\u000a      2010, Global Biodiversity Outlook 3 [c], which evaluated whether\u000a      or not the 2010 target had been reached. They also formed the basis of\u000a      subsequent publications such as the Global Environmental Outlook 5\u000a      (published by United Nations Environment Programme in 2012), of which\u000a      Collen is a co-author, and which has the specific aim of informing\u000a      environmental decision-making and facilitating the interaction between\u000a      science and policy [d].\u000a    Our collaborators at IUCN, through their press releases, reports and\u000a      updates of the IUCN Red List, and WWF International, through the biennial\u000a      publication of the Living Planet Report (e.g. in 2008, 2010, 2012),\u000a      provide evidence of further impact and outreach by raising public\u000a      awareness of the on-going biodiversity crisis affecting the planet. The\u000a      Living Planet Index forms a central part of the Living Planet report,\u000a      which is published biennially, translated into 13 languages, and has a\u000a      print run of 70,000 copies. Free downloads of the PDF number in the\u000a      hundreds of thousands [e].\u000a    As a result of the expertise we have developed through the underpinning\u000a      research described above, and our collaborative work with IUCN and others,\u000a      we have been commissioned to undertake further work on biodiversity\u000a      indicators, with associated impact. For example, the Arctic Council, a\u000a      high-level intergovernmental forum to promote cooperation, coordination\u000a      and interaction among the 10 Arctic nations for the protection of Arctic\u000a      wildlife, commissioned IOZ to evaluate trends in Arctic wildlife,\u000a      culminating in the Arctic biodiversity report produced by IOZ in 2008 in\u000a      collaboration with the Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Program. This\u000a      report used LPI data and methodology to assess trends in Arctic\u000a      biodiversity over a 34-year period, and was endorsed by Senior Officials\u000a      of the Arctic Council [f].\u000a    The abundance and extinction risk monitoring tools developed by IOZ\u000a      researchers are now being used by the UN Convention on Migratory Species\u000a      (CMS), an intergovernmental treaty that aims to conserve terrestrial,\u000a      aquatic and avian migratory species throughout their range. Migratory\u000a      species threatened with extinction are listed on Appendix I of the\u000a      Convention. CMS Parties strive towards strictly protecting these animals,\u000a      conserving or restoring the places where they live, mitigating obstacles\u000a      to migration and controlling other factors that might endanger them. Our\u000a      tools are used to track trends in species listed on the CMS, a vital part\u000a      of their remit and key to measuring the success or otherwise of the policy\u000a      decisions taken under the CMS [g].\u000a    We have been centrally involved in the development of Red Lists at\u000a      national levels. IOZ was involved in the 2009 workshop on the development\u000a      National Red Lists (held at ZSL), and developed the National Red List\u000a      website (the first centralised source of national-level biodiversity data,\u000a      launched in 2010 [h]. IOZ scientists have also worked with\u000a      countries around the world advising on the development of National Red\u000a      Lists (e.g. Nepal 2011, Tajikistan 2010). In Mongolia, National Red List\u000a      data feeds into a tool used for all Environmental Impact Assessments, and\u000a      the resulting website has been adopted by the Ministry of Environment and\u000a      Green Development [i]. National Red Lists have also been included\u000a      in the CBD Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological\u000a      Advice (SBSTTA) 17 draft recommendations [j].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Scientists at the Institute of Zoology (IOZ) led the development of the\u000a      IUCN Red List, the foremost tool for assessing species extinction risk.

National Red Lists, or\u000a      comparable assessments, can also assist with land use planning and\u000a      responsible impact assessments.\u000a    ","Title":"\u000a    Global Biodiversity Indicators for the Convention on Biological Diversity\u000a    ","UKLocation":[],"UKRegion":[],"UOA":"Earth Systems and Environmental Sciences","UnderpinningResearch":"\u000a    In 2002, a meeting of the Convention on Biological Diversity Conference\u000a      of the Parties led to the adoption, by almost all nations, of the target\u000a      of `reducing the rate of biodiversity loss' by the year 2010. This target\u000a      required indicators to quantify changes in biodiversity. Two main avenues\u000a      of research were pursued at IOZ to address this need.\u000a    The first avenue built on work by Professor Georgina Mace (then a\u000a      postdoctoral researcher) to develop the International Union for\u000a      Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List, which was formalised in 1994 [1].\u000a      Mace continued to refine the IUCN criteria and categorisation process\u000a      until 2006 (during which time she became Director of IOZ) [2]. The IUCN\u000a      Red List provides a quantitative means of assessing the relative\u000a      extinction risk of species, is widely recognised as the most comprehensive\u000a      and rigorous approach for evaluating the global conservation status of\u000a      species, and has become the key information resource for fighting the\u000a      current extinction crisis.\u000a    This tool was subsequently developed between 2006 and 2010 by Professor\u000a      Jonathan Baillie and Dr Ben Collen to track changes in extinction risk\u000a      over time, and to generate wider taxonomic coverage (in 2006, most\u000a      extinction risk classifications concerned just birds, mammals and species\u000a      of commercial interest) to answer questions about changing biodiversity\u000a      with greater generality. At the start of this period, Baillie and Collen\u000a      were both members of IOZ's postdoctoral staff, although Baillie later\u000a      became Director of Conservation Programmes at ZSL and Collen subsequently\u000a      led this work as a Research Fellow. The underpinning research involved\u000a      developing a new sampled approach to extinction risk assessment, the\u000a      Sampled Red List Index (SRLI). The SRLI assesses a representative set of\u000a      species from a broader set of groups (including invertebrates and plants)\u000a      in a time and cost effective manner [3, 4]. As a result, the IUCN\u000a      Red List has grown in size and complexity (from 40,000 species assessed in\u000a      2007 to 70,000 species in 2013) and plays an increasingly prominent role\u000a      in guiding conservation activities of governments, NGOs and scientific\u000a      institutions.\u000a    The second avenue, developed by Collen and Baillie over the same period,\u000a      is based on an aggregated indicator of abundance trends: the Living Planet\u000a      Index [5]. The research demonstrated how population abundance\u000a      trend data could be brought together to evaluate whether CBD targets have\u000a      been achieved.\u000a    These two avenues of research were drawn together in several\u000a      publications, culminating in a paper in Sciencem [6],\u000a      which has become the leading article cited to show that the CBD 2010\u000a      Target was not met.\u000a    Collaborations are an integral part of the work on biodiversity\u000a      indicators. For the Red Listing work, IUCN, BirdLife International and the\u000a      Royal Botanic Gardens Kew are key collaborators on the projects mentioned.\u000a      For the work on abundance trends, WWF International are central to the\u000a      developments outlined in this case study. UNEP-WCMC are key proponents of\u000a      global biodiversity indicators, housing the secretariat for the\u000a      Biodiversity Indicators Partnership and dealing with much of the liaison\u000a      with the Convention on Biological Diversity.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"29571","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Between 2008 and 2013, UCL's research into arsenic pollution of\u000a      groundwater has had significant\u000a      impacts on policy, practice and public health security in Bangladesh.\u000a      Specifically, it has guided the\u000a      development and refinement of policy on groundwater pumping in response to\u000a      the groundwater\u000a      arsenic crisis and underpinned practical approaches towards arsenic\u000a      mitigation and groundwater\u000a      monitoring; as a result, it has improved public health security across the\u000a      region. Globally, the\u000a      research has contributed to the development by UNICEF of policies relating\u000a      to the investigation\u000a      and mitigation of arsenic contamination. Key research findings were shared\u000a      widely with\u000a      stakeholders beyond academia, partly as a natural outcome of the\u000a      collaborative nature of the\u000a      research, to which Bangladesh government departments and NGOs contributed\u000a      through their\u000a      provision of access and data. The reach of the impact was further extended\u000a      by UCL contributions\u000a      to national meetings and workshops in Bangladesh, including a workshop\u000a      titled Deep groundwater\u000a        in Bangladesh: UCL research in support of policy development in\u000a      January 2013 in Dhaka.\u000a    Supporting UNICEF policy and directives: UNICEF has been a leading\u000a      international provider\u000a      and facilitator of mitigating actions responding to the arsenic crisis in\u000a      Southeast Asia. The\u000a      organisation has adopted UCL's explanation of the underlying processes and\u000a      causes of\u000a      groundwater arsenic in the Bengal Basin as the standard paradigm for\u000a      understanding arsenic\u000a      pollution in alluvial aquifers worldwide [A]. UCL research provided\u000a      fundamental support for\u000a      UNICEF's assessment of global health impacts of groundwater arsenic, which\u000a      underpinned its\u000a      development of policies and directives for its country offices, published\u000a      in 2008 [B]. By\u000a      demonstrating that the existing state of contamination in Bangladesh was\u000a      both predictable and\u000a      manageable, UCL research particularly facilitated UNICEF's proposals for\u000a      rational and effective\u000a      responses [A]. Significant projects supported by UNICEF since 2008, and\u000a      reflecting or responding\u000a      to those proposals, include the Bangladesh Government's Department of\u000a      Public Health\u000a      Engineering (DPHE) 15-year water supply and sanitation `Sector Development\u000a      Plan' [C], published\u000a      in 2011 by the DPHE Policy Support Unit (PSU). The Sector Development Plan\u000a      describes national\u000a      strategy for the investment of approximately $20 billion in the water,\u000a      sanitation and health (WASH)\u000a      sector. UNICEF Bangladesh's Water and Environmental Sanitation Specialist\u000a      stated: \"Completely\u000a      outside academic circles, the UCL work, both directly, and indirectly by\u000a      shaping DPHE reports,\u000a      quite simply transformed the policy debate in Bangladesh and India, and\u000a      indeed beyond because it\u000a      guided my 2007\/08 global predictive modelling for UNICEF\" [A].\u000a    Guiding Bangladesh government policy development: The DPHE Policy\u000a      Support Unit leads the\u000a      development of government policy in the water supply and sanitation sector\u000a      in Bangladesh. The\u000a      January 2013 Dhaka workshop on Deep groundwater in Bangladesh,\u000a      co-convened by UCL, Dhaka\u000a      University and the PSU, was attended by representatives of the DPHE, the\u000a      Bangladesh Water\u000a      Development Board (BWDB), the Bangladesh Agricultural Development\u000a      Corporation, the\u000a      Geological Survey of Bangladesh, the Water Resources Policy Organisation,\u000a      and the donor\u000a      (including UNICEF and WaterAid) and NGO communities [D]. It resulted in\u000a      the submission of an\u000a      advisory policy statement ('Deep Groundwater in Southern Bangladesh - a\u000a      vital source of water')\u000a      [E] to the PSU [D]. This statement promotes deep groundwater as a\u000a      long-term secure water source\u000a      to mitigate the effects of arsenic and salinity in southern Bangladesh,\u000a      and identifies seven points of\u000a      consensus around which policy should be framed. According to the PSU\u000a      Director, the UCL\u000a      research has \"made a highly regarded impact in helping the Government of\u000a      Bangladesh develop\u000a      its policy towards deep groundwater pumping and water quality protection\"\u000a      [D].\u000a    Support for arsenic mitigation programmes: The DPHE is the\u000a      Bangladesh government\u000a      authority with principal responsibility for arsenic mitigation through\u000a      provision of safe water supplies,\u000a      and BRAC (formerly the Bangladesh Rural Advisory Committee) is the leading\u000a      NGO in the WASH\u000a      sector. UCL research has been used by the Arsenic Management Division of\u000a      the DPHE to develop\u000a      deep groundwater pumping as a mitigation strategy [F], and informed deep\u000a      tubewell mitigation\u000a      provisions developed by BRAC [G]. Decisions on the optimum depth of\u000a      arsenic mitigation wells in\u000a      the DPHE 2011 Sector Development Plan [C] and the BRAC 2011 WASH Programme\u000a      II [H], have\u000a      been supported by the research on the spatial and depth-distribution of\u000a      the arsenic source, and the\u000a      hydraulic structure of the Bengal aquifer system [F, G].\u000a    Contributions to public health security: Deep groundwater in\u000a      Bangladesh is free of excessive\u000a      arsenic. The implementation of deep groundwater pumping strategies by DPHE\u000a      and BRAC\u000a      between 2000 and 2013, to designs informed by UCL research [F, G], is\u000a      estimated to have\u000a      reduced arsenic exposure &#8212; thereby enhancing health, welfare and quality\u000a      of life &#8212; among a\u000a      combined total of some 10 million people across southern Bangladesh [F,\u000a      G]. The BRAC WASH\u000a      Programme alone involved the drilling of 3,966 deep tubewells between 2006\u000a      and 2011, targeting\u000a      8.5 million people, mostly living in rural areas [H]. Public health\u000a      security has also been protected by\u000a      the UCL research finding that arsenic pollution in Bangladesh is natural,\u000a      and not caused by\u000a      pumping for irrigation (reference [1] above). This finding has helped\u000a      underpin the maintenance of\u000a      food-grain self sufficiency in the country from 1998 to the present day.\u000a      In 1998, there were\u000a      demands both within civil society and at ministerial level for a ban on\u000a      groundwater irrigation, then\u000a      thought to be the cause of arsenic pollution. The UCL discovery catalysed\u000a      and informed public\u000a      debate about the issue, supporting counter-demands that ensured the\u000a      continuation of groundwater\u000a      irrigation. The enduring impact of this reversal is affirmed by UNICEF\u000a      Bangladesh's Water and\u000a      Environmental Sanitation Specialist, who notes that \"UCL research was\u000a      central to this process\",\u000a      which has itself been \"critical to maintaining food-grain self-sufficiency\u000a      in Bangladesh and a\u000a      substantial part of India\" [A].\u000a    Influence on groundwater monitoring practice: The BWDB is the\u000a      Bangladesh government\u000a      authority with responsibility for monitoring the quality and quantity of\u000a      the groundwater resources\u000a      nationally. McArthur's research findings on the rate of groundwater flux\u000a      at the arsenic source\u000a      regions (reference [4], above), and Burgess's research on the rate of\u000a      migration of arsenic towards\u000a      pumping wells (references [5] and [6] above), alerted BWDB [I] and UNICEF\u000a      [A] to the\u000a      requirements and timescales for groundwater monitoring. The research\u000a      findings influenced the\u000a      BWDB's approach to groundwater monitoring, specifically regarding the\u000a      security of deep\u000a      groundwater, and informed their establishment in 2012 of a coastal\u000a      groundwater network of over\u000a      120 monitoring points [I]. BWDB continues to appraise the design of its\u000a      national deep groundwater\u000a      monitoring programme in the light of UCL research, most recently through\u000a      consultation at the\u000a      January 2013 Dhaka workshop. That workshop, according to the BWDB Deputy\u000a      Director (Ground\u000a      Water Hydrology), \"gave the opportunity for us to consider the\u000a      contributions of UCL research and\u000a      their implications for our approach towards groundwater monitoring. Our\u000a      joint effort has been\u000a      guiding BWDB to plan and develop appropriate investigation and monitoring\u000a      technologies in order\u000a      to generate good quality hydrogeological data and information for the\u000a      sustainable use of limited\u000a      fresh and safe groundwater resource\" [I].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    UCL research findings about the source, transport and fate of arsenic in\u000a      sediments exploited for\u000a      water supply in the Bengal Basin have underpinned the development and\u000a      implementation of policy\u000a      by the Bangladesh government, international donors and non-governmental\u000a      organisations (NGOs),\u000a      and led to improvements in public health security across southern\u000a      Bangladesh. By demonstrating\u000a      that arsenic pollution in Bangladesh is not caused by irrigation pumping,\u000a      the research countered\u000a      popular demands and government intentions to curb irrigation, thereby\u000a      supporting the country's\u000a      continued food-grain self-sufficiency.

Since 1990,\u000a      extensive arsenic\u000a      pollution of groundwater has been recognised in Quaternary fluvio-deltaic\u000a      sediments exploited for\u000a      water supply. The problem is especially acute across the densely populated\u000a      floodplains of\u000a      Southeast Asia, where shallow groundwater constitutes the only\u000a      bacteriologically safe source of\u000a      water for more than 100 million inhabitants. In Bangladesh and West Bengal\u000a      alone &#8212; where\u000a      shallow groundwater contains arsenic at concentrations up to 100 times the\u000a      World Health\u000a      Organization (WHO) guideline limit for drinking water &#8212; some 70 million\u000a      people are affected, and\u000a      sustainable mitigation solutions are far from universally implemented.\u000a    Research conducted since 1997 by John McArthur and William Burgess in the\u000a      Department of Earth\u000a      Sciences at UCL has addressed the distribution, source, transport and fate\u000a      of arsenic in the Bengal\u000a      Basin, taken as a type area for Quaternary fluvio-deltaic aquifers.\u000a      McArthur and Burgess' first\u000a      published contribution in 1998 (with graduate student Nickson and\u000a      collaborators in Bangladesh) set\u000a      out their deduction, from the geochemical context and analysis of water\u000a      from 46 wells in\u000a      Bangadesh, that groundwater arsenic derives from reduction of\u000a      arsenic-bearing iron oxyhydroxides\u000a      in the sediments [1]. This finding overturned the previous consensus that\u000a      arsenic enters\u000a      groundwater by oxidation of arsenic-bearing pyrite in response to\u000a      water-table lowering by irrigation\u000a      pumping. The research demonstrated that arsenic pollution in Bangladesh is\u000a      a natural\u000a      phenomenon, rather than being caused by irrigation pumping.\u000a    Extensive fieldwork and laboratory analysis of groundwater and sediment\u000a      cores from West Bengal,\u000a      conceived by McArthur and executed in conjunction with lead collaborator\u000a      D. M. Banerjee\u000a      (University of Delhi) and other collaborators in the UK and India (as\u000a      indicated by the author lists on\u000a      references [2-4]), were conducted between 2000 and 2008. This work exposed\u000a      buried peat as the\u000a      main cause of the chemical reaction giving rise to severe arsenic\u000a      pollution in the groundwater [2].\u000a      Building on this, the research team developed and used their 'palaeosol'\u000a      model [3] to demonstrate\u000a      that the current distribution of arsenic in groundwater reflects the\u000a      distribution of palaeo-channels\u000a      and palaeo-interfluves that developed between 125,000 and 18,000 years\u000a      ago, as sea-level fell\u000a      and a late-Pleistocene landscape developed across the Bengal Basin. This\u000a      model applies to delta\u000a      regions worldwide, and is valuable as a guide both for groundwater\u000a      monitoring and for siting\u000a      arsenic-safe tubewells [4].\u000a    Also between 2000 and 2008, Burgess worked in an equal collaboration with\u000a      P. Ravenscroft\u000a      (consultant in Dhaka) and K. M. Ahmed (Dhaka University) on an\u000a      interpretation of more than 3,000\u000a      groundwater analyses, supplemented by sediment core analysis and\u000a      permeability measurements.\u000a      Using data from these studies, they established a hydrogeological\u000a      synthesis of arsenic occurrence\u000a      across southern Bangladesh [5]. Burgess, with graduate students at UCL,\u000a      then developed\u000a      conceptual and numerical models to show how groundwater flow controls\u000a      present-day arsenic\u000a      concentration at shallow pumping wells, and to posit future trends. At\u000a      basin-scale, Burgess worked\u000a      with UCL research student Hoque and their collaborators in Bangladesh to\u000a      determine the potential\u000a      for deep groundwater, which is free of excessive arsenic, to provide a\u000a      safe alternative water\u000a      supply. Via their analysis of more than 2,000 borehole records and\u000a      development of numerical\u000a      models, Burgess and his collaborators described the major elements of the\u000a      Bengal Aquifer System\u000a      to &gt;350m depth, its development over Plio-Quaternary time, and the\u000a      extent of its vulnerability to\u000a      contamination by arsenic as a consequence of excessive pumping [6]. This\u000a      evaluation\u000a      underpinned recognition of the potential for deep groundwater as a secure\u000a      mitigation option;\u000a      Burgess and UCL research fellow M. Shamsudduha presented that option to\u000a      Bangladesh\u000a      government authorities at a workshop in Dhaka in January 2013 (see section\u000a      4). The analysis of\u000a      the vulnerability of deep groundwater was an equal collaboration between\u000a      Burgess, M. Hoque\u000a      (UCL graduate student), H. Michael (Univ.

These improved\u000a      models allow the companies to manage and develop their reservoirs better,\u000a      leading to improved company performance.\u000a    UCL Ainsa Project results provided hard data on likely reservoir\u000a      continuity, porosity-permeability, vertical and lateral pathways and\u000a      baffles to fluid flow, which the participating oil companies use to\u000a      explore and define levels of uncertainty in their reservoirs. This, in\u000a      turn, allows them to value their assets and projects better (e.g.\u000a      calculate volumes of recoverable hydrocarbons), leading to more informed\u000a      business and investment decisions.\u000a    The Head of Stratigraphy at BP noted that the UCL outcrop studies provide\u000a      the company with data and ideas at a sub-seismic scale, and are therefore\u000a      critical in their development of a range of alternative in-house models\u000a      for producing oilfields. He said: \"The detailed studies and publication of\u000a      the work is one of the key elements in allowing us to understand and plan\u000a      the development of our reservoirs\" [A]. The underpinning research is used\u000a      for the same purpose at ExxonMobil; their Senior Technical Consultant for\u000a      Hydrocarbon Systems said: \"deep-water systems are important reservoirs for\u000a      our company and research like yours help us explore and develop these\u000a      resources more effectively\" [B].\u000a    Nexen Petroleum UK benefits from the research in the same way. Their Lead\u000a      Geologist for the Buzzard Field said: \"The real value in Kevin Pickering's\u000a      work and on-going research to Nexen is in the manner we create and\u000a      populate our reservoir models. His and his student's Ainsa Basin research\u000a      provides hard data that we use to define certain levels of uncertainty in\u000a      our reservoirs. This, in turn, allows us to better value our assets and\u000a      projects, leading to more informed business and investment decisions\" [C].\u000a    Similarly, one of Chevron's Research Geologists said: \"Deep-water\u000a      reservoirs are extremely important for Chevron's exploration and\u000a      production, and understanding of the geology is fundamental to their\u000a      success. Quality outcrop field work, such as is provided by the research\u000a      group at UCL, is required to provide analogue models, test predictive\u000a      stratigraphic concepts, and provide key data on sub-seismic heterogeneity\u000a      that impacts fluid flow in these reservoirs. The research undertaken by\u000a      UCL in the Ainsa Basin, and the group's publications have greatly assisted\u000a      Chevron in this effort\" [D].\u000a    An example of a hydrocarbon reservoir that has been impacted upon by the\u000a      UCL DWRG research results is the Buzzard Field in the northern North Sea,\u000a      which is principally operated by Nexen Petroleum UK [C]. This asset is in\u000a      its early field life, producing about 200,000 barrels per day (May 2013),\u000a      and holds enough crude oil to deliver potentially about 10% of the UK's\u000a      annual forecast oil demand. Reservoir complexity and potential reservoir\u000a      variability away from well control remain key issues on Buzzard,\u000a      accounting for significant volumetric uncertainty and representing the\u000a      primary risk for new drilling opportunities. The new model for the spatial\u000a      variation of sedimentary lithofacies within reservoir intervals in the\u000a      Ainsa basin, developed by the DWRG, has directly impacted upon predictions\u000a      of spatial variation in primary sandstone reservoir quality in the Buzzard\u000a      Field. Subsequent drilling has corroborated the revised depositional\u000a      framework in the reservoir intervals. Revisions to the existing\u000a      lithostratigraphic correlation scheme were therefore made and incorporated\u000a      into Nexen's subsequent reservoir model updates for the Buzzard oilfield\u000a      [C].\u000a    2) UCL Ainsa Project research results are used to run in-house\u000a        training courses at hydrocarbon companies for geologists,\u000a      geophysicists, reservoir engineers and managers. This training improves\u000a      understanding amongst company employees and results in them being able to\u000a      make more informed decisions throughout their careers about how to manage\u000a      their reservoirs, leading to the companies being able to extract more oil\u000a      from reservoirs and making more money. The four companies mentioned below\u000a      ran at least one in-house training course per year during the REF impact\u000a      period.\u000a    At Nexen Petroleum UK, \"staff are encouraged to participate in\u000a      field-courses to the Ainsa Basin, where UCL's work including the UCL-based\u000a      Ainsa Drilling project are discussed as it provides a unique dataset\u000a      allowing workers to compare 1D well data with 2D and near 3D outcrops\"\u000a      [C]. A letter from their Lead Geologist for the Buzzard Field says: \"I'm\u000a      sure anyone who has utilized this data has learnt valuable lessons in\u000a      subsurface uncertainty\" [C].\u000a    Over 500 BP subsurface professionals from around the globe have visited\u000a      the Ainsa basin over the last 15 years to take part in training courses\u000a      underpinned by the UCL research and have \"directly benefited from the UCL\u000a      studies\" [A]. The Head of Stratigraphy noted that because of UCL's \"superb\u000a      dataset\" on the outcrops in the Ainsa basin, \"these outcrops provide\u000a      excellent teaching tools, and within BP form the backdrop for regular\u000a      deepwater exploration and production courses and an annual reservoir\u000a      modelling course\" [A].\u000a    Chevron also runs a training course in the Ainsa basin, and \"has made\u000a      extensive use of the research products of the UCL group\" [D]. Their\u000a      Research Geologist said: \"the core and wire-line log data collected from\u000a      behind the outcrop provides a unique teaching aid which can be used to\u000a      relate subsurface data and well-correlation principles to outcrop\u000a      observations\" [D]. Similarly, ExxonMobil's Senior Technical Consultant\u000a      noted: \"We have an intense training effort in Ainsa and the materials and\u000a      learnings generated by this program [the Ainsa Project] are a key\u000a      component of our training\" [B].\u000a    3) Hydrocarbon companies benefit from the employment of skilled\u000a        research students from the DWRG. Chevron has employed three Ph.D.\u000a      students from the DWRG (two in the REF impact period), and is benefiting\u000a      from the skills acquired by these employees whilst conducting the\u000a      underpinning research [D]. Ph.D. students from the DWRG have also been\u000a      employed by ExxonMobil in 2010 [B] and Nexen Petroleum has created\u000a      internships in 2012 and 2013 for two of the DWRG's current Ph.D. students\u000a      [C].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    UCL's Deep-Water Research Group (DWRG) creates knowledge transfer between\u000a      research and the hydrocarbon industry.

It was around 150\u000a      kilometres in length and was connected to a palaeo Bay of Biscay. The\u000a      clastic sediments that accumulated in the Ainsa basin (and the\u000a      time-equivalent and connected Jaca and Pamplona deep-marine basins to the\u000a      east) formed submarine fans and associated deposits that were supplied\u000a      mainly from rivers and deltas of the rising Pyrenean orogen to the north\u000a      and east. These sediments provide arguably the most complete and linked\u000a      ancient sedimentary system anywhere in Europe, and indeed globally. As\u000a      such, these sediments are of considerable interest to the hydrocarbon\u000a      industry as analogue models for many sites of hydrocarbon exploration and\u000a      production worldwide, and for training technical staff (geologists,\u000a      geophysicists, palaeontologists, reservoir engineers).\u000a    UCL's DWRG, based in the Department of Earth Sciences and led by Kevin\u000a      Pickering (Professor 1993-present), managed an integrated\u000a      outcrop-subsurface study of the deep-marine sandy submarine-fan deposits\u000a      in the Ainsa basin (Ainsa Project drilling phase 1997-1999). This\u000a      groundbreaking project &#8212; the only integrated outcrop-subsurface study of a\u000a      coarse-grained deep-marine system worldwide to date &#8212; was funded by a\u000a      consortium of oil companies under the auspices of the Norwegian Petroleum\u000a      Directorate (NPD), including Conoco, BP, ExxonMobil, NorskHydro-Statoil,\u000a      TotalFinaElf and Phillips Petroleum. With funding from other oil\u000a      companies, the Ainsa Project has continued since the drilling phase until\u000a      the present time. Research conducted as part of the Ainsa Project has\u000a      included onshore drilling and coring, detailed sedimentary core logging,\u000a      seismic acquisition, wireline logging, micropalaeontology and sedimentary\u000a      petrography.\u000a    As part of the post-drilling phase of the Ainsa Project, the UCL DWRG has\u000a      been and continues to be involved in several industry-sponsored\u000a      field-based sedimentological and stratigraphic studies:\u000a    (i) Investigations of the architecture of the sandy systems in the Ainsa\u000a      basin, including their thickness, geometry, and lateral and vertical\u000a      connectivity [1].

This project was\u000a      sponsored by Shell UK (2002-2010) and ExxonMobil (2007-2012).\u000a    (ii) A study of the Guaso system in the Ainsa basin, which found it to be\u000a      a structurally confined, low-gradient, mainly fine-grained, deep-water\u000a      system for which, prior to this study, only a very few and poorly\u000a      documented case studies existed [2]. This work underpins interpretations\u000a      of the Buzzard Field, northern North Sea, which consists of stacked\u000a      sandstone reservoirs in a shelf-edge-delta-supplied basin. It was\u000a      initially sponsored by Shell UK (2005-2010). In 2005, the UCL DWRG was\u000a      also involved in an evaluation of the reservoir sandstones, including\u000a      thin-section work, when the Buzzard Field was first drilled by PanCanadian\u000a      (now Nexen Petroleum), which in turn led to Nexen Petroleum funding\u000a      present research by the UCL DWRG.\u000a    (iii) Studies of trace fossils in the Ainsa basin and their use in\u000a      environmental interpretation, something that is invaluable to oil\u000a      companies looking at limited core material [3, 4]. This work showed that\u000a      trace fossils are powerful indicators of submarine-fan and related\u000a      environments. The project was sponsored by BP (2002-2007).\u000a    (iv) Study and characterisation of the stratigraphic significance of\u000a      mass-transport deposits\/complexes (MTDs\/MTCs) in the Ainsa basin [5, 6].\u000a      Such processes and their deposits can cut out reservoir sandstones and\u000a      provide seals to any hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir sandstones, and their\u000a      study is therefore of interest to the hydrocarbon industry. Most recently,\u000a      this work was sponsored by Nexen Petroleum (2010-2014) [5].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"29984","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Over 90 million people were affected by earthquakes between 2000 and\u000d\u000a      2012, with more than 800,000 losing their lives. Prior to the research\u000d\u000a      described in section 2, seismic hazard worldwide was usually mapped solely\u000d\u000a      using the locations and frequencies of instrumentally recorded\u000d\u000a      earthquakes, mostly without knowledge of active fault locations. The\u000d\u000a      improved methodology developed by Roberts and collaborators, which uses\u000d\u000a      the five parameters listed in section 2, has been used in 2008-2013 for\u000d\u000a      seismic hazard assessments within institutions in both Greece and Italy,\u000d\u000a      the most seismically active parts of Europe. It has impacted on their\u000d\u000a      working practices and is resulting in more informed calculations of\u000d\u000a      seismic hazard in the two countries.\u000d\u000a    Change in the Bank of Greece's seismic hazard assessment: The\u000d\u000a      Birkbeck research led in 2013 to a change in the way that the Bank of\u000d\u000a      Greece approaches seismic hazard assessment and calculation of\u000d\u000a      probabilistic seismic risk, following discussions between the bank,\u000d\u000a      Roberts and a Senior Lecturer from the Agricultural University of Athens\u000d\u000a      (who was Roberts' co-author on underpinning research reference [3]). As of\u000d\u000a      July 2013, the Bank of Greece was running a project to facilitate the use\u000d\u000a      of the five parameters listed in section 2 together with the new\u000d\u000a      seismic-hazard mapping methodology that was developed by Roberts. This new\u000d\u000a      method is being implemented for an upcoming new European Union (EU)\u000d\u000a      Directive, known as Solvency II, which codifies and harmonises EU\u000d\u000a      insurance regulations in order to enhance consumer protection. The new\u000d\u000a      directive requires a credible scientific background that offers a\u000d\u000a      probabilistic estimate, something which is found in Roberts' method.\u000d\u000a      Another co-author on the underpinning research has been employed by the\u000d\u000a      Department of Private Insurance Supervision in the Bank of Greece to\u000d\u000a      implement the method and discuss the work with Greek insurance companies.\u000d\u000a      The Agricultural University of Athens Senior Lecturer, who is involved in\u000d\u000a      the project, writes: \"The work of Prof. Gerald Roberts has changed the way\u000d\u000a      that the Bank of Greece works in terms of seismic hazard\" [A]. In\u000d\u000a      addition, as a result of the work with the Bank of Greece on earthquake\u000d\u000a      insurance risk, the Senior Lecturer has now been elected as a member of\u000d\u000a      the EIOPA (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority)\u000d\u000a      Insurance and Reinsurance Stakeholder Group for a more than 2.5-year\u000d\u000a      mandate as an advisor on earthquake hazard.\u000d\u000a    Adoption of new tools and methods at the Italian Institute for the\u000d\u000a        Protection and Research of the Environment: The role of the Natural\u000d\u000a      Hazards Unit of the Istituto Superiore per la Protezione e la Ricerca\u000d\u000a      Ambientale (ISPRA) is to map, catalogue and risk assess all faults capable\u000d\u000a      of earthquakes for the Italian Civil Protection, which then uses this\u000d\u000a      information to formulate government policy on earthquake risk (e.g. civil\u000d\u000a      defence, infrastructure planning and building regulations). The Head of\u000d\u000a      the Natural Hazards Unit reports that the Birkbeck research has \"produced\u000d\u000a      changes to working practices at my institution in terms of new tools and\u000d\u000a      models available to manage seismic hazard and risk, which directly impact\u000d\u000a      on the information we provide to the Italian authorities\" [B]. Since 2008,\u000d\u000a      the unit's adoption of methods laid out in the research has changed how it\u000d\u000a      advises the Italian Civil Protection on earthquake hazards and the\u000d\u000a      approaches it uses to collect data and work in the field. The Head of the\u000d\u000a      unit reports: \"we now use fault slip-rates, elapsed times since the last\u000d\u000a      earthquake and variability in recurrence intervals in our seismic hazard\u000d\u000a      calculations\" and \"strain-rates from 15 kyrs [ka] are used to compare\u000d\u000a      against strain-rates from GPS and historical seismicity to gain insights\u000d\u000a      into temporal development of seismicity and hazard\" [B]. Insights from the\u000d\u000a      Birkbeck work are used to \"guide our approach to research and in our\u000d\u000a      seismic hazard assessments, in that (a) our staff now subtract\u000d\u000a      post-seismic slip from calculations of maximum magnitude from\u000d\u000a      palaeoseismic earthquakes, and (b) use shallow geophysics to help assess\u000d\u000a      fault slip-rates\" [B]. These impacts were enabled through research\u000d\u000a      collaborations between Birkbeck and ISPRA. The research is also having an\u000d\u000a      impact on public understanding, with the Head of the Natural Hazards Unit\u000d\u000a      reporting that he has used the research insights to \"improve communication\u000d\u000a      with the public about earthquake risks through a series of publicly\u000d\u000a      available videos\" [B].\u000d\u000a    Adoption of new techniques at the Italian Istituto Nazionale di\u000d\u000a        Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV): The INGV is an Italian civil\u000d\u000a      service institution that helps to guide government policy on seismic\u000d\u000a      hazards. It conducts 24-hour countrywide seismic surveillance, and early\u000d\u000a      warning and forecast activities. Since 2009, the Birkbeck research has\u000d\u000a      impacted upon working practices at the INGV. For example, an Earthquake\u000d\u000a      Scientist at the INGV, who works on improving seismic hazard mapping\u000d\u000a      methodology, reports: \"For the last 4 years, my work has been influenced\u000d\u000a      by that of Professor Gerald Roberts. His work has had an impact on mine,\u000d\u000a      changing the way I have been working, because he has convinced myself and\u000d\u000a      others that faults need to be included in seismic hazard assessments so\u000d\u000a      that we can use their slip-rates, earthquake recurrence intervals,\u000d\u000a      variability in recurrence intervals and elapsed time since the last\u000d\u000a      earthquake to calculate and map earthquake probabilities. Before his work,\u000d\u000a      these parameters were not used\" [C]. A Senior Researcher at the INGV also\u000d\u000a      reports that the Birkbeck research is \"having [an impact] on my work and\u000d\u000a      in my institution\" [D]. These impacts on the INGV took place following\u000d\u000a      research collaborations between the institution and Birkbeck.\u000d\u000a    The ultimate benefit of the research to the Greek and Italian\u000d\u000a      organisations above is that they have greater understanding and decreased\u000d\u000a      uncertainty concerning the locations, numbers and behaviour of active\u000d\u000a      faults that are the sources of devastating earthquakes.\u000d\u000a    Improved understanding of seismic hazard within industry and the\u000d\u000a        financial sector: Birkbeck research findings are also being\u000d\u000a      communicated, through the new PURE (Probability, Uncertainty and Risk in\u000d\u000a      the Environment) Knowledge Exchange Network and Research Programme, funded\u000d\u000a      by NERC, to industrial partners including Narec Capital Ltd., Hiscox Ltd.,\u000d\u000a      Aon Benfield, EuroTempest, Arup Group, Lighthill Risk Network, and Met\u000d\u000a      Office.

In particular, through the PURE network blog, websites and\u000d\u000a      meetings, Roberts is involved in communicating to industrial partners the\u000d\u000a      hazards associated with devastating earthquakes, elapsed time science, and\u000d\u000a      the effects of stress transfer between faults, improving their\u000d\u000a      understanding and knowledge of these issues [E].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Birkbeck research on improved mapping of seismic hazards has led to\u000d\u000a      changes in working practices at Italian civil service institutions and the\u000d\u000a      Bank of Greece.

This is a problem, since\u000d\u000a      earthquake recurrence intervals for damaging earthquakes on individual\u000d\u000a      active faults are commonly hundreds to thousands of years. Instrumental\u000d\u000a      seismicity data cannot capture (a) the location of every active fault in a\u000d\u000a      region, (b) the recurrence intervals and natural variability in recurrence\u000d\u000a      intervals for damaging earthquakes on each active fault, and (c) the\u000d\u000a      elapsed time since the last damaging earthquake on each active fault.\u000d\u000a      These variables are essential to calculate the probabilities of damaging\u000d\u000a      earthquakes occurring in a stated time period, and hence to produce\u000d\u000a      probabilistic seismic hazard maps that quantify the geography of both\u000d\u000a      financial and social risk. Furthermore, current methods do not usually\u000d\u000a      include site effects where shaking amplifies\/attenuates on\u000d\u000a      soft-sediment\/bedrock sites; instead, simple distance attenuation\u000d\u000a      functions for seismic shaking are used.\u000d\u000a    To address these problems, research within the Department of Earth and\u000d\u000a      Planetary Sciences at Birkbeck involved collaboration with the Italian\u000d\u000a      civil service and the Bank of Greece to enable the calculation and mapping\u000d\u000a      of seismic hazard based on the following five parameters:\u000d\u000a    (1) Maps of active faults &#8212; this parameter identifies all known seismic\u000d\u000a      sources.\u000d\u000a    (2) Maps of bedrock\/sediment that have different site-responses to\u000d\u000a      seismic shaking.\u000d\u000a    (3) Fault slip-rates and Holocene (15 &#177; 3 ka) earthquake recurrence\u000d\u000a      intervals (with post-seismic slip subtracted) &#8212; this parameter defines how\u000d\u000a      many earthquake shaking events are expected in a given time period using\u000d\u000a      data that are measured over a time period that is known to be long enough\u000d\u000a      to average out temporal earthquake clustering.\u000d\u000a    (4) Variability in recurrence intervals &#8212; this parameter quantifies the\u000d\u000a      variability of recurrence intervals relative to the value averaged over\u000d\u000a      the whole Holocene.\u000d\u000a    (5) Elapsed time since the last earthquake &#8212; this parameter sets the\u000d\u000a      start time for conditional probability calculations for earthquakes on\u000d\u000a      specific faults.\u000d\u000a    Research between 2008 and 2013 involved (a) field and satellite mapping\u000d\u000a      of active faults to identify all potential seismic sources [1-5]; (b)\u000d\u000a      measurements of geomorphic offsets across faults (usually the offset of\u000d\u000a      the periglacial surface marking the demise of the last glacial maximum 15\u000d\u000a      &#177; 3 ka) to gain the slip-rate averaged over multiple seismic cycles [2,\u000d\u000a      3]; (c) dating the offset surfaces with 36Cl cosmogenic\u000d\u000a      exposure dating to confirm slip-rates; (d) mapping fault kinematics to\u000d\u000a      facilitate calculation of a strain-rate field that quantifies the\u000d\u000a      geography of 15 ka-averaged stress-loading [2]; (e) dating exposed fault\u000d\u000a      surfaces with 36Cl to gain past slip-magnitudes and hence\u000d\u000a      earthquake magnitudes needed to calculate earthquake recurrence intervals;\u000d\u000a      (f) measuring the 36Cl concentration on the immediate top 2 metres of the\u000d\u000a      sub-surface fault plane to gain the residence time in that location and\u000d\u000a      hence the elapsed time since the last surface-faulting (i.e. damaging)\u000d\u000a      earthquake; (g) measuring the surface rupture and afterslip\u000d\u000a      characteristics of a recent earthquake (L'Aquila 2009, Mw 6.3)\u000d\u000a      to calibrate the slip-rate to recurrence interval calculation for older\u000d\u000a      slip [5, 6]; (h) compiling the historical and palaeoseismic database to\u000d\u000a      identify the longest and most geographically complete earthquake record\u000d\u000a      possible [2]; (i) using the earthquake record to calculate Coulomb stress\u000d\u000a      transfer between faults; (j) combining the strain-rate field (loading rate\u000d\u000a      on individual faults), stress transfer results, and elapsed time results\u000d\u000a      to map stress concentration relative to elapsed time across the region;\u000d\u000a      (k) back calculating the stress and elapsed time for all known past\u000d\u000a      earthquakes to test the hypothesis that damaging earthquakes occur\u000d\u000a      preferentially in locations with anomalously long elapsed times and high\u000d\u000a      stress concentrations; and (l) using the results of (k) to produce seismic\u000d\u000a      hazard maps with civil service project partners.\u000d\u000a    The key Birkbeck researcher was Gerald Roberts (Senior Lecturer and\u000d\u000a      Reader 2008-2012; Professor 2012-present).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"29987","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1327865","Name":"Myanmar"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    UCL's research on extreme weather has underpinned significant commercial\u000a      and humanitarian impacts around the world. Central to the process of\u000a      developing the research into successful products and services were\u000a      marketing, regular clear presenting and, most importantly, the steady\u000a      gaining of credibility through the demonstration of accuracy, reliability\u000a      and independence.\u000a    There were a number of important contributions to achieving credibility:\u000a      (1) TSR winning two prestigious insurance industry awards: the British\u000a      Insurance Awards for London Market Innovation of the Year (2004) and for\u000a      Risk Management (2006); (2) TSR successfully predicting the very active\u000a      2004 and 2005 Atlantic and U.S. hurricane seasons (which prompted Lord\u000a      Leven, the Chairman of Lloyd's, to state that \"TSR are the first to offer\u000a      a level of precision which is of practical use\"); and (3) TSR being\u000a      selected to provide real-time alert feeds to Reuters AlertNet, the global\u000a      humanitarian news portal, and its warnings helping to save many lives from\u000a      Cyclone Sidr's devastating impact on Bangladesh in November 2007.\u000a    The gaining of credibility was a key factor in the decisions to launch\u000a      the commercial ventures EuroTempest Ltd (ET) in 2007 and Tropical Storm\u000a      Risk Business (TSRB) in 2009. Products from TSRB are disseminated to\u000a      customers via annual licences managed by UCL Business (UCLB), the\u000a      technology-transfer company of UCL, and complement the publicly available\u000a      TSR storm alerts, seasonal forecasts and warnings to humanitarian\u000a      organisations, which are disseminated via online web feeds and email\u000a      alerts. ET and TSRB received a total income of &#163;1.319 million from sales\u000a      of the commercial services between 1 January 2008 and 31 July 2013 [A].\u000a    Extreme weather alerts and forecasts informing decision making: As\u000a      of 31 July 2013, there were around 22,000 TSR storm alert subscribers and\u000a      around 2,000 TSR seasonal forecast subscribers [B]. A market survey\u000a      conducted in 2010 showed that 85% of users of TSR services rated the storm\u000a      alerts at either 4 or 5 (on a scale of 1 to 5) in terms of accuracy, ease\u000a      of understanding, meeting their needs, timeliness and overall satisfaction\u000a      [C]. Hundreds of the storm alert subscribers are companies around the\u000a      world who employ the alerts, with other information, in their risk\u000a      awareness and decision making. These companies cover a wide range of\u000a      industries and activities, from shipping and construction, to\u000a      manufacturing and golf course maintenance [C]. During the REF impact\u000a      period the TSR website also received over 9.5 million visits [D].\u000a    TSR's seasonal forecasts are widely reported and followed in the\u000a      (re)insurance industry and contribute to the anticipation of upcoming risk\u000a      and to insurance pricing. The service is regarded as one of the top three\u000a      forecast providers for North Atlantic hurricane outlooks [E]. For example,\u000a      Risk Management Solutions (RMS) &#8212; one of the two largest global\u000a      catastrophe modellers &#8212; included TSR forecasts in their \"2013 Atlantic\u000a      hurricane season outlook\" white paper [E], which was distributed to their\u000a      clients (who include 85% of the top 40 global reinsurance companies and\u000a      80% of the top 10 global reinsurance intermediaries).\u000a    Companies benefiting from TSRB and ET commercial services: Between\u000a      1 January 2008 and 31 July 2013, TSRB and ET data were incorporated into\u000a      the commercial products and systems of 22 international organisations [A],\u000a      and therefore contributed to the financial benefits accrued by these\u000a      organisations. These companies comprise 20 in insurance and reinsurance,\u000a      one in global telecommunications and one that is a technical service\u000a      provider for the global oil and gas industry. Thirteen of these companies\u000a      are\/were subscribers for at least three successive years [A]. Five\u000a      examples of companies that have benefited significantly are:\u000a    1) TSR products enhance the ImpactonDemand platform sold by Aon Benfield\u000a      &#8212; the world's leading reinsurance intermediary &#8212; by providing live feeds\u000a      and historical footprints of global tropical cyclone tracks.\u000a      ImpactonDemand is a highly innovative and versatile platform that enables\u000a      Aon Benfield's many clients to visualise and quantify their exposures to\u000a      risk, and perform sophisticated, detailed data analysis to drive\u000a      insightful business decisions. Their Managing Director of Product\u000a      Development and Applied Research said: \"The input from TSR underpins the\u000a      mission of Aon Benfield Research [...] to deliver relevant research that\u000a      helps insurers and reinsurers to build their understanding and management\u000a      of risks.\" [F]\u000a    2) Lloyd's &#8212; the world's specialist insurance market &#8212; uses TSR products\u000a      in its services to its 57 managing agents (which comprise much of the\u000a      London insurance market). The company's Head of Exposure Management and\u000a      Reinsurance noted: \"The regular hurricane updates are invaluable in\u000a      providing early warning of potential impacts. The additional business\u000a      service [...] gives us an independent early view of likely losses from\u000a      live hurricanes. This assists us with catastrophe response planning, media\u000a      liaison and regulatory discussions.\" [G]\u000a    3) The Norwegian Hull Club (NHC) &#8212; one of the largest marine insurers in\u000a      the world &#8212; uses TSR products in alerting its portfolio of over 9,200\u000a      vessels worldwide to steer clear of approaching dangerous storms. NHC\u000a      started using TSR products after losing two vessels in September 2009 due\u000a      to tropical storms and a \"lack of storm awareness\" by vessel masters,\u000a      which cost the company over US$12 million. This experience caused the\u000a      company to introduce measures to ensure that such losses did not happen\u000a      again, and it \"identified TSR as providing the desired type of reliable,\u000a      regularly updated and easily understandable tropical storm warning\u000a      information.\" NHC's Director of Communications and Client Services said:\u000a      \"The TSR warning information is embedded within the NHC in-house satellite\u000a      data assimilation system and is dispatched to vessel masters and\u000a      management companies to warn of approaching dangerous storms in an easy\u000a      understandable (Google Earth) format. This system provides 24\/7\/365\u000a      operational monitoring and advice [...] Since September 2009 the NHC have\u000a      not experienced another total loss from tropical storms!\" [H]\u000a    4) At SCOR &#8212; a leading global reinsurance company &#8212; TSR products have\u000a      enabled, since 2010, the \"rapid dissemination of new information [relating\u000a      to tropical storms] across interested parties throughout the business,\u000a      including underwriting, claims and senior management personnel.\" SCOR's\u000a      Head of Natural Catastrophe Risk Modelling added: \"the free storm tracking\u000a      TSR website is the `go-to' source used by the many underwriting\u000a      organisations with natural catastrophe portfolio risk.\" [I]\u000a    5) The claims management team at RSA &#8212; a FTSE 100 company providing\u000a      insurance products and services in 32 countries worldwide &#8212; greatly\u000a      benefit from \"EuroTempest's accurate and timely forecasts of the loss from\u000a      high winds before and immediately after a windstorm event striking Europe\u000a      [...] in assessing risk and in allocating resources.\" RSA's Head of\u000a      Technical Services reported that the claims division has for several years\u000a      employed \"EuroTempest's database of weather observations across the UK in\u000a      order to help validate weather related claims by postcode.\" [J]\u000a    Influencing humanitarian work and contributing to saving lives:\u000a      TSR warnings and data have contributed to preparedness work and the\u000a      reallocation of funds for tropical storms affecting several countries\u000a      worldwide since January 2008. A recent example is tropical storm Mahasen\u000a      which struck Bangladesh in May 2013. TSR warnings and data for Mahasen\u000a      triggered successful preparedness and disaster risk management work in\u000a      Bangladesh and Myanmar by teams from Plan International (one of the\u000a      largest children's humanitarian organisations in the world) [K]. According\u000a      to the United Nations (UN), this preparatory work by humanitarians for\u000a      Mahasen contributed to the saving of \"countless lives\" in Bangladesh,\u000a      where an estimated one million people were evacuated from 13 coastal\u000a      districts in the 24 hours before the storm hit [L].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research conducted within the Aon Benfield UCL Hazard Centre has\u000a      underpinned the development of innovative extreme weather services for the\u000a      real-time monitoring of global tropical storms and European extreme\u000a      weather. These services have achieved significant commercial and\u000a      humanitarian impacts worldwide. Within the REF impact period these impacts\u000a      included &#163;1.319 million of income generated by sales of commercial\u000a      products; 24,000 subscribers receiving free storm alerts and\/or seasonal\u000a      forecasts; seasonal forecasts distributed to reinsurance companies\u000a      worldwide; and a contribution to lives saved in Bangladesh from tropical\u000a      storm Mahasen (2013). Twenty-two international organisations have also\u000a      benefited from the commercial extreme weather services; for example, they\u000a      support the claims division at RSA in assessing risk, allocating resources\u000a      and detecting fraudulent weather claims; and they enable the Norwegian\u000a      Hull Club to alert its portfolio of over 9,200 vessels worldwide to steer\u000a      clear of approaching dangerous storms.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Economic","Institution":"\u000a    University College London (UCL)\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Birkbeck College","InstitutionName":"Birkbeck College","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007760},{"AlternativeName":"University College London","InstitutionName":"University College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007784}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a[1] Statistical evidence links exceptional 1995 Atlantic hurricane season\u000a      to record sea warming, M.

TSR's initial service focus was seasonal\u000a      forecasting, but from 2003 this expanded to include innovative real-time\u000a      warning and monitoring products for live tropical storms worldwide [2].\u000a    Multiple UCL research insights underpin the TSR service developments.\u000a      These include (1) recognition and quantification of the significant\u000a      spatial impacts of El Ni&#241;o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on hurricane and\u000a      typhoon occurrence and landfall [3]; (2) development of the first seasonal\u000a      forecast model for U.S.-striking hurricanes to offer significant\u000a      precision, through the discovery of significant wind patterns in July that\u000a      either favour or hinder evolving hurricanes reaching U.S. shores [4]; (3)\u000a      first quantification of the link between changes in SST and changes in\u000a      hurricane activity [5]; (4) first demonstration of the business benefits\u000a      to insurance of skilful seasonal U.S. hurricane forecasts [6]; (5) first\u000a      provision of tropical storm windfields (forecast and immediate post-event)\u000a      in terms of peak 3-second gust (this being better linked to loss than\u000a      1-minute or 10-minute sustained winds); and (6) first computation and\u000a      provision of probabilistic real-time warning and loss information for\u000a      tropical storms worldwide, including (a) an innovative `wind speed\u000a      probability' graphical product which maps the likelihood that any point\u000a      will be struck by hurricane and\/or by tropical storm strength 1-minute\u000a      winds up to five days in advance, (b) innovative storm email alerts that\u000a      are triggered by the likelihood a given location will be struck by winds\u000a      of a given magnitude, and (c) an innovative forecast loss product which\u000a      provides, by U.S. state and from five days before hurricane landfall, the\u000a      probabilities that the insured loss will exceed different thresholds.\u000a    The work described above enabled the team to begin research on a second\u000a      extreme weather risk service, EuroTempest, in 2004, after recognising that\u000a      a service such as TSR did not yet exist for European weather extremes but\u000a      would be highly valuable, especially in relation to windstorms, which\u000a      account for 75% of European insured losses. The expertise and knowledge\u000a      gained from TSR was used to develop similar real-time innovative warning\u000a      and risk products for European extratropical storms, and for rainfall and\u000a      temperature extremes.\u000a    Key UCL researchers: the research insights and product\u000a      developments were instigated and led by Mark Saunders (Lecturer 1997-1998;\u000a      Senior Lecturer 1998-2005; Professor 2005-present), with input from the\u000a      following research associates: Adam Lea (2002-present), Benjamin\u000a      Lloyd-Hughes (1999-2008), Christopher Merchant (1998-1999), Budong Qian\u000a      (2001-2002), Paul Rockett (1999-2002), Frank Roberts (1997-present) and\u000a      Peter Yuen (2004-2007).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"30202","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research and instrumental development described above gave rise to a\u000a      new tool for the Earth Science community &#8212; namely the laser-ablation\u000a      system `RESOlution series'. A laser-ablation system utilizes high-energy\u000a      (up to GW\/cm2), deep-UV (e.g. 193 nm) photons for the\u000a      controlled removal (ablation) of material at &#181;m-spatial resolution (&lt;10\u000a      - &gt;300 &#181;m). Ablation takes place in a He-atmosphere inside a gas-tight\u000a      LA cell that contains variously shaped and sized samples and produces\u000a      nanometer-sized particles. These are transported into a plasma-based ion\u000a      source (ICP), where they are atomized and ionized, and then analysed in\u000a      the attached mass spectrometer (MS), hence (MC-(ICPMS). The geometry\u000a        and (small) volume of the LA sample cell is critical as the LA system\u000a        must maintain exactly the same performance characteristics irrespective\u000a        of sample size \/ shape (e.g. a long stalagmite, a tiny zircon or a\u000a        single foraminifer). For the first time, the RESOlution LA systems with\u000a        their two-volume LA cells guarantee such a performance for a\u000a        commercially available instrument (M&#252;ller et al., 2009), applicable\u000a      to essentially all solids (diamonds, ice, minerals (carbonates,\u000a      phosphates, silicates, ores), metals, wood, polymers etc.).\u000a    The performance metrics of the new system include superior analytical\u000a      precision via much improved LA-ICPMS signal stability (~fivefold; M&#252;ller\u000a      et al. (2009)), excellent accuracy especially for high- precision isotope\u000a      ratio analysis (e.g. Hf; Sr isotopes), and significantly shortened\u000a      analysis time due to very rapid signal washout of the two-volume LA cell.\u000a      The latter also enables reliable and routine depth- profiling (e.g.\u000a      Griffiths et al., 2013), which facilitates sub-&#181;m spatial\u000a      resolution since a single laser pulse removes &lt;100 nm (&lt;0.1&#181;m) of\u000a      material.\u000a    The leading role of Royal Holloway Earth Sciences in LA system\u000a      development is highlighted by having been invited to organize and host the\u000a      forthcoming (12th) European Workshop on Laser Ablation (EWLA)\u000a      in July 2014, a biennial international conference on laser-based\u000a      microanalysis (http:\/\/ewla.rhul.ac.uk\/\u000a      ). M&#252;ller chairs the organizing committee.\u000a    The impact of this instrument development can be clearly demonstrated in\u000a      several areas:\u000a    1) Resonetics (USA) &amp; Laurin Technic (Australia) The\u000a      commercialization and continued development of the Royal Holloway\u000a      prototype via the joint venture between Laurin Technic (Canberra,\u000a        Australia) and led by Resonetics LLC (Nashua, NH, USA) has\u000a        created an entirely new area of commercial activity for Resonetics (The\u000a      President\/Director of Resonetics 2011\/12). Resonetics was\u000a      previously not active in the Geoscience sector but since ~2009 are\u000a      considered a key player, driving innovation in laser-ablation. The\u000a      laser-ablation market since 2007 has changed almost beyond recognition,\u000a      because the new competitors such as Resonetics or Photon Machines (on the\u000a      market with their two-volume cell ~2 years after Resonetics) have removed\u000a      the earlier market dominance of NewWave Research and driven innovation\u000a      significantly forward.\u000a\u0009  For Resonetics, this has resulted in a US$7\u000a        million turnover and the direct support for eight to ten employees to\u000a        manufacture the \"RESOlution series\" LA-ICPMS based on the Royal Holloway\u000a        prototype, with research money being returned to Royal Holloway ( see\u000a          Sections 3 &amp; 5). The continued construction of highly\u000a        specialized two-volume LA cells in Canberra by Laurin Technic also\u000a        strongly supports the local specialist engineering and machining\u000a        industry there. Further impact at Resonetics is evident in their\u000a        biomedical application areas, as documented in a letter from the President\/Director\u000a        of Resonetics in 2013: `...Resonetics was able to utilize some of\u000a        the core technology from the RESOlution on laser manufacturing equipment\u000a        for CGM devices. CGM devices are utilized to allow diabetics to monitor\u000a        their blood sugar levels [...]'. `[...] use some of the technology\u000a        developed for the RESOlution and expand it for use with producing next\u000a        generation stents. Stents are used to heal either blocked or damaged\u000a        arteries [...]'.\u000a    2) Geochemical microanalysis worldwide the introduction of much\u000a      more sophisticated hardware integrated with (MC-)ICPMS and controlled by\u000a      user-friendly software. In addition this high-end instrument has resulted\u000a      in 20+ sales worldwide in ~3 years and the details are documented in\u000a      section 5 below. Apart from the two-volume LA cell, further instrumental\u000a      breakthroughs that substantially enhance the types of material that can be\u000a      analyzed and the analytical capabilities include\u000a    (a) a cryogenic sample holder compatible with the two-volume cell,\u000a    (b) a rotating rectangular aperture for analysis of curved, layered\u000a      samples (e.g., speleothems, corals) at maximum spatial resolution\u000a      combined with maximum sensitivity,\u000a    (c) development in sophisticated gas plumbing including a debris exhaust\u000a      valve activated during pre-analysis cleaning.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Wolfgang M&#252;ller \"...developed with Resonetics (USA) and Laurin Technic\u000a        (Australia) an instrument...designed to be the ultimate, no compromises,\u000a        laser ablation....\" system (Gabay, President\/Director,\u000a        Resonetics). Crucially featuring a two-volume laser-ablation-cell\u000a      available commercially for the first time, the new \"RESOlution-series\u000a      product-line\" has since development and installation of the Royal\u000a      Holloway-prototype (2007\/08) been sold worldwide to 20+ laboratories. When\u000a      coupled to (MC-)ICPMS (plasma mass spectrometers), RESOlution LA- systems\u000a      yield the most accurate and precise isotopic\/trace element data at the &#181;m-scale\u000a      for a wide variety of solids. Economic and societal impact included (a)\u000a      employment of eight technical specialists at Resonetics and additional\u000a      staff at worldwide suppliers, (b) direct technological spin- offs linked\u000a      to monitoring diabetes and stents production, and (c) a turnover of US$7M\u000a      (2011). This new partnership has shaped the LA market worldwide and\u000a      remains a key innovation driver with the recent addition of a Royal\u000a      Holloway-designed cryogenic cell for analysis of ice cores or frozen\u000a      biological samples.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Technological","Institution":"\u000a    Royal Holloway, University of London\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Royal Holloway, University of London","InstitutionName":"Royal Holloway, University of London","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"London","UKPRN":10005553}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2172517","Name":"Canberra"}],"References":"\u000a    All outputs available from the HEI on request.\u000a    Research Quality:\u000a    \u000a1.

The development of both the electron microprobe in\u000a      the 1950-60s and the ion microprobe in the 1970-80s paved the way for\u000a      spatially-resolved analysis of element concentrations and\/or low-precision\u000a      isotope ratios, respectively. However, only the coupling of\u000a        laser-ablation systems with (MC-)ICPMS (multicollector\u000a        inductively-coupled-plasma mass spectrometers) during the 1990s\u000a        facilitated analytical breakthroughs, allowing for rapid\u000a      accurate trace elemental and\/or high-precision isotopic analysis at the\u000a        &#181;m-scale with applications across the sciences.\u000a    At Royal Holloway, the appointment of Wolfgang M&#252;ller in late 2004\u000a      spawned a new initiative in in- situ geochemical analysis, because\u000a      the then commercially available laser-ablation systems comprised\u000a      unsophisticated laser-ablation (LA) cells despite their UV-laser sources.\u000a      The LA cell represents the core of any LA system because it is where the\u000a      laser interacts with the sample, and as such defines its key performance\u000a      characteristics. The SRIF3-funded LA prototype system was developed at\u000a      Royal Holloway between 2006-2007. The Royal Holloway-led design was\u000a        realized as a new joint venture between Royal Holloway (idea, research,\u000a        overall design, consortium setup), Laurin Technic (Australia; LA cell\u000a        developer, supplier &amp; design-consultant) and Resonetics LLC (USA;\u000a        overall system integration) and is now marketed as the RESOlution series\u000a        and available to the geochemical community worldwide. Resonetics had\u000a      previously not been active in the geoscience market.\u000a    The RESOlution series is the first commercially available LA system\u000a        featuring a two-volume LA sample cell (Laurin cell). Due to its\u000a      rapid signal washout (&lt;1.5 s\/99% signal drop) and uniform signal\u000a      response, this LA cell gives unprecedented signal stability and allows\u000a      rapid acquisition of precise and accurate data using depth and\u000a      compositional profiling, `normal' spot analysis and 2D mapping (M&#252;ller et\u000a      al 2009, Tomlinson et al 2011, Evans &amp; Muller 2012, Rittner &amp;\u000a      M&#252;ller 2012).

As a\u000d\u000a      result, thousands of simulations can be run overnight on simple desk-top\u000d\u000a      PCs thus bringing sensitivity analyses and \"mathematical inversion\" of\u000d\u000a      turbidity current models to the desktop-computers of geologists at the\u000d\u000a      forefront of exploration in oil-companies. In summary, these developments\u000d\u000a      resulted in the development of highly efficient software that allows users\u000d\u000a      to rapidly understand and characterize turbidite deposits.\u000d\u000a    The practical use for this software is to find a simulation that\u000d\u000a      accurately reproduces ancient sand deposits observed in wells. The model\u000d\u000a      then predicts the sand distribution over the entire modelled area, thus\u000d\u000a      identifying promising locations for future drilling. The areal\u000d\u000a      distribution and thickness of the modelled sand bodies also allows for\u000d\u000a      prediction of the reservoir volume that is an important factor in deciding\u000d\u000a      the financial risk of further exploration. Finally, the sand distribution\u000d\u000a      can be fed into industry-standard fluid-flow models that predict the ease\u000d\u000a      with which hydrocarbons (oil &amp; gas) can be extracted from the\u000d\u000a      sand. This allows for the assessment of recoverable (as opposed to\u000d\u000a        in-place) reserves that constrains the exploitation strategy (e.g.\u000a        placement of water-injection wells).\u000d\u000a    The Royal Holloway program was commercialized by Midland Valley\u000d\u000a      Exploration Ltd. during 2008. MVE's contribution was to build a\u000d\u000a      user-friendly interface and, most importantly, to integrate the modelling\u000d\u000a      with their own world-leading structural-reconstruction software.\u000d\u000a      Structural reconstruction allows ancient seafloor bathymetry to be\u000d\u000a      estimated from 3D seismic data and this bathymetry is a key input to the\u000d\u000a      turbidity current modelling. The combination of structural reconstruction\u000d\u000a      and forward\/inverse modelling of turbidity currents is unique with no one\u000d\u000a      else yet providing this capability in either industry or academia.\u000d\u000a    Since its release, the software has been sold to nine commercial clients\u000d\u000a      including major oil-companies and smaller consultancy companies. In\u000d\u000a      addition the software has been purchased by ten universities. Also, MVE\u000d\u000a      have used the software on three consultancy projects. The names of the\u000d\u000a      specific companies involved and the financial details are commercially\u000d\u000a      sensitive. However, Royal Holloway received a 30% royalty on all sales and\u000d\u000a      consultancy indicating that MVE were paid &#163;120k between Q3-2008 and\u000d\u000a      Q2-2011. As a result of Royal Holloway involvement in marketing and\u000d\u000a      support, we know that Shell, Nexen, Noble Energy, RepSol and StatOil are\u000d\u000a      some of the companies who have evaluated the software. Income from sales\u000d\u000a      together with Government-funds for supporting further development have\u000d\u000a      allowed MVE to employ three top-level people in their UK office to market\u000d\u000a      and develop this product.\u000d\u000a    In 2009 StatOil used the results of turbidite modelling during\u000d\u000a      reassessment of the Gudrun field in the Norwegian North Sea. Gudrun was\u000d\u000a      discovered in 1974 but was not exploited at that time because of the\u000d\u000a      technical difficulties of extracting oil from this geologically complex\u000d\u000a      field. However, the technical capability now exists to exploit such\u000d\u000a      resources and so its modern commercial potential was reassessed during\u000d\u000a      2009. This included an evaluation of reservoir size, location,\u000d\u000a      compartmentalization and quality, in order to develop the most\u000d\u000a      cost-effective drilling strategy. Results from Royal Holloway software\u000d\u000a      modelling contributed to this study. In particular the software was used\u000d\u000a      to evaluate the impact of compartmentalization of sand-bodies resulting\u000d\u000a      from contemporary folding and faulting and to evaluate uncertainty in\u000d\u000a      sand-body location related to the unknown entry points of the turbidity\u000d\u000a      currents. As a result of the reassessment, a plan of development and\u000d\u000a      operation (PDO) was submitted to the Norwegian government and accepted in\u000d\u000a      2010. Engineering work began in late 2010 and the field will come on-line\u000d\u000a      in 2014. Gudrun is currently believed to hold oil and gas reserves worth\u000d\u000a      $13billion. To exploit this field $3.5 billion is being invested by\u000d\u000a      Statoil during the period 2010-14. Exploitation of the Gudrun field will\u000d\u000a      help to secure energy supplies in western Europe at a time when many\u000d\u000a      oil-rich regions of the world are becoming increasingly volatile and\u000d\u000a      unreliable.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Waltham's software, developed at Royal Holloway, is impacting on the oil\u000d\u000a      and gas industry.

The original mathematical model (Waltham &amp;\u000d\u000a          Davison 2001) was similar to the published depth-averaged models\u000d\u000a        used by other groups and ultimately the approximations used meant that\u000d\u000a        the model had limitations. Royal Holloway scientists then developed and\u000d\u000a        introduced new methods of quantifying basal friction (Waltham 2004\u000d\u000a          &amp; 2008, Waltham et al 2008) that allowed friction-factors and\u000d\u000a        particle suspension to be related to other quantities such as flow\u000d\u000a        thickness and seafloor roughness. As a result, the list of unknown\u000d\u000a        factors controlling any given flow was substantially reduced in this\u000d\u000a        methodology. Furthermore, Royal Holloway scientists demonstrated that a\u000d\u000a        simple genetic-searching algorithm can be used to efficiently find the\u000d\u000a        remaining model parameters (e.g. flow thickness, flow density etc) (Waltham\u000a          et al 2008). These parameters are required to produce a turbidity\u000d\u000a        current whose deposits can match those seen in the available wells for\u000d\u000a        the particular region or field under consideration. This approach proved\u000d\u000a        to be particularly useful for excluding unlikely scenarios, e.g. flows\u000d\u000a        entering a modelled region from all but a narrow range of directions (Waltham\u000a          et al 2007). Hence, ancient flows can be reconstructed\u000d\u000a        using limited data concerning the deposit properties (e.g. sand and\u000d\u000a          mud thicknesses in a few well locations). Such a model \"inversion\"\u000d\u000a        approach allows deposit thickness and porosity to be predicted in areas\u000d\u000a        devoid of data (i.e. between the wells) thus allowing the overall\u000d\u000a        sand-distribution to be evaluated.

This research follows several key themes:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a       Modelling, including 3D device simulation, of new structures within\u000d\u000a        imaging sensor technology. Key outputs were the understanding of how the\u000d\u000a        narrow channel effect can impact charge transfer, particularly in Gaia\u000d\u000a        and Euclid (Seabroke, Murray, Holland, Clarke, Stefanov; 2008-present).\u000d\u000a       Design of new imaging sensors, and contributions to the design work\u000d\u000a        at e2v, for example contributing to the design of the CCD273 detector at\u000d\u000a        e2v for the Euclid mission where we recommended changes to the width of\u000d\u000a        the buried channel implant for improved space radiation hardness, and\u000d\u000a        have made inputs into modifications of the semiconductor processing of\u000d\u000a        polysilicon electrodes to provide greater control of clock phase\u000d\u000a        overlaps, leading to increased yield and manufacturability (Holland,\u000d\u000a        Murray; 2004-present).\u000d\u000a       Development of new test methodologies and new fundamental\u000d\u000a        understanding of the physical processes at work, for example providing\u000d\u000a        refinements to the mean variance, or photon transfer curve, test\u000d\u000a        technique (Murray) and the subsequent deviation from Poisson statistics\u000d\u000a        (Stefanov), and refining the knowledge of charge traps, and their\u000d\u000a        capture\/release time constants on device operation through measurement\u000d\u000a        and modelling (Hall; 2008-present).\u000d\u000a       The study of space radiation damage on the sensors, and its impact on\u000d\u000a        the scientific performance of instruments using the technology, with\u000d\u000a        many examples in publication (Gow, Holland, Hall, Murray), and an\u000d\u000a        exploration of the use of p-type silicon for improved radiation hardness\u000d\u000a        over n-type silicon (Gow, Murray; 2005-present).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32188","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The Open University co-produced Frozen Planet &#8212; a seven-hour BBC One\u000d\u000a      television series that\u000d\u000a      was the highest rating natural history series in the UK since 2001. It was\u000d\u000a      scientifically coherent\u000d\u000a      and was the first prime-time BBC natural history programme to devote an\u000d\u000a      entire hour to how the\u000d\u000a      poles are changing through climate change. It carried a high profile\u000d\u000a      environmental science\u000d\u000a      message, and the public, society at large, the media and the UK government\u000d\u000a      benefited from the\u000d\u000a      impact through timely accurate presentation of polar science.\u000d\u000a    As a co-producer, The Open University was intimately involved in the\u000d\u000a      production of Frozen\u000d\u000a      Planet and our input throughout the REF period shaped the science\u000d\u000a      portrayed, subjects to be\u000d\u000a      filmed, and the scripts. Brandon's research expertise became a key\u000d\u000a      underpinning element and it\u000d\u000a      raised areas of polar-related science previously unknown in the public\u000d\u000a      sphere. These included\u000d\u000a      physical science based on his own research and leadership, and animal\u000d\u000a      behaviour through his\u000d\u000a      cross-disciplinary collaborative publications.\u000d\u000a    The first five episodes were devoted to the environment and animals,\u000d\u000a      building on Brandon's\u000d\u000a      basic research and expertise. The sixth episode portrayed the place of\u000d\u000a      people in the polar\u000d\u000a      regions and showed the place of scientists at both poles. Episode 7 was\u000d\u000a      crucial and was called\u000d\u000a      `Thin Ice`.\u000d\u000a    `Thin Ice' was devoted to the science of how the poles are changing. It\u000d\u000a      was a tour of the best\u000d\u000a      evidence we have for why and how the polar regions are changing, and the\u000d\u000a      potential impact on\u000d\u000a      the rest of the planet. Clearly, the science behind the episode and the\u000d\u000a      narration by Sir David\u000d\u000a      Attenborough were to be profoundly important. Relating to our published\u000d\u000a      research, the science\u000d\u000a      issues portrayed included, for example, krill stocks in the southern\u000d\u000a      ocean, the fate of the\u000d\u000a      Antarctic ice sheet and the state of the Arctic sea ice cover. Where the\u000d\u000a      science did not directly\u000d\u000a      link to our research publications, such on the melting of the Greenland\u000d\u000a      ice sheet, we determined\u000d\u000a      the importance and the narration.\u000d\u000a    In The Open University we used our experience of communicating climate\u000d\u000a      science to the public\u000d\u000a      and were prepared for the inevitable debate. This in fact started more\u000d\u000a      than six months before\u000d\u000a      the first broadcast, when the House of Lords Communications Committee\u000d\u000a      questioned Sir David\u000d\u000a      Attenborough. Baroness Fookes directly asked:\u000d\u000a    \"Sir David, we have heard a report, which may or may not be true, that at\u000d\u000a      the end of your latest\u000d\u000a      series `Frozen Planet' there is a big statement by you on environmental\u000d\u000a      issues, which could be\u000d\u000a      regarded as controversial... Can we ask if it's true or not?\"\u000d\u000a    Sir David responded that he was the narrator of the series and he was\u000d\u000a      sure it was solid science.\u000d\u000a      Just before `Thin Ice' was broadcast it was attacked in print by Lord\u000d\u000a      Lawson and others in the\u000d\u000a      Daily Telegraph and other publications for being a biased exaggeration.\u000d\u000a      Brandon led media\u000d\u000a      discussion pointing to both his and the communities' research which\u000d\u000a      supported the science\u000d\u000a      portrayed.\u000d\u000a    Part of our relationship with the BBC is educational and at the end of\u000d\u000a      several Frozen Planet\u000d\u000a      episodes David Attenborough advertised a free double-sided A0 map of the\u000d\u000a      polar regions with\u000d\u000a      the Arctic on one side and the Antarctic on the other. Brandon prepared\u000d\u000a      this in collaboration with\u000d\u000a      the British Antarctic Survey, and around the map edges were several\u000d\u000a      thousand words of\u000d\u000a      research-level information and scientific images of the poles. The Open\u000d\u000a      University sent out\u000d\u000a      263,000 of these maps on request to the general public, raising the\u000d\u000a      profile of polar research.\u000d\u000a    The series was watched by an average of 10.8 million people per episode\u000d\u000a      with a further 12\u000d\u000a      million views on the BBC iPlayer. In the United States the average per\u000d\u000a      episode was over 20\u000d\u000a      million. This made it the highest rating natural history series in the UK\u000d\u000a      since 2001 and the\u000d\u000a      largest environmental science message in the UK of 2011. The impact\u000d\u000a      extended into\u000d\u000a      government policy and influenced the passage of the Antarctic Bill into UK\u000d\u000a      law in 2012-13.\u000d\u000a    Subsequently, over 2500 people paid to take an Open University short\u000d\u000a      course called Frozen\u000d\u000a      Planet, consisting of a 260-page book and various online film and\u000d\u000a      activities based on the filmed\u000d\u000a      material and the science behind it. Brandon also prepared a wide variety\u000d\u000a      of extremely popular\u000d\u000a      open educational resources with tens of thousands of downloads. His work\u000d\u000a      on and around the\u000d\u000a      series led to him being awarded the Times Higher Education `Most\u000d\u000a      Innovative Teacher of the\u000d\u000a      Year, 2012'.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The Open University (OU) co-produced the highest rating television\u000d\u000a      natural history science\u000d\u000a      programme in the UK since 2001.

His cross-disciplinary publication record and previous career at\u000d\u000a      the British Antarctic\u000d\u000a      Survey put him in a perfect position to advise the BBC on the Frozen\u000d\u000a      Planet series. A key theme\u000d\u000a      of the series was the apparent contradiction between the complete\u000d\u000a      isolation yet strong climate\u000d\u000a      connections of the high latitudes and the temperate regions. In the\u000d\u000a      Antarctic both are provided\u000d\u000a      by the ocean. Brandon's oceanographic research on the Antarctic\u000d\u000a      Circumpolar Current led to a\u000d\u000a      landmark paper (Cunningham et al., 2003) that was a key theme of Frozen\u000d\u000a      Planet Episode 1\u000d\u000a      (`To the Ends of the Earth').\u000d\u000a    Brandon's work with OU research student D.P. Walker close to the\u000d\u000a      Antarctic continent has\u000d\u000a      shown how the global ocean is responsible for a significant proportion of\u000d\u000a      the current observed\u000d\u000a      ocean-driven decay of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. The paper by Walker et\u000d\u000a      al. (2007)\u000d\u000a      measured the heat flowing towards the continent, and demonstrated how\u000d\u000a      inefficient the process\u000d\u000a      of the ocean melting the ice actually is. Walker et al. (2013) describes\u000d\u000a      the features of the\u000d\u000a      regional oceanography that allow warm water to reach the ice. This\u000d\u000a      underpinning science\u000d\u000a      became key themes of two Frozen Planet episodes, 6 and 7 (`The Last\u000d\u000a      frontier' and `On Thin\u000d\u000a      Ice'). These insights also led Brandon to become the Co-Chair of the UK\u000d\u000a      Experts group on Ice\u000d\u000a      Sheet Stability and write the `Announcement of Opportunity' for the NERC\u000d\u000a      Ice Sheet Stability\u000d\u000a      programme.\u000d\u000a    Brandon's published work on polar ecosystems became the key elements of\u000d\u000a      the Frozen Planet\u000d\u000a      `story'. For example, in Atkinson et al. (2001) he showed how the ocean\u000d\u000a      controlled the\u000d\u000a      ecosystem around an important island noted as a `biological hotspot'. He\u000d\u000a      also led the\u000d\u000a      oceanographic work on a four-nation international experiment called the\u000d\u000a      `Bo Survey' to\u000d\u000a      determine the amount of krill in the Atlantic Sector of the Antarctic\u000d\u000a      waters.

This research was used implicitly throughout the seven\u000d\u000a      hours of the series and\u000d\u000a      was an underlying theme of Frozen Planet Episodes 2, 3 and 4 (`Spring',\u000d\u000a      `Summer' and\u000d\u000a      `Autumn').\u000d\u000a    Finally, Brandon had the insight to develop a proposal to take the NERC\u000d\u000a      autonomous\u000d\u000a      underwater vehicle Autosub to sample the physical and biological\u000d\u000a      environment beneath the sea\u000d\u000a      ice of Antarctica. This work provided the first knowledge about the larger\u000d\u000a      environment beneath\u000d\u000a      the sea ice and his published work (Brierley et al., 2002) led to the\u000d\u000a      development of a key\u000d\u000a      storyline in Frozen Planet Episode 5, `Winter'.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32193","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The pursuit of pure ecological research into the functioning of\u000a      hydrological niches has not only\u000a      advanced ecological theory, but has provided practical benefits to\u000a      society. It has enabled the\u000a      impacts of water abstraction on sites of conservation interest to be\u000a      objectively assessed, water\u000a      management of nature conservation sites to be based on scientific\u000a      knowledge, and both the\u000a      practitioner community and interested members of the public to understand\u000a      how climate drives the\u000a      species composition of wet meadows.\u000a    The need to designate and manage the few surviving remnants of\u000a      species-rich wet grassland in\u000a      England was recognised in 1973. Numerous sites were subsequently\u000a      designated and managed for\u000a      their nature conservation importance. Initially, presumably because they\u000a      were labelled `wet\u000a      grasslands', their managers strove to retain water on them by building\u000a      bunds and blocking ditches.\u000a    This mindset was reflected in the management prescriptions of\u000a      agri-environment schemes in which\u000a      landowners were paid to raise water levels. Against this background, our\u000a      research showed\u000a      unexpected results (e.g. Gowing et al., 2002). The evidence was that\u000a      species richness in these\u000a      systems was greatest where drainage was at its most efficient. Further\u000a      research confirmed these\u000a      findings (e.g. Gowing et al., 2005) and allowed specific advice to be\u000a      produced for people wishing to\u000a      conserve particular features of nature conservation interest.\u000a      Specifically, the pattern of water\u000a      availability over the year could be prescribed to favour a particular\u000a      species or community of\u000a      interest. Often this practice involved holding water tables as high as\u000a      possible during summer, but\u000a      low enough to drain excess water in winter and spring.\u000a    The research team at The Open University regularly advised organisations\u000a      such as the\u000a      Environment Agency (EA) and Natural England (NE) on a site-by-site basis\u000a      during the period\u000a      2000-05 (e.g. outputs 5 and 8 below.) During this period the EA identified\u000a      the need for general\u000a      guidance to all managers of wet grassland of conservation interest. It\u000a      formally commissioned a\u000a      publication entitled `Ecohydrological guidelines for lowland wetland plant\u000a      communities' in 2004 and\u000a      approached The Open University to write the lead section on grasslands.\u000a      The effect on the ground\u000a      of this work was to alter the mindset of managers to the extent that where\u000a      they had previously built\u000a      bunds and blocked ditches on sites of nature conservation importance, they\u000a      were now removing\u000a      bunds and clearing ditches to safeguard the biodiversity of their sites\u000a      (e.g. culverting and bund\u000a      removal works at North Meadow Special Area for Conservation (SAC),\u000a      Cricklade, Wilts.). The\u000a      guidelines have become a standard reference work for wetland managers and\u000a      the EA paid for\u000a      them to be updated in 2010.\u000a    Another route to impact was advice given to the EA on the appropriate\u000a      assessments it needed to\u000a      undertake on sites designated as SACs under the European Habitats\u000a      Directive. Floodplain\u000a      Meadows were designated under this directive and The Open University team\u000a      produced a series of\u000a      reports (e.g. outputs 4 and 7) to identify the risks posed to these sites\u000a      from external influences. The\u000a      EA recognised that many of its Area Offices were commissioning similar\u000a      advice and therefore\u000a      suggested The Open University host a national project in partnership with\u000a      a range of relevant\u000a      organisations to coordinate the monitoring, analysis and communication of\u000a      information relating to\u000a      floodplain meadows. The Floodplain Meadow Partnership was therefore set up\u000a      in 2007 and since\u000a      then has proactively interacted with practitioners to implement the new\u000a      understanding arising from\u000a      our group's research.\u000a    Since 2007, The Open University has worked in partnership with seven\u000a      other organisations (see\u000a      list of contacts below for details), all of which are involved in the\u000a      conservation of this threatened\u000a      habitat. The partnership, hosted by The Open University, and funded by\u000a      environmental charities,\u000a      seeks to support practitioners within the member organisations and beyond\u000a      via an interactive\u000a      website, regular newsletters, workshops, field visits, guided walks,\u000a      public lectures and a\u000a      conference. The workshops are aimed at site mangers, who are taught\u000a      practical skills allowing\u000a      them to assess their own sites and amend their management to enhance\u000a      biodiversity. Over 100\u000a      managers have been trained in this way, representing the majority of\u000a      people managing designated\u000a      sites in this category.\u000a    Since 2008, the research team has visited 93 sites across England and\u000a      Wales both to gather data\u000a      and to provide advice. Many of these have had their management altered in\u000a      response to the\u000a      evidence provided by the earlier research, including all five of the sites\u000a      designated as being of\u000a      international importance under the Habitats Directive. In seven cases\u000a      drainage channels were\u000a      reinstated to facilitate removal of flood waters, which avoided species\u000a      loss through episodes of\u000a      anoxia. The Partnership is the first point of contact for people with\u000a      questions about the\u000a      management of floodplain meadows; we have over 650 people requesting our\u000a      newsletter, have\u000a      had over 2500 unique visitors to the interactive website and have reached\u000a      over 8000 people at\u000a      face-to-face events over the past six years. Feedback received from\u000a      participants describes how\u000a      they have altered practices, such as cutting dates, following their\u000a      interaction with the University\u000a      research.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Gowing and his associates' research demonstrated the\u000a      sensitivity of grassland species\u000a      to soil moisture regime.

This was discovered while undertaking applied research\u000a      for river engineering\u000a      projects funded by MAFF (now Defra). The new understanding suggests that\u000a      no one species\u000a      manages to dominate a wet grassland plant community through competitive\u000a      exclusion because the\u000a      soil moisture environment is so variable, in both space and time. This\u000a      variability allows numerous\u000a      species to coexist because each is favoured by a particular set of\u000a      hydrological conditions.\u000a    Our research has quantified the hydrological preferences of many species\u000a      and has demonstrated\u000a      that their overlap in `hydrological niche space' is significantly lower\u000a      than would be expected by\u000a      chance.\u000a    The early stages of this research were published by Gowing with funding\u000a      from Defra (formerly\u000a      MAFF) and other government agencies (e.g. National Rivers Authority,\u000a      English Nature). The key\u000a      paper describing the ecological implications of the work was published\u000a      from The Open University\u000a      by Silvertown, Gowing and colleagues in 1999. This paper challenged the\u000a      prevailing neutral theory\u000a      of biodiversity and provided concrete evidence for the niche-based\u000a      hypothesis for coexistence. It\u000a      has been cited over 200 times. Funding from Defra was renewed and a series\u000a      of openly available\u000a      reports to guide its environmental schemes was produced. The Environment\u000a      Agency funded the\u000a      production and publication of guidelines for nature conservation managers\u000a      in 2004, which are still\u000a      regarded as best available information today.\u000a    Subsequent projects building on these initial insights have been funded\u000a      by the UK research\u000a      councils to integrate this understanding with a holistic approach to\u000a      floodplain management, by the\u000a      Leverhulme Trust to apply the water level control methods developed to\u000a      habitats of conservation\u000a      importance in South Africa, and by NERC urgency grants to consider the\u000a      impacts of major events\u000a      (floods or fires) on the responses of the studied communities. Five PhD\u000a      students have undertaken\u000a      research on applying the new insights to different systems and situations.\u000a    The first phase of the work was conducted in a consortium of research\u000a      groups (Cranfield\u000a      University, The Open University and the Institute for Terrestrial\u000a      Ecology\/Centre for Ecology and\u000a      Hydrology) during the period 1994-99.

A critical feature of the group is that it is part of an\u000a      international network of collaborators working closely with local\u000a      communities, government-run volcano observatories and universities in\u000a      several countries. Citizen scientists volunteering to undertake\u000a      measurements on volcanoes represent a major theme common to many of the\u000a      studies.\u000a    Earthwatch is the charity that has collaborated with the OU on many of\u000a      the recent citizen science expeditions. It offers untrained members of the\u000a      public the opportunity to work in peer-reviewed research projects and has\u000a      found that many returning citizens express very clear enthusiasm and\u000a      report positive experiences. Nigel Winser, Executive Vice President\u000a      (Observations) of the charity, commented:\u000a    `Your work over many years with these individuals fulfils Earthwatch's\u000a      mission to engage people worldwide in scientific field research and\u000a      education to promote the understanding and action necessary for a\u000a      sustainable environment... These volunteers return and engage their wider\u000a      communities &#8212; in schools, in business, with other academics and in the\u000a      home &#8212; with their own outreach activities.'\u000a    The following are examples of the substantial impact this approach is\u000a      having on the volunteers, policymakers and the local communities\u000a      surrounding the persistently active volcanoes in Iceland and South\u000a      America.\u000a    Citizen scientist observations at Askja volcano in Iceland suggest that\u000a      magma has been accumulating beneath the caldera since 2007 and colleagues\u000a      at the Nordic Volcanological Institute increased their surveillance of the\u000a      area during the summer field seasons of 2009 onwards. The Open University\u000a      team has collaborated with local volcano scientists in this area over\u000a      several decades, and worked together with citizen scientists over much of\u000a      that period. Professor Gu&#240;mundsson, Professor of Geophysics and\u000a      Head of the Faculty of Earth Sciences, Reykav&#237;k, comments:\u000a    `The decades-long collaboration with the volunteer Earthwatch teams has\u000a      been particularly valuable, since their contribution has led to fieldwork\u000a      campaigns that is difficult to see how could have been carried out in any\u000a      other way. Here are two important aspects that need to be considered.\u000a      Firstly, the volunteer participation brings resources into research that\u000a      would otherwise not be available. Secondly, the vast majority of all the\u000a      volunteers that have participated in your Earthwatch projects act as\u000a      proponents of science within the general public.'\u000a    More recently, the group's work at Po&#225;s volcano, Costa Rica, involved\u000a      citizen scientists in predicting increased local environmental damage from\u000a      2009 and helped to inform the volcano observatory staff and National Park\u000a      officials who restricted access by the public to the crater area during\u000a      the degassing crisis of 2009-10, reducing the risk of injury. To mitigate\u000a      against such hazards, operational guidelines for monitoring and responding\u000a      to changes in volcanic degassing were put in place in Costa Rica and\u000a      Nicaragua in 2009. These will be essential for establishing short-term\u000a      responses to gas-related health emergencies, as well as medium-term land\u000a      management policies to reduce the effect of degassing on human and\u000a      agricultural activity. Both are of direct economic benefit to vulnerable\u000a      communities.\u000a    The Open University group and several cohorts of citizen scientists have\u000a      worked closely with the Nicaraguan government body tasked with volcano and\u000a      environmental monitoring, and share all of the research results with them.\u000a      Educational material has been provided from this project to the National\u000a      Park Office and is now used in its visitor centre to inform the public\u000a      about volcanic risk and environmental impact. In the past year work has\u000a      begun with local farmers to study water quality with a view to advising on\u000a      safety for agriculture. This has educated and trained the wardens within\u000a      the National Park, who are now able to identify species of flora and fauna\u000a      that can be used to monitor poisonous gas levels, and has allowed them to\u000a      develop a more systematic recording of volcanic activity.\u000a    More generally, several volcano observatories have benefited from this\u000a      research and the approach of using citizen scientists to both acquire data\u000a      and help integrate and involve local communities. Several observatories\u000a      and civil defence organisations and geological surveys have requested\u000a      collaboration and advice. Training has also been requested and given to\u000a      students from other higher education institutions (from the UK and\u000a      elsewhere).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The longevity of volcano impact monitoring projects is a strong argument\u000a      for the involvement of citizen scientists and volunteers.

A key aspect of the work has been\u000a      the involvement of volunteer citizen scientists, and also engagement with\u000a      local communities. The team has included Dr Steve Blake and Dr Mike\u000a      Gillman, and colleagues from other institutions including Professor\u000a      Corinne Locke (University of Auckland), Dr Hilary Erenler (Northampton\u000a      University), and Dr Glyn Williams-Jones (Simon Fraser University). Dr\u000a      Saskia van Manen, an independently funded Branco Weiss Research Fellow, is\u000a      researching the impact on society of fluctuations in volcanic activity in\u000a      Costa Rica and Nicaragua.\u000a    The Volcanology and Ecology Project\u000a    Citizen science fieldwork on volcanoes has been carried out almost every\u000a      year since 2008. The environmental volcanology project integrates\u000a      expertise in volcano monitoring, modelling and public engagement with the\u000a      delivery of comprehensive hazard awareness, preparedness and mitigation.\u000a      Professor Rymer has shown that unerupted magma can remain molten at\u000a      shallow depths for many months, and that magma movements can be detected\u000a      many years in advance of eruption; both are crucial to hazard mitigation\u000a      since natural variations and persistent activity affect the local\u000a      environment. High concentrations of gases at persistently active volcanic\u000a      sites can cause heavy metal pollution (heavy metals such as lead, copper\u000a      and zinc) of soil, water and the atmosphere. The implications for local\u000a      people include a build-up of pollutants in their agricultural crops.\u000a    In recent years citizen scientists mapping the distribution of air plants\u000a      within and around such volcanoes have found that the location of these\u000a      plants mirrored results from the sulphur detection plates in indicating\u000a      levels of gas deposition. This provides a new way for local communities to\u000a      monitor gas flux from the volcano without the need for instrumentation and\u000a      lab analysis.\u000a    The Microgravity and Volcano Hazards Project\u000a    Citizen science fieldwork was carried out on volcanoes in Iceland over a\u000a      20-year period 1993-2013. Recent work in Iceland has built upon the many\u000a      earlier citizen science monitoring projects (e.g. Carbonne et al. 2010,\u000a      2011; Wooler et al., 2009; Williams-Jones et al., 2008; Gottsman et al.,\u000a      2008), and is focused around the ongoing subsidence within the main\u000a      caldera of Askja volcano in the north of Iceland. Ground deformation and\u000a      micro-gravity data collected by citizen scientists and volunteers have\u000a      been used to shed light on the processes responsible for unrest at this\u000a      large, central volcano. Increased seismicity and net micro-gravity\u000a      increases while the subsidence continued were the cause of considerable\u000a      speculation in the period 2008-10. A 20-year gravity time series at Askja\u000a      caldera shows a sharp contrast in behaviour at the caldera centre compared\u000a      with the margins. The observed reversal from long-term magma drainage to\u000a      magma accumulation below the caldera centre identified by these new\u000a      gravity data may be the first sign heralding the next phase of activity at\u000a      Askja (van Dalfsen 2011).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32210","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The following are a series of examples of the way in which the research\u000a      of Frederickson and the Open University group has helped the UK Government\u000a      and waste management industry reduce the quantity of organic waste going\u000a      to landfill sites. The EU Landfill Directive (31\/1999\/EC) sets tough\u000a      targets for reducing the amount of biodegradable municipal waste (BMW)\u000a      sent to landfill: for the UK these are to reduce to 75% of 1995 BMW level\u000a      by 2010, 50% by 2013 and 35% by 2020. In 2004 these targets were embodied\u000a      within the Landfill Allowance and Trading Schemes (LATS and LAS)\u000a      administered by the Environment Agency. Waste Disposal Authorities\u000a      investigated sustainable waste management technologies such as composting\u000a      of source-segregated BMW and the use of mechanical biological treatment\u000a      (MBT) to pre-treat residual BMW to reduce landfilling of BMW.\u000a    In 1995 Jim Frederickson co-founded the Composting Association which is\u000a      now the Organics Recycling Group (ORG) at the Renewable Energy\u000a      Association. In 2005 and 2009 he was invited to join the BSI committees\u000a      which developed and then updated the first UK specification for waste-\u000a      derived compost (BSI PAS100) and in 2005 The Open University developed a\u000a      new PAS100 compost bioassay test and updated this in 2010. Frederickson\u000a      was appointed to the Technical Advisory Committee overseeing the UK\u000a      Compost Quality Protocol (2007 to present); this is the Quality Assurance\u000a      scheme for waste-derived compost products. Jeremy Jacobs, Technical\u000a      Director of the ORG, comments: `Jim's extensive contribution to promoting\u000a      and developing standards in the waste industry has made a significant\u000a      impact on waste policy, resulted in improved environmental protection and\u000a      has undoubtedly benefited the natural environment enormously.' According\u000a      to the WRAP survey of the UK organics recycling industry (WRAP, 2013), the\u000a      UK composted almost 6 million tonnes of BMW in 2012 compared with just\u000a      150,000 tonnes in 1995.\u000a    The use of mechanical and biological treatment (MBT) to pre-treat\u000a      residual BMW prior to landfill is a new technology to the UK. The\u000a      Environment Agency working with industry developed an evaluation scheme\u000a      for quantifying decreases in BMW landfilled due to MBT. The Open\u000a      University was part of the Environment Agency team (with WRc PLC) that\u000a      developed the core test methods (DR4 and BM100) and protocols for this;\u000a      these were embodied in the Agency's 2005 and 2009 guidance for the\u000a      statutory evaluation of MBT plants (`Guidance on monitoring of MBT and\u000a      other treatment processes for the landfill allowances schemes (LATS and\u000a      LAS) for England and Wales'). Kathryn Nicholls (Senior Technical Advisor\u000a      waste recovery (Biowaste) at the Environment Agency comments: `By\u000a      developing the DR4 and BM100 biodegradability tests and by contributing to\u000a      the overall MBT evaluation methodology, The Open University has made a\u000a      significant impact on reducing environmental risk (e.g. through leachate\u000a      pollution and greenhouse gas emissions) of landfilling residual household\u000a      waste.'\u000a    Approximately 2.5 million tonnes of residual waste was treated by MBT at\u000a      30 sites in the UK in 2012 (WRAP, 2013). In 2009, The Open University\u000a      entered into an ongoing research partnership agreement with AmeyCespa Ltd\u000a      to assist them in the evaluation and optimisation of the Cambridge MBT\u000a      facility. Open University research findings included exceptional\u000a      reductions in potential landfill methane emissions (&gt;90%) from treating\u000a      BMW. Jonathan Jones (Principal Operations Manager) comments: `This Open\u000a      University research has been immensely valuable to AmeyCespa Ltd and has\u000a      contributed much to our understanding of the biological treatment process\u000a      and how best to optimise plant operations and minimise environmental\u000a      impacts.'\u000a    Further evidence of the key role played by The Open University group in\u000a      supporting government initiatives is in the development of test methods\u000a      and specifications for anaerobic digestion (AD). Jim Frederickson was\u000a      appointed to the British Standards Institute PAS110 committee in 2008\u000a      (PAS110 is the UK specification for application of digestates to land).\u000a    The Open University was commissioned by WRAP to develop the Residual\u000a      Biogas Potential (RBP) digestate stability test for inclusion in PAS110:\u000a      2010. The OU undertakes this key RBP test on behalf of the AD sector with\u000a      approximately 250 RBP tests having been completed. PAS110: 2010 underpins\u000a      the Biofertiliser Certification Scheme (BCS). According to http:\/\/www.biogas-info.co.uk\/,\u000a      the AD sector currently comprises 106 AD plants processing approximately 5\u000a      million tonnes of waste per year. There are currently 12 AD plants which\u000a      have achieved certification under the BCS\u000a      (http:\/\/www.biofertiliser.org.uk\/).\u000a    Dr Nina Sweet OBE (WRAP Anaerobic Digestion Special Adviser) comments:\u000a      `In providing a key stability test method (RBP) for digestate in PAS110:\u000a      2010 and by contributing to the wider development of the PAS110: 2010\u000a      specification, Jim Frederickson and the Open University team have directly\u000a      aided the development of the anaerobic digestion sector, which is a\u000a      Government priority.'\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The research of Prof Jim Frederickson and the Integrated Waste Systems\u000a      Research group at The Open University (OU) has impacted industrial\u000a      partners and government agencies in developing a sustainable approach to\u000a      waste processes and treated products.

The combination of\u000a      vermiculture (tertiary treatment of waste using selected earthworm\u000a      species) with suitable composting systems to enhance waste decomposition\u000a      and compost stability (e.g. Frederickson et al., 1997, one of the more\u000a      highly cited academic papers in this area, 50 on Scopus Oct. 2013) led to\u000a      research and quantification of biodegradability in relation to composting\u000a      municipal waste. Jim Frederickson led the first UK investigation into the\u000a      effectiveness of large-scale composting to treat municipal waste, which\u000a      was commissioned by the Environment Agency (Frederickson, 1999). This\u000a      research included empirical studies on the effect of key composting\u000a      parameters (moisture content, aeration) on waste decomposition rates.\u000a    Arising from this early research into biological treatment of waste was\u000a      the recognition that more sophisticated methods for determining the\u000a      biodegradability of municipal waste were required. These were investigated\u000a      at The Open University during a NERC (CASE) studentship project sponsored\u000a      by Shanks Waste Solutions Ltd starting in 2002 (PhD awarded 2006). One\u000a      conclusion from the research was that the level of greenhouse gas\u000a      emissions emitted during processing was positively correlated with the\u000a      stability or biodegradability of waste undergoing treatment. This\u000a      relationship was particularly notable for methane emissions arising from\u000a      anaerobic conditions during composting. It led to future work on the\u000a      effects of anaerobic conditions on waste biodegradability and the\u000a      development of biodegradability tests for evaluating the decomposition\u000a      potential and environmental impact of waste subjected to anaerobic\u000a      conditions during treatment (biogas generation) and disposal (landfill).\u000a    The Open University pioneered and promoted the concept of\u000a      biodegradability testing for waste- based projects and was commissioned in\u000a      2005 by the Environment Agency to work with WRc plc on the development of\u000a      the aerobic DR4 test and the anaerobic BM100 test methods for determining\u000a      biodegradability losses during mechanical and biological treatment (MBT)\u000a      of household waste. Both of the test methods were subsequently adopted by\u000a      the Environment Agency for use in the statutory evaluation of MBT plants\u000a      commencing in 2005, with the BM100 test method undergoing minor\u000a      modification in 2009 to become the BMc test.\u000a    Also in 2005, Defra commissioned the OU, WRc plc and Cranfield University\u000a      to investigate the characteristics, biodegradability and environmental\u000a      impact of novel wastes, pre and post biological treatment. The DR4 and\u000a      BM100 tests were employed to help characterise a number of untreated and\u000a      treated waste types, such as anaerobic digestates, to help predict the\u000a      relationship between biodegradability and environmental impact from\u000a      disposal and\/or application to land.\u000a    Following the Defra research project, in 2009 the OU was commissioned by\u000a      the Waste &amp; Resources Action Programme (WRAP), established by the\u000a      government as an independent not-for- profit company limited by guarantee\u000a      in 2000, to jointly develop the anaerobic `Residual Biogas Potential\u000a      (RBP)' test with Southampton University.

This led Defra to\u000a      investigate the potential role\u000a      of sulfur pollution in mitigating emissions from restored UK peatlands.\u000a      The economic potential of\u000a      understanding peatland carbon dynamics and the role of sulfate in\u000a      mitigating emissions has been\u000a      recognised by the Great Fen Project, which is taking the carbon balance\u000a      and offsetting of a great\u000a      swathe of the Cambridgeshire Fens into account in its future plans\u000a      (http:\/\/www.greatfen.org.uk\/about\/studies).\u000a      The work helped the Great Fen Project to recognise\u000a      that while its `re-wetting' conservation restoration strategy arrests\u000a      carbon loss by reducing carbon\u000a      oxidation, the high sulfate concentrations that exist within the fen peats\u000a      means that there are likely\u000a      to be lower methane emissions than could normally be expected to occur as\u000a      a consequence of\u000a      elevating the water-table. The work was influential in planning the\u000a      purchase of much of the area for\u000a      conservation, in part through marketing the scheme's carbon offsetting\u000a      potential and avoid carbon\u000a      losses.\u000a    Gauci and the Ecosystems Group's work on the fluvial carbon losses of\u000a      pristine and degraded\u000a      tropical forested peatlands in Borneo feeds directly into the IPCC\u000a      (Intergovernmental Panel on\u000a      Climate Change) and REDD (UN Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and\u000a      Forest Degradation\u000a      programme) processes, since they have provided the only currently\u000a      available data on dissolved\u000a      organic carbon (DOC) exchanges for such ecosystems. This understanding of\u000a      the carbon\u000a      dynamics of the ecosystems is essential in subjects covered by protocols\u000a      such as REDD, including\u000a      carbon offsetting, avoided carbon losses and mitigation of carbon losses,\u000a      because dissolved\u000a      organic carbon is the single largest carbon fraction lost from these\u000a      ecosystems via river drainage.\u000a    The Open University-led study was discussed in detail at three IPCC\u000a      workshops in Brazil,\u000a      Tanzania and Japan and is central for establishing the baseline for\u000a      natural DOC losses within the\u000a      IPCC Wetlands Supplement and for identifying a scaling factor for DOC\u000a      losses from drained\u000a      tropical peatlands.

Research by Dr\u000a      Gauci and the\u000a      Ecosystems Research Group has focused on human influences over the\u000a      stability of carbon\u000a      within temperate and tropical peatlands that have been subject to human\u000a      interference\u000a      (principally through drainage) and on the influence of human activity such\u000a      as pollution, climate\u000a      warming and CO2 enrichment on wetland methane emissions. The\u000a      group has been influential in\u000a      identifying that the deposition of pollution-derived sulfate in acid rain\u000a      dramatically reduces\u000a      emission of the powerful greenhouse gas methane (Gauci et al.,\u000a      2002) and that this `sulfate\u000a      suppression' of methane emissions may have been sufficient to offset\u000a      climate-driven growth in\u000a      the global wetland methane emission source into the middle of this century\u000a      (Gauci et al., 2004).\u000a      Critically, and given the reduction of sulfur pollution in industrialised\u000a      nations, the group has\u000a      identified the long-lived duration of the sulfate-suppression effect, i.e.\u000a      that recovery from\u000a      methane suppression by sulfate deposition may take several decades (Gauci\u000a      et al., 2005). This\u000a      is supported by research into the responses of wetland methane emissions\u000a      to individual high\u000a      sulfur emission events in history, such as the Icelandic Laki eruption of\u000a      1783-84 (Gauci et al.,\u000a      2008).\u000a    The work of Gauci and the Ecosystems Group has also extended to\u000a      understanding other forms\u000a      of carbon exchange within wetland ecosystems. Their recent work has\u000a      focused on variations in\u000a      carbon losses of peatlands into rivers, caused by deforestation, drainage\u000a      and fires in Bornean\u000a      peat swamps. These deposits are a particularly large reserve of carbon,\u000a      and the Open\u000a      University research demonstrated that these ecosystems are undergoing\u000a      instability and collapse\u000a      as a consequence of deforestation and land use change (Moore et al.,\u000a      2013). This was the first\u000a      such study to report fluvial carbon losses from forested as well as\u000a      deforested catchments, and\u000a      was the first to identify the age of the carbon that was lost. The group\u000a      found that the carbon lost\u000a      from forested ecosystems is modern and as such is tightly coupled to\u000a      current net primary\u000a      productivity. In contrast, the carbon lost from deforested and drained\u000a      peats was often thousands\u000a      of years old, in other words derived from the deep and ancient peat\u000a      reserves. Notably, the\u000a      oldest carbon lost originated in peatlands that had been converted to oil\u000a      palm agriculture. The\u000a      work was led by Gauci, who was senior and corresponding author on the\u000a      paper.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32222","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The work of The Open University Planetary and Space Sciences group has\u000d\u000a      had significant impact through academic-industry partnerships, supporting\u000d\u000a      UK space sector and government agencies.

Some of the projects we have undertaken have also influenced\u000d\u000a      ESA's ability to develop global partnerships.\u000d\u000a    The first example, the L-VRAP (Lunar Volatile Resources Analysis Package\u000d\u000a      2011-2012) project within ESA's Lunar Lander programme, initially\u000d\u000a      attracted &#8364;300k to a consortium led by The Open University (including RAL\u000d\u000a      Space, EADS Astrium Ltd, Fluid Gravity Engineering (FGE), and the NASA\u000d\u000a      Astromaterials Research Office, USA). The L-VRAP project allowed EADS\u000d\u000a      Astrium, an established prime contractor in space hardware, to be involved\u000d\u000a      in Lunar Lander design with a view to future opportunities to tender for\u000d\u000a      contracts with ESA in any eventual mission implementation. The L-VRAP\u000d\u000a      study allowed FGE, a UK based scientific consultancy specializing in\u000d\u000a      computational physics, to apply its expertise in a new area of research,\u000d\u000a      Jim Merrifield of Fluid Gravity Engineering commented:\u000d\u000a    `Partnering with The Open University on the L-VRAP project has enabled us\u000d\u000a      to restart our line of activity in in-space plume modelling which has\u000d\u000a      allowed us to make a stronger case for proposing repeat business.\u000d\u000a      Additionally, certain aspects of the plume regolith interaction needed to\u000d\u000a      support L-VRAP have enabled us to participate in contracted work concerned\u000d\u000a      with the sub-sonic liberation of dust from solar panels on Mars. This is a\u000d\u000a      new area of work for us, both in terms of application and flow regime.'\u000d\u000a    The L-VRAP project has also had significant impact in the European Space\u000d\u000a      Agency because of the recent renewed interest in international\u000d\u000a      partnerships for a lunar lander mission. Berengere Houdou, Head of the ESA\u000d\u000a      Lunar Lander Office commented:\u000d\u000a    `The work of The Open University team led to the design of a package to\u000d\u000a      analyse complex chemistry and potentially valuable resources on the Moon.\u000d\u000a      This has provided us with an important input for discussions with\u000d\u000a      potential international partners, with a view to developing an\u000d\u000a      international lunar exploration programme.'\u000d\u000a    The second example, the DUSTER project (2012-2013), is led by the UK\u000d\u000a      based space engineering consultancy Magna Parva, with partners FGE and\u000d\u000a      makes use of a key piece of Open University knowhow, chemical pumping. The\u000d\u000a      initial work has attracted over &#8364;450k to UK industry and placed them in an\u000d\u000a      excellent position to win the contract to build devices to extend the\u000d\u000a      lifetime of future martian explorers built by ESA. Miles Ashcroft of Magna\u000d\u000a      Parva commented:\u000d\u000a    `The successful contract win with ESA to perform the DUSTER project was\u000d\u000a      heavily influenced by the ability of MPL to be able to partner with Fluid\u000d\u000a      Gravity Engineering and The Open University. In particular the benefit of\u000d\u000a      utilizing existent practical research and a knowledge base in the\u000d\u000a      applicable field. Additionally it is expected that this will provide\u000d\u000a      on-going benefits as the developed technology is pulled through into\u000d\u000a      flight applications.'\u000d\u000a    In our third example, The Open University partnered with SEA (Systems\u000d\u000a      Engineering and Assessment), in 4 ESA studies (2006-2009) to help\u000d\u000a      implement planetary protection strategies for Mars missions. The work was\u000d\u000a      led by SEA, and the partnership with the OU allowed them to move into a\u000d\u000a      new area of business, training scientists and engineers in European\u000d\u000a      industry and research organisations in building microbially clean\u000d\u000a      spacecraft. The training materials developed by The Open University were\u000d\u000a      delivered to Thales Alenia Space (Italy &#8212; prime contractor for ExoMars)\u000d\u000a      who have delivered training to over 600 people working on ESA space\u000d\u000a      mission programmes in 6 countries across Europe. Subsequently, SEA won\u000d\u000a      contracts from ESA to undertake work on precision cleaning for returned\u000d\u000a      Mars sample curation. This work is of strategic importance to the UK,\u000d\u000a      since it is prioritising sample curation in the post-ExoMars\u000d\u000a      programme.\u000d\u000a    Finally, the impact of the Planetary and Space science group capability\u000d\u000a      extends to several international partners. One such example is CSEM, a\u000d\u000a      Swiss manufacturer of MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) for clocks and\u000d\u000a      watches, for whom a &#8364;400k ESA project with The Open University enabled a\u000d\u000a      move into the manufacture of MEMS-based miniature gas chromatograph-mass\u000d\u000a      spectrometry equipment for space missions and other applications.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The Planetary and Space Sciences (PSS) research group at The Open\u000d\u000a      University has designed, built and deployed space flight instrumentation\u000d\u000a      that is at the core of several iconic ESA (European Space Agency)\u000d\u000a      missions.

The Open University proposed an elegant\u000d\u000a        alternative system that makes use of day-night temperature variations to\u000d\u000a        fill and pressurise a container with Martian atmosphere. In the cold of\u000d\u000a        the Martian night the container is opened and atmosphere is chemically\u000d\u000a        trapped in the vessel. In the warmer daytime, with the container valve\u000d\u000a        shut, gas desorbs (Patent to Sheridan et al. 2010).

These have resulted in real-world impacts, which ultimately\u000d\u000a      result in tangible reductions in global CO2 and other\u000d\u000a      atmospheric emissions.\u000d\u000a    Research on International Aviation Emissions: CATE, at MMU, has\u000d\u000a      been working within a technical body of the UN ICAO Agency, to design the\u000d\u000a      first CO2 emissions standard for aircraft (see `Research on\u000d\u000a      international aviation emissions', sec.2). MMU input has been crucial for\u000d\u000a      the relevant UK and European regulatory authorities ([D], sec.5).\u000d\u000a      The ICAO formally adopted the metric in February 2013 ([B], sec.5),\u000d\u000a      but the standard has not yet been set. MMU is active in both establishing\u000d\u000a      the principles for standard-setting and quantifying the impact of\u000d\u000a      standards on future CO2 emission reduction. CATE leads one of\u000d\u000a      the 6 technical ICAO Working Groups (Impacts and Science Group) and\u000d\u000a      supports 3 others. According to the Executive Director of the Federal\u000d\u000a      Aviation Administration of the US: \"CATE's efforts to quantify\u000d\u000a        aviation's emissions inventories have informed critical decisions on new\u000d\u000a        air quality and noise engine and aircraft standards in 2010 and 2013 at\u000d\u000a        ICAO\/CAEP. Such policy decisions have tremendous costs and offer\u000d\u000a        substantial environmental benefits. They must be made carefully and be\u000d\u000a        informed by the best available science. CATE has been at the forefront\u000d\u000a        of informing policy makers and ensuring their decisions are\u000d\u000a        science-based\" ([D], sec.5).\u000d\u000a    Research on International Maritime Emissions: The IMO is the UN\u000d\u000a      Agency responsible for international emissions of CO2 from the\u000d\u000a      maritime sector, under Article 2.2. of the Kyoto Protocol. The IMO\u000d\u000a      commissioned a `game changing' emissions and impacts assessment, published\u000d\u000a      in 2009, to which David Lee contributed. This report has made a major\u000d\u000a      impact on the maritime sector and has set benchmarks for historical,\u000d\u000a      present, and future potential emissions through the development of\u000d\u000a      scenarios. \"The involvement of Professor Lee, amongst other\u000d\u000a        world-leading experts has reduced the uncertainty for governments in\u000d\u000a        their decision making process and is one of the main reasons for IMO's\u000d\u000a        successful adoption of the first binding and global CO2\u000d\u000a        regime for an industry sector.\" (Technical Director, IMO, [E],\u000d\u000a      sec.5) In addition to the emissions assessment, the section on the climate\u000d\u000a      impact of maritime emissions was co-led by David Lee. Through the IMO\u000d\u000a      report ([3], sec.3) and follow-on publications ([2], [6],\u000d\u000a      sec.3), this shifted the perspective of the maritime and shipping industry\u000d\u000a      to accept that the sector's emissions of CO2 lead to global\u000d\u000a      warming in the long-term, despite short-term cooling from sulphur\u000d\u000a      emissions. Thus SO2 emissions regulations proceeded (entered\u000d\u000a      into force 1 July 2010), with the consequential protection of local and\u000d\u000a      regional air quality, simultaneously combined with a separate focus on CO2\u000d\u000a      emissions reductions. This resulted in adoption of a CO2\u000d\u000a      emissions standard\/energy efficiency design index in July 2011.\u000d\u000a    Designing aviation policy options in the European Union and the UK:\u000d\u000a      In January 2012, the European Union introduced aviation into its Emissions\u000d\u000a      Trading Scheme (ETS). The original scope of the scheme, in terms of\u000d\u000a      pollutants and policy\/geographical scope, was commissioned by the European\u000d\u000a      Commission in 2005 ([5], sec.3). The 2005 report set out the basic\u000d\u000a      design of the ETS. Crucially, the European Parliament wanted to include\u000d\u000a      non-CO2 emissions from aviation, and David Lee, concluded in\u000d\u000a      this ([5], sec.3) and a later (2008) report to the Commission that\u000d\u000a      they should not be included in the ETS as the science was not sufficiently\u000d\u000a      developed. As a result of the EU-ETS, significant CO2 emissions\u000d\u000a      savings will result (currently under some negotiation at the international\u000d\u000a      level, to which MMU is contributing data). \"From the early stages of\u000d\u000a        policy formulation through to on-going international negotiations over\u000d\u000a        the future global policy and rules on aviation emissions, timely MMU\u000d\u000a        research and input have enabled EU policies and positions to be\u000d\u000a        formulated and defended on the basis of solid and state-of-the art\u000d\u000a        knowledge, the most prominent example hereof being aviation's inclusion\u000d\u000a        in the EU's Emissions Trading System\" (Personal assistant to\u000d\u000a        Member of Cabinet of Connie Hedegaard, European Commissioner for Climate\u000d\u000a        Action [F], sec.5) The UK Committee on Climate Change (CCC)\u000d\u000a      was established by Parliamentary Act to examine UK CO2\u000d\u000a      emissions each year and ensure that the UK is on course to meet targets.\u000d\u000a      The CCC assessed whether aviation emissions should form part of these\u000d\u000a      targets, and examined impacts and mitigation options. David Lee was\u000d\u000a      appointed to the CCC as special advisor on aviation, and contributed\u000d\u000a      towards the writing of the CCC's 2009 Aviation Report, as recorded in the\u000d\u000a      report's acknowledgements. As a result, the CCC noted that CO2\u000d\u000a      emissions from international aviation should be considered in the UK legal\u000d\u000a      targets for CO2. Moreover, the CCC adopted and re-published the\u000d\u000a      main chart from [1], sec.3, and recommended that non-CO2\u000d\u000a      impacts should be revisited in the future \"David Lee was an expert\u000d\u000a        advisor for our review of aviation emissions (CCC, 2009), where he\u000d\u000a        provided advice on non-CO2 effects, aircraft and fleet\u000d\u000a        technologies and future scenarios.

According to the Fourth Assessment Report of the\u000d\u000a      Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC), transport emissions of\u000d\u000a      CO2 were 23% of energy-related CO2 emissions in 2004\u000d\u000a      ([A], sec.5, alphabetical sources to corroborate the impact).\u000d\u000a      However, the aviation and maritime sub-sectors of transport (~21% of\u000d\u000a      transport CO2 emissions) have less potential for dramatic\u000d\u000a      reductions in CO2 emission intensity. This is because of their\u000d\u000a      dependence on liquid fossil fuels and slow fleet turnover. Moreover, both\u000d\u000a      sectors are predicted to continue to grow at rates greater than that of\u000d\u000a      the GDP. Thus, aviation and maritime sectors are likely to represent\u000d\u000a      increasing proportions of both total transport and global fossil fuel\u000d\u000a      related CO2 emissions. CATE, at MMU, has been researching the\u000d\u000a      environmental impacts of aviation (noise, air quality and climate) since\u000d\u000a      1993. Since 2003, CATE has focussed upon the impact of the aviation and\u000d\u000a      maritime sectors on climate. CATE's key REF staff, (Prof. David Lee and Dr\u000d\u000a      Sarah Raper, supported at any one time by a team of ~10 RFs, RAs and\u000d\u000a      PhDs), have developed research that has earned a global reputation for its\u000d\u000a      policy-relevance on emissions, atmospheric impacts and the impact of\u000d\u000a      future alternative fuel (biofuel). This is evidenced by continuous support\u000d\u000a      by the Department for Transport (DFT) since 2003 (sec.3) and key widely\u000d\u000a      cited research on the quantification of the impact of aviation on climate\u000d\u000a      ([1], sec.3).\u000d\u000a    Research on international aviation emissions (2010-2013): This\u000d\u000a      research has focused upon i) the design of a whole aircraft\u000d\u000a      performance-based emission metric for international regulation, ii) the\u000d\u000a      design of emission scenarios and assessment of future trends, and iii)\u000d\u000a      developing summaries of the science of aviation and climate.

The first identification of by-catch in UK-stranded common\u000a      dolphins led to realisation of\u000a      the need among scientists and policy makers better to understand and\u000a      quantify the population level\u000a      impact of the phenomenon in exposed species in UK and European waters. For\u000a      example, it\u000a      resulted in numerous UK Government and EU-funded independent\u000a      observer-based studies to\u000a      quantify cetacean by-catch in commercial fisheries and develop mitigation\u000a      measures to reduce\u000a      unsustainable cetacean by-catch rates in specific European fisheries [a].\u000a      Diagnostic criteria for\u000a      cetacean by-catch developed by CSIP are still widely used today in UK [b]\u000a      and overseas [c,d].\u000a    As a result of our work on gas embolism, the Spanish Government imposed a\u000a      ban on high\u000a      powered naval sonars in the vicinity of the Canary Islands. This ban was\u000a      recently hailed as a major\u000a      conservation success since no further mass stranding events (MSEs)\u000a      occurred since the ban was\u000a      imposed (including 2008-2013 period) [e]. The Canary Islands were\u000a      formerly a \"global hotspot\" for\u000a      beaked whale MSEs so the ban is likely to have prevented several MSEs\u000a      during the REF period.\u000a      The European Parliament also issued a non-binding resolution to stop the\u000a      deployment of high-\u000a      intensity sonars within the EU until the completion of a global assessment\u000a      of its cumulative effects\u000a      on marine life following initial publication of our gas embolism findings\u000a      [e].\u000a    The IOZ-led CSIP investigation into the 2008 common dolphin mass\u000a      stranding event (MSE) in\u000a      Cornwall concluded that concurrent naval exercises in the area were the\u000a      most probable cause, led\u000a      to specific revisions to the mitigation of Royal Navy activities including\u000a      a direct role for CSIP\u000a      scientists in early reporting of near-shore groups of pelagic cetaceans to\u000a      Royal Naval Command in\u000a      Portsmouth [f,g]. The 2008 MSE investigation also led to the\u000a      establishment of the Marine\u000a      Underwater Sound Stakeholders Forum (MUSSF) convened by the UK Government\u000a      (Defra and\u000a      Ministry of Defence) to specifically discuss and improve the environmental\u000a      mitigation of naval\u000a      activities and of which IOZ continues to form an integral part. The MUSSF\u000a      was later subsumed into\u000a      the Underwater Sound Forum with additional input from the oil and gas\u000a      industry [g].\u000a    In relation to chemical contaminants, the CSIP and CEFAS (under Robin\u000a      Law) were specifically\u000a      funded to monitor long-trends trends in chemical contaminant exposure in\u000a      direct compliance with\u000a      several conservation agreements\/legislation. This CSIP-CEFAS underpinning\u000a      research utilises a\u000a      sentinel marine mammal apex predator - the UK-stranded harbour porpoise (Phocoena\u000a        phocoena). CSIP-CEFAS data on accumulating levels of brominated\u000a      flame retardants in UK-\u000a      stranded porpoise blubber in the 1990s contributed directly to the EU-wide\u000a      ban of the commercial\u000a      penta- and octa-mix polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) products in 2004\u000a      [h]. Following that\u000a      PBDE ban, CSIP underpinning science showed statistically significant and\u000a      consistent declines in\u000a      porpoise tissue concentrations of brominated diphenyl ethers (BDEs)\u000a      including the 2008-2012\u000a      period [h]. For organochlorine pesticides, CSIP-CEFAS data shows\u000a      statistically significant and\u000a      consistent declines in organochlorine pesticide concentrations (such as\u000a      DDTs and dieldrin)\u000a      including 2008-2012 [h]. CSIP-CEFAS underpinning studies again\u000a      show a decline in HBCD\u000a      concentrations in UK-stranded porpoises including the 2008-2012 period [h].\u000a      Collectively, these\u000a      long-term studies show that the EU bans (or ongoing risk assessment for\u000a      HCBD) resulting from\u000a      CSIP underpinning science have been highly effective in reducing the\u000a      bioaccumulation of several\u000a      classes of chemical pollutants (including organochlorine pesticides and\u000a      brominated flame\u000a      retardants) in a sentinel marine top predator and in the wider European\u000a      marine environment [h].\u000a    In contrast, and despite being banned for over three decades,\u000a      underpinning scientific studies for\u000a      PCBs have shown that concentrations in UK-stranded harbour porpoises have\u000a      remained stable\u000a      since 1997 and regularly exceed established thresholds for mammalian\u000a      toxicity including the REF\u000a      period [i]. The impact of our research on PCBs in marine top\u000a      predators is that urgent scientific,\u000a      policy and management steps are urgently needed to try to reduce their\u000a      concentrations and\u000a      associated impacts [h,i].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The UK Cetacean Strandings Investigation Programme (CSIP), led by the\u000a      Institute of Zoology, first\u000a      identified accidental entrapment in commercial fisheries (by-catch) as the\u000a      cause of mass mortality\u000a      of UK common dolphins.

The\u000a      investigation was led by Dr\u000a      Thijs Kuiken of the Institute of Zoology (IOZ).\u000a    The discovery of \"gas and fat embolism\" in stranded cetaceans in UK and\u000a      Spain [2] -\u000a      analogous to decompression sickness (DCS) or \"the bends\" in human divers -\u000a      identified a\u000a      condition that marine mammals were previously thought not to suffer.

The work was conducted jointly\u000a      by Dr Paul Jepson (IOZ)\u000a      and Professor Antonio Fernandez (University of Las Palmas, Gran Canaria,\u000a      Spain). Eight gas\u000a      embolism cases were reported stranded in the UK between 1993 and 2002 and\u000a      another 10 cases\u000a      in a mass stranding of beaked whales in September 2002 in Canary Islands,\u000a      Spain.\u000a    Other underpinning science includes the investigation into the UK's\u000a      largest common dolphin\u000a      (Delphinus delphis) MSE in 2008 in which at least 26 dolphins died\u000a      coincident with an international\u000a      naval exercise [3]. This is one of the very first dolphin (i.e.\u000a      non-beaked whale) MSEs to be causally\u000a      linked to naval activities. The CSIP investigation and subsequent\u000a      peer-reviewed paper was led by\u000a      Dr Paul Jepson (IOZ) and conducted during 2008-2013.\u000a    The UK CSIP has a longstanding collaboration with Robin Law at the Centre\u000a      for Environmental,\u000a      Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) that has generated probably the\u000a      largest dataset\u000a      globally for bio-accumulative chemical contaminants in a marine mammal\u000a      sentinel species - the\u000a      UK-stranded harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena) [4]. The\u000a      data enable analysis of trends in a\u000a      range of pollutants over time, thus assessing compliance with EU bans or\u000a      on-going EU risk\u000a      assessments.

PCBs levels have,\u000a      however, remained stable from 1997\/8 in UK-stranded harbour porpoises (Law\u000a      et al 2012) where\u000a      case-control epidemiological studies have found strong links between\u000a      elevated PCBs levels and\u000a      infectious disease mortality [6], thus verifying proposed\u000a      thresholds for toxicity in a free-living\u000a      marine mammal. Even greater PCB concentrations have been found in apex\u000a      predators like killer\u000a      whales (Orcinus orca) and coastal bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops\u000a        truncatus) [4].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"34493","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    1) Marine Energy\u000a    On EPSRC grants GR\/S12333 and GR\/S12326 CMMFA and project partners,\u000a      Queen's University Belfast (QUB) carried out a linked experimental and\u000a      numerical study of Oscillating Wave Surge Converters (OWSCs). The Marine\u000a      Renewables Energy Group at QUB are acknowledged world-leading device\u000a      developers within the wave energy community credited with the development\u000a      and installation of LIMPET,\u000a      the world's first grid-connected wave energy converter (WEC). The OWSC was\u000a      a novel hybrid of the LIMPET oscillating water column device and a\u000a      pendulor-type system with a hinged paddle surge converter. The work\u000a      involved wave tank tests at QUB and numerical modelling with CMMFA's\u000a      AMAZON suite of codes to extensively map the parameter space of the\u000a      device. This enabled particular parameters such as the hinge point\u000a      location and position of an inclined back plane to be isolated, studied in\u000a      detail and revised. The models allowed realistic scenarios to be explored\u000a      to provide device productivity results. The impact was design guidance\u000a        for OWSC devices and the OYSTER WEC was developed as a direct result of\u000a        this project [A].\u000a    Subsequently, Aquamarine Power plc with a team of 45 people was formed in\u000a      2005 to bring the OYSTER technology to the commercial market [B].\u000a      Since 2010, two full-scale prototypes of OYSTER\u000a        800 have been built and tested. In May 2013, the Scottish Government\u000a      granted a license for Aquamarine Power plc to develop the world's largest\u000a      grid-connected commercial wave power array deploying around 50 OYSTER\u000a      devices with a combined capacity to power almost 30,000 homes [C].\u000a      In 2012, RCUK cited OYSTER as one of its Impact exemplars of UK energy\u000a        research and capacity building [D].\u000a    2) Offshore Wind\u000a    The CMMFA was Co-Investigator on the Phase 2 EPSRC SUPERGEN WIND ENERGY\u000a      TECHNOLOGIES-CORE Consortium project EP\/H018662, `Towards the Offshore\u000a      Wind Power Station' [2010-2014]. This involved 26 academic and 7\u000a      industrial partners undertaking research to achieve an integrated, cost\u000a      effective, reliable and available Offshore Wind Power Station. CMMFA was\u000a      also a Co-Investigator on Phase 1 of the SUPERGEN WIND Energy Technologies\u000a      Consortium project EP\/D034566 [2006-2010]. The focus of the SUPERGEN WIND\u000a      project was on the technological challenges related to the exploitation of\u000a      the UK's extensive offshore wind refsource through interdisciplinary\u000a      research consisting of all relevant branches of engineering embracing\u000a      environmental impact, socio-economic and regulatory aspects. In\u000a      particular, this included electrical power engineering; condition\u000a      monitoring; use of innovative materials and active load reduction; rotor\u000a      aerodynamics; lighting and radar visibility; subsea foundations and\u000a      hydrodynamics. The project had 2 parallel themes. The first dealt with the\u000a      underlying physics and engineering of the offshore wind turbine farm\u000a      whilst the second looked specifically at the wind turbine itself, building\u000a      upon SUPERGEN Phase 1. The results of the two themes are now feeding into\u000a      a third Gathering Theme, which is developing the wind farm as an offshore\u000a      power station. Development focuses upon how the station should be\u000a      designed, operated and maintained for optimum reliability. It also\u000a      considers what form future developments should take such as the up-scaled\u000a      facilities on novel floating structures and the economics associated with\u000a      their implementation.\u000a    CMMFA was the only UK CFD group involved as Investigators in SUPERGEN\u000a      WIND Phases 1, 2 with sole project responsibility for the subsea\u000a      foundations and hydrodynamics areas. Working with partners at Lancaster\u000a      and Hull universities, it combined numerical modelling with laboratory\u000a      studies of foundation scour at wind turbine mounts and wave loading on\u000a      fixed and floating mounts. Knowledge transfer (KT) in SUPERGEN WIND Phase\u000a      1 and 2 occurs outside of the traditional dissemination routes of academic\u000a      publications. In SUPERGEN WIND KT occurs through i) formal Consortium\u000a      Management Group Meetings, which are attended by all academic partners and\u000a      the 7 industrial project partners (e.g. E.ON plc, GL Garrad Hassan,\u000a      Alstrom Grid Ltd) [E], ii) Research Monographs targeted at\u000a      knowledge transfer to industry [F] and iii) development of future\u000a      industrial energy leaders through EPSRC Doctoral Training Centres (DTCs).\u000a      These DTCs are part-funded by industrial partners who are also involved in\u000a      project selection, placement and recruitment of doctoral students [G].\u000a      Knowledge transfer also occurs via the SUPERGEN WIND Annual Assembles [H]\u000a      at which CMMFA have presented their research. Annual Assemblies are\u000a      attended by over 50 industrial players in the wind energy sector and EPSRC\u000a      Programme Managers and Policy Makers, who set and revise the agenda for\u000a      the RCUK Energy programme. CMMFA were invited participants at the January\u000a      2013 Wind Energy Scoping Workshop convened by EPSRC [I]. This\u000a      workshop defined the research areas to be prioritised for funding in Phase\u000a      3 of the 5-year programme from 2015, leading to the current Call for\u000a      Proposals under SUPERGEN WIND. The new areas in Phase 3 include further\u000a      work proposed by CMMFA on improved and adventurous foundation concepts to\u000a      increase understanding of the dynamics of floating platforms in deeper\u000a      water underpinned by the work carried out by CMMFA and partners in Phase 2\u000a      of the programme.

These documents set out the UK Government policy and\u000a      target to deliver 15% of UK energy from renewables by 2020. Eight\u000a      technology areas are identified: onshore wind, offshore wind, marine\u000a      energy, biomass electricity, biomass heat, ground\/air source heat pumps\u000a      and renewable transport. Responsibility for delivering the technology\u000a      rests in part with the RCUK Energy Programme, which, through its funded\u000a      programmes, seeks to position the UK to meet its energy and environmental\u000a      targets and policy goals through world-class research with impact,\u000a      capacity building and training. The RCUK programme, with &#163;625M invested\u000a      thus far, is helping the UK to make evidence-based policy decisions on\u000a      energy addressing the climate change agenda, including changes to\u000a      regulatory mechanisms and impact assessments. CMMFA's research and Impact\u000a      case study is linked to 2 of the above 8 technology areas, namely marine\u000a      energy and offshore wind.\u000a    Active in the area of free surface hydrodynamics since 1995, CMMFA has\u000a      developed in-house advanced computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models and\u000a      software. The work cited relates to the environmental impact assessment\u000a      arising from climate change, sea level rise and increased storm activity\u000a      in the offshore environment. This has critical implications for the safe\u000a      deployment and survivability of past, existing and proposed offshore\u000a      structures for both wind and wave power, which in deep water are\u000a      increasingly likely to be novel floating structures. The design and\u000a      survivability of these structures depends critically on the reliability of\u000a      hydrodynamic impact load predictions. These are a key component of a fully\u000a      integrated design solution for offshore marine structures involving other\u000a      disciplines such as electrical power engineering, materials science, rotor\u000a      aerodynamics and condition monitoring as well as environmental impact,\u000a      regulatory and socio-economic issues.\u000a    Supported by experimental studies conducted in collaborating partner\u000a      laboratories at Bath, Edinburgh, Hull, Lancaster, Manchester, Oxford,\u000a      Plymouth and Queen's Belfast universities, work was focused upon\u000a      constructing a detailed, validated, computational model in the form of a\u000a      so-called numerical wave tank (NWT). This simulates both laboratory-scale\u000a      and full-scale devices in realistic wave climates and led to the\u000a      development of the CMMFA's AMAZON suite of flow codes. CMMFA brought novel\u000a      developments in numerical techniques over the discipline boundary from its\u000a      pre-1995 work in aeronautical CFD. CMMFA pioneered their use in the sister\u000a      discipline of hydrodynamics. These included optimized adaptive mesh\u000a      generation that preserves the favourable properties and simplicity of\u000a      rectangular grids whilst combining these with so-called cut (trimmed)\u000a      cells [1] that align with stationary irregular boundaries\/terrain,\u000a      or objects moving with up to six degrees of freedom (DoF); and,\u000a      Riemann-based flow solvers that provide high resolution of cell-interface\u000a      fluxes [2]. The suite of codes developed included i) a numerical\u000a      wave flume based on the shallow water equations (a depth-integrated form\u000a      of the Navier-Stokes equations) suitable for calculating wave run-up in\u000a      near-shore regions [3] and, ii) a 3D NWT based on a full two-fluid\u000a      viscous Navier-Stokes solution in both air and water regions above and\u000a      below the free (water) surface. This can model wave generation,\u000a      steepening, overturning and breaking over a structure [4, 5]. In\u000a      the NWT, numerical wave paddles move, either singly or in groups, to\u000a      generate the required wave characteristics, e.g. directionally focussed\u000a      waves. Boundary conditions eliminate reflections or allow waves to pass\u000a      through. Outputs are a full set of flow variables e.g. pressure and\u000a      velocity fields, water surface elevations, forces and body motion\u000a      response. These supplement laboratory experiments and prototype testing.\u000a      The result is a fully detailed flow model incorporating all relevant\u000a      physics above and below the water surface. This includes the fluids, air\u000a      and water, aeration as waves break and impact a structure, wind effects on\u000a      waves and the motion response of the structure. In contrast\u000a      contemporaneous diffraction models and potential flow codes were not\u000a      suitable for breaking waves whilst previous NWTs based on the full\u000a      Navier-Stokes equations did not include compressible phenomena such as\u000a      aeration and cavitation. This may be important in quantifying loadings\u000a      under extreme wave conditions in which structures must survive [6].\u000a      Since 1999, the group's work in the hydrodynamics area has been funded\u000a      continuously by the EPSRC via 12 research grants and two Joule Centre\u000a      grants, (total &gt; &#163;10M). Seven of these are within the current REF\u000a      period (four are current). The majority of awards involve collaboration\u000a      with leading laboratory-based groups (as stated above) or are\u000a      multi-disciplinary consortium-led collaborations, e.g. with project\u000a      partners in the EPSRC SUPERGEN\u000a      programmes. The group has produced over 60 peer-reviewed publications in\u000a      the underpinning area.\u000a    Key CMMFA Researchers Professor Derek Causon, 1986 &#8212; present.\u000a      Professor Clive Mingham, 1989 &#8212; present\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"34496","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Principal impacts arising from our research were evidence to government\u000d\u000a      and NGOs on the risks to biodiversity from air pollution and the\u000d\u000a      development of methods and policies for upland peatland restoration and\u000d\u000a      re-establishment of Sphagnum moss.\u000d\u000a    Impacts on policy of air pollution effects on ecosystems:\u000d\u000a    Critical loads are used by government and NGOs to inform decision-making\u000d\u000a      on planning applications for industry and agriculture.

Since\u000d\u000a      1994, CEEREC has investigated the consequences of nitrogen pollution, acid\u000d\u000a      rain and ozone on semi-natural vegetation in particular heathlands,\u000d\u000a      grasslands and bogs. The research of CEEREC utilises field experiments and\u000d\u000a      national surveys to show the harm caused by nitrogen pollution to a range\u000d\u000a      of semi-natural habitats. Research is rooted in work on Welsh moorlands\u000d\u000a      where long term nitrogen experiments since 1993 have highlighted the\u000d\u000a      sensitivity to nitrogen pollution of ecological processes including raised\u000d\u000a      nitrogen leaching, base cation depletion, increased winter injury, loss of\u000d\u000a      lichens and bryophytes [1]. This work has been undertaken within\u000d\u000a      the context of NERC and DEFRA research programmes [G1], [G2].\u000d\u000a    The arrival of Dise in 2005 broadened CEEREC's interests to include\u000d\u000a      landscape studies of nitrogen impacts on various plant communities.\u000d\u000a      Research on acid grasslands found a decline in species richness of western\u000d\u000a      European grasslands in response to pollutant nitrogen (ESF BEGIN\u000d\u000a      consortium project, 2006-2009, &#8364;760k) [2], [3]. MMU led a project\u000d\u000a      on pollution indicators within the DEFRA programme with York, Imperial,\u000d\u000a      Sheffield Universities, Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology and the James\u000d\u000a      Hutton Institute on the effects of acidification and eutrophication on\u000d\u000a      terrestrial ecosystems and their recovery' [4], [G1], [G3].\u000d\u000a      Our research demonstrated the similar vulnerability to air pollution of\u000d\u000a      five very distinct habitats across the UK. Our research on plant community\u000d\u000a      composition expanded when Dise lead a European consortium of 50 academics\u000d\u000a      and practitioners exploring the impacts of pollution, precipitation and\u000d\u000a      temperature on peatland biodiversity and biogeochemistry from southern\u000d\u000a      Europe to the Arctic [G4], [G5]. Caporn's research on\u000d\u000a      heathlands [5] showed that these systems impacted by nitrogen\u000d\u000a      pollution would only recover slowly due to the effects of long-term\u000d\u000a      nitrogen accumulation. In the Pennine moorlands where acute historic\u000d\u000a      pollution contributed to catastrophic degeneration, CEEREC demonstrated\u000d\u000a      that intervention measures were required to restore plant communities and\u000d\u000a      some degree of ecosystem function, [7].\u000d\u000a    In the southern Pennines, air pollution has played a significant\u000d\u000a      historical role in peatland degradation. Our research reported in Bonn et\u000d\u000a      al 2009, [A], on the natural recovery of Sphagnum in the\u000d\u000a      southern Pennines [T1], [T2], showed that air quality in\u000d\u000a      the Peak District National Park is now at least adequate for restoration\u000d\u000a      of Sphagnum. This is the keystone species of active, healthy\u000d\u000a      peatlands providing vital ecosystem services including water management\u000d\u000a      and carbon sequestration. In collaboration with Moors for the Future [G6],\u000d\u000a      Sen demonstrated that microbial succession accompanies vegetation\u000d\u000a      re-establishment of bare peat, crucial knowledge underpinning the costly\u000d\u000a      peatland restoration procedure. Sen has applied DNA-based functional\u000d\u000a      micro-biomics to improve understanding of functional nitrogen-cycling in\u000d\u000a      soil and the associated plant root microbial drivers in peatland\u000d\u000a      restoration. CEEREC has explored novel techniques to restore Sphagnum\u000d\u000a      moss on many degraded peat soils and its research and knowledge transfer\u000d\u000a      is leading scientific approaches to Sphagnum bog restoration in\u000d\u000a      the UK.

In order to\u000d\u000a      generate this stockpile, the power\u000d\u000a      station already employs 2,000 previously unemployed people [e]. This makes\u000d\u000a      the power station the\u000d\u000a      largest employer in the District, offering salaries of &#163;125-130 per month,\u000d\u000a      higher than the regional\u000d\u000a      average. Dr Choge, Principal Research Officer from the Kenyan Forestry\u000d\u000a      Research Institute\u000d\u000a      (KEFRI) stated this has \"changed people's lives because they now have\u000d\u000a        a livelihood.\" Ahmed has\u000d\u000a      stated that this \"wouldn't have happened without Harris's contribution\u000d\u000a        via regional-level research\".\u000d\u000a    Impacts on public policy and services\u000d\u000a      In Kenya, Prosopis has spread over an estimated 41.5 million\u000d\u000a      hectares severely affecting farming\u000d\u000a      and grazing. Coventry, with the Kenyan Forestry Research Institute, ran a\u000d\u000a      series of workshops\u000d\u000a      during 2008 in Baringo, Garissa and Tana River Districts. Choge confirmed\u000d\u000a      that at each locality, 50\u000d\u000a      people were trained in the utilisation and management of Prosopis,\u000d\u000a      and that Kenyan government\u000d\u000a      officers responsible for agriculture, livestock and environment also\u000d\u000a      participated. The following two\u000d\u000a      policy impacts in Kenya have resulted from the underpinning research,\u000d\u000a      intermediate dissemination\u000d\u000a      and subsequent workshops:-\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      In 2008, the Kenyan Government produced draft legislation proposing\u000d\u000a        the control of Prosopis\u000d\u000a        using a biological control insect. Choge confirmed that the Kenyan\u000d\u000a        Government has recently\u000d\u000a        changed its approach towards Prosopis from \"eradication\u000d\u000a          towards management\", emphasising\u000d\u000a        that this change in policy has been influenced by the Kenyan Forestry\u000d\u000a        Research Institute and\u000d\u000a        the Unit's research.\u000d\u000a      Until 2008, most use of trees for charcoal was illegal in Kenya. The\u000d\u000a        classification and research\u000d\u000a        knowledge on the utilization of Prosopis by Coventry contributed\u000d\u000a        to the blanket ban being lifted,\u000d\u000a        and permitted Prosopis being used as a charcoal source, allowing\u000d\u000a        communities in Kenya to\u000d\u000a        start commercial production. Official records of charcoal sales gathered\u000d\u000a        from individual\u000d\u000a        communities in all the three districts since the charcoal trade ban was\u000d\u000a        lifted averaged &#163;440,000\u000d\u000a        per year.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Bennett's research on rangeland management has stimulated policy\u000d\u000a      debate in South Africa.\u000d\u000a      Tshintsha Amakhaya, an alliance of rural people and NGOs in South Africa,\u000d\u000a      invited Bennett to give\u000d\u000a      a presentation at an expert workshop held by the Grassland Society in 2010\u000d\u000a      entitled:\u000d\u000a      `Mainstreaming new paradigms in communal rangelands: how can we\u000d\u000a        influence policy in South\u000d\u000a        Africa'.

As a\u000d\u000a      result, sessions have been allocated at Annual Grassland Congresses every\u000d\u000a      year since 2010 and\u000d\u000a      interest in the debate is growing (45 people were involved in the 2012\u000d\u000a      discussions).\u000d\u000a    In 2013 Bennett guest-edited a Special Issue of the African\u000d\u000a      Journal of Range and Forage Science\u000d\u000a      entitled `Aligning policy with the socio-ecological dynamics of rangeland\u000d\u000a      commons' [f]. This Special\u000d\u000a      issue has provided a pathway to research impact. It was launched in South\u000d\u000a      Africa at the Grassland\u000d\u000a      Society Annual Congress in July 2013, with two hundred people in\u000d\u000a      attendance. A subsequent\u000d\u000a      panel discussion at the Congress attracted the attention of senior\u000d\u000a      figures, including the South\u000d\u000a      African Deputy Director-Generals for Animal Production and Rangeland in\u000d\u000a      the National Department\u000d\u000a      of Agriculture (which is part of the larger Department of Agriculture,\u000d\u000a      Horticulture and Fisheries).\u000d\u000a      The launch re-emphasised the need for policy makers to incorporate the\u000d\u000a      expertise of the\u000d\u000a      Grassland Society (highlighted by Bennett's Special Issue) in\u000d\u000a      policy. Following the panel\u000d\u000a      discussion the Grassland Society was approached in July 2013 to contribute\u000d\u000a      to the \"Policy for the\u000d\u000a      sustainable management of veld (range) and forage resources in South\u000d\u000a      Africa\" [h].\u000d\u000a    Impacts on society, culture and creativity\u000d\u000a      The Unit ran a series of dissemination workshops on Prosopis in\u000d\u000a      India, and subsequently Kenya.\u000d\u000a      Beneficiaries included trainees from local farmer field schools, village\u000d\u000a      chiefs and district officials. The\u000d\u000a      first Unit-led Prosopis workshop ran in 1999. In 2001 workshops\u000d\u000a      were held in three states of India,\u000d\u000a      with more than 150 participants. In 2006 a workshop was held in Kenya,\u000d\u000a      with 26 attendees, on the\u000d\u000a      use of Prosopis flour and chainsaw milling for Prosopis\u000d\u000a      timber. In addition, public forums were led\u000d\u000a      by the Unit and the Kenyan Forestry Research Institute in Baringo, Garissa\u000d\u000a      and Tana River\u000d\u000a      localities each attracting over 200 participants. Since then, the Kenyan\u000d\u000a      Forestry Research Institute\u000d\u000a      have extended the training courses nationally across Kenya, and\u000d\u000a      internationally in Djibouti.\u000d\u000a    Studies conducted in 2012 concluded that the sale of Prosopis\u000d\u000a      products is now providing up to 46%\u000d\u000a      of family income in Baringo, and approaching one million pounds per year\u000d\u000a      of additional income in\u000d\u000a      Baringo, Garissa and Tana River since 2008 [d]. Included in\u000d\u000a      this was income earned from the sale of\u000d\u000a      pods for animal feed and poles used in the construction of local huts,\u000d\u000a      particularly in Garissa where\u000d\u000a      they are used in the Dadaab refugee camp, the largest in the world. These\u000d\u000a      huge benefits are\u000d\u000a      considered self-sustaining and expected to increase. Choge [d]\u000d\u000a      noted that \"there is an increasing use\u000d\u000a        of processed Prosopis pods by many communities for feeding livestock as\u000d\u000a        a positive impact of the\u000d\u000a        awareness and training programmes in the recent years by the Government\u000d\u000a        and other development\u000d\u000a        partners\".\u000d\u000a    Conclusion\u000d\u000a      This case study demonstrates that the Unit's research had economic\u000d\u000a        impact and enabled The\u000d\u000a      Mesquite Company to diversify and enter into entirely new profitable\u000d\u000a      markets. It has also opened\u000d\u000a      up the opportunity for a Prosopis-fuelled power station. In\u000d\u000a      addition, the research has an impact on\u000d\u000a        public policy and services providing information to both South\u000d\u000a      African and Kenyan government\u000d\u000a      officials. The Prosopis research enabled the Kenyan government to\u000d\u000a      lift a blanket ban on plant-based\u000d\u000a      charcoal and change its policy approach to Prosopis from\u000d\u000a      \"eradication to management\". The\u000d\u000a      rangeland management research has informed South African policy debate.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This Unit's staff and associates have considerable expertise in land\u000d\u000a      management, focussing on two\u000d\u000a      issues faced in Africa; the management of communal rangelands and the\u000d\u000a      management of native\u000d\u000a      species for the benefit of local communities. Coventry University is a\u000d\u000a      recognized centre of global\u000d\u000a      knowledge on Prosopis, a series of economically and ecologically\u000d\u000a      important tree species, but also\u000d\u000a      widely-considered potentially serious weeds in many countries.\u000d\u000a      Underpinning research carried out at\u000d\u000a      Coventry was pivotal to the correct identification, evaluation and\u000d\u000a      subsequent management and\u000d\u000a      utilisation of the most common tropical species, Prosopis juliflora\u000d\u000a      and Prosopis pallida. Other\u000d\u000a      research, on the management of common rangelands, has provided an\u000d\u000a      understanding of the way\u000d\u000a      common land rights are expressed in communal areas and the social,\u000d\u000a      political and ecological factors\u000d\u000a      which govern them.\u000d\u000a    The Unit's research has led to economic impacts, including for\u000d\u000a      The Mesquite Company (Texas)\u000d\u000a      who generate USD 150,000 each year from the sale of Prosopis\u000d\u000a      products. The research has also\u000d\u000a      had impact on public policy and society in Kenya and South Africa.\u000d\u000a      In Kenya, the Government\u000d\u000a      changed its approach towards Prosopis from eradication towards\u000d\u000a      management and lifted a\u000d\u000a      blanket-ban on the use of plant-based charcoal as a result of the Unit's\u000d\u000a      research. This enabled the\u000d\u000a      Green Power Station (currently employing 2000 people) to be established.\u000d\u000a      In South Africa, policy\u000d\u000a      debate has been informed by research on the governance of common land. The\u000d\u000a      research has also\u000d\u000a      had impact on creativity, culture and society, informing public\u000d\u000a      and political debate in South\u000d\u000a      Africa, Kenya and India.

The impact of\u000d\u000a      the Prosopis research has been achieved by a highly collaborative\u000d\u000a      team of researchers,\u000d\u000a      policymakers and regional officials, of whom Harris et al were an\u000d\u000a      essential component. Prosopis\u000d\u000a      consists of around 45 species of spiny trees and shrubs found in regions\u000d\u000a      of the Americas, Africa,\u000d\u000a      Western Asia, and South Asia. They often thrive in arid soil and are\u000d\u000a      resistant to drought, positive\u000d\u000a      characteristics that have led them rapidly to colonise large areas of\u000d\u000a      grazing land. As such Prosopis\u000d\u000a      is often considered an invasive weed in several countries where it has\u000d\u000a      been introduced, including\u000d\u000a      in Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Jamaica, the Middle East, India, Nigeria, Sudan,\u000d\u000a      Senegal and Southern\u000d\u000a      Africa. Reports state that worldwide, millions of hectares have been\u000d\u000a      invaded by the species, from\u000d\u000a      both natural and artificial spread (through the grazing of animals that\u000d\u000a      eat the seed pods).\u000d\u000a      Eradication programmes have been tried in many countries, but with limited\u000d\u000a      success. The\u000d\u000a      fundamental research of Harris et al, in identifying two of the\u000d\u000a      most common tropical species has led\u000d\u000a      to programmes to manage and utilise, rather than eradicate the species.\u000d\u000a    Bennett (Senior Lecturer, at Coventry since 2002) and Barrett\u000d\u000a      (submitted to UoA21) extended the\u000d\u000a      research on land management in a different direction, examining the\u000d\u000a      management and governance\u000d\u000a      issues of common grazing land. This research has informed the development\u000d\u000a      of effective\u000d\u000a      institutional policies for the management of common land at both a local\u000d\u000a      and national level in South\u000d\u000a      Africa.\u000d\u000a    The following research, which occurred in parallel and in synergy,\u000d\u000a      contributed to the research impact:\u000d\u000a    Field research confirming appropriate species for tropical arid\u000d\u000a        conditions (1993-1998)\u000d\u000a      A DFID-funded project (1991-1995, &#163;233,000) assessed the field performance\u000d\u000a      of more than 100\u000d\u000a      seed sources of twelve Prosopis species in Cape Verde. This was\u000d\u000a      supported by laboratory,\u000d\u000a      greenhouse and nursery experiments in the UK and Oman, which provided an\u000d\u000a      understanding of\u000d\u000a      drought-tolerance, and assessed techniques for propagating improved\u000d\u000a      material. A parallel DFID-funded\u000d\u000a      project in India (1992-1995, &#163;65,000) cross-tested the same material and\u000d\u000a      techniques. P.\u000d\u000a        juliflora and P. pallida were confirmed as the most suitable\u000d\u000a      species for tropical arid conditions, though\u000d\u000a      this research also identified clear problems surrounding their taxonomy [b].\u000d\u000a    Taxonomic research resolving the identification and distribution of\u000d\u000a      Prosopis (1998-2013)\u000d\u000a      Suitable molecular markers and foliar characters [3,4,5] were\u000d\u000a      identified in collaboration with the\u000d\u000a      Universidad P&#250;blica de Navarra, Spain, supported by grants from the Royal\u000d\u000a      Society and British\u000d\u000a      Council (1999-2002, &#163;20,000). An important innovation was the additional\u000d\u000a      use of chromosome\u000d\u000a      numbers [2], leading to a breakthrough discovery that allowed the clear\u000d\u000a      separation of P. juliflora and\u000d\u000a      P. pallida.

Cook's\u000a      work has been invaluable to police authorities by helping to determine\u000a      whether cases require\u000a      further investigation, and has been influential in the progress or closure\u000a      of a number of high profile\u000a      legal cases.\u000a    \u000a      Haut de la Garenne children's home, Jersey: analysis of bone remains\u000a        discovered at the\u000a        site during a child abuse investigation in 2008 proved that, although\u000a        human, they were not\u000a        from modern times and therefore not the result of murder when the home\u000a        was open in the\u000a        1960s-80s. No further investigation was required.\u000a      A Victorian murder: when a skull was unearthed in Sir David\u000a        Attenborough's garden, 14C\u000a        analysis helped to identify the victim as Julia Thomas, killed in 1879\u000a        by her maid.\u000a      Operation Malachi, featured on BBC Crimewatch: analysis determined\u000a        that a body\u000a        discovered behind hoardings in Manchester was that of a woman who was\u000a        born in the early\u000a        to mid-1950s and who died in the late 1960s to early 1970s. This case is\u000a        ongoing.\u000a    \u000a    Radiocarbon analysis has been carried out for Revenue &#8212; Irish Tax and\u000a      Customs, Merseyside\u000a      Police and TRACE Wildlife Forensics Network to establish whether animal\u000a      parts such as elephant\u000a      ivory and rhinoceros horn came from animals that were alive during the\u000a      nuclear weapons era and\u000a      therefore traded illegally. In the context of this work, Cook has appeared\u000a      as an expert witness at\u000a      Winchester Crown Court (23 June 2009). One client, Cellmark Forensic\u000a      Services, undertakes\u000a      commercial forensic and genetic profiling for many police forces, and has\u000a      engaged Cook's\u000a      expertise to provide accurate analysis of bone and ivory on 12 occasions\u000a      during 2011-13. The\u000a      quality of the service that they have received has enabled the company to\u000a      grow its caseload during\u000a      2012.\u000a    Archaeology: Invaluable Cultural Treasures\u000a    In 2012 Cook and Hamilton collaborated with researchers from the\u000a      Universities of Leicester and\u000a      Oxford to analyse bones excavated from a car park that were believed to be\u000a      those of Richard III.\u000a      Standard 14C analysis alone did not provide the correct\u000a      timeframe to confirm his identity. However,\u000a      applying Bayesian techniques and taking data on his diet and the marine\u000a      reservoir effect correction\u000a      into account made it possible to pinpoint the time of death to demonstrate\u000a      that the remains were\u000a      consistent with Richard III (later absolutely confirmed by DNA analysis).\u000a      In 2008 the National Trust\u000a      for Scotland asked Cook to date artefacts from the Isle of Iona, where St\u000a      Columba established a\u000a      monastery in 563 AD and where, during the following century, his church\u000a      played a major role in the\u000a      expansion of Christianity in northern Britain. The work at SUERC\u000a      demonstrated human\u000a      colonisation of the island many centuries prior to construction of the\u000a      monastery. This finding has\u000a      been recognised by the Scottish Parliament for its cultural importance. In\u000a      2011, Historic Scotland\u000a      asked Cook to provide a chronology for the formation of the Ring of\u000a      Brodgar, which is a key\u000a      monument in the Heart of Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site. Analysis\u000a      determined that the\u000a      standing stones pre-date Stonehenge, thus underscoring their national and\u000a      international\u000a      importance.\u000a    Bayesian statistical methods were added to the SUERC laboratory in 2011.\u000a      These methods enable\u000a      the laboratory to provide a complete analytical approach from advice on\u000a      the optimum number and\u000a      type of samples for a particular study to actual 14C analyses\u000a      and a detailed Bayesian report.\u000a    Commercial archaeology companies have benefitted in multiple ways from\u000a      the inclusion of\u000a      Bayesian statistics in post-excavation programmes. Perhaps most\u000a      importantly, by developing\u000a      Bayesian chronologies they have been able to produce historic and\u000a      prehistoric narratives that\u000a      engage the community's interest, e.g. Gwynedd Archaeological Trust &#8212; Site:\u000a      Ysgol yr Hendre.

Thus before legislation was introduced in 1996,\u000d\u000a      consumers were unaware of whether or not food had been irradiated. SUERC\u000d\u000a      researchers led by Sanderson were the first to develop methods and\u000d\u000a      equipment for screening foodstuffs for irradiation, and this work led to\u000d\u000a      the formulation of UK and European standards providing protection and\u000d\u000a      reassurance to consumers.\u000d\u000a    In 2001 Sanderson's tests on UK food supplements found that a high\u000d\u000a      proportion (42%) had been irradiated and were not in compliance with the\u000d\u000a      law. Subsequent testing in other countries found that this was a\u000d\u000a      widespread problem and this information was made public. Sanderson's team\u000d\u000a      has continued to analyse samples for food retailer and supplier clients,\u000d\u000a      testing over 3,000 since 2008.\u000d\u000a    Sanderson and his team developed two international standard methods based\u000d\u000a      on the use of luminescence to detect irradiation: BS EN 1788 (first\u000d\u000a      introduced in 1996) and BS EN 13751 (first introduced in 2001). Today,\u000d\u000a      these standard methods are the most widely used to detect irradiated foods\u000d\u000a      and remain unchanged since their introduction. Every consumer in the UK\u000d\u000a      and Europe has benefitted from the added protection provided by the work\u000d\u000a      of Sanderson's team in relation to food labelling and screening.\u000d\u000a      Authenticity and traceability of foodstuffs are important to consumers,\u000d\u000a      regulators and the food industry. In compliance with EC legislation, the\u000d\u000a      UK Food Labelling Regulations 1996 and the Food Irradiation Provision\u000d\u000a      Regulation 2000 require all foods, or listed ingredients of food, that\u000d\u000a      have been irradiated, to be labelled with the words \"irradiated\" or\u000d\u000a      \"treated with ionising radiation\". Therefore the work carried out in SUERC\u000d\u000a      has provided consumers with substantially enhanced protection from\u000d\u000a      unlabelled irradiated food.\u000d\u000a    The International Atomic Energy Agency's Food Irradiation Specialist\u000d\u000a      states:\u000d\u000a    EN1788 and EN13751 are the most widely used methods to detect\u000d\u000a        irradiated foods. In a regulatory sense, EN1788 and EN13751 are\u000d\u000a        necessary to ensure that food can be tested for compliance with the law.\u000d\u000a        Both tests used together are a powerful tool in ensuring compliance with\u000d\u000a        food irradiation regulations and also labelling regulations [to ensure\u000d\u000a        that food is correctly labelled as irradiated]....\u000d\u000a      The use of these tests by regulators has ensured that food businesses\u000d\u000a        (especially those who deal in food supplements) take action to check\u000d\u000a        their products for irradiation on a routine basis.\u000d\u000a      The availability of these tests for use by the food industry has also\u000d\u000a      helped to settle disputes between companies. The tests are also available\u000d\u000a      to be used by consumer groups and others who would like to test the\u000d\u000a      authenticity of food.\u000d\u000a    Professor Sanderson's laboratory is recognized as the foremost in the\u000d\u000a        use of and development of luminescence techniques to detect irradiated\u000d\u000a        food. [Full statement available from HEI]\u000d\u000a    To support enforcement of these regulations, the two standard methods are\u000d\u000a      employed successfully by governments across Europe. There have been\u000d\u000a      several cases where companies have been found to be supplying irradiated\u000d\u000a      products in violation of the legislation, leading to costly recalls (often\u000d\u000a      sanction enough) and other enforcement action including at least one UK\u000d\u000a      prosecution. Food retailers and suppliers also use Sanderson's methods for\u000d\u000a      screening ingredients, thus managing their regulatory risk.\u000d\u000a    Sanderson's laboratory is recognised as the world-leader in the detection\u000d\u000a      of irradiation in foods.

The UK Advisory Committee for Irradiated and\u000d\u000a      Novel Foods (ACINF) reported in 1986 that \"there are as yet no generally\u000d\u000a      applicable chemical or physical tests which would be adequate for the\u000d\u000a      enforcement of legal and commercial requirements, or for investigation\u000d\u000a      purposes, for determining whether a food or a food ingredient has been\u000d\u000a      irradiated\". At the time it was increasingly common for products ranging\u000d\u000a      from root vegetables to cereals, fruits, seafood, meats and spices to be\u000d\u000a      subjected to ionising radiation by gamma rays and high-energy X-rays. But\u000d\u000a      there was no legal or other statutory requirement for such irradiation to\u000d\u000a      be disclosed to retailers and consumers, despite potential health hazards.\u000d\u000a    Professor David Sanderson (Lecturer then Senior Lecturer 1986-2004,\u000d\u000a      Reader 2004-08, Professor 2008-present), was working with luminescence\u000d\u000a      research based on single photon counting for several years and was\u000d\u000a      convinced that it would be a suitable technique for detection of\u000d\u000a      irradiated foods. Sanderson received the first of a series of contracts\u000d\u000a      from the Ministry of Agriculture in 1987 to investigate the suitability of\u000d\u000a      luminescence methods for this purpose.\u000d\u000a    The underlying processes, when minerals and other dielectric media store\u000d\u000a      energy from ionising radiation by charge trapping at defect centres,\u000d\u000a      leading to luminescence emission under stimulation, were known from\u000d\u000a      solid-state physics research. Thermoluminescence dating of ceramics and\u000d\u000a      thermoluminescence dosimetry using natural and synthetic materials applies\u000d\u000a      such principles. Sanderson had previously been involved in development and\u000d\u000a      application of these phenomena using single photon counting methods. The\u000d\u000a      application to bioinorganic systems and to mixed organic\/inorganic\u000d\u000a      materials, however, was new. In particular he recognised that PSL might be\u000d\u000a      capable of detecting food irradiation using anti-Stokes wavelength shifts\u000d\u000a      in new luminescence instruments. Exploratory spectroscopy verified the\u000d\u000a      applicability of the phenomena and systematic work on herbs, spices,\u000d\u000a      fruits, vegetables and shellfish had been completed by 1994. Parallel\u000d\u000a      development of novel high sensitivity pulsed photostimulation systems,\u000d\u000a      patented in 1993, led to the production of commercial screening\u000d\u000a      instruments.\u000d\u000a    Sanderson developed two international standard methods based on\u000d\u000a      luminescence. BS EN 1788 describes the application of thermoluminescence\u000d\u000a      to silicates extracted from a wide variety of foods using techniques first\u000d\u000a      developed at his laboratory. BS EN 13751 describes the use of pulsed PSL\u000d\u000a      for rapid instrumental screening. These standards are still the most\u000d\u000a      widely used methods to detect irradiated food.\u000d\u000a    The development and validation of these methods has been the result of a\u000d\u000a      series of externally funded research projects including those supported by\u000d\u000a      the UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) and the Food\u000d\u000a      Standards Agency.\u000d\u000a    This research has been carried out by Professor Sanderson and his\u000d\u000a      research team, Dr Lorna Carmichael (Postdoctoral Research Associate\u000d\u000a      1990-present) and Dr Saffron Fisk (Technician 1996-99 and 2004-11).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37237","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    A. Conservation of unique fossil site\u000a    In 2005, in collaboration with Prof Hou, Siveter and Aldridge (and Derek\u000a      Siveter from Oxford) were\u000a      the only academics from outside China asked to help the Yuri Municipal\u000a      Government &#8212; the\u000a      administrative region within which Chengjiang is located &#8212; to prepare an\u000a      application for World\u000a      Heritage Status.

The\u000a      first overview of the full diversity of the fossil biota was central to\u000a      demonstrating that the fossils\u000a      present are equal if not greater in diversity and quality of preservation\u000a      than other sites of\u000a      exceptional preservation already recognized as WHS.\u000a    Any country is eligible to send to UNESCO a list of nominees for World\u000a      Heritage Status.

But the\u000a      processes by which\u000a      exceptionally preserved fossils came to be fossilized are complex, and\u000a      disentangling the important\u000a      biological and evolutionary signals from the noise of post-mortem decay,\u000a      preservation biases, and\u000a      geological processes is fraught with difficulties. This is an area in\u000a      which Leicester's Palaeo3 Group\u000a      specializes.\u000a    The Unit's work in this area has combined three complementary strands of\u000a      research:\u000a    \u000a      New anatomical and evolutionary interpretations of exceptionally\u000a        preserved animals,\u000a        including work on the earliest known fossil vertebrates, diversity and\u000a        early evolution of\u000a        arthropods [1-3;], primitive deuterostomes, and methods\u000a        for robust anatomical analysis.\u000a      Detailed analysis of mechanisms of preservation, describing the\u000a        minerals involved and\u000a        explaining the process of fossilization of exceptionally preserved\u000a        fossils, such as those in\u000a        the Chengjiang biota [4].\u000a      Experimental analysis of biases resulting from differential decay of\u000a        soft-tissues, providing\u000a        data for the sequence and timing of decay of the characteristics used in\u000a        identification and\u000a        interpretation of fossilized soft tissues, allowing analysis of whether\u000a        fossils look primitive\u000a        because they rotted to some degree before they were fossilized [5].\u000a    \u000a    This third strand &#8212; revealing how decay of bodies can distort the fossil\u000a      record of evolution &#8212; has led\u000a      directly to significant public engagement.\u000a    Of particular relevance to this case is a body of research on the\u000a      anatomy, evolutionary\u000a      relationships and preservation of Chengjiang fossils. The Chengjiang\u000a      fossil site was first\u000a      discovered by Chinese geologist Hou Xianguang.

This work developed into a\u000a      long-standing joint research\u000a      partnership between University of Leicester academics and Prof Hou (now\u000a      director of Yunnan Key\u000a      Laboratory for Palaeobiology at Yunnan University, Kunming, China).\u000a      Leicester's particular\u000a      contribution to this partnership, which is ongoing, has been the\u000a      scientific interpretation and analysis\u000a      of the Chengjiang fossils. This expertise has consistently been at the\u000a      cutting edge of\u000a      palaeobiology. It is this interpretation and analysis which have revealed\u000a      unique insights into the\u000a      roots of animal biodiversity, leading UNESCO to recognize their\u000a      Outstanding Universal Value.\u000a    In 2005, Professors David Siveter and Richard Aldridge were awarded Guest\u000a      Professorships at\u000a      Yunnan University.

Contributions to the film:\u000a    I. A physical role in the film. Unwin featured in two stories, `Darwinopterus'\u000a      and `Robodactylus', filmed in London at the end of July 2010. With the\u000a      exception of the host, Attenborough, this was the longest appearance in\u000a      the film by a contributor. Unwin also appeared in the `Making of Flying\u000a        Monsters' (A).\u000a    II. Unwin was the lead scientific consultant on the film and contributed\u000a      to the development of the script, assessment of ideas and story lines and\u000a      fact-checking. He also provided critical feedback on animations and film\u000a      sequences. Discussion of the central narrative and of several episodes,\u000a      e.g. on Darwinopterus, took place during an all-day meeting in\u000a      London in early 2010 and subsequently by email and phone (B).\u000a    III. Generation and provision, between December 2009 and April 2010, of\u000a      information on film locations (e.g. Solnhofen, Germany; Crayssac, France),\u000a      an extensive list of contacts and advice on the suitability and\u000a      accessibility of specific objects (e.g. specimens of Darwinopterus)\u000a      (B).\u000a    B. Investment in the British Film Industry.\u000a    Approval of the film project by Sky brought considerable benefit to\u000a      Atlantic, the producer of FM3D, and its subcontractors (C).\u000a      Principal among these were: ONSIGHT 3D, responsible for postproduction and\u000a      editing services; Vision3 who supervised the 3D filming and provided\u000a      production support; ZOO , who generated the high resolution CGI suitable\u000a      for the very large screens found in Imax theatres; and FIDO, who developed\u000a      and built models used in filming and CGI production (C). In total,\u000a      more than 130 people were involved in the project which spanned the period\u000a      late 2009 to late 2010 (D).\u000a    The primary benefit came in the form of financial funding (&gt;&#163;3\u000a      million) principally from Sky. Work on FM3D provided Atlantic and its\u000a      subcontractors with a unique opportunity to develop high end 3D film\u000a      technology and processes, described by Atlantic CEO Anthony Geffen as `an\u000a      evolving tool-set' (E), and thus acquire expertise and experience\u000a      in this important and rapidly developing area. `Flying Monsters' thus\u000a      became a `showcase for 3D moviemaking' as applied to documentaries (F).\u000a      Building directly on the financial and critical success of this project\u000a      (see below) Atlantic have gone on to produce a series of documentaries\u000a      (e.g. `Galapagos 3D', `Micro Monsters 3D'), that have also met with\u000a      critical acclaim (F).\u000a    C. Revenue generation and distribution\u000a    Unusually, for a science documentary, FM3D has been a great financial\u000a      success. By May 2013 it had generated more than ten million dollars in\u000a      revenue from Imax and other movie theatre ticket sales and this will rise\u000a      further as the film continues to be shown worldwide (G).\u000a    A unique, ground-breaking feature of FM3D, vastly increasing its\u000a      potential audience, has been its delivery across an array of platforms.\u000a      Through collaboration with National Geographic the film has been\u000a      distributed to film theatres across the globe (G). The film can\u000a      also be streamed from the internet, is available on DVD and Blue Ray DVD,\u000a      was broadcast on terrestrial television (with a debut on Xmas Day 2010)\u000a      and content can also be viewed via an app for the iPad and Android (G).\u000a    The total viewing audience exceeds one million. The film also has a very\u000a      large geographic footprint, having been shown in more than 75 IMax\u000a      theatres worldwide distributed across 20 countries (G).\u000a    D. Evaluation of `Flying Monsters 3D'.\u000a    To date FM3D has been awarded five prizes (H). The most\u000a      prestigious of these, a BAFTA for the best specialist factual film, was\u000a      awarded in 2011. The film also won a Special Award given by the\u000a      International Broadcasting Convention, for best science film, in 2011,\u000a      best Earth and Environmental Program at the Jackson Hole Wildlife Film\u000a      Festival in 2012, and a Panda Award for best 3D film at Wildscreen 2012.\u000a    The film has garnered a large number of positive reviews. Mean\u000a      aggregations of these posted on the principal film review websites show\u000a      consistently high scores (e.g. Rotten Tomatoes = 100%; IMDb = 7.0\/10 for\u000a      279 reviews (I)).\u000a    E. Target audience and educational impact.\u000a    The principal target of this film was children of school age. Many film\u000a      reviews comment positively in this respect (\"the majority of the 3D\u000a      imagery is impressive enough to instill a sense of awe among its\u000a      predominantly school-age target audience\", Timeout 03\/05\/11)\u000a      showing that this aim was achieved (I). Audience\u000a      figures indicate that more than five hundred thousand school-age children\u000a      have already seen FM3D (G). The positive educational impact of the\u000a      film is further demonstrated by National Geographic which has used their\u000a      web-site to deliver additional educational content, based on FM3D and\u000a      aimed at school-children (J).

This iconic group, without which no dinosaur\u000a      diorama, film, or documentary would be complete, were unique in many\u000a      respects, not least the giant sizes achieved by some species with\u000a      wingspans in excess of 10 metres. The sheer exoticism of pterosaurs\u000a      coupled with their patchy fossil record has rendered these creatures one\u000a      of the great enigmas of palaeontology and, until recently, a mass of\u000a      contradictions, debates and controversies. During the last two decades, a\u000a      series of important new finds coupled with the application of modern\u000a      approaches such as scanning electron microscopy and phylogenetic analysis\u000a      have revolutionised our understanding of the biology and evolutionary\u000a      history of pterosaurs.\u000a    David Unwin, based in Leicester since 2006 and Reader in Palaeobiology\u000a      since 2009, has been at the forefront of this research, authoring more\u000a      than 100 presentations, 60 papers, a book and several edited volumes on\u000a      pterosaurs. Research projects founded and directed by Unwin, many of them\u000a      involving international collaboration (e.g. in Argentina, China, Germany,\u000a      Romania, Russia, Mongolia, Spain, and the USA) have played a pivotal role\u000a      in shaping our understanding of these unique animals and helped solve a\u000a      string of outstanding questions concerning pterosaur anatomy, locomotory\u000a      abilities, reproduction, physiology, taxonomy and evolutionary\u000a      relationships.\u000a    Recently completed projects led by Unwin (1-6) directly\u000a      contributed to several key episodes of `Flying Monsters' and underpinned\u000a      the general historical narrative of the film. Unwin's phylogenetic\u000a      analyses of pterosaurs, the most comprehensive in the field, played a\u000a      critical role in identifying a series of new forms (Shenzhoupterus\u000a      (2), Darwinopterus (1), Alanqa (5))\u000a      and established their relationships to other pterosaurs. Darwinopterus,\u000a      heavily featured in the film, is one of the most important fossil finds\u000a      ever made. This pterosaur, first recognised by Unwin in Beijing in 2009,\u000a      has a highly unusual anatomy, consisting of a remarkably advanced skull\u000a      and neck perched on a primitive body. Darwinopterus thus fills a\u000a      large and seemingly unbridgeable evolutionary gap between primitive and\u000a      advanced pterosaurs. As Unwin and colleagues have shown (1),\u000a      this pattern points to a `modular' form of evolution that could explain a\u000a      long-standing problem: the frequent appearance, in the fossil record, of\u000a      relatively rapid, large-scale evolutionary changes.\u000a    Unwin's research on the reproductive biology of pterosaurs (3,4),\u000a      in collaboration with colleagues in the UK and China, led to startling new\u000a      insights into the nesting behaviour of these animals: they buried their\u000a      eggs, like many reptiles, rather than sitting on them as birds do. An\u000a      extraordinary specimen of a female Darwinopterus preserved in\u000a      association with an egg, dubbed `Mrs T' by Unwin, further emphasised the\u000a      remarkably reptilian nature of pterosaurs (3). Studies on\u000a      exceptionally well preserved skeletons by Unwin and colleagues based in\u000a      the USA resolved a particularly troublesome paradox: how was the\u000a      respiratory system of the reptile-like pterosaurs able to support the\u000a      highly demanding activity of flapping flight (6). This work also\u000a      supplied fresh insights into the evolution of giant size in pterosaurs\u000a      which was facilitated through the extensive hollowing out of bones and\u000a      soft tissues by extensions of the lungs\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37239","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Background to Impact. Two major wars in the Persian Gulf area in\u000a      1991 and 2003-2008 involved more than 1M allied military personnel and the\u000a      use of DU munitions; subsequent to the 1991 conflict, ~250,000 UK, US, and\u000a      Canadian veterans developed Gulf War Illness, the cause of which remains\u000a      elusive. Possible culprits are the nerve gas Sarin, DU, excessive\u000a      pesticide use during the conflict, and post-traumatic stress. During the\u000a      period 1997-2008 there was considerable concern that exposure of military\u000a      personnel (and collateral exposure of civilians) to DU munitions might\u000a      contribute to illness of veterans (Gulf War Illness, cancer, birth\u000a      defects, etc) and have other deleterious environmental effects. These\u000a      concerns were documented by the Royal Society and the United Nations in\u000a      2001-2002. In 2005 the UK Government appointed the Depleted Uranium\u000a      Oversight Board (DUOB) to commission a study to both develop a high\u000a      sensitivity assay and to apply this to veterans to find out if DU exposure\u000a      was widespread (7); the MoD also commissioned a joint NERC research\u000a      programme on the environmental impacts (6). No such test was\u000a      available worldwide at that time. At the same time, sites of DU pollution\u000a      from manufacturing munitions were poorly studied and understood in terms\u000a      of their environmental footprint. A common thread in all of this science\u000a      is that a sensitive, reliable test to quantify DU exposure that took place\u000a      many years earlier had been lacking, unavailable to the environmental\u000a      health community. No DU-exposed human cohort had ever been studied in\u000a      terms of aerosol DU particle exposure, and this question was also\u000a      addressed by the Leicester group.\u000a    Beneficiaries: Beneficiaries of this work are primarily the UK,\u000a      Canadian and US governments who have learned that the DU exposure\u000a      sustained by Gulf War veterans is more limited than thought. Other\u000a      benefits are directly to those ~250,000 US, UK, and Canadian veterans with\u000a      Gulf War Illness who can achieve more clarity about whether DU played a\u000a      role in their illness. Other beneficiaries are New York Department of\u000a      Health who have adopted the Leicester test and are conducting a more\u000a      comprehensive exposure and health study on the DU munitions factory site\u000a      studied by Leicester personnel. As a follow up to this work, the Atomic\u000a      Weapons Establishment (AWE Aldermaston) sought collaboration with the team\u000a      and NIGL colleagues to develop a laser ablation ICP-MS method to analyse\u000a      uranium isotopes in tiny (~1 03bcm) particles to reduce the cost of\u000a      nuclear forensic testing in uranium enrichment establishments for the IAEA\u000a      and the UK government.\u000a    Direct Impacts. The urine-testing research showed that no tested\u000a      veteran had detectable DU (none out of 466 tested, documented in final\u000a      report of the DUOB (7 section 4), allowing the UK government to\u000a      conclude the study without costly subsequent follow up and be satisfied\u000a      that significant exposure to veterans by DU could not be substantiated in\u000a      terms of a large group of veterans. This allowed the UK MoD to largely\u000a      draw a line under this particular issue, and reduce future expenditure\u000a      related to DU-related issues. This is substantiated by a letter from the\u000a      lead author on the 2001-2002 Royal Society Report on DU, stating \"The\u000a        Depleted Uranium Oversight Board were particularly impressed by the high\u000a        performance of NIGL in testing for uranium isotopes ....which has\u000a        resulted in a much clearer view of the levels of exposure to DU on the\u000a        battlefield (which subsequently have been supported by uranium isotope\u000a        measurements by Harwell on urine from veterans of the 2001 Gulf War) and\u000a        have very largely eliminated further consideration of DU exposure as a\u000a        contributor to Gulf War diseases\" (C).\u000a    The environmental study in New York (1-3) documented the long term\u000a      environmental legacy of DU pollution, uptake by plants and animals, slow\u000a      migration in soil, and very slow corrosion of highly oxidized DU aerosol\u000a      particles. None of these conclusions were known until this work was done,\u000a      yet policy decisions need to rely on such evidence. The research proved as\u000a      entirely incorrect the conclusions of the US Agency of Toxic\u000a      Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR)which stated that the DU\u000a      contamination legacy surrounding the New York manufacturing plant could\u000a      not be quantified and that detection in humans after 20 years would be\u000a      impossible. The method was applied to exposed individuals to show that DU\u000a      particulate exposure is still detectable after 20 years (4).\u000a      Arising from this work, the US Congress Committee on Science and\u000a      Technology sought testimony from Parrish on 12 March 2009 (A,B)\u000a      concerning the research in order to learn lessons about how to quantify\u000a      exposure and improve the performance of its own agency responsible for\u000a      health concerns in such sites (i.e. ATSDR).\u000a    The long term health and environment effects of chronic DU-inhalation or\u000a      ingestion exposure are as yet un-quantified, because no health study has\u000a      been conducted on putatively-exposed humans, even though numerous animal\u000a      studies show mutagenic and teratogenic effects. The Leicester study\u000a      directly prompted the New York State Department of Health to conduct in\u000a      2011-13 a larger (~$0.5M; cohort of 300) targeted DU exposure and health\u000a      study to address the continuing health concerns of that locality, and\u000a      Parrish is advising this group with parallel analyses to assess Quality\u000a      Control, advice on how best to conduct chemical separations, and in\u000a      critical evaluation of method publication. He will likely be involved in\u000a      interpretation of exposure once data is acquired by that laboratory on a\u000a      cohort in New York.\u000a    Although the whole of the 1991 Gulf War veteran cohort is unlikely to\u000a      have had significant DU-exposure, it can only be eliminated as a cause of\u000a      Gulf War Illness in a proper study of veterans suffering from the illness.\u000a      A direct impact of the research is that testing for DU is taking place\u000a      during 2011-13 by Parrish on 160 intensively studied Gulf War Illness\u000a      sufferers whose medical conditions were the subject of a 10-year, $20M\u000a      study at the Southwestern Medical Centre, University of Texas. This DU\u000a      exposure study will define the role, if any, of DU in this illness and\u000a      conclude in 2013, of considerable medical significance.\u000a    Finally, the AWE (Atomic Weapons Establishment Aldermaston) has consulted\u000a      Leicester and NIGL personnel in order to conduct collaborative development\u000a      and knowledge exchange to develop a more rapid and cost-effective\u000a      LA-ICP-MS method to analyse ~103bcm uranium particles in nuclear forensic\u000a      safeguard testing at AWE, who have a strategic regulatory national role in\u000a      this area. This capability of using LA-ICP-MS for U particle isotope\u000a      composition is a priority topic of the IAEA (Vienna) and the nuclear\u000a      forensic safeguards community because of the very high cost and time-\u000a      consuming nature of doing this work by the alternative FT-TIMS or SIMS\u000a      methods, which are the only methods currently accredited by the IAEA;\u000a      LA-ICP-MS offers similar sensitivity, faster turnaround and more rapid\u000a      analysis including the minor uranium isotopes.\u000a    A further specific impact is that the Leicester PhD student who\u000a      participated in this work was then quickly employed by a major mass\u000a      spectrometry manufacturer as a key applications scientist. He is now\u000a      involved in developing and marketing the type of instruments used in the\u000a      study to other scientific establishments worldwide including IAEA and AWE;\u000a      this is a tangible impact of the high-level training delivered as part of\u000a      the on-going research.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Parrish at Leicester developed a unique high sensitivity urine,\u000a      soil and particle isotope assay for detection of DU pollution and applied\u000a      this to Gulf War veterans to quantify exposure to DU munitions. None of\u000a      the Gulf War veterans tested in a UK MoD study had detectable DU; this\u000a      allowed the UK government to conclude that DU exposure was limited, and\u000a      that the harm to veterans was small, although residual environmental\u000a      issues of chronic exposure have yet to be quantified. The test was also\u000a      applied to munitions' factory workers and nearby residents, and allowed\u000a      the exposure to DU to be quantified in individuals and environmental\u000a      materials.

These uranium isotope method\u000a      advancements, with their origins in earth science and geochronology, were\u000a      adapted and applied to environmental contamination (1, 2, 4)\u000a      and environmental health topics in order to address important problems.\u000a      Urine and other matrices (soils, organic material, micron sized particles)\u000a      are often difficult to work with, but medically and environmentally\u000a      important; mass spectrometry methods were adapted in 2004-2008 for these\u000a      matrices and are ongoing. For urine, the work consisted of\u000a      co-precipitating, concentrating, and purifying tiny amounts (as small as\u000a      100 picograms) of uranium from the other undesired elements and compounds\u000a      contained in urines, and measuring the precise isotope composition of\u000a      uranium to attempt to detect and quantify anthropogenic uranium. This was\u000a      demanding since the expectation of the MoD was that samples of urine from\u000a      `DU-contaminated' soldiers might only have 1-5% of the uranium in the\u000a      samples consisting of DU, this being the expected result if a significant\u000a      contamination arose up to 15 years prior to taking a urine sample. A 1-2%\u000a      deviation of isotope ratio of 238U\/235U was\u000a      required for total quantity of uranium of as little as 1 nanogram; in\u000a      addition the anthropogenic isotope 236U was required to be\u000a      measured at &lt;50 femptogram level of abundance. This had never been\u000a      achieved before in either medical or geochemical research. This R&amp;D\u000a      was validated by blind externally-administered proficiency tests,\u000a      administered by the EU IRMM to stand up to scrutiny (5). In\u000a      parallel a method of solid particle (&lt;1003bcm in size) isotope\u000a      determination using laser ablation sampling was developed (3),\u000a      allowing forensic tracing of particles back to their source, a procedure\u000a      used by the IAEA to monitor uranium enrichment worldwide using different\u000a      and more costly methods.

Overall, their results indicate that the 25% of\u000a      the population with the highest\u000a      exposure to BPA have on average a 1.5-2 fold increased risk for developing\u000a      heart disease. This\u000a      research has had identifiable impacts on national and international\u000a      policy, on public awareness,\u000a      and on investment in research and development by the plastics industry:\u000a    International policy debate\u000a    International policy debate has been stimulated. Publication of the 2008\u000a      paper on BPA and CVD in\u000a      JAMA [1] provoked a large number of policy discussion documents; Galloway\u000a      and Melzer were\u000a      invited in person to provide verbal evidence to the FDA Congressional\u000a        Review of the Safety of\u000a        BPA, Washington, September 2008. Policy papers discussing these\u000a      results and their impact on\u000a      legislation (see below) and the current advice on tolerable daily intakes\u000a      were published by many\u000a      countries including: the US FDA; European Food Standards Agency [a];\u000a      the Advisory Board of the\u000a      German Society of Toxicology; and Health Canada.

In January 2010, federal\u000a      officials at the FDA stated\u000a      \"some concern\" about BPA's safety, particularly for infants and young\u000a      children. This case study\u000a      research [key references 1, 2] was included in the cited evidence [c],\u000a      and there have been\u000a      associated changes in legislation world-wide. Canada declared BPA a toxin\u000a      and banned it from\u000a      baby bottles in 2008, followed by France and Denmark in 2010. Similar\u000a      restrictions have been\u000a      instituted across individual US states. In July 2012, the FDA acknowledged\u000a      \"substantial\u000a      uncertainties with respect to the overall interpretation of human health\u000a      studies and their\u000a      implications,\" and has banned BPA from infant feeding containers. In\u000a      January 2011, the European\u000a      Commission adopted Directive 2011\/8\/EU, prohibiting the use of BPA in\u000a      infant feeding bottles, and\u000a      in 2013 has instigated a systematic re-evaluation of research to inform\u000a      current legislation further.\u000a    Public awareness of health risks.\u000a    Public awareness of health risks of plastics additives has been raised\u000a      through public debate and\u000a      critical media reviews. The research described in Section 2 is described\u000a      in over 3000 items of\u000a      editorial and commentary material in the international peer-reviewed\u000a      literature, international media,\u000a      newspapers, popular scientific press [d] and podcasts [e],\u000a      general popular journals such as Marie\u000a        Claire, Men's Health, Women's Health, National Geographic, Elle, BBC\u000a        Food Magazine, National\u000a        Geographic [f] and national newspapers such as The\u000a        Independent, Times, Daily Mail, New York\u000a        Times, USA Today [g].

The research also features\u000a      in an online popular\u000a      science blog from the BBC featuring an interview with Galloway. The Sunday\u000a      Times Magazine took\u000a      up the story by publishing a special feature on Depledge related to the\u000a      BPA research, but also to\u000a      the wider issue of how environmental chemicals influence human health [h].\u000a    Industry investment in research and development.\u000a    In response to the research, plastics industries have invested in\u000a      research and development of\u000a      safer chemical alternatives.

This monomer is used in\u000a      the synthesis of\u000a      polycarbonate plastics and the epoxy resins lining tinned food. BPA\u000a      escapes from packaging into\u000a      food, dust, soil, and water. Careless disposal of consumer products and\u000a      packaging has resulted in\u000a      BPA contaminating ecosystems worldwide. Indeed, it is detectable in\u000a      &gt;95% of the human\u000a      population [1].\u000a    In 2008, Profs Galloway (Biosciences), Melzer, and Depledge (Medical\u000a      School) examined data\u000a      from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)\u000a      which, for the first time,\u000a      measured urinary BPA in a representative sample of the US population [1].\u000a      Higher urinary BPA\u000a      concentrations were associated with increased incidences of cardiovascular\u000a      disease (CVD),\u000a      diabetes, and clinically abnormal liver enzymes. The results showed that\u000a      the quarter of the\u000a      population with the highest concentrations of BPA metabolites in their\u000a      urine was more than twice\u000a      as likely to report having heart disease and diabetes compared with the\u000a      lowest quarter. In 2012,\u000a      the findings relating to CVD were replicated [2], making it highly\u000a      unlikely that this was a chance\u000a      finding.\u000a    The team studied the specificity and timing of these associations by\u000a      carrying out the largest\u000a      international biomonitoring studies to be undertaken for BPA, funded by\u000a      the British Heart\u000a      Association [3]. On-line solid-phase extraction coupled with high\u000a      performance liquid\u000a      chromatography isotope dilution mass spectroscopy was used to accurately\u000a      quantify BPA and its\u000a      major metabolites BPA-glucuronide and sulphonate in urine samples. The\u000a      team conducted a\u000a      longitudinal study of 3900 CVD patients and their controls, which showed\u000a      that BPA exposure\u000a      precedes disease progression by up to 10 years. They additionally explored\u000a      the toxicological\u000a      mechanism of BPA in men and women whose CVD had been precisely diagnosed\u000a      by angiogram\u000a      (considered a gold standard method for determining vessel thickness), to\u000a      show that BPA exposure\u000a      is specifically associated with narrowing of the arteries [4].\u000a    The team also studied the effects of BPA on circulating hormone levels\u000a      and showed that exposure\u000a      to BPA was associated with changes in testosterone concentrations in a\u000a      further 400 adult men [5],\u000a      with changes in the expression of hormone receptors detectable in vivo\u000a      [6] and in vitro (paper in\u000a      press in Reproduction, October 2013). These results are consistent\u000a      with BPA acting as an\u000a      environmental endocrine disruptor.\u000a    The scientists are currently working with colleagues in Australia, with\u000a      funding from the Australian\u000a      Medical Research Council, studying associations between diabetes and\u000a      exposure to BPA and\u000a      phthalates.

These interdisciplinary issues were addressed by Lenton\u000d\u000a      co-editing and contributing to\u000d\u000a      an AMBIO special issue on Arctic tipping points [5], and\u000d\u000a      co-writing a corresponding commentary\u000d\u000a      (Abrupt climate change in the Arctic. Nature Climate Change 2(2),\u000d\u000a      60-62 (2012)).\u000d\u000a    Understanding of tipping points led Lenton to question the foundation for\u000d\u000a      the widely-used policy\u000d\u000a      target of a 2&#176;C limit for the increase in annual mean surface temperature.\u000d\u000a      A reframed policy\u000d\u000a      objective was proposed that would limit the overall magnitude, rate of\u000d\u000a      change, and spatial\u000d\u000a      gradients of human influences on the Earth's energy balance. This research\u000d\u000a      led to an invited\u000d\u000a      `Worldview' piece in Nature (Lenton (2011) 2 &#176;C or not 2 &#176;C? That\u000d\u000a      is the climate question. Nature\u000d\u000a      473, 7).\u000d\u000a    Interest in the impacts of climate tipping points on Europe led the\u000d\u000a      European Environment Agency\u000d\u000a      to convene a workshop (involving Lenton), which the EU Joint Research\u000d\u000a      Centre (Sevilla) followed\u000d\u000a      with a project to assess the potential economic impacts on Europe (with\u000d\u000a      Lenton on the advisory\u000d\u000a      board). These studies and a US Department of Energy workshop on the social\u000d\u000a      cost of carbon\u000d\u000a      emissions led to an influential critique of the representation of tipping\u000d\u000a      points (or the lack of it) in\u000d\u000a      integrated assessment models [6].\u000d\u000a    To explore the broader framing and implications of tipping points, Lenton\u000d\u000a      co-convened and Cox\u000d\u000a      attended a cross-disciplinary workshop at the Royal Society Kavli Centre,\u000d\u000a      jointly sponsored by the\u000d\u000a      British Academy, which engaged leaders from multiple sectors of society,\u000d\u000a      as well as academics &#8212;\u000d\u000a      resulting in a co-edited book (O'Riordan, T. and Lenton, T.

Research on fathead minnow has informed the development of several\u000d\u000a      tests adopted by the OECD. A short-term screening test for estrogenic and\u000d\u000a      androgenic activity, and aromatase inhibition in fish was adopted in\u000d\u000a      September 2009 [b], an assay to assess early-life stage effects of\u000d\u000a      EDCs on fish sexual development was adopted in July 2011 [c], and\u000d\u000a      an in vivo reproductive screening assay, the Fish Short Term\u000d\u000a      Reproduction Assay, was adopted in October 2012 [d]. The US\u000d\u000a      Environmental Protection Agency's Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program\u000d\u000a      has based its general validation principles on the harmonized\u000d\u000a      scientifically peer-reviewed principles by the OECD [e]. The\u000d\u000a      Norwegian company Biosense commercialised the vitellogenin assay developed\u000d\u000a      by Tyler and his colleagues, developing them in accordance with the\u000d\u000a      recommendations from the OECD.\u000d\u000a    Gina Solomon, Senior Scientist for the Natural Resources Defence Council\u000d\u000a      referenced Tyler's research as part of her witness testimony before the US\u000d\u000a      Congress Committee on Energy and Commerce, Subcommittee on Energy and\u000d\u000a      Environment in February 2010, in the session addressing the risks of EDCs\u000d\u000a      in drinking water [f].\u000d\u000a    The research is listed as supporting evidence in the listing of the\u000d\u000a      chemical 4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenol, 4-tert-octylphenol as a\u000d\u000a      substance of very high concern. The European Chemicals Agency adopted this\u000d\u000a      listing on 9 December 2011, stating that the conclusion was based on\u000d\u000a      \"strong evidence from high quality studies of adverse effects in two fish\u000d\u000a      species, which are oestrogen mediated\" [g].\u000d\u000a    In September 2012, The International Conference on Chemicals Management\u000d\u000a      (ICCM) adopted a resolution to include EDCs as an emerging issue under the\u000d\u000a      Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management (SAICM). Tyler's\u000d\u000a      work was presented by Professor Susan Jobling from Brunel University, as\u000d\u000a      part of the technical briefing on EDCs [h]. His work is further\u000d\u000a      explicitly mentioned in the United Nations Environment Programme and the\u000d\u000a      World Health Organization.

A\u000d\u000a      spokesperson for the Chemicals &amp; Emerging Technologies Division at\u000d\u000a      Defra said the research \"...informed our approach to implementing the\u000d\u000a      Water Framework Directive as it set the evidence baseline against which we\u000d\u000a      could objectively assess Commission proposals.\"\u000d\u000a    The research helped provide sufficient data to \"act as a policy trigger\u000d\u000a      for taking action\" (area manager at the Environment Agency). The National\u000d\u000a      Endocrine Disruption Demonstration Programme was funded by the Environment\u000d\u000a      Agency and the water industry and was managed by UK Water Industry\u000d\u000a      Research (UKWIR); all ten water and sewerage companies in England and\u000d\u000a      Wales participated in the programme, which produced extensive data\u000d\u000a      regarding the occurrence, treatment and release of various EDCs from\u000d\u000a      conventional wastewater treatment works. The collaborative programme was\u000d\u000a      considered to yield \"valuable efficiencies\" by \"avoiding the need to fund\u000d\u000a      separate work programmes\" [j].\u000d\u000a    The impact of the research has largely been facilitated by Charles\u000d\u000a      Tyler's active participation in expert panels, authorship of government\u000d\u000a      reports and as an advisor to government. Tyler was the UK Coordinator for\u000d\u000a      the UK-Japan Joint Research on Endocrine Disruptors between 2005 and 2010\u000d\u000a      and is currently its Chief Science Advisor (2010-2015).

The team also established the widespread prevalence of a new\u000d\u000a      group of EDCs that act as anti-androgens and have feminising effects in\u000d\u000a      fish, and they played a significant role in helping to understand the\u000d\u000a      effects of mixtures of EDCs on fish reproduction and health (e.g. [3]).\u000d\u000a    Tyler's applied research in this area has developed methods that have\u000d\u000a      been adopted for international test guidelines for testing EDCs in fish. A\u000d\u000a      major research activity is the development and application of molecular\u000d\u000a      approaches to unravel the mechanisms of endocrine disruption [4]. Applying\u000d\u000a      these molecular approaches the team has recently shown feminised male fish\u000d\u000a      in wild populations in UK rivers have a reduced reproductive capability\u000d\u000a      with potential impacts for the sustainability of wild fisheries [5].\u000d\u000a      Further recently funded (NERC) work is now applying genome wide sequencing\u000d\u000a      methods to understand the mechanisms of adaptation to EDCs in wild fish\u000d\u000a      populations.\u000d\u000a    Working with Kudoh in Biosciences at Exeter, Tyler's team recently\u000d\u000a      developed a transgenic fish that is highly sensitive to environmental\u000d\u000a      oestrogens and provides an unrivalled whole systems model of informing on\u000d\u000a      the potential health impacts of exposure to environmental oestrogens [6].\u000d\u000a      The model developed is now being trialled for chemical and drug screening\u000d\u000a      through a BBSRC funded Flexible Interchange Partnership with AstraZeneca.\u000d\u000a      Further (NERC) funded work by Tyler (with Kudoh) is developing transgenic\u000d\u000a      fish models for EDCs with other modes of action (e.g., anti-androgens).\u000d\u000a    Tyler's work has further developed models for assessing effects of EDCs\u000d\u000a      on behaviour to show lower threshold of effect compared with tissue\u000d\u000a      disruptions, illustrating much wider ramifications of exposure to EDCs on\u000d\u000a      population dynamics. This work is reported in leading environmental\u000d\u000a      journals and government publications and is highly cited.\u000d\u000a    In recognition of this research work on EDCs, in 2012 Charles Tyler was\u000d\u000a      awarded The Fisheries Society of the British Isles Beverton Medal for\u000d\u000a      ground breaking research in fish biology.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37265","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Our close engagement with key stakeholders has led to impacts on\u000a      international policy and Brazilian environmental policy. Extensive media\u000a      coverage has stimulated widespread public debate.\u000a    Informing International Policy\u000a    The intact Amazon rainforest is currently absorbing about 1 billion\u000a      tonnes of carbon per year (i.e. more than 10% of annual anthropogenic CO2\u000a      emissions), but this has been almost completely offset by the carbon\u000a      dioxide emissions due to deforestation over the last few decades. Largely\u000a      in response to widespread tropical deforestation, the UNFCCC introduced\u000a      the mechanism Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest\u000a        Degradation (REDD) in 1995. REDD is a set of steps designed to use\u000a      market and financial incentives to reduce the emissions of greenhouse\u000a      gases from deforestation and forest degradation. Exeter's research\u000a      concerning changing fire frequency in Amazonia and the implications for\u000a      REDD policy [3] is referenced in UNEP and FAO documents [a,b].\u000a    More general concerns over the risk and impact of Amazonian forest\u000a      dieback led the World Bank to fund a project in 2008 with the goal \"to\u000a        assist in understanding the risk of a potential reduction in biomass\u000a        density in the Amazon basin induced by climate change impacts (Amazon\u000a        dieback) and its implications\". Cox and Jupp of the University of\u000a      Exeter were contracted members of the World Bank's project team along with\u000a      collaborators from Brazil, Japan and Germany. Interim reports from the\u000a      project were presented to the UNFCCC \"Subsidiary Body for Scientific\u000a        and Technical Advice (SBSTA)\", and the project outcomes continue to\u000a      feed into public debate [c] and UNFCCC policy discussions\u000a      concerning the \"permanence\" or otherwise of tropical carbon stores [d].\u000a      The project published its full report in 2010 [e], concluding that\u000a      fertilization effects of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide\u000a        levels on forest ecosystems like the Amazon have proven to be a key\u000a        unknown\", and that \"Amazon dieback should be considered a\u000a        threshold for dangerous climate change\". Both of these conclusions\u000a      derive in large part from work carried-out by researchers at the\u000a      University of Exeter (see Section 2).\u000a    Our most recent research findings, which constrains the loss of tropical\u000a      land carbon under climate change, were reported by the International\u000a        Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) to the United Nations\u000a        Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) \"Subsidiary Body for\u000a        Scientific and Technical Advice (SBSTA)\", at its meeting in Bonn in\u000a      June 2013 [f]. The results of this research have also been made\u000a      available to UK policymakers through Cox's position on the Scientific\u000a      Advisory Group of the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC),\u000a      where they have contributed to the UK's more positive attitude towards\u000a      avoided deforestation within the UNFCCC negotiations.\u000a    Brazilian Environmental Policy\u000a    Our research in this field has also had a very direct impact on\u000a      environmental policymakers in Brazil. After the publication of his paper\u000a      in 2010 [3], Luiz Aragao met with policymakers from the Acre regional\u000a      government of Brazil to discuss the policy implications. Out of that\u000a      meeting grew a long-term collaboration between the University of Exeter, the\u000a        Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE), and the Brazilian\u000a        State Government of Acre, which culminated in the funding of a joint\u000a      project called \"PULSE-Brazil\", which Cox leads. This project is developing\u000a      a Geographical Information System (GIS) to display and analyse data on the\u000a      changing environmental conditions in Brazilian Amazonia, so as to inform\u000a      policy concerning responses to environmental change in the State of Acre\u000a      and other vulnerable States of Brazil [g]. PULSE-Brazil has\u000a      enabled very direct interaction with the Environmental Secretary of Acre\u000a      (Vera Reis) who has attended all of the project meetings, and has been\u000a      aided by the hiring of a Portuguese speaking project manager (Duarte\u000a      Costa) who is spending extended periods working alongside the Acre\u000a      officials in Brazil to facilitate effective knowledge exchange.\u000a    Informing Public Debate through the Media\u000a    The iconic nature of the Amazonian rainforest and its importance for the\u000a      Earth System, make our research of great interest to the public and the\u000a      media. Research from the University of Exeter has contributed\u000a      significantly to public debate, appearing in newspapers and television\u000a      programmes. For example, the Amazonian drought of 2010 and its mechanisms\u000a      were discussed extensively by the BBC [h], and the \"Amazon Dieback\u000a      Scenario\" was covered by the New York Times in 2011 [i]. Amazon\u000a      dieback was also described in the BBC1 Horizon \"Hot Planet\" episode that\u000a      aired in 2009 and 2010, and on which Cox appeared and was the scientific\u000a      consultant [j]. In 2012, Cox spent 2 weeks in Amazonia making a TV\u000a      programme, which aired in the US in October 2013 (http:\/\/www.thetippingpoints.com\/).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research at the University of Exeter on the links between the Amazon\u000a      rainforest and climate change has influenced international climate policy,\u000a      has directly assisted Brazilian environmental policymakers, and has\u000a      received international media coverage.

It is a\u000a      hotspot for biodiversity that houses about 10% of all species on Earth,\u000a      and it is home to 25 million people. The Amazon rainforest also stores 120\u000a      billion tonnes of carbon, and exchanges about 10 billion tonnes of carbon\u000a      per year with the atmosphere. The future of the Amazon rainforest is\u000a      therefore of critical importance for the climate system, for the global\u000a      carbon cycle and biodiversity, and therefore for the well-being of\u000a      humanity.\u000a    The Amazon rainforest is however currently suffering from multiple\u000a      pressures associated with direct deforestation and from changes in mean\u000a      climate and climatic extremes. Research carried-out by University of\u000a      Exeter researchers has led to concerns that the Amazon rainforest could\u000a      \"dieback\" in the 21st century, releasing carbon to the\u000a      atmosphere and accelerating climate change, as well as damaging the\u000a      ecosystem services that the forest currently provides. This notion of\u000a      \"Amazon forest dieback\" emerged from climate-carbon cycle projections\u000a      carried out by University of Exeter researchers Peter Cox and Richard\u000a      Betts when they were both full-time at the Met Office-Hadley Centre.\u000a      Underpinning the impact here is subsequent research, all carried out since\u000a      Cox moved to the University of Exeter in 2006, which has developed a\u000a      deeper understanding of the mechanisms and risk of Amazon dieback.\u000a    A key paper in 2008 identified an unexpected link between changes in air\u000a      quality and the risk of 2005-like droughts in Amazonia [1]. It showed that\u000a      reducing anthropogenic aerosol pollution in the Northern Hemisphere,\u000a      associated primarily with reduced sulphur dioxide emissions from burning\u000a      sulphurous coal, has allowed the tropical north Atlantic to warm relative\u000a      to the south, prompting the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) to move\u000a      northwards and delaying the onset of the rainy season in the south and\u000a      west of Amazonia.\u000a    This research helped motivate a special issue of New Phytologist\u000a      in 2010, in which Cox, Jupp and their collaborators on a World Bank funded\u000a      project (see section 4) estimated the risk of future drying in key regions\u000a      of Amazonia based on projections from 23 climate models [2]. In 2010, Luiz\u000a      Aragao of the University of Exeter also published an influential paper\u000a      which suggested that some of the additional carbon storage arising from\u000a      avoided deforestation would be offset by increases in the frequency of\u000a      forest fires [3].\u000a    Recent research by Cox, Friedlingstein and collaborators, published in\u000a      2013 [4], has identified an \"emergent constraint\" on the loss of tropical\u000a      land carbon as a result of climate change, which arises from the observed\u000a      inter-annual variability in the atmospheric CO2 concentration.\u000a      As such it significantly reduced the uncertainties concerning the risk of\u000a      Amazon forest dieback [5], and identified the extent of the CO2\u000a      fertilization of tropical forest growth as the remaining key uncertainty.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37266","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3202326","Name":"Croatia"},{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Natural Environment Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    University of Glasgow research on Scottish rivers and coasts has shaped\u000a      policy and strategy and empowered communities to manage their environment.\u000a      These impacts are detailed below:\u000a    Influencing UK biodiversity policy\u000a    In the UK over 30% of priority species and 40% of priority habitats are\u000a      in decline.

The NEA quantified the value of the geodiversity of the UK\u000a      coastline at &#163;48 billion, thus clarifying its economic benefits and\u000a      encouraging policy-makers to give coastal geodiversity equal weight in\u000a      planning and management decisions.\u000a    This work has further contributed to the subsequent UK 2020 policy\u000a      document.

He works with them on Scottish Government-funded pilot projects\u000a      providing funds to local communities for plans to slow erosion rates and\u000a      improve land drainage. Hansom discussed the projects with five local\u000a      groups, including the Lochboisdale Amenity Trust, and sanctioned the\u000a      release of grants to them. He ran several adaptation workshops with local\u000a      crofting groups and, at Castlebay High School on the Isle of Barra, gave\u000a      wave-tank model demonstrations to classes over a week-long workshop\u000a      programme. Hansom also took part in a short video in partnership\u000a      with the Western Isles Council for Adaptation Scotland, a Scottish\u000a      Government programme reviewing a variety of projects under the theme of\u000a\u0009  `Scotland's\u000a        Climate Story', (see video entitled `Adapting\u000a        to Climate Change in the Western Isles &#8212; Jim's story').

SCAPE mobilises individuals and communities to protect\u000a      sites of archaeological interest in Scotland's coastal areas. Hansom\u000a      advises on SCAPE projects including SCH@RP (Scottish\u000a      Coastal Heritage at Risk), which uses a smartphone app (`ShoreUpdate') and\u000a      interactive map to enlist volunteer citizen scientists (there are\u000a      currently 460 volunteers) to help monitor `priority sites'. As of 31 July\u000a      2013, 264 sites had been surveyed by volunteers, and they had donated\u000a      &#163;35,775 to the project. Launching SCH@RP in 2012, Fiona Hyslop MSP, the\u000a      Cabinet Secretary for Culture and External Affairs in Scotland, stated:\u000a      \"SCAPE has led the field in highlighting the erosion of coastal sites and\u000a      it is a credit to its members and research that it has found a way to use\u000a      incredibly accessible mobile technology to improve the national records\u000a      through the creative use of local expertise.\" The ShoreUpdate app is\u000a      available for Apple and Android, and has been rated 4-star on Android; it\u000a      has been downloaded 200 times since launch.\u000a    The controversial proposal by Donald Trump to build a golf course on the\u000a      environmentally protected Menie Links in Aberdeenshire represented a\u000a      high-profile conflict between economic and environmental interests. The\u000a      site was designated European Geological Conservation review status, as\u000a      recommended by Hansom's\u000a      2007 report for SNH. This contributed to Aberdeenshire Council\u000a      turning down Trump's planning application for development work, which\u000a      would have destroyed the geomorphological importance of the site.\u000a      Following a public enquiry in June 2008 the Scottish Government\u000a      unprecedentedly reversed this decision, prompting a significant protest\u000a      campaign led both by local residents and organisations including SNH (whom\u000a      Hansom represented at the Trump public inquiry), the Ramblers Association,\u000a      RSPB and the Scottish Wildlife Trust.\u000a    This case inspired filmmaker Anthony Baxter to create the documentary\u000a\u0009You've\u000a      Been Trumped (2011). The film includes significant\u000a      contributions from Hansom. You've Been Trumped has won 15\u000a      International Film Festival awards, received more than 130 reviews and\u000a      features in newspapers around the world, and has been translated into\u000a      Chinese, Polish, Croatian, Czech, Italian, and Finnish. A public petition\u000a      calling for a Scottish Government inquiry into the Trump case has gained\u000a      19,537 signatures. BBC\u000a      Panorama broadcast a programme investigating the reasons behind the\u000a      approval of the Trump project which meant \"sacrificing an environmentally\u000a      protected part of the Scottish coastline\". The Menie site's special\u000a      status, as defined by Hansom's underpinning research, was the starting\u000a      point for an examination of the planning and approval process in both the\u000a      film and programme in the public campaigns and international press\u000a      coverage.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    University of Glasgow expertise in coastal erosion has directly\u000a      influenced biodiversity policy at local, national and international\u000a      levels, delivered flood mitigation initiatives in partnership with public\u000a      agencies in Scotland, and mobilised public support for environmental\u000a      safeguards to preserve our natural heritage.

This case study focuses on research that has had impact on policy\u000a      and public awareness.\u000a    River and Coastal Geomorphology\u000a    The UK has some of the world's most sophisticated environmental\u000a      legislation, the delivery of which is supported by a strong scientific\u000a      evidence base. The University of Glasgow has provided key evidence in the\u000a      fields of river and coastal geomorphology, across several key projects:\u000a    \u000a      River morphology: University of Glasgow research has refined\u000a        approaches to modelling sediment transport, which leads to significant\u000a        changes in river form (EPSRC to Hoey (Co-I) 2000-02). Further research\u000a        examined this issue in specific river, river exit and coastal locations\u000a        in Scotland (SNH to Hansom (PI) and Hoey, 1995-97).\u000a      Coastal processes and sediment budgets: Understanding sediment\u000a        delivery and removal processes in coastal environments (i.e. nearshore,\u000a        beach, dune and river exits) is crucial for understanding wider coastal\u000a        functioning. The quantification of sediment budgets (SNH to Hansom (PI)\u000a        1991-96, 2002), partnered with an understanding of the influence of past\u000a        sea-levels on sediment supply and coastal function (NERC to Hansom (PI)\u000a        2002; SNH to Hansom (PI) 2006), revealed that sediment deficits have\u000a        always played a pivotal role in coastal processes and their responses to\u000a        changing sea levels.\u000a      Coastal development trends: Coastal management decisions must be\u000a        underpinned by knowledge of the impact of coastal function on past,\u000a        present and future coastal landform development. Several research\u000a        projects to establish coastal trends have had wide impact on the\u000a        management of:\u000a      \u000a        rivers and beaches &#8212; SNH to Hansom (PI) and Hoey, 1995-97\u000a        estuaries &#8212; SEPA\/RSPB\/SNH to Hansom (PI) 1999\u000a        dunes and machair &#8212; SNH\/JNCC to Hansom (PI) 1996, 2002-04, 2007,\u000a          2009\u000a      \u000a    \u000a    Changing Sediment Budgets\u000a    Research commissioned by NTS, SEPA and SNH, sought to understand the\u000a      normal patterns of coastal sediment transport by waves and tides and their\u000a      impact on landform stability and erosion. In the course of this work\u000a      Hansom used novel time-series Digital Terrain Models to accurately\u000a      quantify, for the first time, the gains or losses of sediment from\u000a      specific sections of beach, dune and saltmarsh (SNH report, 2011). SNH\u000a      subsequently adopted this methodology, which led to the identification of\u000a      widespread coastal steepening in Scotland resulting in increased coastal\u000a      erosion, relative sea level change and loss of habitat. Hansom's 2011 work\u000a      on sea level change outpacing land uplift in Scotland revealed that its\u000a      coastlines are no longer buffered from the erosional and flooding impact\u000a      of sea level change &#8212; a key game-changing message for Government and Local\u000a      Authority policy-makers and planners. Hansom went on to develop a\u000a      GIS-based coastal erosion susceptibility model to identify where the\u000a      presence or lack of coastal defences and sediment transport modifies\u000a      vulnerability to flooding and erosion. This methodology now informs the\u000a      coastal flood and erosion risk management component of SEPA's Flood Risk\u000a      Management Strategy (SEPA\/CREW Research Report 2013 available from HEI).\u000a    Geological Conservation Review\u000a    The Geological Conservation Review is the process by which the key earth\u000a      science sites in the UK are identified by experts in their field for\u000a      conservation purposes. In 2007 Hansom was commissioned by SNH to assess\u000a      the Foveran Links Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), the Drum\u000a      Links and Menie Links in Aberdeenshire. The research concluded that the\u000a      dune systems of Forevan Links SSSI represent a valuable geomorphological\u000a      asset. The Menie Links in the southern part of Forevan Links SSSI features\u000a      a vast unvegetated sand sheet complex that has remained active for most of\u000a      the 20th century. One of the least disturbed sand dune systems\u000a      in Britain, its scale and dynamism makes it nationally and internationally\u000a      unique, and so should be fully recognised as a Geological Conservation\u000a      Review site.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37271","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"1694008","Name":"Philippines"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Scottish aquaculture is a major industry with an estimated value of\u000a      &#163;584.7 million (2011). Scotland is also the largest producer of farmed\u000a      salmon in the EU. Where adequate regulation is absent, aquaculture can\u000a      have a detrimental environmental impact, affecting not only the marine\u000a      environment but the overall sustainability and performance of a site.\u000a      Discharges are a primary environmental concern when it comes to planning\u000a      or expanding sites. Determining appropriate limits for discharges has been\u000a      a difficult task for environmental regulators, because they lacked a\u000a      reliable model to accurately predict the impact on the local ecosystem. In\u000a      Scotland, SEPA are responsible for the monitoring and regulation of\u000a      aquaculture sites, enforcing environmental quality standards for sea-floor\u000a      sediment at all aquaculture sites.\u000a    Prior to the work of Prof. Black's team in the development of DEPOMOD,\u000a      SEPA used a simple empirical matrix as the main planning tool for consent.\u000a      This matrix could not optimize farms to their environmental surroundings,\u000a      creating a `trial and error' approach to finding the optimum farm size,\u000a      leading many farms to close due to pollution problems4,5.\u000a      Research by Prof. Black's team (1998-2000) saw the development of DEPOMOD.\u000a      As part of the original steering committee, SEPA realized this model could\u000a      provide a means to apply scientific rigor to their aquaculture planning\u000a      process and enable plans to be optimized to the site-specific conditions.\u000a      SEPA supported the work of Black and his team to further develop and\u000a      streamline DEPOMOD leading to the development in 2005 of AutoDEPOMOD4,5.\u000a      AutoDEPOMOD has the capability to automatically iterate towards a solution\u000a      which will optimise productivity whilst remaining within Environmental\u000a      Quality Standards.\u000a    In 2005 AutoDEPOMOD was adopted by SEPA as a compulsory stage in the\u000a      planning process. Since 2005 (and continuing), any operator wanting to\u000a      develop a new aquaculture site or expand an existing one must use\u000a      AutoDEPOMOD to identify the sustainable size for a proposed farm4,5.\u000a      All presently operational salmon sites in Scotland have used AutoDEPOMOD,\u000a      enabling site developers to accurately match farm size to the capacity of\u000a      the environment providing the industry with a streamlined process to\u000a      enable farm optimisation from the outset whilst ensuring environmental\u000a      standards are maintained.\u000a    AutoDEPOMOD continues to be a compulsory stage in the aquaculture\u000a      planning process and Prof. Black and his team continue to work with SEPA\u000a      and aquaculture industry representatives, including the Scottish Salmon\u000a      Company6 and Marine Harvest7 to update the model to\u000a      support future industry developments. The research team have been awarded\u000a      a grant of &#163;576,400 from the Scottish Government (2012-2014) to recode\u000a      AutoDEPOMOD and to improve the modelling of resuspension processes.\u000a    International Impact\u000a    \u000a      The DEPOMOD model developed by Black and his team has international\u000a        presence within the aquaculture arena. At present, 122 DEPOMOD licence\u000a        holders exist in 25 countries, 26 of which have been issued in the\u000a        period 2008-2013, including 21 commercial licences and 5 non-commercial\u000a        licences1. In 2012 the Canadian Department of Fisheries and\u000a        Oceans requested DEPOMOD to regulate the aquaculture industry and was\u000a        used to predict benthic impacts at new and proposed Salmon farms in\u000a        Southwestern New Brunswick (2009, 2012)8.\u000a      Black led the development of DEPOMOD for specific regions including\u000a        the Mediterranean (MERAMOD) and Philippines (TREPOMOD). At present, 25\u000a        licence holders of MERAMOD and TREPOMOD exist, 11 of which have been\u000a        issued since 20081.\u000a    \u000a    Additional Impacts\u000a    \u000a      The development of AutoDEPOMOD means that a greater level of\u000a        confidence can be applied to measuring the sustainability of a fish-farm\u000a        at any given site. In 2010 SEPA Aquaculture Specialist commented to NERC\u000a        (funders of the original DEPOMOD project 1998-2000): \"The development\u000a          of DEPOMOD and subsequently AutoDEPOMOD as tools to be used in the\u000a          regulatory process has significantly improved the means by which SEPA\u000a          assesses the size of fish farm which can be sustained at any given\u000a          site and has provided an increased level of scientific rigour in\u000a          defining local environmental capacity\"2,5.\u000a      In recognition of his international reputation in aquaculture\u000a        environment impact research and development of DEPOMOD, Prof. Black\u000a        (UHI) became a member of the Scottish Government Working Group on\u000a        Aquaculture8as an expert in aquaculture environment impacts\u000a        (2002-2013).\u000a      AutoDEPOMOD has facilitated a positive impact to the natural\u000a        environment by placing environmental health at the centre of aquaculture\u000a        planning.

The Scottish Environment\u000a      Protection Agency (SEPA) monitors and regulates aquaculture discharges and\u000a      specifies Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) for sea-floor sediments\u000a      which are enforced for all aquaculture sites in Scotland.\u000a    Predicting how discharge levels will impact seabed environmental quality\u000a      in order to plan new, or for expansion to existing, aquaculture operations\u000a      is difficult due to the complex site-specific predictive modelling\u000a      required.\u000a    For &gt;20 years UHI researchers (Black, Nickell, Cromey) have studied\u000a      the aquaculture &#8212; marine environment interaction, investigating\u000a      aquaculture pollution, disease and parasite management and recovery\u000a      processes in fish-farm sediments. In 1998, Prof. Black's research team\u000a      began a 2 year project to model how fish-farm waste settles on the seabed.\u000a      The project developed a model, named DEPOMOD, which took into account site\u000a      specific conditions such as current speed, water depth, fish biomass and\u000a      feed volume to predict discharge amount and deposition area. DEPOMOD was\u000a      the first aquaculture discharge model which could be accurately adapted\u000a      for individual sites. The project steering committee comprised SEPA and\u000a      representatives from the aquaculture industry including the Scottish\u000a      Salmon Growers Association (now SSPO). SEPA recognised the development of\u000a      the model as a means to accurately predict effects on the seabed below\u000a      fish-farms. In 2001 SEPA supported further development of the model by the\u000a      research team to examine the discharge of sea-lice medicine from fish-farm\u000a      sites in order to derive appropriate limiting license conditions for\u000a      discharge.\u000a    DEPOMOD has since been adapted to aquaculture practices in other parts of\u000a      the world: from 1999-2003 the UHI research team led an EU consortium to\u000a      develop MERAMOD for Mediterranean fish-farms to model the predicted\u000a      deposition of particulate waste faeces and feed from sea bass and bream\u000a      farms. Prof. Black (UHI) also led the development of TROPOMOD (2006-2008)\u000a      to analyse the environmental impact of aquaculture in the Philippines. The\u000a      model assesses the impact of milkfish and tilapia, the two most important\u000a      fish cultured in the Philippines.\u000a    DEPOMOD provided accurate prediction of fish-farm waste deposition and\u000a      impact to the seabed, however the functionality of the model was limited\u000a      as any changes to specific parameters meant all parameters had to be\u000a      re-set. Since 2001 work has been on-going to enable the user to change\u000a      individual parameters within a live model. This development, named\u000a      AUTODEPOMOD, increased the use of the model to enable it to be used in\u000a      optimising fish-farm capacity. AUTODEPOMOD allows individual parameters\u000a      (such as biomass) to be changed until the modelled discharge level reaches\u000a      the EQS set by SEPA, thereby advising the optimum fish farm capacity\u000a      within environmental limits.\u000a    In 2005 AUTODEPOMOD was adopted by SEPA as a compulsory step in the\u000a      planning process for new and expanding aquaculture sites. Prof. Black and\u000a      his team continue to work to improve the model and are currently\u000a      integrating sulphur chemistry into AutoDEPOMOD and have been commissioned\u000a      by the Scottish Government to re-parameterize and recode AutoDEPOMOD.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37278","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Harmful algal blooms (HABs) generate natural biotoxins that are harmful\u000a      to humans who ingest shellfish that have concentrated the toxins in their\u000a      flesh.

As\u000a      blooms of this organism move around the coast, monitoring provides early\u000a      warning to allow the industry to plan finfish husbandry operations and the\u000a      routing of fish transport by well boat. Operating since 2008, the\u000a      programme has been successful in providing early warning of elevated Karenia\u000a      densities and hence preventing significant losses\/costs to industry.

Some marine algal species produce biotoxins which can cause\u000a      damage to, and mass mortality in, fish and other organisms. Human\u000a      ingestion of shellfish contaminated by algal biotoxins can cause poisoning\u000a      which may be manifest in illnesses ranging from mild gastrointestinal\u000a      problems to respiratory and neurological disorders or even death. Toxic\u000a      algal populations can rapidly increase, forming large naturally occurring\u000a      accumulations known as harmful algal blooms (HABs).\u000a    For &gt;60 years UHI scientists have researched phytoplankton ecology\u000a      (Drs Marshall &amp; Orr, 1950s), growth theory (Dr Droop 1960s), and the\u000a      relationship between harmful algal species and finfish mortalities in\u000a      Scottish sea lochs (Drs Gowen, Jones and Tett).\u000a    Since 1998 UHI HAB research has been led by Prof. Davidson and is centred\u000a      on understanding the environmental interaction of specific HAB species,\u000a      including the influence of environmental conditions on HAB movement,\u000a      toxicity levels and risk to the aquaculture industry, producing &gt;60\u000a      peer-reviewed publications. This research may be divided into 2\u000a      categories:\u000a    1. Algae Harmful to Finfish\u000a      In 2006, Prof. Davidson's group tracked the movement of a large bloom of a\u000a      HAB genus, deadly to finfish, called Karenia. Bloom movement was\u000a      tracked from the waters of southwest Scotland, northeast to the Shetland\u000a      Islands and the North Sea. These studies enabled determination of temporal\u000a      and spatial trends in Karenia bloom movement in response to\u000a      environmental conditions (including temperature, salinity &amp; weather\u000a      conditions)1. The research found that bloom events are\u000a      influenced by local fluctuations in salinity1. In collaboration\u000a      with Plymouth Marine Laboratory, remote sensing methods were developed to\u000a      detect and track Karenia blooms2.\u000a    2. Algae Harmful to human health\u000a      In 1999, 49,000km2 of western Scottish waters were closed to\u000a      shellfish harvesting due to the risk of Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning (ASP)\u000a      caused by shellfish contaminated by the HAB species Pseudo-nitzchia.\u000a      Prof. Davidson's team researched this closure and subsequent Pseudo-nitzchia\u000a      bloom events, developing an understanding of the environmental factors\u000a      influencing temporal and spatial trends in HAB movement and seasonal\u000a      patterns in growth and toxicity such as temperature and nutrient cycles3.\u000a      It was found that silica limitation, linked to seasonal fluctuations in\u000a      nitrogen:silica ratios, promoted enhanced toxicity in Pseudo-nitzchia3.\u000a    If ingested by humans, toxins from the HAB genus Alexandrium, can\u000a      cause Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP). Prof. Davidson's studies of Alexandrium\u000a      have revealed the co-occurrence of highly toxic and non-toxic forms of the\u000a      species Alexandrium tamarense which are morphologically identical,\u000a      but molecularly distinct. The group have developed laboratory and field\u000a      techniques to aid discrimination of toxic and non-toxic forms4.\u000a    Prof. Davidson's group has discovered much about the influence of\u000a      environmental conditions on HAB species biology and behaviour. This\u000a      research led to further collaborative studies to evaluate the likelihood\u000a      of factors such as climate change, anthropogenic nutrients and ballast\u000a      water transfer causing the invasion of UK waters by new toxic\u000a      phytoplankton species, or changing the abundance and toxicity of\u000a      indigenous species5,6. This has allowed us to establish a\u000a      temporal\/spatial understanding of HAB risk that is used by the Food\u000a      Standards Agency to underpin their shellfish safety policy.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37283","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2088628","Name":"Papua New Guinea"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Research undertaken by Dr. Shimmield's team to investigate the\u000a      environmental impact of the deposition of mine tailings in the deep sea of\u000a      Papa New Guinea (PNG) (2006-2010) informed the development, by the\u000a      research team, of a set of `Guidelines for the use of DSTP in PNG'2.\u000a      These Guidelines were presented publically in 2008, published in 2009 and\u000a      in 2012 these guidelines were formally adopted by the government of PNG3,8\u000a      (Mineral Resource Authority &amp; Department of Mineral Policy and\u000a      Geohazard Management) and established as regulation to control and manage\u000a      mining impacts on the marine environment.

The research programme\u000a      formed part of the Mining Sector Support Programme (MSSP) of PNG, funded\u000a      by the 8th European Development Funding Initiative.\u000a    Mine tailings are the waste product resulting from the removal of target\u000a      metals (e.g. gold) from mineral ore. Traditionally tailings are stored on\u000a      land in `tailings dams', however due to high incidence of seismic activity\u000a      and frequent heavy rainfall, dams in PNG are at high risk of failure,\u000a      causing catastrophic damage to the environment and human health.\u000a      Consequently deep sea tailings placement (DSTP) techniques have been\u000a      pioneered by mine operators, involving the discharge of tailings in deep\u000a      water1.\u000a    Understanding and mitigation of mine-induced environmental impacts is\u000a      essential to secure private sector investment for mining operations on\u000a      which the economy of PNG relies. The objective of MSSP was to investigate\u000a      how to mitigate mine-induced environmental impacts, including impacts of\u000a      DSTP, therefore reducing risk and increasing private-sector investment.\u000a    Dr. Shimmield's team researched the effects of DSTP at 2 PNG mines: Lihir\u000a      Gold Mine which has been actively discharging tailings since 1996 and\u000a      Misima Mine, closed in 2004 after discharging tailings for 15 years,\u000a      allowing an assessment of the recovery of the marine environment after\u000a      tailings placement1. Research involved investigating ocean\u000a      currents and mixing, the behaviour of metals3 and the effect of\u000a      tailings on benthic communities4 including the risk of elevated\u000a      metal contents entering the food chain.\u000a    The research established a metal \"fingerprint\" of tailings compared to\u000a      natural sediments1, which enabled the transport of fine\u000a      tailings within the deep ocean to be ascertained. Key findings of the\u000a      research include:\u000a    \u000a      Significant differences in biological assemblages present at DSTP and\u000a        DSTP free areas, indicating a relative decline in species number at DSTP\u000a        sites1.\u000a      Impacted sediments contain high concentrations of metals, including\u000a        ecotoxic elements (e.g. Cu, Cd, As)1, 3.\u000a      Evidence of post-operational recovery of deep sea benthic communities\u000a        impacted by mining operations1.\u000a      Elevated arsenic levels in surface waters were not linked to DSTP but\u000a        result from runoff of acid mine drainage at Lihir Gold Mine.1\u000a\u000a    \u000a    Research Outputs:\u000a    \u000a      Final Report: Independent Evaluation of DSTP in PNG1\u000a\u000a      Guidelines for the use of DSTP in PNG\u000a      Specific Guidelines for the use of DSTP at Lihir Gold and Ramu NiCo\u000a        mines.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37284","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2960313","Name":"Luxembourg"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Eutrophication is a process involving the excessive build-up of nutrients\u000d\u000a      in a water body\u000d\u000a      leading to the deterioration of the water quality. Whilst eutrophication\u000d\u000a      can happen naturally,\u000d\u000a      human impacts such as sewage discharge can greatly enhance the process. As\u000d\u000a      such,\u000d\u000a      eutrophication status is controlled by The European Urban Waste Water\u000d\u000a      Treatment Directive\u000d\u000a      (UWWTD) of 1991. The UK set up the Comprehensive Studies Task Team (CSTT)\u000d\u000a      to produce\u000d\u000a      guidelines for studies to check that British waters were not becoming\u000d\u000a      eutrophic. However,\u000d\u000a      despite these guidelines, in 1999 the European Commission (EC) accused the\u000d\u000a      UK of infracting\u000d\u000a      the UWWTD, by failing to identify certain coastal waters in England and\u000d\u000a      Wales as eutrophic.\u000d\u000a      This accusation led to a court case in the European Court of Justice,\u000d\u000a      which was finally decided\u000d\u000a      in the UK's favour in 20097. The CSTT model, developed by UHI,\u000d\u000a      Napier University and\u000d\u000a      University of Bangor was key to the UK's successful defence1.\u000d\u000a    The UK was brought before the Court in 2007, and presented its defence in\u000d\u000a      writing over the\u000d\u000a      next two years, culminating in a hearing in Luxembourg in April 2009.\u000d\u000a      Prof. Tett contributed\u000d\u000a      written and oral evidence during this period and attended the hearing in\u000d\u000a      person as an expert\u000d\u000a      advisor, supporting the UK government solicitors and Defra officers.\u000d\u000a    The defence included data showing lack of undesirable disturbance due to\u000d\u000a      nutrient enrichment\u000d\u000a      of UK waters, and made the argument, based quantitatively on the CSTT\u000d\u000a      model, that many of\u000d\u000a      our coastal waters and estuaries were light-limited, and therefore not\u000d\u000a      eutrophic1.\u000d\u000a    As part of the judgement, the Court ruled that eutrophication comprises\u000d\u000a      four linked steps: (1)\u000d\u000a      enrichment with nutrients; (2) accelerated growth of algae, etc.; (3) an\u000d\u000a      undesirable disturbance\u000d\u000a      to the balance of organisms; (4) an undesirable disturbance to water\u000d\u000a      quality; and that, for\u000d\u000a      eutrophication to be proven, a causal relationship between each step must\u000d\u000a      be demonstrated1.\u000d\u000a    It was agreed that the relevant waters in question were nutrient-enriched\u000d\u000a      (step 1), but the UK\u000d\u000a      claimed that accelerated algal growth (step 2), was often prevented by\u000d\u000a      turbidity. Results from\u000d\u000a      the CSTT model were put forward to show that this was the case1.\u000d\u000a    In December 2009 it was announced that the UK had won the relevant part\u000d\u000a      of its case1. The\u000d\u000a      CSTT model provided the scientific evidence which helped to uphold the\u000d\u000a      reputation of British\u000d\u000a      scientific research and save the British government and taxpayers a hefty\u000d\u000a      bill for additional\u000d\u000a      water treatment. A similar case was lost by the French government in 20042,\u000d\u000a      resulting in heavy\u000d\u000a      fines and the expensive obligation to build extra sewage treatment plants.\u000d\u000a      Enforcement of the\u000d\u000a      directive, if the UK had lost the case, would have required the\u000d\u000a      installation of nutrient-stripping\u000d\u000a      treatment systems to all waste water discharges identified as being\u000d\u000a      eutrophic &#8212; affecting every\u000d\u000a      major city and town from the east of England up to Liverpool, an area with\u000d\u000a      a resident\u000d\u000a      population of around 20 million. This tertiary level of sewage treatment\u000d\u000a      would have cost on the\u000d\u000a      order of &#163;6 billion to implement, accounting for initial capital costs of\u000d\u000a      installation, running costs\u000d\u000a      and maintenance over a 20-year period1.

Model development and refinement took place from 1994-1997\u000d\u000a      during a number of\u000d\u000a      collaborative research projects2,3,4,5,6,7 of UHI, Napier\u000d\u000a      University and University of Bangor.\u000d\u000a    The UHI component built on over 30 years of research into water exchange\u000d\u000a      and mixing\u000d\u000a      characteristics in sea-lochs and estuaries (Inall), phytoplankton growth\u000d\u000a      theory (Droop) and\u000d\u000a      nutrient effects on water quality (Gowen). This work was brought together\u000d\u000a      with work on the\u000d\u000a      other crucial parameters relating to photosynthetic efficiency and\u000d\u000a      growth-related respiration in\u000d\u000a      response to underwater light carried out at Napier University and\u000d\u000a      University of Bangor, to\u000d\u000a      develop the CSTT Model for Eutrophication.\u000d\u000a    The model uses the rate of exchange between water-bodies, the rate of\u000d\u000a      addition of nutrients,\u000d\u000a      and light levels to predict whether or not there will be eutrophication in\u000d\u000a      a body of water under\u000d\u000a      specified conditions and was published in the CSTT guidelines (1997).\u000d\u000a    From 1997-2003, the model was validated by UHI and Napier University\u000d\u000a      during a joint PhD\u000d\u000a      Studentship, against observations from the Mediterranean to the Arctic in\u000d\u000a      the collaborative\u000d\u000a      European project OAERRE4. Further tests were also carried out\u000d\u000a      in Loch Creran by Napier-SAMS\u000d\u000a      PhD student Celine Laurent5 (2002-2006). During this study, the\u000d\u000a      CSTT model was\u000d\u000a      applied to Loch Creran to assess the capacity of the loch to assimilate\u000d\u000a      nutrients from fish-farms.\u000d\u000a      Model simulations were found to retain a significant correlation with\u000d\u000a      observations\u000d\u000a      demonstrating the model's ability to replicate actual conditions of the\u000d\u000a      water-body, in this case\u000d\u000a      Loch Creran.\u000d\u000a    The model continues to be developed and adapted for wider use and with\u000d\u000a      funding from the\u000d\u000a      Scottish Aquacultural Research Forum (SARF, 2005-2011), UHI researchers\u000d\u000a      led by Prof's\u000d\u000a      Tett &amp; Inall have been developing a new version of the model for\u000d\u000a      predicting the environmental\u000d\u000a      impacts of aquaculture in sea lochs6 and has been developed\u000d\u000a      further to the ACExR model for\u000d\u000a      seasonal exchange and mixing in enclosed sea lochs.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37288","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"146669","Name":"Cyprus"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    SUERC researchers have had wide-ranging impacts on the UK and\u000a      international nuclear industry.\u000a      Expert advice and data provided to government departments, security\u000a      organisations, the nuclear\u000a      industry, regulators, local authorities and charities has influenced\u000a      management and monitoring of\u000a      authorised discharges, accidental radionuclide releases and planned\u000a      disposals of radioactive\u000a      waste.

Its impact extends beyond rainfall\u000a      estimates to include food security; health planning; humanitarian aid; and\u000a      in economic planning as well as in capacity building of local\u000a      meteorological services and community resilience.\u000a    Rainfall estimates, drought and crop failure\u000a    The procedures developed have allowed the Unit to issue rainfall\u000a      estimates every 10 days and every month, at very high spatial resolution\u000a      (4 km nominally but reliable at around 10 km). These estimates now cover\u000a      the whole of Africa and are widely considered to be, on average, as or\u000a      more robust, skilful and reliable than from more complex methods.5,6\u000a      It is particularly suited to identifying 10-day periods of above- and\u000a      below-average rainfall in real time, making it ideal for drought and food\u000a      monitoring. The TARCAT climatology allows events and anomalies to be\u000a      defined. TAMSAT has been shown to provide early warning of crop failures\u000a      caused by low precipitation during key stages of the crop growing cycle. A\u000a      quote from the leader of the FOODSEC Action of the EC's Joint Research\u000a      Centre (JRC)5 explains the importance and quality of TAMSAT\u000a      data and how its wider use came about: \"The JRC contracted TAMSAT to\u000a        provide improved data of rainfall estimates over Africa. The TAMSAT\u000a        approach was expected to yield more reliable estimates thanks to the\u000a        local calibration approach compared to estimates derived from GCMs. At\u000a        the Crop And Rangeland Monitoring workshop (Sept. 2011), it was\u000a        demonstrated that TAMSAT data was superior to other sources for\u000a        estimating accurately the extent of the drought that hit the Horn of\u000a        Africa in 2010-2011. We started to use effectively the TAMSAT data in\u000a        our Crop Monitoring Bulletins (later renamed Food Security Bulletins)7,8\u000a      in 2012 because before then data suffered some artefacts in the\u000a        calibration process. The recent release of a 30-year archive opens\u000a        possible other uses such as weather index insurance in agriculture. The\u000a        bulletins we publish are mainly used by other European Union services\u000a        dealing with food aid, and food security in general. They are European\u000a        Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO), DG Development and Cooperation and\u000a        EU delegations in countries at risk of food insecurity (circa 15\u000a        countries in Sub-Saharan Africa). The bulletins are also used by UN\u000a        agencies (FAO and WFP) ... and by some NGOs.\"\u000a    Planning humanitarian aid\u000a    A clear example of the value of TAMSAT research was provided by the\u000a      2011\/12 Sahel crisis:9 18 million people across nine countries\u000a      were subject to drought-driven famine, and more than 1 million children's\u000a      lives were at risk.10 Warnings were initially broadcast in 2010\u000a      by USAID\/FEWS- NET (a Famine Early Warning System)11, based on\u000a      the results of general circulation modelling. As rainfall monitoring\u000a      became vital to understand the development of the crisis, TAMSAT was\u000a      utilized by agencies such as the UN's FAO6 (via the JRC and the Africa\u000a      Real Time Environmental Monitoring Information System), FSNAU (Food\u000a      Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit, Somalia) and FSNWG (Food Security\u000a      and Nutrition Analysis Working Group) (Nairobi)12. TAMSAT\u000a      complemented independent rainfall monitoring by FEWS-NET and predictions\u000a      of large-scale crop yields based on satellite imagery of rainfall, as\u000a      pioneered by the Unit using TAMSAT data, became of vital importance. OXFAM\u000a      and Save the Children consider the response was better than for previous\u000a      crises (more children received treatment for acute malnutrition in the\u000a      region than ever before, and the World Food Programme alone reached 5-6\u000a      million people with food aid10). Shortfalls in the response\u000a      were defined to be political and organisational,13 but the\u000a      reliability and accuracy of the warnings was considered either \"very good\"\u000a      or \"excellent\".14 The IMPACT of TAMSAT data and science\u000a      continues to grow as governments and aid agencies learn how to make best\u000a      use of the warnings and rainfall monitoring.9\u000a    Distribution and use of estimates of crop and pasture yields\u000a    The Unit won the contract to provide data to the JRC's FOODSEC Action in\u000a      2008 because of targeted research (that was later published in Maidment et\u000a      al. 2012), demonstrating the value of adding TAMSAT data to re-analysis\u000a      data (e.g. from ECMWF). Since 2012, JRC and ReliefWeb bulletins7,8\u000a      use TAMSAT data to estimate crop and pasture food yields. More than 40\u000a      regional and annual bulletins are published each year providing\u000a      qualitative and, where possible, quantitative yield forecasts at least one\u000a      month prior to harvest for the whole of Africa. All the main agencies and\u000a      charities involved in African food security and aid (list available from\u000a      the Unit) receive TAMSAT data as part of the set compiled by FOODSEC and\u000a      used to help them define policy. The bulletins are also used by UN\u000a      agencies to cross-check their own assessments. As part of the MARSOP\u000a      project,3 TAMSAT's operational rainfall estimates support the\u000a      activities of the AMESD (African Monitoring of the Environment for\u000a      Sustainable Development) thematic groups through their data broadcasting\u000a      service, e-Station. Additionally, the TARCAT dataset is instrumental in\u000a      the derivation of the Global Water Satisfaction Index (GWSI) for crop\u000a      productivity analysis within the FOODSEC Action. TAMSAT data are now also\u000a      used by members of AfClix (the Africa Climate Exchange) set up by R.\u000a      Cornforth, a NERC KE Fellow in the Unit since 2011, representing a diverse\u000a      set of users across disciplines and sectors worldwide (for example,\u000a      recently supporting a flash flood early warning system in Sudan piloted in\u000a      the 2013 rainy season).\u000a    Capacity building and community resilience\u000a    In addition to providing data, an important aspect of TAMSAT is capacity\u000a      building of African national meteorological agencies. In this, the\u000a      relative simplicity of the TAMSAT method is a major asset. The Unit's team\u000a      now collaborates with 21 partner organisations, 10 of which are in Africa.\u000a      TAMSAT is also used by AGHRYMET15 to provide key and timely\u000a      information on the rainy season. As, for example, noted by the Ethiopia\u000a      national meteorological agency \"TAMSAT played an important role in\u000a        building capacity to generate quality rainfall products for both\u000a        real-time and historical data use in Ethiopia.\"16 The\u000a      Unit has run workshops in Africa, attended by 7 African nations, installed\u000a      custom-made training software and websites and taught MSc and PhD\u000a      students.\u000a    TAMSAT also has had a key role in building community-centred resilience,\u000a      as noted in a recent review9. Specifically, TAMSAT allows\u000a      African meteorologists to monitor the progress of rainy seasons and to\u000a      give early warning of floods and droughts. When allied to the 30-year\u000a      TARCAT dataset, TAMSAT data are already having applications: supporting\u000a      government and commercial insurance schemes for small farmers (for\u000a      example, index-based insurance contracts based purely on TAMSAT data are\u000a      now providing insurance cover for 8500 farmers in Kenya, Uganda and Zambia17);\u000a      limiting insect and fungal infestations; healthcare (there are very\u000a      promising programmes to exploit TAMSAT in predicting malaria outbreaks18,\u000a      the efficacy of which are now being tested), managing soil erosion,\u000a      planning drought and flood resilience programmes, crop diversification and\u000a      appropriate crop selection, planning strategic animal fodder reserves and\u000a      agricultural infrastructure, informing human and livestock vaccination\u000a      programmes.\u000a    The reach and the significance of TAMSAT's impact are huge. The number of\u000a      under-nourished people in sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to be 234\u000a      million. Through its role in increasing the resilience of African\u000a      populations to weather and climate shocks, TAMSAT has had major impact. In\u000a      2010, TAMSAT received the IBM award for Meteorological Innovation That\u000a        Matters from the Royal Met. Soc. The citation states: \"TAMSAT\u000a        continues to deliver massive benefits to Africa in terms of essential\u000a        rainfall predictions ...[it] ... is used extensively by African weather\u000a        services, providing a unique and essential source of data. This\u000a        technology providing precipitation information is of such importance in\u000a        developing regions, that it merits this recognition. From its inception,\u000a        TAMSAT have shown how even the early generations of satellite technology\u000a        can be harnessed quantitatively to provide vital rainfall information\u000a        over a wide region.\"\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Over one quarter of the estimated 886 million undernourished people in\u000a      the world live in sub-Saharan Africa and their lives and livelihoods\u000a      depend critically on rain-fed agriculture. However this region has lacked\u000a      the equipment and the infrastructure to monitor rainfall. Over the past 20\u000a      years, the Unit's TAMSAT (Tropical Applications of\u000a      Meteorology using SATellite Data and Ground-Based\u000a      Observations) research group has developed a reliable and robust means for\u000a      monitoring rainfall, appropriate for use in Africa. In addition, the Unit\u000a      pioneered the use of such data to predict crop yields over large areas.\u000a      TAMSAT data and methods are now used in food security (to anticipate\u000a      drought and predict crop and livestock yields); in health planning (to\u000a      predict outbreaks of rain-promoted diseases such as malaria); in aid (to\u000a      guide the allocation and distribution of relief food and water); and in\u000a      economic planning (to plan mitigation activities and investment in\u000a      infrastructure). The Unit's programme of development and validation has\u000a      extended the method to all of Africa, at all times of year. Our work with\u000a      national meteorological services in Africa has helped them to build their\u000a      own capabilities and to both contribute to TAMSAT and exploit it. The data\u000a      provided by TAMSAT has had major impact in increasing the resilience of\u000a      African populations to weather and climate, saving and improving the\u000a      quality of lives, and strengthening economies in developing nations.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Environmental","Institution":"\u000a    University of Reading\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Reading (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Reading","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007802}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"184745","Name":"Nairobi"}],"References":"\u000a    References have been selected to illustrate various aspects of\u000a      development over 20 years.

TAMSAT\u000a      uses spacecraft data to give maps of rainfall. The method requires a great\u000a      deal of calibration, but this makes it more accurate and reliable than\u000a      more complex rival methods. Work done before 1993 had demonstrated how\u000a      satellite thermal infrared (TIR) imagery could be used to estimate\u000a      rainfall from the observed Cold Cloud Duration (CCD) - the duration of a\u000a      cloud-top temperature below a given threshold.2 The technique\u000a      is importantly simple: local, seasonally- varying temperature thresholds\u000a      which best discriminate between precipitating and non-precipitating clouds\u000a      of convective origin are empirically determined using the observed CCD and\u000a      rainfall data from rain gauges on the ground (a process hereafter referred\u000a      to as calibration). Using the sole input of TIR imagery, rainfall maps are\u000a      produced in near-real time for each 10-day period and they have also been\u000a      generated retrospectively for January 1983 onwards. Climatology-based\u000a      calibrations now exist for a 28-year long archive (1983-2010) of\u000a      simultaneous CCD and rain gauge observations. Work done since 1993 (which\u000a      continues to the present day) has developed the technique and extended its\u000a      geographical reach. Initial conceptual work after 1993 was driven by G.\u000a      Dugdale (retired from the Unit in 2000 but still a visiting fellow) and J.\u000a      Milford (retired 1998). From 1995 until his untimely death in late 2011,\u000a      the research was led and coordinated by David Grimes, with developments by\u000a      many PDRAs and PhD students under his supervision (including E. Tarnavsky,\u000a      R. Maidment, H. Greatrex, E. Pardo-Ig&#250;zquiza, R. Bonifacio, V. Thorne, C.\u000a      Teo and M. Assiri). Other staff who contributed to the work are J.Slingo,\u000a      Challinor, and P. Crauford (all now left UoR) and Wheeler (SAPD).\u000a      Following the death of Grimes, the work is led by E. Black with\u000a      contributions by R. Allan, C. Williams (PDRA) and NERC KE Fellow R.\u000a      Cornforth.\u000a    The key advantages of TAMSAT over other methods that rely on more complex\u000a      algorithms and more modern satellite equipment are that: (1) it can be\u000a      applied consistently to a long time series of data; (2) African Met\u000a      services can both contribute to and use the data; and (3) through the\u000a      calibrations, it can be adapted to cope with the required range of\u000a      locations, times and applications. In order to cover all Africa at all\u000a      times, an extensive programme of calibration development and validation,\u000a      as well as rainfall time series development and comparisons with other\u000a      approaches have all been needed and continue to the present day.\u000a    TAMSAT uses an extensive proprietary rain-gauge dataset obtained from\u000a      local meteorological services. This improves its skill compared to other\u000a      satellite products and facilitates sustained engagement with those Met.\u000a      services, their funding agencies and governments. The continual\u000a      improvements of the calibration techniques over the past 20 years have\u000a      resulted in increased accuracy (e.g. Pardo-Ig&#250;zquiza et al., 2006) and\u000a      extended the regions covered: for example, Thorne et al. (2001) in\u000a      southern Africa and Assiri (UoR PhD thesis, 2011, supervised by Grimes) in\u000a      the Arabian Peninsula.\u000a    Developments of the technique and its applications, made by the Unit\u000a      between 1993 and 2012, have radically expanded the use of the TAMSAT (and\u000a      other rainfall data) to quantitative estimates and forecasts of cultivated\u000a      (crop) and natural vegetation growth over Sahelian pastures. Early\u000a      development by Bonifacio et al. (1993) of pastureland growth used a\u000a      regression model between biomass production and accumulated plant water\u000a      use, derived from TAMSAT rainfall estimates through a simple soil water\u000a      budgeting procedure. Further work in the Unit, in collaboration with the\u000a      School of Agriculture Policy and Development (SAPD), developed a\u000a      methodology for predicting national-level crop yield (using the GLAM model\u000a      developed also in collaboration with SAPD) with gridded rainfall data\u000a      (Challinor et al., 2003; Teo and Grimes, 2007) and also evaluated how\u000a      uncertainties in the rainfall estimates propagate through to crop yield\u000a      estimate (H. Greatrex, UoR PhD thesis, 2012, supervised by Grimes and\u000a      Wheeler). There are now several models that routinely use satellite\u000a      rainfall data to drive crop models: all build on the Unit's pioneering\u000a      proof-of-concept work that laid down basic principles and demonstrated the\u000a      potential.\u000a    Under a project supported by the EC3, the Unit is part of a\u000a      consortium with partners Alterra, MeteoConsult and VITO (Vision on\u000a      Technology) for which they undertook the first Africa-wide calibration\u000a      effort that led to the derivation of the 30-year TARCAT (TAMSAT African\u000a      Rainfall Climatology And Time-series) dataset, as well as a library of\u000a      methods for routine validation of the satellite based rainfall estimates.\u000a      This is increasingly important as TARCAT is uniquely homogeneous,\u000a      high-resolution dataset and so provides climatology, against which events\u000a      and long-term changes can be compared).4 TAMSAT also took part\u000a      in a study of how climate change, and rainfall in particular, is likely to\u000a      influence African economies (Washington et al., 2006).\u000a    1.

In\u000a      addition, the GWP values are used within the Clean Development Mechanism\u000a      of the Kyoto Protocol that enables industrialized countries to fund\u000a      emission-reduction projects in developing countries, and to claim credit\u000a      for these reductions in meeting their own targets. Where these projects\u000a      involve reductions in emissions of gases other than CO2\u000a      (historically this constitutes about 20% of the total number of projects)'\u000a      the GWP is used to calculate CO2-equivalence. The same GWP\u000a      tables are also used within the UK Climate Change Act (2008) to calculate\u000a      CO2-equivalent emissions to assess the extent to which the UK\u000a      is meeting its own commitments under this Act.\u000a    The UNFCCC negotiations, starting in 2005 and continuing through the\u000a      REF2014 assessment period, which led to the agreement on the second\u000a      commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol (2013-2020), have recommended the\u000a      adoption of the GWP tables listed in (the errata to) the IPCC Fourth\u000a      Assessment Report. Of the 69 gases in this table that are covered by the\u000a      Kyoto Protocol, inputs to about one-quarter can be traced directly to\u000a      research in the Unit (including those publications given in Section 31,2,3,4),\u000a      and about half originate from previous IPCC or WMO Ozone assessments where\u000a      Shine was the lead author of relevant sections of the assessment and\u000a      played a major role in the compilation of the lists of REs 7,8,9.\u000a      Reading's work includes the first detailed RE value for nitrogen\u000a      trifluoride4, a compound widely used in the electronics\u000a      industry and also for trifluoromethyl sulphur pentafluoride; emissions of\u000a      these gases were not included in the first commitment period of the Kyoto\u000a      Protocol, but are now part of the second commitment period. Hence the\u000a      Unit's research helped enable the UNFCCC negotiations during the REF2014\u000a      assessment period; specifically its work helped enable the production of\u000a      the updated GWP tables in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report and the\u000a      inclusion of additional gases in those tables.\u000a    The Unit's work on alternatives to the GWP has impacted public policy by\u000a      enabling a policy debate on the most appropriate metrics for use in\u000a      climate conventions. The work has led to debate within the IPCC and\u000a      UNFCCC, with requests from parties to the Convention to assess the\u000a      appropriateness of metrics to calculate CO2-equivalence. As a\u000a      specific example, because of the scale of its agricultural activity,\u000a      Brazil has relatively high methane emissions. Using the standard GWP\u000a      metric to place emissions on a CO2-equivalent scale, Brazil's\u000a      methane emissions account for about 17% of their total CO2-equivalent\u000a      emissions. By contrast, using the 100-year GTP metric, developed at the\u000a      Unit5, the methane emissions would account for only 5%. Brazil\u000a      have stated (in their 2010 National Contribution to the UNFCCC) that \"they\u000a      object to the use of the GWP... [and the] .. option for aggregating the\u000a      reported emissions into carbon dioxide equivalent units using the GWP ...\u000a      was not adopted\". The same report states that \"the use of GTP allows for\u000a      more appropri-ate mitigation policies\". The UNFCCC's Subsidiary Body for\u000a      Scientific and Technical Advice (SBSTA) continues to discuss and debate\u000a      the issue; for example, in 2012 it organised, a workshop on the issue,\u000a      bringing together policymakers and scientists, at which Shine was a\u000a      speaker.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Human activity leads to the emission of many greenhouse gases that differ\u000a      from carbon dioxide (CO2) in their ability to cause climate\u000a      change. International climate policy requires the use of an \"exchange\u000a      rate\" to place emissions of such gases on a \"CO2-equivalent\"\u000a      scale. These exchange rates are calculated using \"climate emission\u000a      metrics\" (hereafter \"metrics\") which enable the comparison of the climate\u000a      effect of the emission of a given gas with emissions of CO2.\u000a      Research in the Unit has contributed directly to (i) the calculation of\u000a      inputs required for such metrics, (ii) the compilation of listings of the\u000a      effects for a large number of gases and (iii) the consideration of\u000a      alternative metric formulations.

Shine, and co-workers within and outside the unit, have\u000a      contributed underpinning research that has contributed heavily to impact.\u000a      Shine was a member of academic staff in the Unit throughout both the\u000a      impact period and the REF assessment period.\u000a    First, Shine was a convening lead-author in successive assessment reports\u000a      of the WMO\/UNEP (World Meteorological Organization \/ United Nations\u000a      Environment Programme) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\u000a      and the WMO\/UNEP Scientific Assessments of Stratospheric Ozone Depletion\u000a      during the 1990s7-9. These assessments reported the values of\u000a      the Global Warming Potential (GWP) which is the metric adopted by the\u000a      Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations' Framework Convention on Climate\u000a      Change (UNFCCC) to allow signatories to report the emissions of different\u000a      greenhouse gases on a CO2-equivalent scale. The GWP is one of a\u000a      range of possible methods for comparing the climate impact of emissions of\u000a      different greenhouse gases (technically it is the time-integrated\u000a      (100-year) radiative forcing following a pulse emission of a gas, relative\u000a      to the same quantity for an emission of CO2). Shine's work in\u000a      these assessments included the compilation of an essential input to GWP\u000a      calculations (the so-called \"radiative efficiency\" or RE) for a large\u000a      range of gases7,8,9, the critical assessment of available RE\u000a      values and the recommendation of the most appropriate values 7,8,9,\u000a      and finally the calculation of GWPs themselves9, which are\u000a      tabulated within the assessments.\u000a    Second, Shine, with contributions from current Unit member, Prof. E.J.\u000a      Highwood (initially as a post-doc and as a member of academic staff since\u000a      2001), calculated RE values for a large number of gases, in collaboration\u000a      with several PDRAs and PhD students based within the Unit, and with\u000a      laboratory and computational spectroscopists from outside the Unit. The\u000a      spectroscopist collaborators were principally from the Department of\u000a      Chemistry at the University of Reading (UoR), the Ford Motor Company\u000a      Physical and Environmental Sciences Department (Dearborn, MI, USA) and the\u000a      Molecular Spectroscopy Facility, at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory,\u000a      UK.\u000a    Since 1995, the Unit's ongoing work has developed and refined\u000a      methodologies for calculating the RE, which included the use of numerical\u000a      models which incorporated the laboratory observations made by our\u000a      collaborators at high spectral resolution. It has updated and improved RE\u000a      values for many known industrial greenhouse gases, and helped resolve\u000a      instances where results presented in the literature had been in\u000a      substantive disagreement. It has produced the first detailed assessments\u000a      of the RE for several newly-detected gases including trifluoromethyl\u000a      sulphur pentafluoride (SF5CF3) and nitrogen\u000a      trifluoride (NF3) which are emitted as a result of industrial\u000a      activity. The work is reported in many papers, examples of which are given\u000a      in section 3 1,2,3,4.\u000a    Finally, research from 2005 onwards within the Unit led by Shine resulted\u000a      in the proposal of novel alternative metrics. This research originated\u000a      from debate within academic and policymaking circles as to whether the GWP\u000a      was the most suitable metric for comparing the climate effect of emissions\u000a      of different gases. This debate had been long-running (since the early\u000a      1990s), but prior to the Unit's work, no alternative had been proposed\u000a      that had gained traction at the policymaker level.\u000a    The Unit's research led to the development of the Global\u000a      Temperature-change Potential (GTP)5 and its computation for a\u000a      wide variety of greenhouse gases6, as a viable alternative to\u000a      the GWP; this has led to a renewed debate at the policymaker level, about\u000a      the most suitable metric to be used within international protocols. The\u000a      GTP characterises the effect of the emission of a gas on surface\u000a      temperature at some point in the future, and may be better suited than the\u000a      GWP to one of the aims of the 2009 Copenhagen Accord of the UNFCCC, which\u000a      is to restrict temperature increases due to human activity to below 2oC.\u000a      This work has involved collaboration within EC FP7 projects, most notably\u000a      with the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research &#8212;\u000a      Oslo (an independent research centre, associated with the University of\u000a      Oslo).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37294","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2629691","Name":"Iceland"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The Unit's research was key to the implementation of flexible emergency\u000d\u000a      procedures that minimise disruption to air traffic without compromising\u000d\u000a      safety, during volcanic ash emergencies.\u000d\u000a    Contribution of the Unit's radiosonde measurements\u000d\u000a    Flight bans were brought into effect during the crisis by nations across\u000d\u000a      Europe because volcanic ash can seriously damage jet aircraft engines. The\u000d\u000a      aviation industry's standing instructions for dealing safely with volcanic\u000d\u000a      ash, published by the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization\u000d\u000a      (ICAO), are to avoid all encounters with ash. During the initial\u000d\u000a      phase of the Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull eruption, the UK government adopted this\u000d\u000a      \"zero risk\" approach and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) published a\u000d\u000a      (non-zero) safety limit for volcanic ash particle concentration. The\u000d\u000a      no-flight ban that had been imposed was quickly confirmed as appropriate\u000d\u000a      by the Unit's radiosonde measurements. Our balloon flights were crucial\u000d\u000a      because remote sensing observations cannot give the necessary detailed\u000d\u000a      information on particle concentrations, size spectrum and composition that\u000d\u000a      are essential to assessing the hazard (see Annex 1a of Zehner (2010)9)\u000d\u000a      and the ban prevented manned research aircraft flights. Furthermore,\u000d\u000a      because NAME could be run back-wards to define the ash source\u000d\u000a      characteristics, the early use of balloons was useful in defining the\u000d\u000a      source characteristics. After the eruption, as part of ensuring national\u000d\u000a      readiness for future such emergencies, the Met Office contracted the Unit\u000d\u000a      to produce more instruments (to date 20) to train Met Office staff to use\u000d\u000a      them and the associated analysis software developed at the Unit.10\u000d\u000a      The success of this is evident in the Met Office deployment of the\u000d\u000a      equipment during the May 2011 Gr&#237;msv&#246;tn eruption in Iceland. They\u000d\u000a      successfully measured ash above Fort William on 24 May 2011.11\u000d\u000a    Contribution of the NAME model testing and analysis\u000d\u000a    The Met Office has international commitments to provide dispersion\u000d\u000a      modelling in emergencies caused by the releases of hazardous gases and\u000d\u000a      materials into the atmosphere. It has been designated a VAAC (Volcanic Ash\u000d\u000a      Advisory Centre) to provide forecasts and guidance to the CAA, National\u000d\u000a      Air Traffic Services (NATS), airports and airlines in order to support\u000d\u000a      their decisions on whether aircraft can fly safely. The London VAAC is\u000d\u000a      particularly important for European aviation as it is responsible for\u000d\u000a      monitoring and forecasting the movement of volcanic ash from Iceland.12\u000d\u000a      The decisions for European nations were based on scientific advice\u000d\u000a      provided by the London VAAC, relayed by the European Organization for the\u000d\u000a      Safety of Air Navigation (EuroControl). However, national authorities soon\u000d\u000a      came under pressure from European airlines, several of whom claimed that\u000d\u000a      test flights in the supposed danger zone \"showed that the models were\u000d\u000a        wrong\"17. After the bans had been in place for three days\u000d\u000a      all major airlines claimed that authorities had been excessively cautious\u000d\u000a      in their approach. In particular, the airlines disputed the validity of\u000d\u000a      the NAME model in use by the VAAC and dismissed the estimates it gave on\u000d\u000a      the ash cloud extent as \"based on theoretical models, not on facts\".17\u000d\u000a      The UK authorities defended their \"zero risk\" regulatory response,\u000d\u000a      pointing out that it was consistent with the guidelines by ICAO in their\u000d\u000a      2007 Manual on Volcanic Ash, as well as with the Volcanic Ash Contingency\u000d\u000a      Plan (EUR Region).16,18 Thus the validity of NAME became one of\u000d\u000a      the two central issues (the other being the safe ash concentration limits\u000d\u000a      for a jet engine) and its testing became an urgent requirement.\u000d\u000a    Consequently, the Met Office requested urgent additional testing of the\u000d\u000a      model be done, and in particular its performance during the\u000d\u000a      Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull event. This was organised by the Met Office Chair at\u000d\u000a      Reading (at that time, Prof. S.E. Belcher) as part of the newly-formed\u000d\u000a      research partnership between the University and the Met Office. Emergency\u000d\u000a      funding for the work was negotiated from NERC's NCAS.8 Quoting\u000d\u000a      VAAC staff:13 \"...to achieve maximum benefit the data\u000d\u000a        needed to be analysed, compared with the model predictions, and\u000d\u000a        appropriate lessons learnt regarding how much material was actually\u000d\u000a        being emitted from the volcano and how much material survived the\u000d\u000a        near-source fall-out processes (sedimentation of large particles,\u000d\u000a        aggregation and sedimentation of fine ash, wash out, etc.) to reach the\u000d\u000a        far field. Dacre et al (2011) was the first example of such an analysis\u000d\u000a        and hence played a key role in the development of our ash modelling\u000d\u000a        approach, both during the event itself using preliminary results which\u000d\u000a        were made available to us, as well as after the event when our approach\u000d\u000a        was revised further. The revised approach was deployed to good effect\u000d\u000a        during the eruption of Grimsvotn in 2011.\" The key element of the\u000d\u000a      revised model which was used during the Grimsvotn eruption was a\u000d\u000a      parameterisation quantifying fall out of large particles and aggregation\u000d\u000a      and subsequent fall out of small particles. This parameterisation allowed\u000d\u000a      quantitative predictions of volcanic ash to be made.\u000d\u000a    New procedures and the lifting of the flight ban\u000d\u000a    Based on the results from, and the additional tests of the NAME model and\u000d\u000a      on the national risk management procedure, EU Member States, national air\u000d\u000a      safety authorities, national air traffic controllers, and EuroControl\u000d\u000a      realised that a more differentiated assessment of the risk posed by the\u000d\u000a      ash cloud was needed than the \"zero risk\" blanket response. Using the work\u000d\u000a      done by the Unit, the VAAC were able to divide NAME-predicted maps into\u000d\u000a      three zone types (depending on the degree of contamination) such that\u000d\u000a      flight bans could be restricted to smaller regions. On 20 April 2010 (day\u000d\u000a      6 of crisis) new procedures were defined, which led to a partial reopening\u000d\u000a      of European airspace. By 22 April 2010 (day 8) regular flight schedules\u000d\u000a      resumed.14 This experience allowed more precise risk assessment\u000d\u000a      procedures to subsequently be put in place in Europe \"allowing for a much\u000d\u000a      more graduated response and minimising closure of European airspace\".15\u000d\u000a      Specifically, these procedures are credited as ensuring the subsequent\u000d\u000a      eruption of Gr&#237;msv&#246;tn, which began on 21 May 2011, caused proportionally\u000d\u000a      much less disruption. (The Gr&#237;msv&#246;tn event actually produced more ash than\u000d\u000a      the Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull event, but direct comparisons are difficult because\u000d\u000a      weather conditions, and hence dispersion, was different). Europa.eu (the\u000d\u000a      official website of the EU) states: \"This is partially due to the\u000d\u000a        different nature of the Gr&#237;msv&#246;tn volcano as well as different weather\u000d\u000a        conditions. But to a much greater extent it is due to the more precise\u000d\u000a        risk assessment procedures that have been put in place in Europe &#8212;\u000d\u000a        allowing for a much more graduated response and minimising closure of\u000d\u000a        European airspace\".15\u000d\u000a    The Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull eruption caused prolonged closure of European\u000d\u000a      airspace. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimated the\u000d\u000a      airline industry worldwide lost &#163;130 million per day as a result. The more\u000d\u000a      flexible flight restrictions made possible by our research allowed these\u000d\u000a      losses to be cut during the latter days of the crisis and during the\u000d\u000a      Gr&#237;msv&#246;tn eruption. In addition to the economic impact on passengers,\u000d\u000a      airlines and cargo there is saved human cost, as flight bans cause\u000d\u000a      disruption to the schedules and plans of individuals from all walks of\u000d\u000a      life and nationalities. 100,000 flights were cancelled, with over 10\u000d\u000a      million people affected. 42,600 flights were cancelled on the first three\u000d\u000a      days of the crisis whereas only 900 were cancelled in the corresponding\u000d\u000a      interval for the Gr&#237;msv&#246;tn eruption.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull volcano, Iceland caused prolonged\u000d\u000a      closure of European airspace, costing the global airline industry an\u000d\u000a      estimated $200 million per day and disrupting 10 million passengers. We\u000d\u000a      have developed and tested models that predict the dispersal of volcanic\u000d\u000a      ash and developed instrumentation to monitor ash clouds during flight bans\u000d\u000a      and used it to test the models. Our research played a key role in\u000d\u000a      establishing the need for a flight ban and in the adoption of a more\u000d\u000a      flexible approach to its staged lifting as the emergency continued. It\u000d\u000a      also led to increased levels of readiness and to new emergency procedures\u000d\u000a      being put in place across Europe which have minimised the economic costs\u000d\u000a      and human inconvenience without an unacceptable rise in the risks to\u000d\u000a      passengers and crew.

As part of this, since 2007 the Unit has, in close collaboration\u000d\u000a      with the Met Office, made detailed assessments of the capabilities and\u000d\u000a      accuracy of the Met Office's NAME (Numerical Atmospheric-dispersion\u000d\u000a      Modelling Environment) model used for forecasting the dispersion of\u000d\u000a      atmosphere-borne particles originally developed following the Chernobyl\u000d\u000a      radioactivity release in 1986, leading to important enhancements of the\u000d\u000a      model. These tests have used observations by ground-based and airborne\u000d\u000a      lidars (remote sensing devices that illuminate target parts of the\u000d\u000a      atmosphere with a laser and analyse the reflected light) and other\u000d\u000a      numerical models. The Unit was asked by the UK Government's Cabinet Office\u000d\u000a      to apply both techniques urgently, and to give expert guidance during the\u000d\u000a      eruption of Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull in Iceland in April 2010.\u000d\u000a    Hence the relevant research in the Unit was conducted via two\u000d\u000a      complementary strands. (1) Using technology development funding from NERC,2\u000d\u000a      the Unit developed a generic monitoring package for deployment on standard\u000d\u000a      meteorological balloons which measures the size distribution of small\u000d\u000a      atmospheric aerosols such as dust and ash (Nicoll et al., 2011). (2) A\u000d\u000a      parallel on-going research activity has been to test and to contribute to\u000d\u000a      the development of various models used to predict the dispersion of\u000d\u000a      atmospheric pollutants (Dacre, 2010; Davis and Dacre, 2009). The key\u000d\u000a      researchers in the Unit are Prof. R.G. Harrison and Dr H.F. Dacre who were\u000d\u000a      both members of the Unit at the time, Dr A.L.M. Grant, a senior research\u000d\u000a      assistant throughout, and Dr K.A.Nicoll, PhD student in 2008 who\u000d\u000a      subsequently became a PDRA in 2010 and a Leverhulme Fellow in 2011.\u000d\u000a    For both these research strands it is useful to discuss separately the\u000d\u000a      work done (a) before the Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull eruption on 14 April 2010 and\u000d\u000a      (b) in its immediate aftermath.\u000d\u000a    (a) Before the eruption of Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull\u000d\u000a    The radiosonde system has been developed over the past 20 years to carry\u000d\u000a      a range of sensors for atmospheric measurements. Its turbulence\u000d\u000a      measurements have been used as a benchmark for measurements in other\u000d\u000a      planetary atmospheres, notably Titan, when visited by the Cassini\/Huygens\u000d\u000a      probe.3 The system also provides in-situ aerosol observations\u000d\u000a      for calibration and testing of lidar observations and unique data on dust\u000d\u000a      and cloud properties (e.g. Saharan dust distribution4 and\u000d\u000a      electrification of volcanic ash clouds5). We applied the NAME\u000d\u000a      model to Saharan dust clouds6,7 and the prediction of the\u000d\u000a      structure, amplitude and location of various pollution plumes. We were\u000d\u000a      able to identify and quantify errors in these predictions (Dacre, 2010).\u000d\u000a      In particular, predicted plumes were consistently too small, tended to\u000d\u000a      give excessive concentration at their centre compared to observations and\u000d\u000a      did not have the correct evolution. Comparison with a weather prediction\u000d\u000a      model that employed a convection scheme showed that the dispersion model\u000d\u000a      gave pollutant concentrations that were too low because it transported\u000d\u000a      insufficient pollution vertically out of the turbulent lower atmosphere.\u000d\u000a      Our work led to the Met Office making improvements to their model.\u000d\u000a    (b) In the weeks after the ash cloud eruption from Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull\u000d\u000a          on 14 April 2010\u000d\u000a    Met Office was made aware of the Unit's radiosonde technology and ash\u000d\u000a      detection capability at one of the UK radiosonde technology transfer\u000d\u000a      workshops run by the Unit. Consequently, when the Cabinet Office contacted\u000d\u000a      the Met Office at the start of the Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull crisis, they were\u000d\u000a      referred to the Unit`s balloon flight team (led by Prof R.G. Harrison). At\u000d\u000a      the request of the Cabinet Office, the national standby Chinook helicopter\u000d\u000a      at RAF Odiham was provided to fly the team to sample the ash plume during\u000d\u000a      the early phase of the no-flight ban, enforced on 15 April 2010 (day 1\u000d\u000a      after the eruption). We used the NAME model in real time to identify\u000d\u000a      Benbecula in northern Scotland as the optimum location at which to test\u000d\u000a      the model predictions. The sounding taken there verified the presence of\u000d\u000a      ash in the region, with concentrations close to the predictions of the\u000d\u000a      (improved) model for that location, thereby providing key new information\u000d\u000a      for decision-making (and the basis of the first peer-reviewed publication\u000d\u000a      on the eruption (Harrison et al., 2010)).\u000d\u000a    In response to an urgent request from the Met Office, and supported by\u000d\u000a      emergency funding from NERC via NCAS,8 the Unit also tested the\u000d\u000a      performance of NAME in monitoring the dispersion of the ash during the\u000d\u000a      initial phase of the eruption (14-16 April 2010) and later (4-18 May 2010)\u000d\u000a      (Dacre et al. 2013, Grant et al. 2012). It was shown that NAME model\u000d\u000a      captured the timing and structure of the ash layer at its centre. However,\u000d\u000a      there were important caveats. The main qualitative finding was that the\u000d\u000a      accuracy of model forecasts was largely dependent on accurate information\u000d\u000a      about the volcano source characteristics. Quantitatively, the main finding\u000d\u000a      was that it was necessary to parameterise the fall out of large particles\u000d\u000a      and aggregation and subsequent fall out of small particles in order to\u000d\u000a      capture the observed volcanic ash concentrations over the whole of Europe.\u000d\u000a      With these findings it was possible to define prediction uncertainties as\u000d\u000a      a function of position and so develop a more flexible approach to air\u000d\u000a      space closures.\u000d\u000a    1. http:\/\/www.met.reading.ac.uk\/~jq902220\/curr_res\/Met_tech_published.pdf\u000d\u000a    2. for example, NERC Directed (Research Programme: Technology)\u000d\u000a      Grant NE\/H002081\/1 &#163;135k\u000d\u000a    3.

It has been estimated\u000a      that the cost of a single London flooding event could be &#163;12-16 billion,7with\u000a      great potential for fatalities. London therefore has a high level of\u000a      protection against coastal floods. Construction of the current Thames\u000a      Barrier began following the enquiry into the East Coast flooding in 1953\u000a      and was completed in 1983, at a total cost of around &#163;1.7 billion in 2012\u000a      prices. The original design of the barrier was to cope with a 1-in-1000\u000a      year event until 2030, taking into account the long-term sinking of south\u000a      east England. However, the design did not take into account changes in the\u000a      size of storm surges in the North Sea.\u000a    The Environment Agency (EA) launched the Thames Estuary 2100 (TE2100)\u000a      project in 2002, and the final TE2100 plan was released in November 2012.16\u000a      TE2100 was established because of a recognition that exposure to flood\u000a      loss was increasing and that flood protection infrastructure &#8212; including\u000a      the Thames Barrier &#8212; would need upgrading at some stage in the future. The\u000a      initial planning work to identify management options used established\u000a      Defra guidance on sea level rise (12 mm\/year over 2055-2085, or\u000a      approximately 90 cm by 2100)8, and following the Avoiding\u000a      Dangerous Climate Change conference9 in 2005 also considered an\u000a      extreme sea level rise scenario of 4.2m by 2100. Using these scenarios, a\u000a      series of high level options involving different combinations of\u000a      adaptation measures were developed. In 2005, TE2100 commissioned the Met\u000a      Office's Hadley Centre (which resulted in Unit staff being involved), POL\u000a      and (for river flood risk) NERC's Centre for Ecology and Hydrology to\u000a      produce revised climate change scenarios.\u000a    The research into storm surges had two consequences. First, it used\u000a      several climate models to estimate both changes in storminess and regional\u000a      sea levels, demonstrating that the sea level rise assumptions made in the\u000a      original plans were reasonable.6 Second, using expert judgement\u000a      and interpretation of evidence from periods of past rapid sea level rise,\u000a      it produced a new estimate of a plausible (but highly unlikely) maximum\u000a      sea level rise (termed the H++ scenario) of 2.7m. This was considerably\u000a      lower than the extreme case previously used. The TE2100 Plan16\u000a      recognises the importance of the Unit's findings, stating (p28):\u000a    \"These results give greater certainty that we have being planning for\u000a        the right potential range of water levels this century\"\u000a    \"Our previous worst-case scenario for increases in maximum water levels\u000a        can be revised down.\"\u000a    \"Such a reduction in worst-case scenario for this century means that a\u000a        tide-excluding barrage will not be necessary to manage flood risk this\u000a        century and can be dropped from our final options\"\u000a    The cost of this second barrage has been estimated to be approximately\u000a      &#163;10 billion (in 2012 prices)16, and would need to be\u000a      accommodated in the Government's financial planning. As noted by Reeder\u000a      and Ranger (2012)18 of the proposed developments: \"These\u000a        types of investments tend to be difficult or costly to reverse (i.e.\u000a        they have high `sunk costs'), are high-stakes and their design is\u000a        dependent on what assumptions are made today about the climate over its\u000a        lifetime (e.g. the appropriate height of a sea wall will depend on\u000a        assumptions about sea level rise over the next few decades). This means\u000a        that if forecasts are incorrect today, the project can become maladapted\u000a        to climate, exposing society to greater risks, wasted investments or\u000a        unnecessary retrofit costs.\" They also note the success of the\u000a      TE2100 in handling this problem: \"The TE2100 project demonstrates that\u000a        robust adaptation planning is possible even where dealing with\u000a        long-lived decisions with high sunk-costs and deep uncertainty over\u000a        future climate risks.\" The TE2100 plan also defines the monitoring,\u000a      reviewing and the decision-making procedures that will be needed to keep\u000a      the risk to London, including the storm surge risk from the east and the\u000a      fluvial risk to the west, within acceptable levels.10\u000a    The associated monitoring costs are also calculated. Part of this\u000a      continued evaluation is undertaken through the i-STORM international\u000a      network of moveable storm barriers, which includes representation from the\u000a      UK (the Thames Barrier), the Netherlands, Russia and Italy15.\u000a      The aim of i-STORM is to share experience and methods; Lowe sits on the\u000a      science panel for the network, bringing his experience of climate change\u000a      to i-STORM. The experience of TE2100 has being used to inform similar\u000a      projects elsewhere in the world.18,19\u000a    Because of its importance to such a large population the TE2100 plan has\u000a      received considerable media attention11-14 and has great\u000a      economic implications. A quantification of economic importance of the\u000a      recommendations was commissioned by NERC from the DTZ\/UGL consultancy and\u000a      traces the impact of storm surge modelling work at POL.20\u000a      Because that modelling was deployed via Lowe and Gregory (2005)1\u000a      and Lowe et al. (2009)5 into TE2100, the findings are relevant\u000a      here. The NERC-DTZ report summarises the financial impacts to be:\u000a      safeguarding the London Economy &#8212; &#163;94 million per flood day; safeguarding\u000a      property in the Thames Estuary area &#8212; &#163;2 billion per annum; giving\u000a      confidence to future London investment &#8212; &#163;2.1 billion per annum; value of\u000a      human lives in the Thames floodplain &#8212; &#163;31.25 billion per annum.\u000a    The research used to construct the scenarios for extreme water levels for\u000a      TE2100 also contributed directly to the UKCP09 climate projections.6\u000a      The UKCP09 climate projections were published by Defra in 2009, and\u000a      provide climate information designed to help those needing to plan how\u000a      they will adapt to a changing climate. UKCP09 was developed by\u000a      incorporating the needs of users of climate projections, and also by\u000a      making use of advances in climate science since the previous set of UK\u000a      scenarios was published in 2002. In particular, the UKCP09 projections\u000a      take a probabilistic approach, and construct probability distributions for\u000a      changes in relevant climate, marine and coastal variables. The Marine and\u000a      Coastal Projections Report5 presents scenarios for changes in\u000a      mean sea level and storm surge around the UK (along with wave heights and\u000a      ocean temperatures), and was led by the Unit's Dr Lowe. These scenarios\u000a      show ranges in change in mean sea level and storm surge, based on the use\u000a      of multiple climate models. Chapter 717 of the UKCP09 report\u000a      gives a case study of the use by TE2100 of the sea-level rise and storm\u000a      surge projections (given in Chapters 2-4 of the report) and demonstrated\u000a      how the UKCP09 results could be used in practice. The UKCP09 sea level and\u000a      storm surge scenarios have since 2010 been incorporated as Supplementary\u000a      Guidance21 into the Environment Agency's revised Flood and\u000a      Coastal Erosion Risk Management Appraisal Guidance (FCERM-AG)22.\u000a      This guidance is used in all coastal flood management projects in England,\u000a      and has been applied in all appraisals started since August 2011. The UK's\u000a      Climate Change Risk Assessment23, published in 2012, used the\u000a      UKCP09 sea level rise scenarios to estimate future exposure to coastal\u000a      flooding.\u000a    The Thames Region Climate Change Programme Manager of the Environment\u000a      Agency notes that24 \"The TE2100 project was the first major\u000a        infrastructure planning project to put adapting to the impacts of\u000a        climate change at its centre......Jason [Lowe]'s research commissioned\u000a        by the TE2100 project formed the majority of the input to the UKCP09\u000a        marine projections and has proved very valuable not only to the TE2100\u000a        plan but also to the wider UK in understanding the scale of challenge to\u000a        adapt to rising sea levels and changing weather patterns.\"\u000a    Background information\u000a    6.

First, mean sea level will\u000a      rise as oceans warm and glacier ice melts. Second, a change in wind and\u000a      atmospheric pressure may lead to changes in the frequency of storm surges.\u000a      Research at the Unit and the UK Met Office through the work of Prof.\u000a      Jonathan Gregory and Dr. Jason Lowe has examined both of these components,\u000a      with a particular focus on coasts around the UK. Gregory joined the Unit\u000a      in 2003 and Lowe is a Met Office employee who has been on full-time\u000a      secondment to the Unit (as part of the MetOffice@Reading group) since\u000a      2003. This work within the Unit was supported by funding from Defra to the\u000a      Met Office under contract PECD7\/12\/37.\u000a    Lowe and Gregory (2005)1 and (2006)2 assessed\u000a      potential changes in the magnitude of extreme sea levels around the UK due\u000a      to climate change. They used the Met Office's HadCM3 global climate model\u000a      to provide inputs to the higher resolution regional climate model HadRM3H\u000a      (via an intermediate scale model), and then used the output from HadRM3H\u000a      to run a storm surge model previously developed by NERC's Plymouth\u000a      Oceanographic Laboratory (POL). This nested approach to providing the\u000a      inputs for the storm surge model was necessary because the coarse-scale\u000a      global models used to simulate the effects of future emissions of\u000a      greenhouse gases do not provide fine enough details on potential changes\u000a      in regional wind speeds and circulation patterns. Lowe and Gregory1,2\u000a      estimated that, under high emissions of greenhouse gases, the height of\u000a      the 50-year return period flood around the south east coast of England\u000a      would increase by around 1.2m by 2100: 70cm would be due to increased\u000a      storminess leading to more frequent surges, approximately 33cm would be\u000a      due to the increase in sea level, and the rest would be due to the\u000a      long-term sinking of south east England associated with the isostatic\u000a      rebound of northern UK following the deglaciation. However, there is\u000a      uncertainty in the projected change in extreme sea levels, not only\u000a      because of uncertainty in the change in storminess, but also because of\u000a      uncertainty in change in mean sea level at the regional scale; as oceans\u000a      warm, sea level rises differently in different parts of the ocean because\u000a      of differences in the density of sea water and the effect of ocean\u000a      currents. Different climate models from different modelling centres make\u000a      different projections of both global mean sea level change and the pattern\u000a      of change across the globe (e.g., Bindoff et al., 20073;\u000a      Pardaens et al., 20114).\u000a    As part of the underpinning research for the TE2100 plan for the Thames\u000a      Estuary, in 2005 the Met Office and POL were commissioned by the\u000a      Environment Agency to assess the effects of climate change on extreme sea\u000a      levels in the Thames Estuary. The work was led by Lowe in the Unit with\u000a      contributions from other Unit staff and Gregory in particular. The\u000a      research built on Lowe and Gregory1,2, using essentially the\u000a      same methodology, but used several climate models to estimate changes in\u000a      storminess around the UK and several climate models to estimate change in\u000a      mean sea level around the UK in order to better characterise uncertainty.\u000a      The research also contributed directly to the marine component of the\u000a      UKCP09 UK climate projections6, published in 2009 by Defra, and\u000a      is described in detail in the underpinning UKCP09 science report written\u000a      by Lowe5. Subsequently, the i-STORM group15 was\u000a      established by the Environment Agency monitor relevant developments and\u000a      the Unit's research continues to input advances in the science and\u000a      modelling into this process (e.g., Pardaens et al., 2011).4\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37296","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Pathway to Impact.\u000a    The National Severe Weather Warning System (NSWWS) is a free warning\u000a      service, originally\u000a      established by the Met Office in response to the enquiry set up by the\u000a      Secretary of State into the\u000a      forecasting and impact of the 1987 Great Storm. Warnings of forecasts of\u000a      severe weather enable\u000a      Civil Contingencies Category 1 and 2 responders to plan and implement\u000a      action needed to reduce\u000a      the impact of the severe weather. Warnings are also issued to the public\u000a      at large via the broadcast\u000a      media, and other authorities when appropriate. The warnings also make the\u000a      tasks of the\u000a      emergency services easier by providing reliable updates of the current\u000a      situation and prognosis.\u000a      The system was radically overhauled in 2011 and the Unit's research into\u000a      sting jets provided the\u000a      Met Office with the means to incorporate more accurate predictions of the\u000a      likely impact of a sting\u000a      jet into their severe weather warnings. The ultimate beneficiaries are the\u000a      inhabitants and\u000a      businesses of the UK. In addition, timely warnings reduce losses and\u000a      damage to infrastructure and\u000a      property so local and national government and insurance companies also\u000a      benefit.12\u000a    The Met Office was involved closely in the research and its application\u000a      from the outset. The\u000a      realisation that the most destructive winds are associated with a\u000a      characteristic cloud formation\u000a      produced an immediate benefit in terms of diagnosing current weather\u000a      patterns: by 2005, the Met\u000a      Office had started to use satellite images to issue warnings to locations\u000a      likely to be in the path of a\u000a      sting jet but with warnings only one to two hours in advance of the storm\u000a      (as reported in media\u000a      articles of the time13). Joint work by the Unit and the Met\u000a      Office established what was needed to\u000a      predict the occurrence and severity of sting jets further in advance. As a\u000a      result, the Met Office\u000a      introduced the capability of issuing warnings of sting jet via the NSWWS\u000a      in April 2011.14 The first\u000a      explicit forecast taking account of a sting jet was issued for the storm\u000a      of 8 December 2011, and the\u000a      term `sting jet' was used for the first time in a televised public weather\u000a      forecast on 3 January 201214\u000a      with full explanation of the term appearing on the Met Office web site,15\u000a      in Met Office leaflets16 and\u000a      in press reports.17\u000a    Impact on Met Office and European severe weather warnings \u000a    The importance of the Unit's research in issuing severe weather warnings\u000a      is made clear on the\u000a      Met Office website:23 \"one feature of the 1987 storm was\u000a        the presence of 'sting jets'. .... At the time\u000a        of the storm, however, no-one knew they existed or how they worked.\u000a        Today they are well\u000a        understood and represented in forecasting models so we can warn about\u000a        them in advance\". In\u000a      addition, the head of Numerical Weather Prediction at the Met Office at\u000a      the time has said \"The\u000a        work of Browning and others at Reading was very helpful to the Met\u000a        Office in making reliable\u000a        forecasts and warnings of hazardous weather, in that it led to us\u000a        gaining the capability to identify\u000a        damaging sting jets, predicting their evolution and issuing timely\u000a        warnings. The collaboration\u000a        between Reading and the Met Office was very effective in bringing this\u000a        about\".24 France, Germany,\u000a      Switzerland, Scandinavia and the Baltic countries have also started to\u000a      issue warnings of sting\u000a      jets.25,26 Since summer 2012 work is underway in the US to\u000a      similarly upgrade their capability based\u000a      directly on this research.27\u000a    Applications in windstorms Friedhelm and Ulli\u000a    The benefits of sting jet prediction are demonstrated by warnings the Met\u000a      Office issued on 8\u000a      December 2011 and 3 January 2012 for storms \"Friedhelm\"18 and\u000a      \"Ulli\"19, respectively. In both\u000a      cases, the Met Office forecast that particularly ferocious winds would\u000a      affect parts of Scotland and\u000a      issued the strongest possible severe weather warning on the basis that\u000a      these had been identified\u000a      to be sting-jet storms.28 Agencies acted on the advice: schools\u000a      were closed, police warned people\u000a      not to travel unless absolutely necessary, and emergency services were put\u000a      on alert. The\u000a      Kingston, Erskine, Tay and Forth bridges were closed, and many bus, rail\u000a      and ferry services were\u000a      cancelled.18,19,20,21 Furthermore, the Met Office forecasts of\u000a      these two storms were incorporated\u000a      into warnings issued by various European and Scandinavian Meteorological\u000a      Institutes, and\u000a      triggering the cancellation of North Sea ferry services and the closure of\u000a      several bridges. \u000a    The preventative action minimised the impact of these storms, which\u000a      brought gusts of wind up to\u000a      164 mph and widespread disruption including uprooted trees, damage to\u000a      power lines (e.g. 150000\u000a      homes without electricity in the 8th December storm) and\u000a      overturned vehicles (including a school\u000a      bus that was not in use because schools had been closed because of the\u000a      alert). Importantly,\u000a      nobody was killed. How the outcome would have differed had the warnings\u000a      not been issued cannot\u000a      be known and reliable statistics, that allow comparison with events that\u000a      took place without the\u000a      warnings, will require analysis of many such cases. Scotland's Deputy\u000a      First Minister Nicola\u000a      Sturgeon said: \"The conditions are exactly as predicted when the Met\u000a        Office issued its red\u000a        warning\",19 Central Scotland Police Emergency Planning\u000a      reported \"spot on forecasting over the\u000a        last 2 days\" and Grampian Police said: \"thanks as always for the\u000a        updates, they are vitally important\u000a        to us and are a great source of detail for warning and informing our\u000a        communities\".20 Angus Bruce,\u000a      Bridge Manager at Amey, added: \"I would complement the Met Office for\u000a        the accuracy of their\u000a        information, this helps to give us confidence in the information we\u000a        receive and allows us to plan\u000a        things such as the re-opening of the Erskine Bridge with confidence and\u000a        accuracy\".21 That sting jet\u000a      science was at the heart of these warnings and the benefits achieved using\u000a      those warnings\u000a      discussed in a Met Office review of the Freidhelm and Ulli events (Fox et\u000a      al. (2012).23\u000a    It is not yet possible to quantify the benefits that arise from the\u000a      improvement to warnings\u000a      brought about specifically by sting jet science. However, the savings\u000a      resulting from the Met\u000a      Office's severe wind warnings in general give an indication of the scale\u000a      of the potential savings for\u000a      the most damaging (sting jet) events. The total savings were evaluated in\u000a      a 2007 report by the Met\u000a      Office, working with the Cabinet Office.22 At that time, sting\u000a      jet warnings were still in their infancy\u000a      (specifically, satellite images were used to warn of locations likely to\u000a      be in the path of a sting jet but\u000a      only one to two hours in advance); nevertheless, severe wind warnings were\u000a      estimated to save 23\u000a      lives and &#163;34m per annum in the UK construction industry, &#163;41m efficiency\u000a      savings in the\u000a      emergency services and &#163;95.5 million saved in the UK through improved\u000a      aircraft routing and a\u000a      further &#163;3.6 million reduction in flight delays. The prediction of sting\u000a      jets is also finding applications\u000a      in severe weather warning around Europe and in France, Germany,\u000a      Switzerland, Scandinavia and\u000a      the Baltic countries in particular.\u000a    The Unit's research led to the understanding that sting jets are a\u000a      feature of many, but not all,\u000a      rapidly developing storms. It has been estimated that if the Great Storm\u000a      of 1987 had recurred in\u000a      2007, it would have caused between &#163;4 billion and &#163;7 billion in insured\u000a      loss Europe-wide,2 over\u000a      70% of this generated in the UK. Discussions have been held between the\u000a      Unit and a number of\u000a      insurance, re-insurance and CAT (Catastrophe) modelling companies\u000a      (Willis-Re, RMS, AIR-\u000a      Worldwide and Axa) to appraise them of the need to include the impact of\u000a      sting jets in their\u000a      statistical cyclone databases. Most insurers rely on \"vender\" models from\u000a      sub-contractors but for\u000a      reasons of commercial confidence, they do not know if these incorporate\u000a      sting jets (and associated\u000a      losses) or not. By making them aware of the science and its implications,\u000a      the Unit has already had\u000a      an influence on both the insurers and the CAT modellers demonstrated, for\u000a      example, by KT\u000a      partnerships funded by Axa.29\u000a    Background Information\u000a    12. e.g., P.

They termed these winds a\u000a      \"sting jet\". In collaboration\u000a      with the Met Office, the researchers developed ways to identify sting jets\u000a      in current and imminent\u000a      weather and, later, methods to forecast these extremely damaging events up\u000a      to a several days in\u000a      advance. These techniques are now used in the UK National Severe Weather\u000a      Warning Service\u000a      (NSWWS) and in European storm forecasts. Since the development of this new\u000a      early warning\u000a      capability, events have been too few to compile proper statistics;\u000a      however, there is general\u000a      agreement amongst the emergency services, local government officials and\u000a      insurers that the\u000a      improved warnings of extreme winds have saved lives, minimised disruption\u000a      and generated\u000a      considerable cost savings.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Environmental","Institution":"\u000a    University of Reading\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Reading (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Reading","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007802}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2655603","Name":"Birmingham"}],"References":"\u000a    Citations to each paper, as found by a WoS search (October 2013) are\u000a      given in brackets for the\u000a      following relevant journal papers.

Extreme winds of up to\u000a      115 miles per hour, which had not been forecast, also caused widespread\u000a      structural damage to\u000a      buildings, and brought down an estimated 15 million trees.1\u000a      Rail and road transport were disrupted\u000a      and power supplies to some areas were interrupted for more than two weeks.\u000a      The storm was the\u000a      second most expensive weather event in the UK on record, costing the\u000a      insurance industry &#163;1.4bn.2\u000a    Motivated by a similar, \"near-miss\" storm on 30 October 2000 (in which\u000a      the strongest winds did\u000a      not cause damage because they were over the North Sea)3 Unit\u000a      scientists examined surface\u000a      observations (wind, temperature, humidity and pressure), satellite imagery\u000a      and radar rainfall data,\u000a      for the 1987 storm, to ascertain the cause of the very strong wind gusts\u000a      that developed that night.\u000a      This work was carried out by Prof K. Browning between 2001 and 2003, with\u000a      a PDRA (M. Field)\u000a      under his supervision. Browning retired from UoR in 2003 and is now a\u000a      visiting Emeritus Professor\u000a      with the Unit. Subsequently, the work was carried on by Unit members Dr\u000a      S.Gray and Prof P.\u000a      Clark (the latter being Unit member for 1998-2010 as part of the embedded\u000a      Met Office Joint Centre\u000a      for Mesoscale Meteorology, JCMM now called MetOffice@Reading, who rejoined\u000a      the Unit as a\u000a      UoR Professor in 2012). Also involved in the work have been Unit members\u000a      Dr J. Methven,\u000a      MetOffice@Reading research assistant Dr. C. Wang, PDRA Dr. O.\u000a      Mart&#237;nez-Alvarado, PhD\u000a      student Dr. L. Baker (who became a PDRA in with the Unit in 2011), and PhD\u000a      student J. Catto\u000a      (until 2010): all these PDRAs and students were supervised by Gray and\u000a      Clark.\u000a    Browning found that the most damaging gusts the 16 October 1987 storm had\u000a      occurred in a\u000a      small region (roughly 50 km across) present for only a relatively short\u000a      time (a few hours) compared\u000a      with the lifetime of the storm as a whole (1-2 days). He interpreted\u000a      observations as showing that\u000a      these most damaging winds emanated from a jet of air emerging from the tip\u000a      of a hook-shaped\u000a      cloud that encircled the low-pressure centre of the storm system, a region\u000a      different from the\u000a      commonly-understood areas where strong winds were expected (Browning, 20046;\u000a      Browning and\u000a      Field, 20047). Browning named the phenomenon a \"sting jet\",\u000a      because meteorologists from\u000a      Bergen had previously noted that such hook-shaped clouds had the\u000a      appearance of a scorpion's\u000a      tail. Browning also identified the evolution of the cloud pattern in\u000a      satellite imagery as a useful tool\u000a      for identifying the presence of a sting jet once it had developed.\u000a    Clark et al. (2005)8 used high-resolution numerical weather\u000a      prediction models to study the 3-dimensional\u000a      structure of sting-jet storms. They confirmed that the most damaging\u000a      surface winds\u000a      result from a jet of air descending from a part of the hook-shaped cloud\u000a      several kilometres above\u000a      the ground, which is unstable to an atmospheric instability known as\u000a      Conditional Symmetric\u000a      Instability (CSI). Based on an understanding of when and where damaging\u000a      surface winds might\u000a      develop, other researchers in the unit (Gray with Mart&#237;nez-Alvarado and\u000a      Baker) went on to confirm\u000a      the presence of sting-jets in a number of storms, as did international\u000a      collaborators using different\u000a      models (Mart&#237;nez-Alvarado et al., 2010).9 Broader collaborative\u000a      projects involving the Unit have\u000a      observed such events in yet greater detail, including the NERC-funded\u000a      DIAMET project (DIAbatic\u000a      influence on Mesoscale structures in ExTratropical storms).\u000a    High-resolution modelling studies by the Unit's researchers enabled them\u000a      to determine the\u000a      minimum resolution needed in weather forecast models to capture the\u000a      phenomenon. Models of\u000a      sufficient resolution are now run operationally by forecast centres such\u000a      as the Met Office for short-\u000a      range forecasts. They also showed that strong sting jets only occur in\u000a      storms which develop CSI in\u000a      the hook-shaped cloud, and hence they developed a diagnostic to detect\u000a      sting jets in the low-\u000a      resolution datasets typical of longer-range forecast models incapable of\u000a      directly resolving the sting\u000a      jet (Gray et al., 2011).10 The diagnostic enabled the Unit's\u000a      researchers to assess the likely\u000a      frequency of sting jets in past storms using re-analysis data\u000a      (Mart&#237;nez-Alvarado, 2012)11 and\u000a      opened up the possibility of earlier warnings. The work was funded by a\u000a      series of NERC grants.4\u000a    The ability to predict the sting jets is very important because of the\u000a      potential loss of life and\u000a      property damage that the extremely high wind speeds can cause.\u000a      Understanding the mechanisms\u000a      that give rise to sting jets has allowed their diagnosis from\u000a      low-resolution general circulation\u000a      models or statistical models, such as those in use within the\u000a      insurance\/reinsurance industry2 and\u000a      forecasts and warnings of such events, several days in advance, were made\u000a      possible.\u000a    1.

Because it is freely available, we do not know the full extent\u000a      of TRACK's usage and some applications we know of are in highly\u000a      competitive commercial sectors and remain confidential. Specific examples\u000a      of its use (in partnership with the Unit) are highlighted in more detail\u000a      below, but on-going support requests19 indicate more widespread\u000a      use. The significance of the applications of TRACK is very high and it has\u000a      contributed to novel quantitative analysis in the insurance sector as well\u000a      as insights for policy- making and operational model development. TRACK's\u000a      impact is subtle in some cases because TRACK is primarily an enabling tool\u000a      (providing users with new ways to access and interpret storm data) rather\u000a      than a specific scientific conclusion. TRACK has nevertheless made novel\u000a      quantitative storm analyses possible in a wide variety of weather and\u000a      climate datasets, including in- house datasets owned by the end-users\u000a      themselves.\u000a    The specific examples of TRACK usage discussed here fall into 3\u000a      categories: (1) use of TRACK to improve storm forecasts for the offshore\u000a      industry; (2) use of TRACK to construct catalogues of storm events for use\u000a      by the insurance industry in understanding risk and how it is changing;\u000a      and (3) the use of TRACK to guide the improvement and use of climate\u000a      simulation models.\u000a    BMT ARGOSS is a subsidiary\u000a      of the BMT Group and is a leading maritime consultancy and weather\u000a      forecast company, providing offshore forecasts to customers including oil\u000a      and gas companies, transport companies, jetty operators, Liquid Natural\u000a      Gas sites and dredgers. It has a strong collaboration with the Unit, where\u000a      it funds a Professorship. Through this BMT learnt early of the Unit's work\u000a      on storm forecasting and our conclusion (based on TRACK) that storms\u000a      typically move more rapidly than estimated in weather forecast models.18\u000a      As a result, since 2009 their in- house meteorologists have used TRACK to\u000a      produce improved weather-forecast products for maritime emergency response\u000a      and vessel routing. 24 For example, they now make improved\u000a      estimates of storm arrival times at offshore oil rigs, thereby increasing\u000a      the reliability of safety margins and decreasing the time that operations\u000a      need to be shut-down due to extreme weather. A senior consultant and\u000a      project manager states:22 \"Customers require storm warnings\u000a        alongside the regular weather forecasts. These dedicated forecasts\u000a        cannot be produced reliably based on a single model, requiring more\u000a        specialized tools. The TRACK software suite provides us with this\u000a        capability. Currently the TRACK software is run operationally at BMT\u000a        ARGOSS, 4 times per day. TRACK is becoming an essential part of our\u000a        modelling infrastructure. It allows us to focus on the development of\u000a        customer-specific products, and the development of a sustainable service\".\u000a      A Maritime Meteorologist with BMT23 notes that TRACK is \"particularly\u000a        useful for our customers, such as dredging vessels or towing, that need\u000a        to shelter for tropical cyclones and particularly for the high wind\u000a        speed and wave height associated with it. We use the tracking software\u000a        to identify storms at an early stage and advise our customers about wind\u000a        speed and wave height. We use the ensembles to assess the most likely\u000a        track of the cyclone and whether or not the wind speed and wave height\u000a        are expected to reach certain thresholds\" and that \"We generate\u000a        cyclone bulletins based on the ensembles. Particularly the expected\u000a        ground track and estimated wind speed are of great importance to our\u000a        customers such as vessels, rigs or ports\". TRACK is also influencing\u000a      the future development of BMT's services: e.g., it is being used to\u000a      generate statistics to improve typhoon warnings. Froude (NERC Knowledge\u000a      Exchange fellow) and Hodges provided extensive support to BMT-ARGOSS over\u000a      the last 5 years in applying TRACK with weather-forecast data.19\u000a    Storms are extremely important to the global insurance and reinsurance\u000a      sectors.20 In 2012, for example, storms produced global\u000a      insured losses of $54bn and accounted for 75% of total insured\u000a      losses.21 Hence storms are a key risk for insurance exposure.\u000a      Insurance companies need to quantify the risk posed by storms in order to\u000a      assess exposure and set premiums, and this requires an understanding of\u000a      the frequency and characteristics of storm events.\u000a    Willis is one of the \"big\u000a      three\" global insurance brokers dealing with weather and climate\u000a      catastrophe risk.  Working in partnership with Willis since\u000a      2006 through the Willis Reinsurance Network, the Unit has used TRACK to\u000a      derive a catalogue of tropical cyclones. Willis has used this in the\u000a      development of its Tropical Cyclone Laboratory (TC Lab), a decision-making\u000a      tool for brokers that combines observational and model data to identify\u000a      robust evidence of evolving weather and climate risk, and acknowledge the\u000a      invaluable input from the Unit.25 The relationship between the\u000a      Unit and Willis includes a Knowledge Transfer Partnership fellow (Dr J.\u000a      Strachan), who was directly embedded with Willis' Natural Catastrophe\u000a      Modelling and Product Development teams. Her work led to a broader\u000a      understanding of the effects of climate variability and change on extreme\u000a      events within Willis and, in particular, the need for robust long-term\u000a      catalogues of tropical storm events to better assess present and future\u000a      insurance risk.\u000a    TRACK has also been instrumental in the production of the Extreme Wind\u000a      Storm (XWS) catalogue in collaboration with the Met. Office, Exeter\u000a      University and Willis.26 This catalogue of historical\u000a      extratropical wind storms, including footprints of their damaging winds,\u000a      has recently been made freely available but has been designed for use in\u000a      the insurance industry in particular. The impact of the catalogue itself\u000a      will be considerable but has yet to happen; however, the collaboration to\u000a      develop it demonstrates how the application of TRACK is changing planning\u000a      in the insurance industry. For example, in a study made possible only by\u000a      the TRACK software, staff of Willis and Exeter University have studied the\u000a      implications of clustering of windstorms for the insurance industry and\u000a      discuss the scale of the associated losses.27 A Willis briefing\u000a      document notes \"These results will be of interest to insurers\u000a        and reinsurers focussed on more accurate, actuarially-sound risk\u000a        management of European windstorms, particularly those with\u000a        spatially-extended portfolios and exposure in NW Europe\". 28\u000a    Risk Management Solutions (RMS)\u000a      is one of 3 major international catastrophe modelling companies providing\u000a      services to insurance and reinsurance companies. RMS use TRACK to analyse\u000a      storms simulated by their in-house climate modelling and historical\u000a      datasets. The storm tracks are used with their proprietary catastrophe\u000a      model in their wind-storm risk assessment model which is widely used in\u000a      the insurance sector within the UK and internationally.34 The\u000a      Unit is also currently working with the global insurance company, Hiscox,\u000a      to improve understanding of their exposure to Atlantic hurricane risks.\u000a      They have supported MSc and PhD projects in the Unit on the applications\u000a      of TRACK .29 \u000a    The UK Met Office runs one of the world's leading climate models,\u000a      which has developed over time from the late 1980s to the current\u000a      generation HadGEM2 family of models. The models have featured in all\u000a      assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), are\u000a      used to support policy advice provided by the Met Office to the UK\u000a      government, and provided the basis for the climate scenarios (UKCIP98,\u000a      UKCIP02 and UKCP09) used in the vast majority of assessments of the\u000a      impacts of climate change in the UK. Many research projects and activities\u000a      have supported the development over time of the Met Office climate model,\u000a      and TRACK has played a part in this development.30 The Met\u000a      Office use the TRACK software and analysis package to assess the ability\u000a      of models to reproduce storm characteristics, such as their track,\u000a      frequency and intensity31,32, and to show that increasing the\u000a      spatial resolution of the climate model led to considerably improved\u000a      representation of storms. HadGEM2 runs at double the spatial resolution\u000a      and the use of TRACK provided further support for improving resolution.32\u000a      The Met Office also use TRACK with their model simulations of future\u000a      climate to assess potential changes in storm characteristics in targeted\u000a      regional studies.33 A testimonial letter30 from the\u000a      Met Office's Manager of global high resolution modelling list the many\u000a      uses that they make of TRACK and concludes \"Overall, TRACK is a very\u000a        important component of our model assessment and development suite\"\u000a    Background information\u000a    19.

In order for them to be\u000a      systematically studied, they need to be defined objectively and\u000a      consistently from observed weather data. Given the social and economic\u000a      impact of severe storms, it is also important to assess how well\u000a      operational weather forecast and climate models represent storms; the\u000a      complex and fine scale nature of storm processes are a challenge to\u000a      represent in even the best high grid resolution models. However, the\u000a      petabyte-scale volumes of data involved make traditional manual approaches\u000a      to the identification of storms impossible. Scientists working in the Unit\u000a      have therefore created a unique automated diagnostic tool to identify\u000a      storms, track their movement and evolution, and record their\u000a      characteristics (intensity, growth rates etc.). The methodology was based\u000a      on the Unit's research into storm phenomena, and applies image processing\u000a      techniques to existing and novel data from weather and climate models and\u000a      observations12-15. The research was led by Senior Research\u000a      Fellow K. Hodges (who has been with the Unit since before 1993), with\u000a      support from other Unit staff members B. Hoskins (also a Unit member since\u000a      before 1993, since 2008 at 0.2FTE), P-L. Vidale, L. Shaffrey, O.L.\u000a      Bengtsson, C. Thorncroft and H. Dacre, by Knowledge Exchange Fellows R.\u000a      Cornforth E. Froude and J. Strachan (funded by NERC, NERC and Willis-Re,\u000a      respectively), by PDRA Zappa, and by several PhD students supervised by\u000a      Unit staff. All these scientists are still with the Unit except the PhD\u000a      students and Thorncroft, Froude and Strachan (who left in 2002, 2013 and\u000a      2013, respectively).\u000a    That the TRACK software is highly flexible and of wide application has\u000a      been demonstrated by its use in a long series of studies of a wide range\u000a      of storm types including: tropical cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons);1,2\u000a      extratropical cyclones (such as the windstorms which affect UK and western\u000a      Europe);3-7 \"polar low\" cyclones (high latitude cyclones that\u000a      are a hazard to high-latitude shipping and gas and oil platforms);8\u000a      and the development of African Easterly Waves (elongated troughs of low\u000a      pressure moving westward across tropical Africa, and precursors of many\u000a      tropical cyclones).9 The Unit extended the output of TRACK to\u000a      include the 3-dimensional structure of all these storm types and their\u000a      impact \"footprint\" in surface winds, temperatures, and precipitation.\u000a    Unit research using TRACK has shown that storm systems in most\u000a      operational weather- forecast models, on average, move too slowly,18\u000a      creating important insights for both model development and forecast\u000a      operations. The use of TRACK with data from climate models used to\u000a      simulate future climate has shown that increased model-grid resolution is\u000a      vital to accurately represent storm properties.2,3,6 It has\u000a      also shown that whilst the frequency of winter extra-tropical cyclones is\u000a      projected to fall in the future across most of Europe, it may increase\u000a      across the UK and central Europe.4 TRACK has been used to\u000a      reconstruct historical storms to aid in their interpretation 16,17,\u000a      and has been used to construct storm databases10,11.

At the start of the eruption there\u000a      was no observatory on the island, but now the MVO has a custom-built home\u000a      and a sophisticated network of monitoring instruments, that now includes\u000a      the radars developed by UoR, and warning procedures. The activity at the\u000a      volcano has waxed and waned, but one constant is that the main threat to\u000a      life has been from pyroclastic flows produced by collapses of the lava\u000a      dome that can grow for years on end. The short-term threat from these\u000a      flows largely changes depending on how fast the dome is growing (the\u000a      faster the more dangerous) and in which direction (the remaining populated\u000a      areas lie to the north and west of the volcano). MVO faced a major problem\u000a      in assessing these two hazard factors operationally: the lava dome at the\u000a      top of the Soufriere Hills Volcano is often covered in cloud, sometimes\u000a      for weeks on end. The Unit recognised the significance of this at an early\u000a      stage. Satellite radar data, that were of sufficiently high resolution to\u000a      play a useful role, were available only infrequently and under very\u000a      limited access. By 2000, the Unit had identified that some type of\u000a      ground-based, cloud-penetrating radar was required that could be focused\u000a      on the most dangerous parts of the lava dome. The development of AVTIS in\u000a      conjunction with MVO followed from that need.13 The development\u000a      to a second- generation operational version of this entirely new class of\u000a      instrument took ten years.\u000a    The ability to demonstrate an impact with AVTIS and with the\u000a      high-resolution civilian satellite radars (TerraSAR-X) has varied\u000a      depending on the state of activity at the volcano and the state of\u000a      development of the instruments.\u000a    A well-documented example of impact comes from July-August 2008. After\u000a      several days of earthquakes, a major explosion occurred on 29 July\u000a      depositing ash on inhabited areas of Montserrat. Unfortunately, cloud\u000a      covered the upper part of the volcano and MVO initiated an evacuation of\u000a      part of the island closest to the volcano until the state of the volcanic\u000a      dome could be determined, and asked for help from us to do this. AVTIS was\u000a      under development in the UK at that time, so we used satellite radar data\u000a      instead. Wadge invoked the International Charter on Space &amp; Major\u000a      Disasters8,9 via the UK Cabinet Office on MVO's behalf. This\u000a      Charter gives privileged access to satellite remote sensing instruments\u000a      (radars mainly in this case) owned by all the major space agencies across\u000a      the world, to immediately focus on the crisis (Montserrat in this case)\u000a      and provide free data. In association with the British Geological Survey\u000a      these data were interrogated by us.15. The TerraSAR-X data\u000a      proved the most valuable and within 3 days of the explosion we were able\u000a      to provide MVO with clear evidence that the explosion had produced a new\u000a      vent but that this vent had not destabilised the dome as had been feared.\u000a      MVO reported this to the civil authorities on Montserrat and the\u000a      evacuation was revoked. It took another 10 days before the cloud lifted\u000a      sufficiently to confirm radar observations. This early \"all-clear\" was\u000a      welcomed by the evacuated inhabitants and boosted confidence in the\u000a      technique and the public's confidence in MVO. It also demonstrated the\u000a      UK's continued commitment to international disaster response and in\u000a      particular the application of space technology to this domain. It was\u000a      always the intention of this work to effectively transfer the technology\u000a      to MVO. As of 2011 both the space-borne and the ground-based radar\u000a      techniques are a routine part of MVO operations. No event has yet tested\u000a      the eruption early- warning capability but the deployment of a permanent,\u000a      operational instrument on Montserrat shows that the system provides a\u000a      capability for more advanced and timely warnings than was available during\u000a      the last major eruption in 2010.\u000a    The main beneficiaries of the impact are the people and the businesses of\u000a      Montserrat. In 2008 the government's Disaster Management Coordination\u000a      Agency (DMCA) deployed a radio-based early warning system to disseminate\u000a      information on the risk posed by the volcano to everybody in the areas at\u000a      risk.11 The island's population is estimated to be just over\u000a      5000 and is now growing by about 400 p.a. but has yet to recover to the\u000a      over 12000 estimated before the 1995 eruption.12 Prior to\u000a      then, the island had an export economy based on agriculture, clothing,\u000a      electronic parts, tourism, building sand and plants, with a GDP of &#163;30m.\u000a      After the eruption GDP is now at about &#163;15m and the DFID support for\u000a      2012\/3 was &#163;15m, which finances roughly half of all expenditure.12\u000a      It is very difficult to put a figure on the monetary impact of our\u000a      research because there has been no official audit of the impact of the\u000a      eruption from the Government of Montserrat and our work is, rightly, bound\u000a      up in the operations of MVO. The economic benefits in avoiding false\u000a      alarms and in the ability to generate earlier safe all-clears are\u000a      considerable as evacuations cause relocation costs and emergency\u000a      provisions costs and the commercial activities in affected areas to cease.\u000a      Since 1997 there have been no deaths due to the volcano. The constant\u000a      effort at MVO to forecast impending hazards and judge local risks has been\u000a      helped by our work both to avoid tragedies and engender justified\u000a      confidence in public safety. As noted in a report10 financed by\u000a      the European Commission (EuropeAid Cooperation Office) \"The Montserrat\u000a      Volcano Observatory provides the Government with an organisation for\u000a      managing this [volcanic] environmental hazard, and ensuring the continuing\u000a      safety of the island's inhabitants.\" The importance of the volcano early\u000a      warning capability is stressed in the Montserrat Sustainable Development\u000a      Plan.16\u000a    Social science studies in relation to Montserrat show the advances in\u000a      monitoring and prediction have led to an improved quality of life for many\u000a      inhabitants, given they now have the knowledge that they will receive\u000a      reliable early warnings of a major eruption and will not be subject to\u000a      unnecessary evacuations: for example in 2004 57% of respondents felt that\u000a      \"the scientists have shown in the long-term that their advice has been\u000a      justified\".17 Most residents are relieved that the volcano is\u000a      monitored and MVO can initiate better warnings and there is better\u000a      acceptance of the need for forced evacuations. However, building the\u000a      required trust and a working co-operation between scientists, local\u000a      government and inhabitants has not been straightforward. There is now\u000a      considerable local awareness of the uncertainty inherent in the science\u000a      and appreciation that it helps avoid the unpopular decisions giving long,\u000a      and apparently unnecessary, evacuations before the new systems were in\u000a      place.18,19\u000a    The techniques we have developed have, to date, been mainly applied to\u000a      Montserrat. However, their use is now being extended to Latin America and\u000a      Papua New Guinea. We have run workshops to explain our techniques in Costa\u000a      Rica (October 2012), Ecuador and Colombia (June 2013). In these cases, the\u000a      impact on local inhabitants and commerce is yet to occur; however, the\u000a      existence and proven capabilities of the techniques developed by the Unit\u000a      are beginning to have an impact on local policy and planning in each case,\u000a      as knowledge of them and their potential application is spread.\u000a    Background information:\u000a      7.

As part of this we have helped pioneer the practice of using\u000a      radars (on the ground and in space) to monitor the state of active\u000a      volcanoes, particularly those that are frequently obscured by cloud. The\u000a      ground-based radars were developed in collaboration with the University of\u000a      St Andrews (UoSA) and Lancaster University (LU) and the space-based radar\u000a      techniques with DLR (German Aerospace Center), Astrium (Europe's largest\u000a      space company) and ESA (European Space Agency). Prof. G. Wadge has been\u000a      with the Unit from 1985 to the present day. Wadge led the work at UoR with\u000a      contributions from PhD students H. Odbert (2004-8) and A. Toombs (2007-11)\u000a      (supervised by Wadge) and technical staff in the Unit.\u000a    The research comprised two complementary strands.\u000a    1. A ground-based millimetre-wave radar\/radiometer, the All-weather\u000a      Volcano Topography Imaging Sensor (AVTIS) was proposed, built, tested and\u000a      deployed in a ten-year programme that began in 2000. This was funded by a\u000a      series of grants from NERC with Wadge as PI. AVTIS was specifically\u000a      designed for lava dome volcanoes such as the Soufri&#232;re Hills Volcano on\u000a      Montserrat. In conjunction with MVO, we demonstrated that AVTIS provided\u000a      data on the topography and temperature of the growing lava dome\u000a      independent of weather conditions, and provided changing hazard\u000a      information on timescales of hours to weeks.3,4,5 A second\u000a      generation of fixed and roving ground-based versions of AVTIS, was also\u000a      conceived, built, installed and tested by the Unit, in conjunction with\u000a      MVO. By 2011, a fixed AVTIS instrument provided continuous, 24-hour data\u000a      from the volcano and has been used operationally by MVO since. AVTIS is\u000a      the only such instrument in operation worldwide.\u000a    2. The application of space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for\u000a      volcano monitoring was developed over the last two decades. The Unit\u000a      played a significant role in this by helping to apply radar interferometry\u000a      to measure subtle ground motions on volcanoes (including the first mobile\u000a      ground-receiving station on Montserrat in 2000) and in using radar\u000a      intensity changes to monitor the emplacement of pyroclastic flows\u000a      (high-speed flows of hot ash, rock fragments and gas) and lava flows. In\u000a      the early 2000's Wadge helped design satellite missions in conjunction\u000a      with ESA and Astrium specifically for volcano monitoring. The Unit has\u000a      pioneered the use on volcanoes of very high resolution radar intensity\u000a      data from the TerraSAR-X satellite and in 2009-10 demonstrated for the\u000a      case of Montserrat how the location of explosive vents and recently\u000a      emplaced pyroclastic flows can be readily tracked in inaccessible and\u000a      cloud-covered areas 1,5, and in 2010-11 how the motion of lava\u000a      flows in Papua New Guinea could be tracked. 6 The high spatial\u000a      resolution and temporal frequency of these new datasets opens up a\u000a      valuable source of information on the dynamics of on- going explosive and\u000a      effusive volcanic activity that is of direct operational value to\u000a      observatory scientists responsible for making hazard forecasts.\u000a    March-April 2006 provided a valuable demonstration of the value of the\u000a      radar measurements. AVTIS measurements of the lava dome showed that an\u000a      increase in the rate of lava extrusion was occurring 4. This\u000a      was not detected by other MVO instruments until two days later. Thus AVTIS\u000a      effectively provided a 2-day improvement in early warning of an increased\u000a      level of hazard. This additional warning has been an important gain in\u000a      terms of planning emergency procedures.\u000a    1. Wadge, G.

The International Convention on Long-Range\u000d\u000a        Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) is revising Annex IX of the Gothenburg\u000a        Protocol to further reduce the ammonia emissions from land-based\u000d\u000a      activities; Annex I of the International Convention for the Protection\u000d\u000a        of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR)\u000d\u000a      requires the prevention and elimination of coastal water pollution from\u000d\u000a      land-based sources; the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD)\u000d\u000a      requires nutrient fluxes to be controlled to support good ecological\u000d\u000a      status in all EU waters, while the EU Urban Wastewaters Treatment\u000d\u000a        Directive (UWwTD) requires the removal of P from discharges from\u000d\u000a      major wastewater treatment works across the EU-27. The cost implications\u000d\u000a      of delivering these improvements in water quality are significant.\u000d\u000a      Compliance with UWwTD in the UK alone has been estimated to have cost\u000d\u000a      &#8364;350m.10 The EU WFD is the single biggest piece of\u000d\u000a      environmental legislation to be implemented worldwide: costs will be\u000d\u000a      considerably greater than for compliance with the UWwTD.\u000d\u000a    To meet these regulatory obligations, government policymakers and water\u000d\u000a      managers need information on the scale of the problem, the sources of\u000d\u000a      nutrients and the likely effectiveness of intervention measures. Routine\u000d\u000a      water quality monitoring provides some information, but not on the total\u000d\u000a      nutrient flux, its sources in complex catchments, the pathways that\u000d\u000a      nutrient fluxes follow from land to water, and how effective different\u000d\u000a      management strategies might be in reducing the rates, timing and impacts\u000d\u000a      of this flux. This knowledge, essential for the development of effective\u000d\u000a      policy and management, can only be provided through the combined use of\u000d\u000a      robust field observations and numerical simulation models, tailored to\u000d\u000a      meet stakeholder needs. Delivery of these tools and advice, underpinned by\u000d\u000a      an holistic understanding of the science, is imperative to ensure that\u000d\u000a      Defra, EA and the other competent authorities in the UK (and comparable\u000d\u000a      authorities internationally) are able to meet their statutory\u000d\u000a      responsibilities in the areas of water, food and energy security, in the\u000d\u000a      wider context of societal needs, government policy and international\u000d\u000a      agreements.\u000d\u000a    The Unit's contribution and impact\u000d\u000a      The Unit has directly addressed policymaker and management requirements\u000d\u000a      for robust scientific evidence and management tools. The research has\u000d\u000a      identified key drivers of nutrient fluxes, and helped characterise the\u000d\u000a      magnitude and key sources of these fluxes within complex systems, and\u000d\u000a      clarified both the scale of the management challenge and the sectors which\u000d\u000a      might be most effectively targeted through specific management\u000d\u000a      interventions. Defra, the Environment Agency and the statutory\u000d\u000a      conservation and management agencies have used our research findings to\u000d\u000a      develop and test measures to control nutrient and sediment pollution,\u000d\u000a      support reporting on UK discharges of nutrient pollution to the North Sea\u000d\u000a      (www.ospar.org) and to develop the UK\u000d\u000a      national nitrogen budget submitted to the Task Force for Reactive Nitrogen\u000d\u000a      under the UNECE CLRTAP (www.clrtap.org).\u000d\u000a    Evidence of impact in the period 2008-2013\u000d\u000a      In testimonial evidence, Defra11 state that the Unit's \"modelling\u000a        effort has provided part of the evidence base that has helped Defra\u000d\u000a        develop and deliver policy on managing water pollution\" and that it\u000d\u000a      \"addresses questions that are of fundamental importance to our\u000d\u000a        prospects of meeting Water Framework Directive targets\". The\u000d\u000a      Environment Agency12 states that the work in the Unit has\u000d\u000a      delivered \"significant new understanding and evidence\" which has\u000d\u000a      informed its understanding of the dynamics of nitrogen and phosphorus\u000d\u000a      species. Our science research and modelling tools have both been directly\u000d\u000a      used by the EA to support the design and implementation of monitoring and\u000d\u000a      mitigation programmes under the EA- and Defra- funded Catchment\u000d\u000a        Sensitive Farming and Demonstration Test Catchments programmes and\u000d\u000a      the development of river basin management plans in Ireland13.\u000d\u000a      The modelling tools that we have developed for the end-user community have\u000d\u000a      been based on robust scientific evidence, and tailored to meet specific\u000d\u000a      evidence and policy needs, so their use has been considerable and\u000d\u000a      significant. For example, the export coefficient modelling approach\u000d\u000a      (originally developed by the Unit as a national-scale tool in the 1998\u000d\u000a      Environment Agency's Lake Classification and Monitoring programme)\u000d\u000a      was used by the Environment Agency in the period 2008-2013 to characterise\u000d\u000a      the baseline nutrient status of UK waters, and the extent to which they\u000d\u000a      are at risk of failing to achieve Good Ecological Status under the EU WFD.\u000d\u000a      It was also used to generate the UK N budget submitted to the Task\u000d\u000a        Force for Reactive Nitrogen, Expert Panel on Nitrogen Budgets of\u000d\u000a      UNECE (UN Economic Commission for Europe).14 and inform\u000d\u000a      renegotiation of Annex IX of the Gothenburg Protocol.\u000d\u000a    An Environment Agency15 report outlines the methods and\u000d\u000a      evidence used to identify waters which are, or may become, eutrophic. It\u000d\u000a      uses our research finding16 that nitrogen is a limiting factor\u000d\u000a      controlling the degree of eutrophication in standing waters that needs to\u000d\u000a      be assessed for all waters, and uses our work to identify appropriate\u000d\u000a      criteria to determine thresholds above which ecologically significant\u000d\u000a      elevated nitrogen loading occurs17. This evidence has also been\u000d\u000a      used in the work of the Task Force for Reactive N (further information in\u000d\u000a      http:\/\/www.clrtap-tfrn.org\/webfm_send\/284). A 2012 report by Natural\u000d\u000a      England18 on Ecosystem Services Indicators recommends that ``subject\u000a        to the availability of central funds, the contribution of habitat extent\u000d\u000a        to water quality should be established through application of a series\u000d\u000a        of nutrient export coefficients derived from the literature\", citing\u000d\u000a      our most recent publication on this approach.8 Five reports13,19,20,21,22\u000d\u000a      used the findings of a Commissioned Advice Note3 we prepared\u000d\u000a      for Defra to inform the development of integrated catchment management\u000d\u000a      strategies to reduce nutrient loading on waters in throughout the UK and\u000d\u000a      thereby comply with the EU WFD.\u000d\u000a    Results from the application of INCA with climate change scenarios,\u000d\u000a      undertaken under a series of EU-funded projects, have fed directly into\u000d\u000a      catchment-scale assessments by our research collaborators in Norway and\u000d\u000a      Finland on behalf of their national environmental management agencies.\u000d\u000a      INCA was also used by the Environment Agency in the development of the River\u000a        Basin Management Plan for the Thames River Basin District.23\u000d\u000a      This provided evidence that nutrients released from agriculture or from\u000d\u000a      sewage treatment works in the future could be less diluted, under a\u000d\u000a      changing climate, with the reduced flows and higher concentrations of\u000d\u000a      nutrients promoting algal growth and the dieback of important aquatic\u000d\u000a      plant species; the management plan therefore anticipates a deterioration\u000d\u000a      of water quality in the future.\u000d\u000a    Background Information\u000d\u000a    9.

The accumulation of these nutrients\u000d\u000a      in freshwaters, estuaries and the coastal zone has led to reductions in\u000d\u000a      biodiversity, the loss of ecosystem services, and compromised water\u000d\u000a      security. The UK is a signatory to a raft of international conventions and\u000d\u000a      policies which require reductions in the flux of nutrients from land to\u000d\u000a      the water and restoration of ecosystem health and services. To meet these\u000d\u000a      obligations, policymakers need information on the scale of the problem,\u000d\u000a      the sources of nutrients and the effectiveness of intervention measures.\u000d\u000a    Research in the Unit has directly addressed this need.

Since\u000d\u000a      1995, it has received over &#163;4.8m in funding from NERC (&#163;1.2m), the EU\u000d\u000a      (&#163;1.28m), Government departments and agencies (Defra, &#163;1.57m; EA, &#163;0.48m)\u000d\u000a      as well as the water (&#163;0.16m), and energy industries (&#163;0.2m).

This involved the development of\u000d\u000a      numerical simulation models to predict nutrient and sediment fluxes, and\u000d\u000a      hence water quality, at field to catchment scales, and showed that the\u000d\u000a      models were most effectively developed and calibrated when confronted with\u000d\u000a      high frequency (daily or sub-daily) observations at multiple field\u000d\u000a      stations. This research demonstrated that nutrient flux behaviours varied\u000d\u000a      from year to year, depending on inter-annual climate variability. The\u000d\u000a      behaviour also varied between catchments of different geological and\u000d\u000a      climatic character, and between sites within catchments depending on the\u000d\u000a      distribution and connectivity of the key source areas in the catchment\u000d\u000a      upstream from each sampling point. Our research also demonstrated the\u000d\u000a      importance of both biotic controls and abiotic controls on the rate and\u000d\u000a      timing of nutrient flux within catchments, the importance of organic and\u000d\u000a      particulate nutrient fractions as components of the total nutrient load\u000d\u000a      transported to inland and coastal waters, and the importance of instream\u000d\u000a      processes in regulating the timing, chemical character and ecosystem\u000d\u000a      impacts of nutrient flux from source to sea.\u000d\u000a    Several modelling tools were developed by the Unit based on this\u000d\u000a      research. These include the National Export Coefficient Modelling\u000d\u000a        Framework and the Integrated Catchment Model (INCA). The\u000d\u000a      former1,2,3,4,8 simulates the total nitrogen (N) and phosphorus\u000d\u000a      (P) load delivered annually to any water body as the sum of the exports\u000d\u000a      from all contributing sources in the catchment. It has been calibrated\u000d\u000a      against observed data in over 75 catchments, and provides a robust and\u000d\u000a      reliable approach both for quantifying the relative contribution of\u000d\u000a      different sources in the catchment, and assessing the likely effects of\u000d\u000a      mitigation measures through scenario testing. The model is highly cited in\u000d\u000a      both academic (&gt;1500 total citations in Web of Science, WoS, searched\u000d\u000a      October 2013) and stakeholder literature (Section 5). In one recent\u000d\u000a      example of application of the model,8 it was demonstrated that\u000d\u000a      a strategy for reducing the delivery of P from agricultural sources would\u000d\u000a      have only a limited effect on P loadings in reservoirs in southern\u000d\u000a      Portugal, and policy should therefore first focus on reducing the P\u000d\u000a      loading from sewage effluent discharge. In a series of applications at\u000d\u000a      catchment to national scale the model indicated the dominance of animal\u000d\u000a      agriculture in the delivery of both N and P to UK inland and coastal\u000d\u000a      waters in the wetter west of the UK, particularly in rural catchments, the\u000d\u000a      importance of N flux to waters from fertiliser applications to crops and\u000d\u000a      grass in the drier eastern catchments of East Anglia and the Wolds, and\u000d\u000a      the importance of effluent from sewage treatment works in the delivery of\u000d\u000a      P to coastal waters in highly urbanised catchments and downstream from\u000d\u000a      major cities.3,4 INCA5,6,7 is a more complex model,\u000d\u000a      providing a daily simulation of the flux of a number of N species and P\u000d\u000a      fractions at catchment scale. It also simulates carbon as well as nitrogen\u000d\u000a      and phosphorus flux, and has recently been adapted to simulate mercury and\u000d\u000a      sediment flux in applications in the UK and more widely in Boreal and\u000d\u000a      upland areas of Europe. It has been calibrated in over 40 UK and European\u000d\u000a      catchments, and is also highly cited in the academic literature (over 800\u000d\u000a      WoS citations in total).\u000d\u000a    Through targeted investment by the stakeholders, totalling over &#163;3.6m\u000d\u000a      (and more recently in the NERC Environmental Virtual Observatory and\u000d\u000a      Macronutrient Cycles programmes), we have refined these models to meet a\u000d\u000a      wide variety of stakeholder requirements. We have developed cloud\u000d\u000a      computing-enabled frameworks to allow the models to be up-scaled from the\u000d\u000a      field to the national scale, and from data-rich to data-poor regions,\u000d\u000a      providing a platform for the estimation of nutrient flux to any inland or\u000d\u000a      coastal water body in the UK, from daily to annual time steps, for any\u000d\u000a      year for which input data are available, and tailored to a wide range of\u000d\u000a      scenario testing needs.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"37310","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The United Kingdom is a signatory to the United Nations Framework\u000d\u000a      Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which commits countries to reduce\u000d\u000a      greenhouse gas emissions in order to avoid dangerous human interference\u000d\u000a      with the climate. As part of this commitment, the UK adopted the Climate\u000d\u000a      Change Act in 2008 which requires the government to set and meet targets\u000d\u000a      for the emissions of greenhouse gases. Research in the Unit has had a\u000d\u000a      direct impact by: (i) providing the scientific basis for the reduction in\u000d\u000a      emissions needed to meet the UK government's target temperature increase\u000d\u000a      of 2f0b0C above pre-industrial levels, and (ii) providing policy-relevant\u000d\u000a      information to the UK's negotiators at international climate policy\u000d\u000a      conferences. As detailed below, this has been based on underpinning\u000d\u000a      scientific research conducted at the Unit, together with research\u000d\u000a      specifically commissioned by DECC and the Committee on Climate Change\u000d\u000a      (CCC).\u000d\u000a    The first task of the CCC, set up in the 2008 Climate Change Act14,\u000d\u000a      was to propose a target reduction in emissions for the UK. The CCC first\u000d\u000a      selected a `climate target': UK policy should seek to achieve a 50:50\u000d\u000a      chance of keeping the rise in global mean surface temperature below 20C\u000d\u000a      above pre-industrial levels, with only a small chance of an increase above\u000d\u000a      40C. It commissioned the Unit (through Lowe) to identify and\u000d\u000a      assess emissions trajectories which would meet this target. Lowe used an\u000d\u000a      energy balance model with systematically-varying emissions scenarios to\u000d\u000a      conclude that global emissions needed to be reduced by 50% by 2050\u000d\u000a      (relative to 1990) in order to achieve the specified climate target15.\u000d\u000a      The CCC translated this to a UK target of an 80% reduction in emissions 16-17,\u000d\u000a      taking into account historical responsibilities and equity considerations.\u000d\u000a      This target is legally-binding, and informs the setting of successive\u000d\u000a      5-year carbon budgets. The Climate Change Act has become the focus of\u000d\u000a      political debate about its relative costs and benefits over a range of\u000d\u000a      timescales. It influences every inhabitant of the UK and, by leading by\u000d\u000a      example, has the power to have great influence internationally. The CCC's\u000d\u000a      advice on carbon budgets and targets is directly reflected in legislation\u000d\u000a      and the Government's carbon strategy18.\u000d\u000a    The UK government plays a key role in international negotiations over\u000d\u000a      climate policy through the UNFCCC19. These negotiations\u000d\u000a      consider both the targets for climate policy and mechanisms for achieving\u000d\u000a      these targets. The focus of current negotiations is around a replacement\u000d\u000a      for the Kyoto Protocol adopted in 1997, with a target agreed in the 2009\u000d\u000a      Copenhagen Accord20 of keeping the increase in global mean\u000d\u000a      surface temperature to 2oC above pre-industrial levels. The\u000d\u000a      Unit has provided information and evidence to the UK government to support\u000d\u000a      its international negotiations. This has largely been through the AVOID\u000d\u000a      project, awarded by DECC in 2008 through open competition to a consortium\u000d\u000a      led by the Met Office (Lowe was principal scientist) and including the\u000d\u000a      Walker Institute at the University of Reading. The initial AVOID contract\u000d\u000a      had a value of &#163;800k, and additional funds were subsequently awarded to\u000d\u000a      project partners for additional work requested by DECC and Defra. AVOID\u000d\u000a      built explicitly on work in the Unit on the relationship between emissions\u000d\u000a      and temperature changes (Lowe) and on the global-scale impacts of climate\u000d\u000a      change (Arnell). The AVOID project actively sought engagement with\u000d\u000a      stakeholders (largely in DECC and Defra), and presented results not only\u000d\u000a      directly to DECC but also publicly through newsletters, factsheets and\u000d\u000a      presentations at climate negotiation conferences. The research undertaken\u000d\u000a      at the Unit13,5 demonstrated the likelihoods of achieving\u000d\u000a      climate targets with different emissions pathways, and showed the benefits\u000d\u000a      of achieving these targets in terms of impacts avoided (with a particular\u000d\u000a      focus on water availability, river flooding, crop productivity and the\u000d\u000a      energy requirements for heating and cooling). The research demonstrated\u000d\u000a      how reducing emissions will give extra time to install buildings,\u000d\u000a      transport systems and agricultural practices that are more resilient to\u000d\u000a      climate change.\u000d\u000a    Of the AVOID programme as a whole, the Minister for Energy and Climate\u000d\u000a      Change said in 2013 22 \"This has been a unique\u000d\u000a        multi-disciplinary research programme ..... it has been an impressive\u000d\u000a        demonstration of successful collaboration between academia and\u000d\u000a        Government. And it has had concrete outcomes. For example, materially\u000d\u000a        supporting the UK's international engagement and informing our\u000d\u000a        negotiating position at Copenhagen and beyond; Contributing to the UN's\u000d\u000a        Environmental Programme with robust, credible and timely research; and\u000d\u000a        supporting the setting of our carbon budgets\". A formal review of\u000d\u000a      the AVOID programme in 2012 by Risk Solutions23 concluded that\u000d\u000a      \"The AVOID programme is delivering interesting and useful, policy\u000d\u000a        relevant work. It helped frame the UK's position going into the\u000d\u000a        Copenhagen COP and supported work internationally including work by the\u000d\u000a        European Union and United Nations Environment Programme. It has helped\u000d\u000a        inform policy making across government, for example the Committee on\u000d\u000a        Climate Change has used outputs from AVOID to help inform its work on\u000d\u000a        long term (2050) targets for the UK\". With reference to the\u000d\u000a      particular work of the Unit on estimating the impacts avoided by climate\u000d\u000a      policy13, the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change\u000d\u000a      said24 \"We can avoid many of the worst impacts of climate\u000d\u000a        change if we work hard together to keep global emissions down. This\u000d\u000a        research helps us quantify the benefits of limiting temperature rise to\u000d\u000a        2f0b0C and underlines why it's vital we stick with the UN climate change\u000d\u000a        negotiations and secure a global legally binding deal by 2015\".\u000d\u000a    The research has not only been used by the UK government to inform\u000d\u000a      target-setting, but is also contributing directly to international\u000d\u000a      discussions.27 For example, Lowe was an author of a report\u000d\u000a      produced in 2010 by the EU Climate Change Expert Group Science,\u000d\u000a      completed under the Belgian EU presidency and presented at the climate\u000d\u000a      negotiation conference in Cancun in 201025; the aim of the\u000d\u000a      report was to inform delegates of the latest scientific evidence on the\u000d\u000a      chances of achieving the 2oC target specified in the Copenhagen\u000d\u000a      Accord. Lowe also made a presentation on the results of the Unit's\u000d\u000a      research to the first meeting in 2013 of the \"Structured Expert Dialogue\"\u000d\u000a      on the UNFCCC's 2013-2015 review of the 20C target (the \"Long\u000d\u000a      Term Global Goal\").26\u000d\u000a    Background information\u000d\u000a    14.

He has been with the\u000d\u000a      Unit between 2003 and the present day and the work cited here was with\u000d\u000a      Unit PDRA and subsequently MetOffice@Reading researcher Dr L. Gohar. In\u000d\u000a      that time, he has led research to set up and use numerical models\u000d\u000a      specifically to evaluate the effect of different scenarios for the future\u000d\u000a      emission of greenhouse gases on global and regional climate over the 21st\u000d\u000a      century (Lowe et al. 2009)8, (see also Allen et al., 20091;\u000d\u000a      Jones et al., 20102; Huntingford et al., 20123; and\u000d\u000a      Parry et al., 20094). These models have included both large\u000d\u000a      global climate models and simpler energy balance models. The global\u000d\u000a      climate models simulate the evolution of weather over space and time, and\u000d\u000a      can represent non-linearities in the global and regional response to\u000d\u000a      increasing forcing from greenhouse gases. However, they require\u000d\u000a      considerable computational resources and so can be run only for a small\u000d\u000a      number of potential future emissions scenarios. The simpler energy balance\u000d\u000a      models can be run for many more emissions scenarios, but only simulate\u000d\u000a      global mean surface temperature and global mean sea level rise due to the\u000d\u000a      thermal expansion of sea water. A comprehensive assessment of the effects\u000d\u000a      of different future emissions requires the co-ordinated use of both types\u000d\u000a      of model. There are, of course, a large number of possible future\u000d\u000a      scenarios for the future emission of greenhouse gases. Lowe developed a\u000d\u000a      framework for characterising generic emissions scenarios (based on rate of\u000d\u000a      rise, time of peak and lowest value to which emissions decline) and\u000d\u000a      assessing systematically their implications for global temperature rise\u000d\u000a      targets. The research has been undertaken with partners from CEH\u000d\u000a      Wallingford and the University of Oxford, with funding from NERC, Defra\u000d\u000a      (Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs), the Committee on\u000d\u000a      Climate Change, DECC and the Ministry of Defence as part of the Hadley\u000d\u000a      Centre Integrated Climate Programme. Since 2009, the research has also\u000d\u000a      been funded by DECC through the AVOID programme (http:\/\/www.metoffice.gov.uk\/avoid\/),\u000a      which is designed to provide science-based policy-relevant evidence on\u000d\u000a      climate change and its consequences to DECC. J. Lowe led the successful\u000d\u000a      proposal to DECC, and was subsequently made the AVOID programme's\u000d\u000a      Principal Scientist.\u000d\u000a    The second strand of research was led by the Unit's Prof Nigel Arnell\u000d\u000a      (since 2007), with PDRAs Simon Gosling (2008-2011) and Ben Lloyd-Hughes\u000d\u000a      (since 2008) and NERC Knowledge Exchange fellow Tom Osborne (with the Unit\u000d\u000a      since 2003). Other inputs have been made by the Unit's Prof K. Haines with\u000d\u000a      assistance from the Unit's IT staff. The work has involved the development\u000d\u000a      and use of global-scale models to estimate the impacts of climate change,\u000d\u000a      methods of constructing climate scenarios that can be used by these impact\u000d\u000a      models, and the estimation of the impacts of climate change under a\u000d\u000a      variety of assumptions about future emissions. The programme concentrated\u000d\u000a      on hydrological impacts (water resources and floods)6,7,9 and\u000d\u000a      agricultural impacts (crop productivity10). This work was\u000d\u000a      stimulated partly by the desire back in 1997 of the (then) Department of\u000d\u000a      the Environment to understand the socio-economic impacts of change\u000d\u000a      scenarios based on Met Office climate models. Since 2007 this research has\u000d\u000a      been funded by a NERC consortium grant (QUEST-GSI) led by Arnell and by\u000d\u000a      the DECC AVOID programme. Both have involved partners (led by Arnell) from\u000d\u000a      the universities of Southampton, Aberdeen and East Anglia, CEH\u000d\u000a      Wallingford, and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impacts Research in\u000d\u000a      Germany. The work at UoR extended and exploited a hydrological model\u000d\u000a      initially developed by Arnell at Southampton University (before he became\u000d\u000a      director of the Unit's Walker Institute in August 2007) and developed the\u000d\u000a      methodological framework in which the model was subsequently applied.11\u000d\u000a      The research has demonstrated that the impacts of un-mitigated climate\u000d\u000a      change can be very substantial. Projected impacts vary around the globe,\u000d\u000a      and whilst there is broad agreement in the direction of change in many\u000d\u000a      regions, the magnitude of change is often highly uncertain because of\u000d\u000a      uncertainty in future rainfall patterns. For example, the paper by Gosling\u000d\u000a      et al.12 showed that in some regions (e.g. western Europe and\u000d\u000a      the Mediterranean) river flows are projected decrease and water scarcity\u000d\u000a      will therefore increase, but in other regions (e.g. south Asia and parts\u000d\u000a      of China) there is more uncertainty over the direction of change. Arnell\u000d\u000a      has also synthesised impacts of climate change across all the sectors\u000d\u000a      (water, agriculture, coasts, soils and energy), under different scenarios\u000d\u000a      for climate and socio-economic change13.\u000d\u000a    Background information: related publications by Unit staff\u000d\u000a    1.

In 1998, new analyses of their data on the biodiversity of maerl\u000d\u000a      beds in Britain and Ireland\u000d\u000a      were reported in a comprehensive synthesis for the UK Marine SACs LIFE\u000d\u000a      project.1This showed\u000d\u000a      that the biodiversity of seaweeds on maerl beds equalled that of shallow\u000d\u000a      Mediterranean algal\u000d\u000a      communities, the highest previously recorded in Europe.1Their\u000d\u000a      analysis highlighted two of the\u000d\u000a      most serious knowledge gaps concerning management of maerl: growth rates\u000d\u000a      and longevity1. In\u000d\u000a      2001- 2004, Maggs and PhD student Charmaine Blake used a novel vital\u000d\u000a      staining technique to\u000d\u000a      demonstrate slow growth rates (0.5-1.5 mm per annum) of P. calcareum\u000d\u000a      and L. corallioides in the\u000d\u000a      field and laboratory.2The results confirmed previous\u000d\u000a      speculation that commercial harvesting\u000d\u000a      cannot be sustainable and that maerl habitats are very vulnerable to\u000d\u000a      physical disturbance.2\u000d\u000a    Maggs, algal physiologist John Berges (who moved to the University of\u000d\u000a      Wisconsin Milwaukee in\u000d\u000a      2006) and students Blake and Sian Wilson found with PAM fluorometry that\u000d\u000a      maerl species are\u000d\u000a      highly sensitive to disturbance by burial, particularly by anoxic\u000d\u000a      sediments.3 Radiocarbon-dating of\u000d\u000a      dead maerl beds in Northern Ireland by Blake, in collaboration with Paula\u000d\u000a      Reimer (who leads\u000d\u000a      QUB's 14Chrono Centre), showed that catastrophic maerl bed\u000d\u000a      extirpation had occurred in\u000d\u000a      Strangford Lough during a period of rapid sedimentation associated with\u000d\u000a      climatic change 4200\u000d\u000a      years ago.4 In Belfast Lough a maerl bed had died\u000d\u000a      contemporaneously with extensive 19th\u000d\u000a      century channel dredging that re-mobilised toxic sediment. Combined with\u000d\u000a      our experimental\u000d\u000a      evidence that sedimentation kills maerl, we concluded that channel\u000d\u000a      dredging probably caused the\u000d\u000a      death of the Belfast Lough maerl bed4. These results accorded\u000d\u000a      with field observations in Scotland\u000d\u000a      by Jason Hall-Spencer on damage to maerl by sediment from scallop dredging\u000d\u000a      and aquaculture.\u000d\u000a    Maggs, marine ecologist Mark Johnson (who moved to NUI Galway in 2009)\u000d\u000a      and their research\u000d\u000a      group found that in Northern Ireland there was a suite of rare seaweeds\u000d\u000a      confined to maerl\u000d\u000a      habitats5. Experimental stabilization of maerl showed that\u000d\u000a      biodiversity of maerl beds is particularly\u000d\u000a      dependent on the nature and extent of adjacent habitats, requiring\u000d\u000a      conservation measures to take\u000d\u000a      the spatial context of beds into account6.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38455","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Our impact on legislation, designations, policy and practice\u000a    Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland: Our research on spread\u000a      rates, vectors and impacts of IAS in Ireland, and the need for a\u000a      cross-jurisdictional approach to controls (Sections 2, 3), had informed\u000a      ten key recommendations to the Governments of Northern Ireland (NI) and\u000a      the Republic of Ireland (RoI) in the 2004 Review of Invasive Species\u000a        in Ireland by Quercus.

From 2001, Maggs and lecturer Mark Johnson (who moved to NUI\u000a      Galway in 2009), with PhD student\/PDRA Fr&#233;d&#233;ric Mineur (funded by FP5\u000a      ALIENS, 2001-04; AXA Foundation 2009-12), analysed the relative importance\u000a      of different modes of spread of IAS in a pan-European study of invasive\u000a      algae5. These analyses showed a variety of spread patterns\u000a      related to different vectors and contributed to developing risk\u000a      assessments for existing and potential IAS, an important element of the Invasive\u000a        Species Ireland Project.\u000a    Freshwater aliens: Jaimie Dick (NERC Fellow 1993-96, then\u000a      lecturer), with Dirk Platvoet in Amsterdam and a group of QUB PDRAs and\u000a      PhD students, funded by NERC (partnered with University of Leeds\u000a      1999-2002; 2010-13), carried out field and laboratory studies and\u000a      mathematical modelling of the spread and impacts of IAS in freshwater\u000a      systems globally. Publications focused on amphipod crustaceans2,\u000a      highlighting their keystone roles in freshwaters and showing how IAS\u000a      significantly impact biodiversity. From 2008 onwards, Dick and European\u000a      co-workers developed new predictive methodologies, based on functional\u000a      response curves, which allow forecasting of the likely magnitude of\u000a      ecological impacts of key IAS, such as the Killer Shrimp Dikerogammarus\u000a        villosus. This is now rated one of the 100 most damaging IAS in\u000a      Europe (www.europe-aliens.org),\u000a      with the potential to affect the ecology of major rivers, canals, lakes\u000a      and some brackish habitats. From 2005, Provan and Maggs, with research\u000a      student Heather Love, used high-resolution molecular markers to evaluate\u000a      the importance of water-borne seeds in spreading the highly invasive\u000a      riverbank species Impatiens glandulifera (Himalayan Balsam)6.\u000a      Patterns of genetic diversity showed that downstream gene flow is very\u000a      significant, and led to our strategy of control measures implemented on\u000a      the scale of entire river catchments.\u000a    Biosecurity and stakeholder engagement: Research from 2003 to 2006\u000a      within Quercus (QUB's biodiversity consultancy unit), on decision-making\u000a      in IAS management in a cross-jurisdictional context, identified the\u000a      critical need for a cross-border engagement of stakeholders in risk\u000a      assessment, risk reduction and policy development4.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38456","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3077311","Name":"Czech Republic"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Our impact on legislation, designations, policy and practice: The\u000d\u000a      incorporation of our research outputs (Sections 2, 3) into policy\u000d\u000a      development and captive breeding of the critically endangered (IUCN Red\u000d\u000a      List) freshwater pearl mussel has benefitted this species and its habitat\u000d\u000a      locally, nationally and internationally.

Because natural populations are dominated\u000d\u000a      by ageing individuals, captive breeding is required to produce young\u000d\u000a      mussels for restocking rivers. In 1995, the research collaboration between\u000d\u000a      QUB and Ballinderry Fish Hatchery (funded through Department of the\u000d\u000a      Environment Northern Ireland and WWF)3 started using\u000d\u000a      techniques differing from the initial mussel cultivation attempts in the\u000d\u000a      Czech Republic and Germany. Elsewhere in Europe, and in similar programmes\u000d\u000a      for endangered freshwater mussels in the USA, mussels are harvested from\u000d\u000a      host fish and grown in cages.S8 Our method, developed\u000d\u000a      with the Ballinderry Fish Hatchery, releases fish carrying larval mussels\u000d\u000a      into semi-natural containers to grow on, which is less labour intensive,\u000d\u000a      hence cheaper and more practicable. S6\u000d\u000a    350 nine-year old captive-bred mussels were released between 2008 and\u000d\u000a      2009 into natural sediments in their natal Ballinderry River where the\u000d\u000a      remnant population consists of &lt;900 mussels. Each mussel was\u000d\u000a      individually PIT tagged and survival rates after three years were very\u000d\u000a      high (99% at some sites). This compares very favourably with survival\u000d\u000a      rates elsewhere of 0-20% after two years, summarized in Table 2 of McIvor\u000d\u000a      and Aldridge's 2008 report for CCW.S7 In 2009, the\u000d\u000a      Ballinderry Fish Hatchery Trust won an Association of Rivers Trusts\u000d\u000a      Contribution to Science Award for setting up Europe's first successful\u000d\u000a      freshwater pearl mussel breeding project, with our scientific input.

Large populations of mussels, which\u000d\u000a      can help maintain river water quality, have or will shortly become extinct\u000d\u000a      in parts of Europe and North America due to impacts such as pearl-fishing\u000d\u000a      and siltation from land drainage and run-off from agriculture and\u000d\u000a      forestry. The species is included in Annexes II and IV of the EC Habitats\u000d\u000a      Directive (92\/43\/EEC) and Appendix II of the Bern Convention. Failure of\u000d\u000a      EU member states to protect remaining populations risks their exposure to\u000d\u000a      large infraction fines. The freshwater pearl mussel has been described as\u000d\u000a      a flagship species because measures taken to ensure its survival have\u000d\u000a      broader environmental benefits.\u000d\u000a    QUB research: Research on the status and distribution of pearl\u000d\u000a      mussels in the mid to late 1990s evidenced their decline and predicted\u000d\u000a      extinction in the north of Ireland (Dai Roberts with research students Tim\u000d\u000a      Mackie and Colin Beasley).1,2 Populations in rivers that\u000d\u000a      historically supported hundreds of thousands of mussels had declined to\u000d\u000a      hundreds or a few thousand, dominated by older individuals, with little\u000d\u000a      evidence of recruitment. Our predictions of local extinctions, based on\u000d\u000a      life expectancies of the youngest individuals, have been reinforced by\u000d\u000a      recent research (Roberts and research student Conor Wilson 2007-2010)\u000d\u000a      modelling extinction trajectories for mussel populations in England,\u000d\u000a      Scotland, Wales and Ireland.4 Protection of wild populations of\u000d\u000a      pearl mussels is unlikely itself to lead to natural recovery. In Northern\u000d\u000a      Ireland (NI) both reproduction and habitat are compromised and sufficient\u000d\u000a      improvement is unlikely to occur before the predicted date of extinction.4\u000d\u000a    Research by Roberts and researcher Jane Preston on captive breeding of\u000d\u000a      pearl mussels was initiated in 1995, in collaboration with Alan Keys\u000d\u000a      (Ballinderry Fish Hatchery)3. Captive breeding is one of the\u000d\u000a      key approaches to the restoration of endangered species, often seen as the\u000d\u000a      method of last resort. Roberts and co-workers demonstrated that large\u000d\u000a      numbers of young mussels (3,600 in 1999; 19,000 in 2000) could be\u000d\u000a      successfully propagated from a relatively small broodstock under\u000d\u000a      semi-natural conditions3. The system involves infecting trout\u000d\u000a      with mussel larvae, so that larval mussels can complete the parasitic\u000d\u000a      stage of their life cycle in the hatchery, with less than 1% host fish\u000d\u000a      mortality. This pioneering method for cultivation of pearl mussels\u000d\u000a      represents a significant breakthrough in the conservation of this species,\u000d\u000a      intermediate between the release of infected fish into rivers and the\u000d\u000a      intensive cultivation systems developed in continental Europe and the USA\u000d\u000a      for other species of pearl mussels3. Genetic research (Roberts\u000d\u000a      and geneticist Jim Provan with their research groups) in 2007-10 found\u000d\u000a      differences between captive-bred juveniles, their parent broodstock, and\u000d\u000a      mussels from the source river, indicating a loss of genetic variability\u000d\u000a      probably due to founder effects6.

At present more\u000a      than 22,000 tons of HBCD\u000a      are used globally, with production taking place in the USA, Europe and\u000a      Asia (source 1, para 21).\u000a    The research findings from Harrad's group were significant sources of\u000a      evidence used in the risk\u000a      profile for HBCD drawn up for the Convention's POPs Review Committee and\u000a      made a distinct and\u000a      material contribution to the Convention's decision. Harrad's expertise on\u000a      HBCD was also utilised\u000a      in a report commissioned by Defra to consider the UK's stance when\u000a      regulation was under\u000a      consideration by the Convention.\u000a    Global regulation of HBCD\u000a    The UN Environment Programme's Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic\u000a      Pollutants has\u000a      179 parties (178 states and the EU), as at May 2013. Since the Convention\u000a      came into force in\u000a      2004, only 21 compounds have had their use either banned or tightly\u000a      restricted.\u000a    In June 2008, Norway initiated a proposal to add HBCD to this list of\u000a      globally-regulated\u000a      compounds. In order to be listed as a POP under the Convention, there must\u000a      be evidence of: (1)\u000a      potential for long-range transboundary atmospheric transport, (2) adverse\u000a      effects, (3) persistence,\u000a      and (4) bioaccumulation.\u000a    The Convention's POP Review Committee (POPRC) considered a draft risk\u000a      profile on HBCD at its\u000a      meeting in October 2010, which said that \"Based on the available evidence,\u000a      it is concluded that\u000a      HBCD is likely, as a result of long-range environmental transport, to lead\u000a      to significant adverse\u000a      environmental and \/ or human health effects, such that global action is\u000a      warranted.\" (source 1,\u000a      Executive Summary, para 7). Subsequently, at its October 2011 meeting, the\u000a      Committee\u000a      recommended that HBCD be listed under the Convention, with this confirmed\u000a      at a further meeting\u000a      on 19th October 2012.\u000a    As a consequence, the Conference of the Parties (the Convention's\u000a      governing body) at their 6th\u000a      meeting held from 28th April to 10th May 2013 in\u000a      Geneva, agreed to list HBCD under Annex A of the\u000a      Convention. This means that the production and use of HBCD will be banned\u000a      from 2014, with\u000a      some exceptions to 2018 for its use in building insulation (source 2).\u000a    Role of Birmingham research\u000a    Harrad's findings contributed to this process by providing information on\u000a      the magnitude and\u000a      pathways of human exposure to HBCD that contributed to the assessment of\u000a      potential adverse\u000a      human health effects. His substantial body of research has driven the\u000a      conclusion that dust is one of\u000a      the main sources of exposure (source 1, paras 6 and 31, and section\u000a      2.3.2), with six of his papers\u000a      cited in the risk profile.\u000a    Of particular value were Harrad's studies which revealed that children\u000a      ingest more HBCD than\u000a      adults. One of the authors of the risk profile, [text removed for\u000a      publication] of Fisheries and Oceans Canada, has\u000a      written to the University to confirm that \"Dr Harrad's studies showed,\u000a        unequivocally, that children\u000a        ingest more HBCD through this exposure route than adults and has raised\u000a        concerns that this could\u000a        contribute to developmental and neurotoxic effects in infants\".\u000a      [text removed for publication] highlighted Harrad's\u000a      findings during his plenary talk to the POP Review Committee in 2009 and\u000a      introduced the\u000a      committee to the idea that as an exposure route dust (as well as diet)\u000a      accounted for a significant\u000a      portion of the exposure to humans, especially infants (source 3).\u000a    The initial proposal to ban HBCD was made by the Norwegian Royal Ministry\u000a      of the Environment,\u000a      and further confirmation of the role played by the Birmingham research has\u000a      been provided by\u000a      \u0009 [text removed for publication], Chief Scientist of the Norwegian Institute\u000a      of Public Health. As well as\u000a      attesting to the contribution Harrad's work had made to knowledge\u000a      concerning human exposure,\u000a      Professor Becher confirmed the important role played by this research in\u000a      establishing the\u000a      persistence and bioaccumulative capacity of HBCD:\u000a    \"Doubts were raised by industry and others whether HBCD was persistent\u000a        as standardised\u000a        biodegradation tests in soil and sediments did not meet the half-life\u000a        screening criteria of the\u000a        Convention. This would also mean that the extent of exposure to HBCD for\u000a        biota and humans and\u000a        the resulting risks would be low.\u000a    Both [text removed for publication] and experts from Environment\u000a        Canada then evaluated the latest research\u000a        results on HBCD with the aim to demonstrate that HBCD fulfils all the\u000a        criteria of the Convention. In\u000a        this respect, the research of Stuart Harrad and his group was extremely\u000a        valuable. They\u000a        demonstrated clearly the abundance of HBCDs in abiotic samples of\u000a        sediments and the\u000a        bioaccumulative property of HBCD in fresh water fish providing evidence\u000a        of persistence and\u000a        potential for human exposure via fish consumption.\u000a    Further, Harrad's group has provided evidence for the occurrence of\u000a        HBCD in dust from various\u000a        indoor environments resulting from its use in building insulation,\u000a        textile coatings and plastics used\u000a        in electronic equipment. Through their work, it was recognised that\u000a        ingestion of dust can be an\u000a        important source of human exposure besides food. They produced evidence\u000a        that particularly young\u000a        children with their characteristic hand-to-mouth behaviour are at risk\u000a        for elevated exposures. These\u000a        new exposure scenarios made a significant contribution to the\u000a        elucidation of human exposure to\u000a        HBCD and possible health impacts for the risk profile on HBCD adopted by\u000a        the POPs Review\u000a        Committee in 2010. Based, among others, on this document, the Committee\u000a        has proposed for the\u000a        Conference of the Parties to list HBCD under the Stockholm Convention on\u000a        POPs\" (source 4).\u000a    Impact on UK policy and practice\u000a    In the UK, Defra has paid close attention to the implications of\u000a      international regulation of HBCD. In\u000a      2010, the Department commissioned AEA Technology to investigate this.\u000a      AEA's report (source 5 )\u000a      estimated that approximately 1000 tonnes of HBCD are used per year in the\u000a      UK, of this around\u000a      90% was used in the construction industry, with the balance used in the\u000a      textiles and electronics\u000a      industries (source 5 p.3).The report informed Defra's negotiating stance\u000a      in relation to the proposed\u000a      listing of HBCD under the Stockholm Convention.\u000a    Harrad contributed expertise on the environmental chemistry of HBCD for\u000a      the AEA report (source 5\u000a      section 1.5, page 11), and his findings on the degradation, aquatic\u000a      bioaccumulation, and human\u000a      exposure to HBCD, contributed substantially to the report's conclusions.\u000a      The main conclusion of\u000a      the report was that, whilst damage to human health has not been\u000a      demonstrated unambiguously,\u000a      there is clear evidence for human exposure, and HBCDs meet the Stockholm\u000a      criteria for\u000a      persistence and bioaccumulation and, hence, for international regulation.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    In May 2013 the UN Environment Programme's Stockholm Convention on\u000a      Persistent Organic\u000a      Pollutants agreed to ban the widely-used flame retardant\u000a      Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD),\u000a      following evidence that there may be harmful human exposure.

A particularly novel feature is the\u000a      team's focus on the role of\u000a      indoor contamination in driving this exposure. The team have also\u000a      exploited the chiral properties of\u000a      POPs to provide new insights into their sources, environmental fate and\u000a      behaviour.\u000a    One strand of this research has been the environmental fate and behaviour\u000a      of\u000a      hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), which is a flame retardant found in\u000a      domestic environments\u000a      through its use in building insulation, textile coatings and plastics used\u000a      in the computer industry.\u000a      Particular attention has been on the aquatic bioaccumulation of HBCD and\u000a      the magnitude and\u000a      pathways of human exposure. Central to this work has been the development\u000a      and application of\u000a      robust, state-of-the-art hyphenated chromatographic\/mass spectrometric\u000a      techniques to monitor\u000a      concentrations of the various HBCD isomers in a range of environmental\u000a      matrices.\u000a    The overarching aim of the research was to develop understanding of the\u000a      environmental\u000a      occurrence and fate of HBCD from its myriad sources in indoor environments\u000a      through the outdoor\u000a      environment and ultimately into biota and humans. The data produced were\u000a      designed to inform\u000a      evaluation of the environmental and human health risks of HBCD. The\u000a      research provided the first\u000a      measurements made anywhere in the world on concentrations of individual\u000a      HBCD isomers in\u000a      indoor dust (1,2) leading to the realisation that the ingestion of indoor\u000a      dust was an important\u000a      pathway of human exposure to HBCD. Moreover, exposure of young children\u000a      under some\u000a      scenarios was shown to exceed that of occupationally-exposed adults\u000a      working in factories handling\u000a      HBCD (1). The research also generated the first data on contamination of\u000a      school classrooms with\u000a      HBCD and related brominated flame retardants (3). Combined, these studies\u000a      played an important\u000a      role in highlighting the elevated exposure received by young children.\u000a      Moreover, the statistically\u000a      significant correlation between HBCDs in dust from individuals' homes and\u000a      in their blood (4) and\u000a      mathematical modelling of the external contributors to UK body burdens (5)\u000a      emphasised the\u000a      importance of this pathway for adults also.

Three projects in the\u000a      STW plans to which the UoB research materially contributed, the additional\u000a      supply involved, and the specific UoB contribution are summarised in Table\u000a      1. The cost of developing 1 Ml\/day of public groundwater supply is ~&#163;1-3M,\u000a      valuing these three projects at a total of &#163;30-90M [s2, s3].\u000a    The significance of the UoB contribution to these three initiatives has\u000a      been confirmed in writing to the University by MWH, who have said: \"The\u000a        University has had input into all of the above schemes [Resilience\u000a      Projects] with the University groundwater model, and more than 15 peer\u000a        review and MSc thesis publications being used throughout the feasibility\u000a        assessments\". For instance, as regards the new supply well in\u000a      Edgbaston, MWH said \"The capture zones and their sensitivity simulated\u000a        by the University were then directly used by MWH to quantify risks of\u000a        contamination, shortfalls in water volume (achieving 10 Ml\/d) and\u000a        adverse impacts of abstraction in determining the preferred site of the\u000a        new Edgbaston abstraction.\" [s1]. The UoB's 2010 modelling report\u000a      was an appendix to MWH's `Edgbaston Boreholes Feasibility Report' to STW\u000a      [s3]. This was directly used in support of STW's application to the EA to\u000a      drill, test pump and license the Edgbaston well.\u000a    Table 1: UoB contribution to STW's AMP5 and AMP6 plans [s3]\u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          Relevant Birmingham Resilience Projects in STW AMP\u000a            Plans\u000a          Additional supply\u000a          UoB contribution, confirmed in writing by\u000a            STW [s3]\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          1.

MWH\u000a      conclude that \"The University's direct numerical modelling involvement\u000a        was hence a pivotal contribution to developing the Edgbaston supply that\u000a        will enhance the resilience of supply to Birmingham giving much needed\u000a        flexibility.\" [s1].\u000a    Birmingham Resilience Projects: Solvent Constraints. Persistent\u000a      chlorinated solvent contamination may constrain public water supply\u000a      development from parts of the Birmingham aquifer {4}. [s1] \"MWH have\u000a        used the solvents data from Rivett's publications in all of the\u000a      [Resilience project] feasibility studies undertaken. ... The\u000a        provision of this information supported ... the assessment of solvent\u000a        contamination risks ... to the three possible Edgbaston supply\u000a        site options and significantly assisted in the prioritisation of the\u000a        abstraction site selection process. ... The ability to select\u000a        areas of the Birmingham Aquifer with the lowest risk of contamination\u000a        from historical land use records, and support that assessment with data\u000a        from local abstractions (both historical and recent) has been critical\u000a        in determining that some areas of the Birmingham aquifer will be viable\u000a        for supply with marginal treatment\". STW state that [s3]\u000a      \"The historic and recent data provided by Rivett is nowadays cost\u000a        prohibitive to obtain\", but confirm that \"choosing the best\u000a        design\/location for a supply well is of paramount importance as a poor\u000a        location may result in expensive and unforeseen water treatment costs...\u000a      or even well closure\".\u000a    Agency resource management: new Birmingham model development. UoB\u000a      collaboration with the EA to confirm the regional aquifer flow regime {4}\u000a      is recognised by the Agency to be important to them in [s4] \"assessing\u000a        new licence applications, understanding of SSSI impacts, ... other\u000a        environmental risks, eg insufficient groundwater baseflows to rivers,\u000a        groundwater flooding of infrastructure as well as providing vital recent\u000a        calibration data to our ongoing 2012-13 regional aquifer model\u000a        construction.\". The latter illustrates a particularly significant\u000a      impact of the UoB research. The new aquifer model facilitates the EA's\u000a      strategic water resource decision-making: in particular to deliver EU\u000a      Water Framework Directive requirements, to inform aquifer management\u000a      planning (&#163;400M\/y) and to progress the EA's Restoring Sustainable\u000a      Abstraction Project [s4].\u000a    The EA commissioned the groundwater consultants ESI in 2012-13 to build a\u000a      new Birmingham aquifer model (~&#163;100k) with Rivett (UoB) retained as\u000a      external peer reviewer [s4]. The EA project manager notes [s4] \"Dr\u000a        Rivett's contribution in relation to the understanding of urban recharge\u000a        processes, urban runoff removal, the geological framework and\u000a        interpretation and application of geochemical and information (sic)\u000a        has resulted in greater conceptual clarity. In this role his input has\u000a        been invaluable\". He notes [s4], citing 10 key UoB papers since\u000a      1994: \"The model construction has been heavily underpinned by research\u000a        work that the University has undertaken\", indicating that the ESI\u000a      Conceptual Model Report (2013) to the EA is \"dominated by citation of\u000a        the UoB research\", particularly remarking on the use of \"groundwater\u000a        quality and recharge estimations\" in developing the conceptual model\u000a      and updating the numerical model of the aquifer.\u000a    The EA found UoB's model for Birmingham to be \"an invaluable benchmark\u000a        to the new model development\" and add \"without the much improved\u000a        conceptual understanding of aquifer behaviour derived from this\u000a        background work, successful development of the new numerical model would\u000a        not have been possible.\" [s4].\u000a    ESI endorsed this and said that without the historical data from the\u000a      University's research \"the precision of the model would have been\u000a        compromised, significantly reducing the confidence with which it could\u000a        be used as a water management tool\" [s2].\u000a    As the EA state [s4], the \"modelling process has quantified water\u000a        resource availability, and has been used as the basis to update the\u000a        catchment abstraction management strategy for the aquifer.\" These\u000a      are core to future aquifer safeguarding.\u000a    Liverpool\/Manchester aquifer: During the 2008-2013 period,\u000a      the EA undertook a major review of the regional management of the\u000a      Liverpool \/ Manchester aquifer. This aquifer has faced issues similar to\u000a      Birmingham: it also faces threats from estuary water intrusion into the\u000a      aquifer and brine movement, both induced by abstraction. From before the\u000a      early 1990s, the aquifer was used extensively for research by the\u000a      Birmingham team (including 25 publications from 1993 onwards, e.g. {5 -\u000a      6}) in close collaboration with the EA (e.g. {6}), and this research\u000a      contributed significantly to the understanding of the flow and contaminant\u000a      movement in the region [s6, s7, s8].\u000a    Consultants ESI undertook the scoping study for the EA's regional review.\u000a      The University's previous groundwater models of the Liverpool \/ Manchester\u000a      aquifer were an important factor in ESI's recommendation that a major\u000a      groundwater modelling project should proceed, therefore supporting\u000a      investment of some &#163;200K of EA capital [s7]. Accordingly, the EA\u000a      commissioned a new groundwater flow model, to include testing against more\u000a      recent water level data and to take into account advances in understanding\u000a      resulting from intervening research work [s6]. ESI was again appointed,\u000a      with a steering group of staff from the EA, ESI, United Utilities Water\u000a      (UUW), and UoB. In developing the model, \"The research by Birmingham\u000a        University provided vital information and conceptual understanding of\u000a        how the aquifer behaves\" [s7] [s5, 6, 8, 9]: the regional water\u000a      company, UUW, state that \"The University of Birmingham's research has\u000a        been both substantial and vital to the development of the model, and\u000a        therefore ultimately to the protection of the groundwater resource. An\u000a        indication of this is that over 30 University of Birmingham publications\u000a        have been cited in the final report for Phase 1 of the project alone\"\u000a      [s8]. \"[T]hese models were used to develop abstraction management\u000a        procedures for the aquifer ... to ensure compliance with the Water\u000a        Framework Directive as well as informing the [EA's] response to a wide\u000a        range of land use activities that have the potential to cause aquifer\u000a        [and thereby surface water] contamination\" [s7]. For example, the\u000a      modelling work enabled policies to be changed to allow further abstraction\u000a      in the coastal part of the aquifer [s9, citing 16 publications, 8 from\u000a      UoB] and in a heavily industrialized part of Manchester [s6].\u000a    Modelling is also is vital for UUW planning: \"Long-term security of\u000a        supplies is essential, and we rely on numerical modelling of our\u000a        groundwater resources to plan developments and support the management of\u000a        the resource. In the case of the Liverpool \/ Manchester sandstones, we\u000a        have been involved actively in developing the current (2009) model on\u000a        which the [EA] bases its abstraction licensing policy. This model is\u000a        heavily dependent on the work of the [UoB] [which] has been of\u000a        considerable value to United Utilities Water\" [s8]. For more\u000a      specific studies, the model has also been used by ESI on behalf of UUW to\u000a      investigate likely climate change impacts and to \"assist the\u000a        development of three new boreholes drilled in 2012\/13\" [s8].\u000a    Value Estimates: The annual value of the current public\u000a      abstractions in the Liverpool \/ Manchester aquifer, based on UUW tariffs\u000a      and including probable leakages, is approximately &#163;120M\/year [s6]. ESI\u000a      estimate the replacement value of the resource to be between &#163;0.3 and\u000a      &#163;0.9bn [s7]. Using a similar basis, with potential Birmingham aquifer\u000a      resource data from [s2], the combined replacement value for the two\u000a      aquifers lies between &#163;0.4 and &#163;1.1 billion, with an annual value of\u000a      approximately &#163;140M.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Groundwater directly supplies around 30% of the UK's water demand, and\u000a      significantly more through discharges to rivers.

Such models require detailed conceptual\u000a      understanding of the flow and solute transport systems: they also require\u000a      extensive historic data sets to enable them to be tested. Groundwater\u000a      research at the University of Birmingham (UoB) concentrates on developing\u000a      a quantitative understanding of solute, dense non-aqueous phase liquid\u000a      (DNAPL), and particle movement through rock pore space and the concomitant\u000a      reaction processes affecting pollutant transport. This work has made\u000a      extensive use of the Birmingham and Liverpool\/ Manchester sandstone\u000a      aquifers as study areas, and in doing so has contributed very\u000a      significantly to the understanding of how these aquifers behave, thereby\u000a      accumulating expertise that has been used by the regulator and water\u000a      companies when developing groundwater flow models for these regions. Both\u000a      aquifers have been under-utilised in recent decades due to declining\u000a      industrial abstraction, leaving an attractive resource for water companies\u000a      and thus providing yet further impetus to our on-going research.\u000a    For Birmingham, virtually all aquifer investigation until\u000a      recently has been undertaken during research projects at UoB. Early work\u000a      included the development of the first regional flow model for Birmingham\u000a      (to investigate rising groundwater levels (CIRIA Rep. 92, 1993)) and the\u000a      development of recharge and urban chemical loading methods (the NERC\u000a      URGENT programme). Our water quality studies, 1980s to date, have focused\u000a      mainly on chlorinated solvents, transition metals, nitrate, nanoparticles,\u000a      viruses and hydrogeochemical controls (NERC, EU, Environment Agency [EA],\u000a      industry). Studies range from lab to field, notably including experiments\u000a      on our own campus boreholes, regional supply well studies and groundwater\u000a      baseflow discharge to surface water, with international-standard field\u000a      sites established in the city. Lab-, field-, and modelling- based UoB\u000a      studies have shown that future groundwater resource development is likely\u000a      to be constrained by persistent chlorinated solvents and nitrate, and\u000a      locally by metals and naturally occurring arsenic. Although urban\u000a      groundwater had effectively been written off in the UK (\"the\u000a      [Birmingham] aquifer has effectively been abandoned as a potable water\u000a        resource\" (Harris, 1998, Geol. Soc. Sp Pub128, 10)), our research\u000a      suggests with a multi-disciplinary knowledge based approach, valuable\u000a      groundwater resource is still salvageable. Combined, these studies have\u000a      resulted in Birmingham being one of the World's most researched urban\u000a      aquifers.\u000a    The Liverpool\/Manchester aquifer has also been the subject of\u000a      many UoB-led research projects that together provide a much fuller\u000a      understanding of the system as a whole. Project subjects include: regional\u000a      flow system controls; hydrochemistry; local scale solute transport\u000a      processes; regional scale solute transport modelling; and sub-regional\u000a      scale reactive transport modelling. Again, the understanding developed has\u000a      had a significant impact on how the aquifer is managed, as explained in\u000a      section 4.\u000a    Key UoB researchers are: Prof. J. H.

This will present\u000a        different challenges to each area, and local councils are free to decide\u000a        how best to address these\u000a        challenges and take advantage of any opportunities.\" [source 1]\u000a    Birmingham City Council, the largest local authority in the UK, have\u000a      worked in partnership with\u000a      UoB researchers in the BUCCANEER project and drawn extensively on their\u000a      research to inform\u000a      the City's approach to adapting to the increasing risk of extreme\u000a      temperatures posed by the\u000a      combination of urban heat and climate change. The adoption of the\u000a      BUCCANEER tool is clearly\u000a      demonstrated in the City's Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan, in its\u000a      planning framework and\u000a      in its emerging approach to identifying the effect of extreme temperatures\u000a      on its most vulnerable\u000a      residents (such as the elderly and people in poor health). The work has\u000a      achieved impact on public\u000a      policy through helping the City underpin its strategic direction on this\u000a      crucial issue and providing a\u000a      novel operational tool for use in spatial planning; there are further\u000a      health benefits from its adoption\u000a      by public health analysts in the City.\u000a    The partnership work between the Council and the UoB research team is\u000a      continuing with the\u000a      HiTemp project which is viewed by the Council, along with the ongoing NERC\u000a      CASE studentship,\u000a      as the means for informing the next stages of their work on climate change\u000a      adaptation.\u000a    BUCCANEER &#8212; a university \/ city council partnership\u000a      This partnership between the City Council and UoB was fostered through\u000a      Birmingham's Climate\u000a      Change Adaptation Partnership which was established in 2008. The\u000a      Partnership planned to\u000a      understand the risks to people and places from the UHI and climate change\u000a      but a lack of research\u000a      meant that only a blanket approach to understanding heat distribution\u000a      across Birmingham could be\u000a      used. In order to understand the local risks, a new tool was required\u000a      [sources 2 and 3].\u000a    UoB research delivered a tool that now enables the City Council to\u000a      conduct spatial risk\u000a      assessments. The BUCCANEER project established a new web-based planning\u000a      tool based on the\u000a      modelled UHI maps, and was first made available to the Council in 2011.\u000a      The tool is available at\u000a      http:\/\/www.birminghamclimate.com\/\u000a      for free public use by arrangement with the UoB team.\u000a    The tool enables mapping of Birmingham's UHI up to 2100, together with\u000a      transport, health, air\u000a      quality, housing, population and life expectancy, in order to help\u000a      identify vulnerability and risks for\u000a      people and places. It also contains a green infrastructure assessment\u000a      function and the ability to\u000a      export layers into Google Earth for 3D mapping as a communications tool.\u000a      The BUCCANEER tool\u000a      has been demonstrated to a wide range of council services and external\u000a      organisations, including\u000a      the Environment Agency, the NHS, Public Health England and Natural\u000a      England, and has been\u000a      widely welcomed.\u000a    The partnership work on this issue has won two major awards: (a) the\u000a      Local Authority Research\u000a      and Intelligence Association (LARIA) award in 2010 for ground-breaking GIS\u000a      risk mapping\u000a      research, and (b) a Lord Stafford Award for Innovation for Environmental\u000a      Sustainability in 2012.\u000a    BUCCANEER's contribution to Birmingham's Green Vision for an adapted\u000a        city\u000a      The overarching approach to mitigating and responding to climate change in\u000a      Birmingham has\u000a      formed a crucial aspect of the work its Green Commission [source 4] and\u000a      its subsequent Green\u000a      Living Spaces Plan (publication consultation draft issues December 2012;\u000a      adopted by City Council\u000a      September 2013) [source 5]. The novelty of the city's green vision is\u000a      stated explicitly: \"No other UK\u000a        city has undertaken such a comprehensive combined evaluation and mapping\u000a        exercise. This has\u000a        produced a totally new map series of the city ...[which are the] new\u000a        evidence bases that the city\u000a        must work with, in the near future with all its stakeholders, public,\u000a        private and citizens to collectively\u000a        address these leading green city challenges.\" Councillor James\u000a      MacKay, in [source 5]\u000a    The Green Living Spaces Plan links the issues of climate change, public\u000a      health and spatial\u000a      planning as a key ingredient of the city's future planning framework, and\u000a      informs other detailed\u000a      policies. Principle 1 in the plan is \"an adapted city\"; the case\u000a      study used in the Plan for this\u000a      principle is BUCCANEER. The Plan says the use of BUCCANEER means that \"for\u000a        the first time\u000a        decisions can be taken with consideration of the varying heat stress\u000a        across the City caused by the\u000a        urban heat island and the likely impacts of climate change up to 2100...\u000a        Thanks to BUCCANEER\u000a        and the follow-on studies Birmingham has become recognised by the EU as\u000a        a Peer City; and the\u000a        city is building an international reputation for its climate modelling\"\u000a      (p.13).\u000a    City Council planning policy and guidance\u000a      The use of the BUCCANEER tool was identified in the City Council's public\u000a      consultation on its\u000a      Core Strategy for sustainable growth [source 6], where its proposal on\u000a      adapting to climate change\u000a      said that their Development Management process would be used to ensure\u000a      that all new\u000a      developments requiring permission would include measures to reduce the\u000a      impact of extreme heat.\u000a      The document highlights the role of BUCCANEER as the principal means to\u000a      implement this\u000a      approach; the tool enables the identification of areas most vulnerable to\u000a      extreme heat and\u000a      demonstrates the impact of adaptation measures, as well as having the\u000a      potential to inform future\u000a      planning decisions (paras 5.38-5.40).\u000a    Subsequently, the Council issued its public consultation version of its\u000a      Detailed Supplementary\u000a      Planning Policy Guidance [source 7]; this is the guidance which all\u000a      developers need to consider\u000a      when submitting planning applications anywhere in the city. Section 3 of\u000a      this guidance focuses on\u000a      Green Infrastructure and Climate Change Adaptation, and sets out the\u000a      requirements on developers\u000a      to show, with evidence, that they have taken account of the Council's\u000a      policy on climate change\u000a      adaptation. It states: \"Birmingham's approach has been to use\u000a        Geographic Information System\u000a        (GIS) mapping (BUCCANEER Project) to understand the varying degree of\u000a        climate change impact\u000a        across the city on two key areas:\u000a    \u000a      Temperature and UHI\u000a      Flood risk\u000a    \u000a    Developers need to take into account this mapping to assess how\u000a        extreme weather and climate\u000a        impacts will vary depending on their site location.\"\u000a    The Council expects all new developments in the city to minimise\u000a      overheating and reduce the\u000a      reliance on air conditioning. Site layout and building design can help to\u000a      reduce the UHI effect\u000a      making developments more resilient to increased temperatures as a result\u000a      of climate change. This\u000a      Guidance was formally adopted by the City Council in September 2013.\u000a      [source 8]\u000a    BUCCANEER and planning for public health\u000a      As well as the spatial planning measures, Birmingham's Climate Change\u000a      Adaptation Partnership\u000a      has also been concerned with the public health implications of higher\u000a      temperatures in the city.\u000a      BUCCANEER is being used as one of the tools to identify which communities\u000a      are likely to need the\u000a      most help to adapt to the effects of climate change. Often in cities, much\u000a      of the most-deprived\u000a      population lives in densely-populated areas subject to UHI effects, with\u000a      consequent implications for\u000a      public health planning. The development of the tool helped demonstrate the\u000a      significance of this\u000a      issue to senior public health officials in the City (Public Health Lead |\u000a      Policy &amp; Regulation). The\u000a      practical value of data on temperature extremes is now being considered\u000a      when analysing issues\u000a      like the pattern of hospital admissions for lung conditions and asthma and\u000a      COPD (Chronic\u000a      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) in Birmingham. As well as assessing the\u000a      clinical aspects, they are\u000a      also looking to include the wider determinants and risk factors such as\u000a      air quality\/pollution and\u000a      climate\/temperature as provided by the BUCCANEER tool.\u000a    Wider use of BUCCANEER\u000a      There is also evidence that other organisations are using the BUCCANEER\u000a      tool. For instance, the\u000a      major energy company E.ON have confirmed that they used the BUCCANEER tool\u000a      when\u000a      assessing the potential for investing in a combined heat and power\u000a      solution for the new New Street\u000a      Station, and said that \"the tool clarified the primary long term need\u000a        for cooling as opposed to heat\u000a        and helped us better understand future demand profiles\". [source 9]\u000a    Birmingham Airport's Climate Change Adaptation Report (May 2011) says\u000a      that the Airport\u000a      Company have agreed to share information with the City Council to use\u000a      BUCCANEER, and notes\u000a      the potential advantage of having a far greater resolution (500m) than the\u000a      25km of the national\u000a      tool, known as UKCP09 [source 10, p.14].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Extreme heat events are likely to occur more frequently in a warmer\u000a      future climate. Cities\u000a      worldwide are concerned that the urban heat island effect will exacerbate\u000a      the impact of climate\u000a      change on urban populations and infrastructure. The UK government expects\u000a      local councils to play\u000a      a vital role in making sure the country is prepared for climate change.\u000a      Birmingham City Council,\u000a      the largest local authority in the UK, has worked in partnership with the\u000a      University of Birmingham\u000a      (UoB) in the BUCCANEER project (Birmingham Urban Climate Change\u000a        Adaptation with\u000a        Neighbourhood Estimates of Environmental Risk). The city has drawn\u000a      extensively on\u000a      BUCCANEER to design climate resilience into their city systems. The\u000a      project has had public policy\u000a      impact by informing the City's influential Green Commission and by being\u000a      included in the City\u000a      Council's new development Guidance &#8212; urban temperature change has\u000a        become a mandatory\u000a        factor to be considered for every new development requiring\u000a      permission in the city. The\u000a      guidance explicitly points developers towards BUCCANEER as the tool with\u000a      which to consider this\u000a      factor. A second public policy impact derives from the value of the tool\u000a      for health planning: a\u000a      significant proportion of the inner-city population is particularly\u000a      vulnerable to extreme temperatures\u000a      through age or ill-health and live where the heat island effect is shown\u000a      to be largest. This aspect is\u000a      now being increasingly employed by Public Health analysts and managers in\u000a      the city. As a result of\u000a      the city\/university partnership, Birmingham has been recognised by the\u000a      European Union as a Peer\u000a      City and source of best practice for urban climate resilience.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Environmental","Institution":"\u000a    University of Birmingham\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Birmingham (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Birmingham","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"West Midlands","UKPRN":10006840}],"Panel":"B         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    University of Birmingham staff are underlined.

The Meteorology and Climate Group (part of the\u000a      Environmental\u000a      Health Sciences theme) at the University of Birmingham (UoB) have carried\u000a      out extensive research\u000a      on this issue since around 2003. The research has embraced two areas:\u000a      urban\u000a      meteorological\/climate modelling and urban climate observation.\u000a    Urban meteorological\/climate modelling: Insight into the\u000a      land-surface processes over a conurbation\u000a      was gained initially through 3D meteorological modelling of the West\u000a      Midlands led by Dr. Cai\u000a      (Senior Lecturer) as part of a NERC-funded consortium project, PUMA, led\u000a      by Prof. Harrison\u000a      (references 3a, 3b and 3c). Further development of a state-of-the-art 3D\u000a      urban meteorological\u000a      model allowed careful investigation into the major characteristics of\u000a      London's UHI and its impact on\u000a      London's regional climate (3d). Contributing researchers were J. Salmond\u000a      (Lecturer, 2002 - 2006),\u000a      H. Thompson (doctoral student 2004 - 2008) and D. Grawe (National Centre\u000a      for Atmospheric\u000a      Science Fellow 2004-09). The work described in the case study is,\u000a      therefore, derived from\u000a      generalised results from different cities and can be applied to cities\u000a      other than Birmingham with the\u000a      appropriate data input.\u000a    These studies have underpinned the BUCCANEER project, which employed a\u000a      local-equilibrium\u000a      energy balance model and a statistical model. The energy balance model\u000a      used was the national-capability\u000a      JULES model, which is the land-surface scheme for UK global climate\u000a      modelling. The\u000a      BUCCANEER project has led to a NERC-funded CASE studentship focusing on\u000a      developing a\u000a      generic methodology of correcting the UHI pattern from a local-equilibrium\u000a      model by incorporating\u000a      the wind advection effect derived from a 3D meteorological model.\u000a    Urban climate observation: The on-going NERC-funded HiTemp\u000a      project (High Density\u000a      Temperature Measurements in the Urban Environment: NE\/I006915\/1) has\u000a      enabled the\u000a      establishment of the Birmingham Urban Climate Laboratory (BUCL). The\u000a      project is transforming\u000a      the city into a unique, world-class climate facility consisting of an\u000a      array of over 250 wi-fi air\u000a      temperature sensors nested within a coarser array of 30 weather stations\u000a      (uniqueness established\u000a      in critical review 3f). The fundamental issue of establishing a\u000a      standardised protocol for urban\u000a      meteorological networks (3e) underpins BUCL and, hence, BUCCANEER.

These\u000d\u000a      results were used to inform the design of measurements and analysis of\u000d\u000a      data from the DfT-funded TRAMAQ project, which led to the development of\u000d\u000a      the Pragmatic Mass Closure Model (Harrison et al., 2003) which was a\u000d\u000a      parsimonious empirical model which accounted very closely for the measured\u000d\u000a      mass of airborne particulate matter through measurement of a small suite\u000d\u000a      of chemical components.

The strategy also identified\u000a      the difficulties encountered by some users in accessing inland water and,\u000a      partly in response, the National Assembly for Wales Sustainability\u000a      Committee (2010) held an inquiry into access to inland waters in Wales\u000a      (5.6). The opening oral and written evidence was requested from UoB\u000a      researchers and was presented at the first public committee meeting. A key\u000a      outcome of the inquiry was that the Welsh Government decided not to\u000a      introduce legislation on access to inland water and to follow UoB's\u000a      negotiated voluntary approach, an approach supported by various\u000a      consultees, including the National Trust, the Country Land and Business\u000a      Association, the Countryside Alliance and the Angling Trust (5.5). The\u000a      research has also been used as contributing evidence in the 2013 Welsh\u000a      Government review of legislation on access and outdoor recreation, which\u000a      includes access to inland water (5.2).\u000a    Shaping waterway management in Europe: British Waterways (now the\u000a      Canal and Rivers Trust) was a leading stakeholder in the development of\u000a      the UoB's regional strategy for water recreation in the Midlands region.\u000a      Its officers worked with the UoB researchers to develop a conceptual\u000a      framework for harnessing the local social economy to underpin the\u000a      recreational development of waterways (5.7). This concept has since been\u000a      developed further by the UoB researchers, as part of the Green and Blue\u000a      Futures project run by the Canal and Rivers Trust, and is now being used\u000a      by 17 local authorities in 11 EU countries to stimulate policy debate over\u000a      the role of social forms of ownership for enhancing the management of\u000a      smaller waterways (5.7).\u000a    Improving access to inland water spaces for recreation: Research\u000a      commissioned by the Environment Agency that piloted the implementation of\u000a      voluntary agreements resulted in policy actions that led to the\u000a      establishment of new voluntary access agreements and improved access to 70\u000a      miles of multiple-use recreational routes on four rivers in England (5.1).\u000a      An independent evaluation undertaken by Ipsos Mori of the four routes\u000a      found they were viewed positively by sporting, land owning and other\u000a      stakeholders (5.1). The research also influenced the decisions of 300\u000a      landowners or tenants, who, in response to the participatory methods, gave\u000a      their written support for the new voluntary agreements and improvements in\u000a      access to water. In Wales, public and private-sector organisations have\u000a      also improved access to water in response to the `Splash' fund and the\u000a      regional water recreation strategy devised by the UoB. Dwr Cymru\/Welsh\u000a      Water has delivered new access and improved water-sports facilities on\u000a      four of their largest reservoirs (5.3). Similarly, the Brecon Beacons and\u000a      Snowdonia National Park authorities, in response to the regional strategy,\u000a      now have a greater engagement with water-recreation issues and are\u000a      investing in improvements to visitor centre sites (5.3).\u000a    Stimulating social and economic benefits: The economic benefits of\u000a      the `Splash' fund set up in Wales directly in response to the UoB research\u000a      have been evaluated independently (5.8). This evaluation indicates that\u000a      the fund has stimulated economic activity and increased tourism, which,\u000a      during 2008 to 2013, resulted in the addition to the Welsh economy of 102\u000a      FTE jobs and &#163;1.83m of Welsh gross value-added (GVA) (5.8). Of the 130\u000a      Splash-funded projects, 40% are in or within 5kms of the most deprived Communities\u000a        First areas of Wales and the projects have produced health and\u000a      well-being benefits to the users of water-recreation sites (5.4). One of\u000a      the four new voluntary access agreements resulting from the UoB research\u000a      covers a 29km stretch of the River Mersey, which passes through a number\u000a      of deprived communities. This agreement is viewed as an important\u000a      recreational resource by local recreational stakeholders and is seen as a\u000a      considerable achievement that could not have happened without the UoB\u000a      research (5.9). A private-sector outdoor activities business, opened up as\u000a      a result of the new agreement, estimates that the number of customers the\u000a      business has introduced to canoeing has increased four times between 2010\u000a      and 2013, to about 1,700 people per year, most of whom are novice water\u000a      recreationalists (5.9). The agreement has also facilitated the hosting,\u000a      since 2010, of the River Mersey `memory paddle', the first annual open\u000a      water canoe event for the Alzheimer's Society.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Limitations in public access to water environments for recreation are a\u000a      longstanding source of stakeholder conflict in which previous policy\u000a      initiatives have been ineffective.

It revealed that the\u000a      legislative solutions to improve recreational access to land and water\u000a      were unlikely to improve the situation. The research created new knowledge\u000a      about people-environment relationships, specifically the dominance of\u000a      certain interest groups in determining access to inland water [3.1, 3.5,\u000a      3.6].\u000a    Translation and initial interventions 1998&#8212;2007: In keeping with\u000a      the approaches to impact described in REF3a, the academic research was\u000a      closely integrated with policy related research commissioned by a range of\u000a      government organisations and also involved working closely with\u000a      third-sector users. Prior to the enactment of the Countryside and Rights\u000a      of Way Act 2000, the researchers were funded by the Countryside Agency to\u000a      examine the case for recreational access to a number of natural\u000a      environments, including inland waters. Using a deliberative approach, the\u000a      researchers showed that access to water was a legitimate area of policy.\u000a    The researchers were then funded by government bodies to undertake a\u000a      series of three projects into public access to water environments. The\u000a      first project was commissioned by Defra (&#163;112k) to undertake an audit of\u000a      current access and problems that included an analysis of the potential\u000a      environmental effects of current access. This work identified how only 4%\u000a      of the English and Welsh river network was available for navigation and\u000a      the potential role of voluntary agreements in extending public access to\u000a      inland water.\u000a    The UoB was then funded by the Countryside Agency (&#163;91k) to assess the\u000a      feasibility of a new policy approach based on voluntary access. The\u000a      researchers were subsequently commissioned by the Environment Agency\u000a      (&#163;50k) to pilot local implementation of voluntary agreements by working\u000a      with national governing bodies for water-based sports and local\u000a      communities to develop multiple-use water-recreation routes on four\u000a      rivers.\u000a    The research from these projects developed a new set of methods for\u000a      establishing voluntary agreements to improve access whilst addressing\u000a      issues of environmental management. These methods involved recreational\u000a      users, landowners and other stakeholders using collaborative environmental\u000a      mapping, online posters and a range of public consultation and\u000a      deliberation activities to move beyond conflict resolution and towards a\u000a      deeper understanding and appreciation of the co-use of natural resources.\u000a      Based on phenomenological principles, the methods were designed to engage\u000a      academic researchers and policymakers with the lifeworlds of those\u000a      affected by public policy [3.4].\u000a    Impact expansion 2007&#8212;2013: Having demonstrated in the funded\u000a      projects the potential of the new voluntaristic approaches, the\u000a      researchers developed a new strategic framework for the approach. This led\u000a      to the UoB being commissioned (&#163;306k) over three years to work in\u000a      partnership with Defra, the Environment Agency, sports organisations and\u000a      community groups to co-produce regional strategic plans for water\u000a      recreation in six regions. In response to this research the South Downs\u000a      Joint Committee commissioned (&#163;5k) for UoB researchers to produce a\u000a      strategy for the area now covered by the new National Park Authority.\u000a    The European significance of the UoB work has resulted in our researchers\u000a      being commissioned (&#163;25k) in 2010 to support the development of a European\u000a      Development-funded project on the management of small waterways and, in\u000a      2013, to research the ways in which the emergent forms of social ownership\u000a      in northern Europe can be harnessed to support the environmental\u000a      management and recreational development of small waterways.\u000a    The research generated by the funded projects from 1998 to 2013 was\u000a      integrated with the academic research to create new knowledge and\u000a      understandings of property rights and public access issues [3.1, 3.5] and\u000a      the potential effects of the EU Water Framework Directive on the\u000a      recreational use of inland water [3.6].\u000a    Key researchers: \u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          Andrew Church:\u000a          Professor of Human Geography (Aug 1999&#8211;to date).\u000a            Director of Research &amp; Development (Social Sciences) (Apr\u000a            2013&#8211;to date)\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Paul Gilchrist:\u000a          Research Fellow (Jan 2003&#8211;Feb 2012), Senior Research Fellow (Mar\u000a            2012&#8211;to date).\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Paul Hanna:\u000a          Lecturer (Oct 2010&#8211;Jan 2011, Sept 2011&#8211;to date), Research Fellow\u000a            (Feb 2012&#8211;Mar 2012, Sept 2012&#8211;Aug 2013).\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Neil Ravenscroft:\u000a          Principal Research Fellow (Sept 2001&#8211;June 2005), Professor of Land\u000a            Economy (July 2005&#8211;to date).

Instructed by TAYLOR, the\u000d\u000a      NGO constructed and operated successfully three treatment plants that\u000d\u000a      disinfected over 600,000 litres of highly contaminated wastewater,\u000d\u000a      containing up to 10 million Vibrio cholerae pathogens per 100 ml.\u000d\u000a      The design and operation of these in-situ treatment plants\u000d\u000a      prevented the hazardous practice of trucking highly contagious materials\u000d\u000a      to uncontrolled disposal sites. This innovation is the first known\u000d\u000a      response to a UN Panel of Experts' recommendation that UN facilities\u000d\u000a      should disinfect their wastewaters in emergencies. The disinfected\u000d\u000a      effluent complied consistently with WHO health standards for unrestricted\u000d\u000a      irrigation, and the intervention therefore protected impoverished\u000d\u000a      communities located downstream of the plants from the risk of cholera\u000d\u000a      infection during the epidemic. The standard operating practices employed\u000d\u000a      in Haiti have been made openly available to all NGOs working in disaster\u000d\u000a      settings on the `Solutions for Water' web platform of the World Water\u000d\u000a      Forum (5.2).\u000d\u000a    2. Prompted the launch of a National Water Safety Strategy for\u000d\u000a      Malawi in November 2012 and led the UK-based NGOs Pump Aid and WaterAid to\u000d\u000a      improve the quality of drinking water supplied to rural Malawians.\u000d\u000a    In Malawi, 1,000 children under five years of age die from water-related\u000d\u000a      illnesses every month, but by improving drinking water and sanitation,\u000d\u000a      water-related diseases can be reduced by nearly 90%. The UoB team's recent\u000d\u000a      work in Malawi, commissioned by UNICEF, demonstrated how well-designed\u000d\u000a      sanitary surveys can play a pivotal role in securing the safety of water\u000d\u000a      supplies in Malawi and other low-income countries. TAYLOR was invited to\u000d\u000a      report the team's findings to Malawian civil servants and international\u000d\u000a      NGOs at a workshop in Lilongwe in August 2012. In response to this, the\u000d\u000a      Malawian government immediately launched the country's first Water\u000d\u000a        Safety Task Force. In December 2012, the UK-based NGO Pump Aid made\u000d\u000a      significant changes to its provision of water-supply technology in Malawi\u000d\u000a      as a direct result of the team's report. The research led the NGO to\u000d\u000a      improve standards, implement more rigorous quality management, and to\u000d\u000a      employ additional staff to raise community awareness of the issues raised\u000d\u000a      by the UoB research (5.3). This has already resulted in the improved\u000d\u000a      design and siting of 300 new shallow wells in Malawi during 2013 (with\u000d\u000a      1,500 to be commissioned by the end of 2015, serving a population of\u000d\u000a      180,000 people). The research in Malawi also led the NGO WaterAid to\u000d\u000a      review its approach to water-quality testing in the country using the\u000d\u000a      model developed by TAYLOR (5.4). In April 2013, the Water Institute at UNC\u000d\u000a      (USA), in collaboration with the Ministry of Health in Malawi, held a\u000d\u000a      consultative workshop on the development of a national action plan for\u000d\u000a      safe drinking water in Malawi. Evidence from the UNICEF report was used in\u000d\u000a      the recommendation for a strengthening of monitoring and evaluation in\u000d\u000a      this area (5.5). Arising from this work, TAYLOR was invited to join the\u000d\u000a      core group of the `International Low-cost Water Quality Monitoring Panel\u000d\u000a      of Experts', which will report back to the WHO in 2014.\u000d\u000a    3.

Thames Water Services has used the\u000d\u000a      group's findings to control potential health hazards associated with the\u000d\u000a      Old Ford wastewater reuse system at the Olympic Park in East London (5.6)\u000d\u000a      and as a result the company has been able to satisfy an International\u000d\u000a      Panel of Experts that it is adequately protecting human health. Southeast\u000d\u000a      Water and the Environment Agency are using the group's novel hazard maps\u000d\u000a      to support local implementation of the EU Water Framework Directive in\u000d\u000a      southeast England and this work was cited by an independent witness to the\u000d\u000a      UK Defra Water White Paper, 17 February 2012 (5.7).

The\u000d\u000a      group's `multiple barrier approach' to disease control has provided new\u000d\u000a      interventions that prevent human contact with contaminated water.\u000d\u000a    Early work led by TAYLOR [reference 3.1] demonstrated that wastewater can\u000d\u000a      be disinfected using chemical coagulating agents, and subsequently a pilot\u000d\u000a      treatment plant in Brazil successfully disinfected wastewater from a poor\u000d\u000a      peri-urban community at low cost.

A broader understanding of the fate and transport of\u000d\u000a      microorganisms of faecal origin at a catchment level later provided new\u000d\u000a      ways to design strategic water-quality monitoring programmes [3.3]. This\u000d\u000a      led UNICEF to invite staff of EPHRU to investigate how drinking water\u000d\u000a      quality in rural Malawi could be improved (Impact 2).\u000d\u000a    The antibiotic resistance research of EBDON and TAYLOR encouraged them to\u000d\u000a      investigate whether this property of bacteria enabled sources of faecal\u000d\u000a      pollution to be identified. This work was supported by the EU Fifth\u000d\u000a      Framework Programme (FP5) and the EU Interreg IIIA (eg AMACOM and TOFPSW)\u000d\u000a      [3.4]. As a result, EBDON (with TAYLOR) demonstrated that global\u000d\u000a      variations in antibiotic resistance patterns prohibited its universal\u000d\u000a      application [3.4]. EBDON then developed a new and highly effective\u000d\u000a      bacteriophage-based source tracking tool that was able to detect human\u000d\u000a      faeces with high precision. Further, the new method reduced the cost of\u000d\u000a      identifying the impact of municipal wastewaters on rivers and beaches by\u000d\u000a      approximately 90% [3.5]. Later, EBDON demonstrated that his bacteriophage\u000d\u000a      system predicts the presence of waterborne human viruses (Norovirus\u000d\u000a      and Adenovirus) in wastewaters and receiving waters [3.6]. More\u000d\u000a      recent molecular work investigated the human gut composition of adults\u000d\u000a      from the UK, Japan and North America, which confirmed that EBDON'S\u000d\u000a      source-tracking phages are of exclusively human origin.

De Beers has witnessed the impact of the Bristol research in (i)\u000d\u000a      the improvement of geological models; \"The introduction of\u000d\u000a        quantitative data collection techniques have also had significant impact\u000d\u000a        on the construction of geological models by the Company's geologists,\u000d\u000a        which also benefitted greatly from interactions with the Bristol team.\u000d\u000a        This benefit is difficult to quantify in financial terms, but again can\u000d\u000a        be treated as a significant risk mitigation initiative\" [e],\u000d\u000a      and (ii) changes in diamond sampling methods; \"our understanding of\u000d\u000a        the geological complexities of many of the kimberlites we were mining\u000d\u000a        and evaluating improved considerably...this lent considerable support to\u000d\u000a        a change in the way in which we sample kimberlites for grade estimation\"\u000d\u000a      [e]. Both of these factors have led to the mitigation of potential\u000d\u000a      future losses in the form of a decreased risk of failure of a resource\u000d\u000a      model; \"Typically such commercial resource models can be valued at\u000d\u000a        between &#163;10s to 100's of millions of pounds, and the result of the\u000d\u000a        Bristol-De Beers initiative has reduced the risk of such failures\u000d\u000a        through the adoption of new strategies and protocols. These previously\u000d\u000a        occurred due to an incorrect interpretation arising from a poor\u000d\u000a        understanding of the geology\" [c].\u000d\u000a    International Impact on Diamond Mining:\u000d\u000a    Whilst it is difficult to quantify precisely how the kimberlite research\u000d\u000a      initiative has contributed in monetary terms to the international diamond\u000d\u000a      industry, \"there are a number of important changes that have happened\u000d\u000a        in the industry because of the contribution of Bristol University\" [d].\u000d\u000a      One example is \"the sampling programme for the world class Orapa\u000d\u000a        kimberlite mine was changed because of the geological mapping and\u000d\u000a        interpretation conducted by Bristol researchers (see the papers by\u000d\u000a        Gernon et al., 2009a,b) [sic [6]]. In the\u000d\u000a        strictest confidence I can confirm that this change in sampling strategy\u000d\u000a        has had a major positive influence on the life of this mine. This mine\u000d\u000a        contributes roughly 10% of the world's annual diamond supply. This\u000d\u000a        change will significantly increase that proportion\" [b].\u000d\u000a      Furthermore, \"Research conducted at Orapa mine by the Bristol team\u000d\u000a        showed the current reserve being mined may not continue below a certain\u000d\u000a        depth level, and therefore the sampling programme to evaluate the deeper\u000d\u000a        levels was tailored to ensure that significant diamonds are recovered\u000d\u000a        from the deeper regions to test whether the diamond grades and qualities\u000d\u000a        may have changed\" [e]. A second example is that \"Mapping\u000d\u000a        at Jwaneng Mine provided a clearer understanding of the geological\u000d\u000a        continuity of facies in this mine, and this provided confidence that\u000d\u000a        allowed management to approve changing the sampling methodology for\u000d\u000a        grade determination\" [e].\u000d\u000a    Other contributions of Bristol research to the diamond mining industry\u000d\u000a      include; firstly, the re-evaluation of kimberlite terminology; \"We have\u000d\u000a        since seen the nomenclature and data collection standards been\u000d\u000a        progressively updated and developed...to a much improved and better\u000d\u000a        communicated standard throughout the industry internationally. The new\u000d\u000a        standards have been adopted by most kimberlite exploration and mining\u000d\u000a        companies...such as De Beers, BHP, Rio Tinto, Stornoway, Shore Gold and\u000d\u000a        Peregrine Diamonds\" [d]. Secondly, a modern\u000d\u000a      re-interpretation of the volcanology processes that could form\u000d\u000a      kimberlites; \"new or better understood processes have allowed\u000d\u000a        kimberlite geologists to improve the understanding and prediction of\u000d\u000a        diamond size and abundance variations within a deposit. The new ideas\u000d\u000a        are being applied by the most knowledgeable kimberlite geologists who\u000d\u000a        develop diamond estimation models, such as SRK, Mineral Services and\u000d\u000a        other independent specialists\" [d]. Lastly, the provision of\u000d\u000a      an updated emplacement model for kimberlites; \"To a geologist\u000d\u000a        estimating the diamond distribution, these big-picture models improve\u000d\u000a        the prediction of the spatial compartmentalization of diamonds...Very\u000d\u000a        importantly, the models influence diamond sampling programs by guiding\u000d\u000a        the location and frequency of samples required...the improved kimberlite\u000d\u000a        models are therefore improving the quality of the classification of\u000d\u000a        diamond resource estimates internationally\" [d].\u000d\u000a    As well as improving diamond sampling and increasing confidence in grade\u000d\u000a      estimations, research conducted by Bristol since 2004 has also highlighted\u000d\u000a      that \"the local oversimplification of the geology and assumptions of\u000d\u000a        homogeneity in the estimation of diamond content may be causing an\u000d\u000a        over-estimation of the diamond content. The correct understanding of the\u000d\u000a        pipe forming processes...forced SRK to reduce the confidence\u000d\u000a        classification for the deposit, and caused us to treat the samples\u000d\u000a        differently and raise the awareness that the diamond content may be as\u000d\u000a        much as 10-20 % less. This caused the investing company to decide to\u000d\u000a        protect itself and not invest in the project\" [d].\u000d\u000a    Conference presentations and published papers in leading journals [1-6]\u000d\u000a      have brought the Bristol group's work on kimberlites to the attention of\u000d\u000a      other workers in the field, which has led \"immediately to similar\u000d\u000a        research initiatives sponsored by De Beers' main competitors in the\u000d\u000a        diamond market, BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, being initiated. As a\u000d\u000a        consequence knowledge of kimberlite geology went through a period of\u000d\u000a        rapid growth. It is difficult to quantify how this may have affected the\u000d\u000a        industry as a whole, but in my opinion it probably has had a significant\u000d\u000a        improvement on how kimberlite ore bodies are now defined\" [b].\u000d\u000a      This is further supported by [e]: \"De Beers and its associated\u000d\u000a        companies benefitted greatly from this research collaboration. I have no\u000d\u000a        doubt that other diamond exploration and mining companies would also\u000d\u000a        have benefitted from this as the methodologies and techniques introduced\u000d\u000a        by this research programme inevitably spread across the industry\".\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Kimberlite research at Bristol has been a collaborative enterprise with\u000d\u000a      De Beers over the past 10 years.

The origin of kimberlites has been a long-standing\u000d\u000a      issue invoking some controversy [a]. Various factors have\u000d\u000a      contributed to this controversy, such as (i) the lack of direct\u000d\u000a      observations of kimberlite eruptions, (ii) the scarcity of preserved\u000d\u000a      extrusive kimberlites, (iii) the unique environment of emplacement within\u000d\u000a      deep volcanic conduits, and (iv) extensive alteration and lithification,\u000d\u000a      which have either modified or eradicated the primary structures and\u000d\u000a      textures. Despite these problems, it is of economic and commercial\u000d\u000a      interest for the diamond mining industry to have a sufficient\u000d\u000a      understanding of the formation and associated processes. Only small\u000d\u000a      proportions are likely to be diamondiferous, many of which are considered\u000d\u000a      subeconomic because the quality or quantity of diamonds is insufficient.\u000d\u000a      Research at Bristol has addressed these issues as described below.\u000d\u000a    Prior to the collaboration described here (&lt; 2003), the typical\u000d\u000a      approach to kimberlites within the diamond mining industry was dominated\u000d\u000a      by microscopy, with very limited understanding of the volcanology and\u000d\u000a      outdated ideas that were focused on the petrological aspects of these\u000d\u000a      rocks only; \"one of the major short-comings of the existing knowledge\u000d\u000a        applied to diamond-hosting ore-bodies (mainly kimberlites) was that\u000d\u000a        these rocks were not treated as volcanic rocks, but as igneous rocks.\u000d\u000a        This meant that volcanological principles had never been applied to\u000d\u000a        these rocks, and that the sub-division of the ore bodies for economic\u000d\u000a        purposes were based on subjective, largely irrelevant criteria that did\u000d\u000a        not correlate well with diamond grades or diamond values\" [b].\u000d\u000a    Kimberlite eruptions were thought to be caused either by short-lived\u000d\u000a      catastrophic explosions or by interactions with external groundwater. It\u000d\u000a      was also assumed that the contents of the kimberlite pipes came from\u000d\u000a      eruptions of that pipe with reconstructed magmas rich in silica and\u000d\u000a      magnesia [1]. The paradigm was also that the alteration of\u000d\u000a      kimberlites was largely caused by magmatic fluids. Much of the terminology\u000d\u000a      was esoteric and hard to relate to the mainstream volcanological\u000d\u000a      literature [1]. This led to various problems and incorrect\u000d\u000a      interpretations with advancing projects. As such, a paradigm shift was\u000d\u000a      required. De Beers, one of the largest diamond mining companies in the\u000d\u000a      world, \"was tasked with significantly improving the technical\u000d\u000a        processes required to evaluate diamond-bearing deposits more\u000d\u000a        efficiently, i.e. reduce the time taken and costs expended to transform\u000d\u000a        a new discovery to the point where a decision could be taken to develop\u000d\u000a        it further or abandon, and in those being chosen for development to\u000d\u000a        improve the time it would take to bring the project into production\"\u000d\u000a      [b].\u000d\u000a    This paradigm shift required considerable academic support to bring about\u000d\u000a      significant changes to the way diamond mineral resources are evaluated.\u000d\u000a      However, the lack of specialist expertise in volcanic geology meant that\u000d\u000a      diamond mining companies (such as De Beers) were unable to conduct the\u000d\u000a      necessary volcanological research internally and \"members of the mining\u000d\u000a        community felt that a significant improvement could be achieved if we\u000d\u000a        engaged a world leader in volcanology to help guide our search\" [b].\u000d\u000a      In 2003, Matthew Field (De Beers, Wells) contacted Professor Steve Sparks\u000d\u000a      (a Channing Wills Professor of Geology at the time, 2004-2010), based\u000d\u000a      purely on his reputation for academic excellence, with a proposal to\u000d\u000a      conduct research into the volcanism of kimberlites. By 2004, De Beers\u000d\u000a      (Wells) had begun to fund research at Bristol via a bottom-up approach\u000d\u000a      with later input from De Beers Canada, in total supporting four Fourth\u000d\u000a      Year Undergraduate theses, seven joint Natural Environment Research\u000d\u000a      Council (NERC) and Co-operative Award in Science &amp; Engineering (CASE)\u000d\u000a      PhD studentships, and three postdoctoral researchers. By 2006, conference\u000d\u000a      presentations had already been given and the first publication related to\u000d\u000a      this research was produced [2]. This was quickly followed by\u000d\u000a      further scientific publications [1,3-6], many of which have seen\u000d\u000a      impressive citation numbers (e.g. [2] which has seen 163 Google\u000d\u000a      Scholar citations). The swiftness and agility of the progress made by this\u000d\u000a      collaboration can be attributed largely to (i) the facilities available\u000d\u000a      (electron microprobe, fluidisation beds, geophysical fluid dynamics\u000d\u000a      laboratory, experimental facilities), (ii) the pre-existing expertise\u000d\u000a      within the UoA (several other members of staff were brought into the\u000d\u000a      Kimberlite team, for instance, Dr John Schumacher, Dr Jeremy Philips, Dr\u000d\u000a      Richard Brooker and Dr Mark Gilbertson (Department of Mechanical\u000d\u000a      Engineering, UoB)), and (iii) the wealth of international volcanology\u000d\u000a      expertise provided by the Bristol researchers.\u000d\u000a    Through the collaboration between the UoA and De Beers, previously\u000d\u000a      unsolved mysteries have been systematically revealed, and ideas changed\u000d\u000a      significantly. This has contributed to major advances in kimberlite\u000d\u000a      research, effectively bringing to an end more than a decade of relatively\u000d\u000a      confined scientific growth [1]. These changes have been brought\u000d\u000a      about by applying the understanding of physical principles and empirical\u000d\u000a      knowledge of volcanic processes established over the last three decades\u000d\u000a      (also largely developed under the leadership of Sparks), and observations\u000d\u000a      and interpretations of the geology, to develop a model of kimberlite\u000d\u000a      volcanism and to place constraints on kimberlite-forming eruptions [1-6].\u000d\u000a      This underpinning geological and petrological research has developed novel\u000d\u000a      ideas about fluidisation in deep volcanic vents, including processes\u000d\u000a      previously unrecognised in mainstream volcanology [1-6].\u000d\u000a    Findings of this underpinning research have resulted in (i) the\u000d\u000a      recognition of the diversity and complexity of the lithofacies that infill\u000d\u000a      kimberlite pipes [1-6], and (ii) the demonstration that most\u000d\u000a      kimberlite eruptions were long-lived multistage events, including low to\u000d\u000a      moderate intensity phases as well as some high intensity, rather than\u000d\u000a      single catastrophic explosions [3,4]. It has also been revealed\u000d\u000a      that (iii) kimberlites have mostly been altered by external water in\u000d\u000a      hydrothermal systems, with this alteration subsequently shown to strongly\u000d\u000a      affect the reconstruction of original magmas [3,4].

Bristol's research on hydride formation has affected the\u000d\u000a      Sellafield safety case for recovery of\u000d\u000a      legacy wastes by reducing uncertainty in quantifying the risk associated\u000d\u000a      with the occurrence of\u000d\u000a      thermal excursions. It has also helped to confirm that there is not a\u000d\u000a      significant safety issue posed\u000d\u000a      by uranium hydride in the recovery of legacy waste from Sellafield storage\u000d\u000a      silos. Sellafield is now\u000d\u000a      continuing with the Magnox Swarf Storage Silos (&#163;387 million) and other\u000d\u000a      legacy retrieval projects,\u000d\u000a      including the silos direct encapsulation plant (&#163;1.28 billion) and pile\u000d\u000a      fuel cladding silo project (&#163;341\u000d\u000a      million), projects worth a total of ~&#163;1.9 billion [f,h].

A primary aim has been to develop a\u000d\u000a      fundamental understanding of the\u000d\u000a      mechanisms that control corrosion of uranium metal in different storage\u000d\u000a      environments as the\u000d\u000a      resulting corrosion product, uranium hydride (UH3), is\u000d\u000a      pyrophoric (flammable), liable to cause\u000d\u000a      thermal excursions, and presents serious safety hazards during the\u000d\u000a      long-term, or even medium-term,\u000d\u000a      storage of metallic waste in almost all storage environments [a].\u000d\u000a    Scott's research has been focused on identifying and understanding many\u000d\u000a      of the significant factors\u000d\u000a      controlling the onset (initiation) of hydride formation. This\u000d\u000a      understanding has enabled a better\u000d\u000a      prediction of when and if hydrogen corrosion will occur, and thus the\u000d\u000a      implementation of\u000d\u000a      preventative measures that will delay, or even prevent, such an\u000d\u000a      occurrence. Scott's approach to\u000d\u000a      research has been to combine sophisticated surface analysis techniques\u000d\u000a      with specialist isotope-spiked\u000d\u000a      corrosion cells in which the storage environment (pressure, temperature\u000d\u000a      and gas\u000d\u000a      composition) is precisely controlled and monitored [1-4,6]. These\u000d\u000a      gas `rig' systems have enabled\u000d\u000a      Scott to accurately determine the rates of uranium metal and carbide\u000d\u000a      corrosion for different gas\u000d\u000a      mixtures analogous to real-world storage environments. By using the IAC's\u000d\u000a      world-class surface\u000d\u000a      analysis facilities, this research not only provides real time corrosion\u000d\u000a      data, but, more importantly, it\u000d\u000a      reveals the actual mechanisms for corrosion and reactivity of the metal\u000d\u000a      and carbide in different\u000d\u000a      storage environments [2-4]. Consequently, Scott and colleagues\u000d\u000a      have been able to develop\u000d\u000a      subsequent methods for treating these materials to (i) improve their\u000d\u000a      corrosion resistance, (ii)\u000d\u000a      transform them into environmentally stable (or acceptable) compounds [3],\u000d\u000a      and (iii) to provide\u000d\u000a      efficient means of remediation in the event of an environmental release [5].\u000d\u000a    The UK Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) plays a crucial role in the\u000d\u000a      defence of the UK,\u000d\u000a      responsible for the manufacture and maintenance of warheads for Trident, a\u000d\u000a      submarine-launched\u000d\u000a      ballistic missile. AWE has been at the forefront of the UK nuclear\u000d\u000a      deterrent programme for more\u000d\u000a      than 60 years, directly supporting the Continuous At Sea Deterrence\u000d\u000a      (CASD). In 2004, the AWE\u000d\u000a      sought to establish a collaborative partnership with Bristol, ultimately\u000d\u000a      funding a continuing\u000d\u000a      programme of research at the IAC in excess of &#163;1M, to provide a detailed\u000d\u000a      investigation directed at\u000d\u000a      better understanding and predicting the corrosion of uranium and its\u000d\u000a      alloys [a]. This Bristol-AWE\u000d\u000a      partnership was formalised in 2009 with the establishment of a Strategic\u000d\u000a      Alliance agreement,\u000d\u000a      instigated in response to broadening IAC research activity with the\u000d\u000a      company. This Strategic\u000d\u000a      Alliance presented both organisations with the opportunity to develop new\u000d\u000a      collaborative ventures,\u000d\u000a      combining research, people and skills to ensure both institutions are at\u000d\u000a      the forefront of scientific\u000d\u000a      discovery in years to come. As a measure of Bristol's research excellence,\u000d\u000a      the IAC team has won\u000d\u000a      the research prize at the annual AWE materials science and engineering\u000d\u000a      conference four times, in\u000d\u000a      2007, 2009, 2011 and 2013 [a].\u000d\u000a    The Sellafield site is the largest and most hazardous site in the Nuclear\u000d\u000a      Decommissioning\u000d\u000a      Authority's estate and is home to an extraordinary accumulation of\u000d\u000a      hazardous waste requiring\u000d\u000a      treatment, much of it stored in outdated nuclear facilities [b].\u000d\u000a      One of the primary missions of\u000d\u000a      Sellafield is the characterisation, retrieval, treatment, and safe\u000d\u000a      above-ground storage of the legacy\u000d\u000a      wastes produced during earlier operations of the UK nuclear industry.\u000d\u000a      These waste streams\u000d\u000a      contain substantial quantities of uranium metal (from spent nuclear fuel),\u000d\u000a      along with components of\u000d\u000a      the fuel cladding such as Magnox and Aluminium. Waste has been stored\u000d\u000a      under conditions that\u000d\u000a      has led to the formation of corrosion products, therefore leading to\u000d\u000a      substantially different\u000d\u000a      characteristics of materials to those originally consigned to the plants\u000d\u000a      for storage [b]. As such,\u000d\u000a      unanswered questions pertaining to the state of uranium in storage are of\u000d\u000a      significant interest at\u000d\u000a      Sellafield for the safe retrieval and treatment of legacy wastes. In 2011,\u000d\u000a      Sellafield embarked on a\u000d\u000a      national search to identify and evaluate academic expertise related to the\u000d\u000a      corrosion of uranium and\u000d\u000a      other reactive metals. Sellafield required a sponsored link between their\u000d\u000a      internal Centre of\u000d\u000a      Expertise on uranium and reactive metals and a suitably qualified UK\u000d\u000a      University that would provide\u000d\u000a      expert advice and research to support Sellafield's activities and\u000d\u000a      research, particularly in relation to\u000d\u000a      the behaviour of uranium in wastes. In 2012, the IAC was recognised as\u000d\u000a      world-leading in the field of\u000d\u000a      uranium research, having a substantial and leading international expertise\u000d\u000a      for research on uranium\u000d\u000a      and its corrosion products which has accumulated over a period of\u000d\u000a      approximately 10 years, in close\u000d\u000a      collaboration with the UK Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) [b].\u000d\u000a      Subsequently, in early 2012,\u000d\u000a      through the auspices of the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR), Bristol\u000d\u000a      was successfully awarded\u000d\u000a      the CoE-university link with Sellafield, who have acknowledged that the\u000d\u000a      IAC's research directly\u000d\u000a      impacted the company's decision on which University to work with [b].\u000d\u000a      Bristol also gained &#163;500k direct\u000d\u000a      funding from Sellafield over a 5 year period [b].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40235","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Research from the Bristol seismology group has led to a broad range of\u000a      software that has been incorporated into commercial code used for\u000a      geomechanical modelling, measuring shear-wave splitting, characterising\u000a      fractures, and assessing induced seismicity. Consequently, the end users\u000a      (and thus beneficiaries) of this research are oil and gas companies\u000a      looking to decrease their risk, improve oil and gas exploratory efforts\u000a      and minimise exploration costs. For example, commercial impact is broad in\u000a      that many (&gt; 50 worldwide) multinational companies are now using\u000a      Rockfield's coupled software to study the geomechanical behaviour and\u000a      seismic properties of producing reservoirs and understanding fracturing\u000a      and permeability effects; \"the output from the IPEGG project has been\u000a        used regularly to address major challenges facing the petroleum\u000a        industry\" [a]. Consequently, the IPEGG project has been\u000a      viewed as highly successful by both Rockfield Software and the project\u000a      sponsors (BG, BP, ENI, Statoil), with the resulting software being applied\u000a      to various projects, such as \"predicting stress changes and subsidence\u000a        due to the production from major chalk fields in the North Sea;\u000a        assessing optimum position to place an oil platform in the North Sea;\u000a        assessing the optimal mud-weights to use when drilling deviated wells in\u000a        the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico. In addition, we are currently using\u000a        the software to conduct a major (&#163;950,000) project to optimize hydraulic\u000a        fracturing within shale gas reservoirs\"[a].\u000a    Rockfield has witnessed impressive software sales leading directly to an\u000a      expansion in their oil and gas business. This increase in Rockfield's\u000a      capabilities has driven international business to a medium-sized UK based\u000a      company; \"Since the completion of IPEGG we have witnessed significant\u000a        impact both in terms of sales of the software resulting from the project\u000a        and consultancy projects that we have undertaken using the\u000a        software\/workflows. In particular, ELFENTMand\u000a        the module to couple to production simulation models was purchased by BP\u000a        and ENI of the IPEGG sponsors at a cost of &#163;40,000 per license per year\u000a        over the past three years. Additional licenses, which total &#163;80,000\/year\u000a        have been sold to other companies. In addition, Rockfield Software have\u000a        conducted around &#163;400,000 of consultancy work for the petroleum industry\u000a        using the software developed\" [a]. There is then benefit for\u000a      the operators who are hiring Rockfield, in that the improved reservoir\u000a      models will enable them to maximise production while minimising the\u000a      environmental and operational cost of geomechanical issues like subsidence\u000a      (damage to be paid for), well-bore failure (cost of workovers and\/or\u000a      drilling replacement wells) and caprock fracturing (loss of hydrocarbon\u000a      into overburden formations).\u000a    A novel aspect of the IPEGG project has been the development linking\u000a      geomechanical modelling with fluid flow [14]. For instance, Roxar\u000a      has led to the development of a very efficient memory- passing interface\u000a      (MPI) by coupling their software TempestTM with ELFENTM,\u000a      which \"At a time when operators are looking to optimise production\u000a        from increasingly marginal assets and make effective decisions over the\u000a        allocation of capital and resources, the models and analytical processes\u000a        that define modern reservoir simulation have never been more important\"\u000a      [c]. More recently, this software has been utilised to assess\u000a      potential leakage from CO2 storage sites and to assess the use\u000a      of seismic tools for monitoring CO2 movement in the subsurface\u000a      [15,17]. This research conducted at Bristol has \"influenced BP\u000a        operations and future directions in a number of ways, specifically with\u000a        application to the Valhall oil field...The success of the project was\u000a        influential in BP's decision to use ELFEN for geomechanical modelling in\u000a        our North Sea reservoirs. Notably, we are applying the software\u000a        extensively to better manage the giant Valhall oilfield which is the 5th\u000a      largest field in Norwegian waters\" [d]. This has led to two\u000a      further JIPs, the GESER and FRACGAS project [a,1,4]. Consequently,\u000a      IPEGG and its underpinning research is viewed as a major success by the\u000a      Industry Technology Facilitator (ITF); \"One of the things that ITF has\u000a        tried to encourage is the formation of consortia with world class\u000a        expertise to tackle fundamental industry issues. This project is a good\u000a        example of how well this approach can work &#8212; it has brought together\u000a        people that not only have an excellent track record of rapidly applying\u000a        research findings to meet the needs of industry but also have experience\u000a        bringing software packages to the market place\" [e].\u000a    At the inception of the BUMPS project \"there was significant\u000a        scepticism in large parts of industry regarding the viability of the use\u000a        of surface seismic arrays for the monitoring of hydraulic fracturing\"\u000a      [f]. However, the BUMPS project has demonstrated that surface\u000a      seismic monitoring was feasible and has helped to provide confidence to\u000a      the industry that surface monitoring was viable [f]. Indeed,\u000a      Bristol's research into ocean bottom sensors to monitor passive seismic\u000a      events in oil fields has influenced the establishment of the Life of Field\u000a      Seismic array at Valhall in 2003 at a cost of over $46 million [d].\u000a      This research has led to the formation of a small spin-out company, which\u000a      in 2012, was bought by Halliburton Energy Services and can be viewed as a\u000a      measure of the success of the project [d]; \"The BUMPS research\u000a        on surface-microseismic imaging spawned a new company that was ripe for\u000a        acquisition given the dramatic rise in shale play activity worldwide.\u000a        Kit Chambers left Bristol and formed Reservoir RockTalk [sic in 2010], a\u000a        microseismic imaging start-up, which was subsequently bought out by\u000a        Halliburton Energy Services\" [sic in 2012] [b].\u000a    The BUMPS consortium has grown from having 4 sponsors to 10 in a short\u000a      amount of time and is widely recognised as an industry-leading project\u000a      with Kendall providing advice on research quality and directions for\u000a      international companies such as Schlumberger. As such, \"Schlumberger\u000a        views the work of Professor Kendall's consortium as being of both a high\u000a        scientific quality and highly relevant to real world problems, setting\u000a        it apart from many other academic consortia\" [f]. Research\u000a      conducted at Bristol has also been \"key to defining the standard\u000a        magnitude measures used in the mitigation of risks due to induced\u000a        seismicity during hydraulic fracturing\" and to \"reduce location\u000a        uncertainties of microseismic events\" [f]. It can be\u000a      concluded that \"BUMPS is an important industry consortium providing\u000a        independent fundamental research into new capabilities and applications\u000a        of microseismic and other passive seismic monitoring under the advice of\u000a        industry service providers and operators. Such research fills a critical\u000a        need in the industry due to limited research investments in the private\u000a        sector...and allows for quicker advancement and adoption of new\u000a        technology across industry improving commercial results and addressing\u000a        public interests\" [b].\u000a    To summarise, \"the work done at Bristol over the past decade in\u000a        microseismic research has made a significant contribution to the\u000a        development of microseismic technology through innovative research,\u000a        publication of ideas and case studies, and the training of young\u000a        geophysicists who currently work in this business.

In addition, both the\u000a      IPEGG and BUMPS projects have trained numerous PhD students, many of whom\u000a      have gone on to successful careers in the oil industry as a direct result\u000a      of the training, reputation of research excellence, and academic-industry\u000a      collaborations of the UoA.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Bristol researchers have been working with the oil and gas industry to\u000a      develop new methods for monitoring and modelling deformation in oil and\u000a      gas reservoirs.

This\u000a      research has been conducted under the umbrella of two large Joint Industry\u000a      Projects (JIPs): (i) the Integrated Petroleum Engineering, Geophysics and\u000a      Geomechanics (IPEGG) project, which aims to better integrate the\u000a      disciplines of petroleum engineering, geology, geophysics, and\u000a      geomechanics in order to achieve maximum value from reservoirs [13-15,10],\u000a      and (ii) the Bristol University Microseismicity Projects (BUMPS), which\u000a      investigates natural and induced microearthquakes in petroleum reservoirs\u000a      in a variety of settings [3,16-18].\u000a    Geomechanics has, in recent years, emerged as an important area for the\u000a      oil and gas industry because of the need to extract petroleum from\u000a      challenging environments such as deep water, high temperature-high\u000a      pressure, or structurally complex fields. Many reservoirs experience\u000a      significant compaction during petroleum extraction, which can lead to\u000a      problems such as sea floor subsidence and seismicity, which can\u000a      dramatically alter reservoir permeability and redistribute reservoir\u000a      stresses. These geomechanical-related problems are not easily addressed by\u000a      conventional software tools used by petroleum engineers. IPEGG (2005-2009)\u000a      has brought together expertise in reservoir deformation and fluid flow at\u000a      the University of Leeds, the University of Bristol, and Rockfield Software\u000a      Ltd - a Swansea-based company that specialises in advanced numerical\u000a      analysis for geomechanical applications. \"The project was led by\u000a        Quentin Fisher at Leeds, with Bristol coordinating the geophysics\u000a        component. The University of Bristol played a significant role in the\u000a        project, helping in part to build production simulation and\u000a        geomechanical models, developing methods to populate the geomechanical\u000a        models with mechanical properties based on down-hole tool and field\u000a        seismic data... Bristol led the component that built seismic models to\u000a        investigate the use of 4D and passive seismic for detective fault\u000a        compartmentalized reservoirs\" [a]. IPEGG has made key\u000a      developments in linking deformation and fluid flow within reservoirs to\u000a      geophysical observations, such as microseismicity [13-18]. IPEGG\u000a      developed numerical techniques and workflows to couple Rockfield's finite\u000a      element model (ELFENTM) to industry standard production\u000a      simulation models (e.g. TempestTM, EclipseTM, VIPTM),\u000a      which predict reservoir behaviour.\u000a    Reservoir stimulation is one of the fastest growing sectors in the\u000a      petroleum industry and is used extensively in unconventional reservoirs\u000a      such as shale gas, shale oil and tight gas sandstones. Monitoring the\u000a      geomechanical response through induced seismicity is the primary means of\u000a      assessing the efficacy of stimulation, but is also important for\u000a      regulating the industry. Kendall has established one of the world's\u000a      leading consortia in microseismicity (BUMPS; 2009-present), the first to\u000a      develop downhole and surface seismic monitoring techniques for fracture\u000a      characterisation and stress field evaluation, extending the utility of\u000a      microseismic data far beyond simply locating microearthquakes [b,16-18].\u000a      The project has developed novel migration methods for automatically\u000a      locating events in near real time using surface arrays of sensors. It was\u000a      the first to use shear-wave splitting measurements to quantify fracture\u000a      induced anisotropy, most recently extending this work to estimate fracture\u000a      size and compliance, invaluable information for assessing the efficacy of\u000a      hydraulic stimulation. The considerable synergies between IPEGG and BUMPS\u000a      have been used, for example, to compare the geomechanical and microseismic\u000a      response in the world's largest CO2 sequestration projects [15,17].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40236","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2629691","Name":"Iceland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The total cost of the Ejyafjallaj&#246;kull eruption has been estimated at &#163;3\u000d\u000a      billion by Oxford Economics\u000d\u000a      in 2010 [a], with seven million passengers affected by the\u000d\u000a      cancellation of 107,000 flights. The net\u000d\u000a      impact on UK GDP has been estimated to be &#163;466 million [b]. The\u000d\u000a      eruption of Grimsv&#246;tn (Iceland)\u000d\u000a      in 2011, a much larger eruption, only caused the cancellation of 900\u000d\u000a      flights, with subsequent costs\u000d\u000a      being on the order of 1% of that caused by Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull cloud. This\u000d\u000a      is, in part, due to improved\u000d\u000a      understanding of ash clouds and their likely impact on UK airspace and\u000d\u000a      airports by decision\u000d\u000a      makers, through advice provided by the School's experts [c].\u000d\u000a    During the Iceland volcanic ash crisis of 2010, Sparks, Aspinall and\u000d\u000a      Watson were invited to join the\u000d\u000a      Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) set up by Professor Sir\u000d\u000a      John Beddington (then\u000d\u000a      Chief Scientific Adviser to the UK Government) to \"report directly to\u000d\u000a        the Prime Minister and Cabinet\u000d\u000a        Office Briefing Room (COBR)\" meetings [b]. Bristol\u000d\u000a      University was the only institution on the\u000d\u000a      committee (made up of 20 academics and senior civil servants) to have more\u000d\u000a      than one\u000d\u000a      representative. This was a direct result of their recognition as leaders\u000d\u000a      in their fields, specifically\u000d\u000a      plume dispersion [1], statistical volcanology and risk [3,5],\u000d\u000a      and satellite and microscopic\u000d\u000a      observations [2,4,6]. The research experience of the Bristol\u000d\u000a      academics was used extensively to\u000d\u000a      drive discussion within SAGE on source terms for models [d],\u000d\u000a      particularly application of the `Sparks\u000d\u000a      curve' which relates column height (observable) to mass eruption rate\u000d\u000a      (critical model source term)\u000d\u000a      [e]. This curve provides the underlying capability for mass\u000d\u000a      estimation that is vital during stages of\u000d\u000a      an eruption where observations are sparse and \"forms the basis of the\u000d\u000a        quantitative concentration\u000d\u000a        predictions provided by the London VAAC for the ICAP European and North\u000d\u000a        Atlantic Volcanic Ash\u000d\u000a        Contingency Plan\" [e]. Sparks also emphasised the importance\u000d\u000a      of near-source fall out of ash\u000d\u000a      caused by aggregation, which has helped the Met Office to increase their\u000d\u000a      confidence in the\u000d\u000a      standard approaches used, and to obtain a better understanding of the\u000d\u000a      variability that might be\u000d\u000a      expected for different eruptions [e]. At these meetings, Aspinall\u000d\u000a      led the discussion over concerns\u000d\u000a      that Katla (a volcano close to Ejyafjallaj&#246;kull with apparent\u000d\u000a      near-simultaneous historical eruptions)\u000d\u000a      could be triggered, and determined a likelihood for (i) a larger future\u000d\u000a      eruption, (ii) the importance of\u000d\u000a      including volcanic ash clouds in the national risk register [b,f],\u000d\u000a      and (iii) the need to better integrate\u000d\u000a      (and assimilate) satellite observations into Lagrangian dispersion models.\u000d\u000a      It has been recognised\u000d\u000a      by the UK's Department for Transport that \"the advice given by SAGE\u000d\u000a        following the eruption played\u000d\u000a        an important part in the Government's immediate response, with the\u000d\u000a        expertise of its members\u000d\u000a        helping establish the evidence base needed to make difficult operational\u000d\u000a        decisions\" [b].\u000d\u000a    Clear pull-through is demonstrable from the recommendations of SAGE and\u000d\u000a      the Volcanic Ash\u000d\u000a      Observations Review Group (VAORG), with \"short-, mid- and long-term\u000d\u000a        goals being set by VAORG\u000d\u000a        for the London VAAC (based at the Met Office) for improving UK volcanic\u000d\u000a        ash resilience\" [b]. In\u000d\u000a      particular, the initial report (2011) from the VAORG to the Secretary of\u000d\u000a      State lists four main\u000d\u000a      recommendations to which the only three academics on the committee\u000d\u000a      (Watson, Sparks and\u000d\u000a      Aspinall) clearly spoke; these are to (i) constrain and reduce uncertainty\u000d\u000a      (Sparks, Aspinall), (ii)\u000d\u000a      improve observations and their usage, particularly for satellite\u000d\u000a      observations (Watson), (iii) develop\u000d\u000a      a priori source term development (Sparks), and (iv) utilise `expert\u000d\u000a      elicitation' (Aspinall). This last\u000d\u000a      point details the use of a method that pools the opinions of a group of\u000d\u000a      specialists, using differential\u000d\u000a      weights based on empirical testing of their abilities to judge accurately\u000d\u000a      any relevant uncertainties\u000d\u000a      [3,5]. The goal is to quantify relevant uncertainties for\u000d\u000a      appropriate inclusion in decision-making.\u000d\u000a      Consequently, it has been acknowledged that \"the specific sector\u000d\u000a        knowledge of Bristol University\u000d\u000a        staff...has been a key factor in their [sic (SAGE and VAORG's)]\u000d\u000a        effectiveness\" [b], and \"the input\u000d\u000a        of Prof. Sparks, Dr Watson and Dr Aspinall played an important role in\u000d\u000a        this forum through\u000d\u000a        enhancing understanding, quantifying risks and uncertainties, and\u000d\u000a        enabling sound decision-making\"\u000d\u000a      [e]. As a result, \"a number of these recommendations have been\u000d\u000a        carried out, resulting in\u000d\u000a        improved modelling and forecasting capabilities, leading to a more\u000d\u000a        resilient aviation sector\" [b].\u000d\u000a    The Icelandic crisis was international news for weeks.

These include,\u000d\u000a      for TV: Sky News, CNN, Channel 4 News, France24, BBC News 24; radio: BBC\u000d\u000a      Radio 4's Today\u000d\u000a      Programme and World at One, CBS, NPR (which operates a 38-station regional\u000d\u000a      radio network in\u000d\u000a      the US serving a regional population of 5 million people), BBC Radio\u000d\u000a      Bristol, LBC, ABC Australia,\u000d\u000a      and print: New York Times, Daily Express, El Pais, LA Times, Reuters, and\u000d\u000a      Veja (a weekly news\u000d\u000a      magazine in Brazil, the fourth most circulated in the world). As a result,\u000d\u000a      millions of the public were\u000d\u000a      informed about the crisis and were able to make better informed decisions.\u000d\u000a    \"The Met Office and London VAAC have benefited directly from the work\u000d\u000a        of and our interactions\u000d\u000a        with...the School of Earth Sciences\" [e]. Whilst the Met\u000d\u000a      Office already uses the `Sparks curve' to\u000d\u000a      estimate mass eruption rate, Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull and Grimsv&#246;tn presented very\u000d\u000a      different challenges in\u000d\u000a      terms of determining both an accurate mass eruption rate and particle size\u000d\u000a      distribution. \"During\u000d\u000a        both eruptions Sparks directed discussion on accurately estimating,\u000d\u000a        based on his knowledge of\u000d\u000a        how weak plumes are influenced by wind and how fragmentation processes\u000d\u000a        control downwind\u000d\u000a        particle size\" [e]. The School's interactions with the\u000d\u000a      London VAAC have been communicated to\u000d\u000a      other VAACs around the globe [g], particularly around using the\u000d\u000a      `Sparks curve' adroitly. For\u000d\u000a      instance, throughout the 2011 Grimsv&#246;tn eruption, Sparks \"was a key\u000d\u000a        member of a new source\u000d\u000a        refinement science group arranged by the Met Office to elicit expert\u000d\u000a        advice and input on this\u000d\u000a        complex issue as part of the London VAAC operational response\" [e].\u000d\u000a      Interactions between the\u000d\u000a      Met Office and Bristol is illuminating fundamental near source volcanic\u000d\u000a      processes and has resulted\u000d\u000a      in the generation of a real world web based tool to improve VAAC\u000d\u000a      assessment and evaluations [g].\u000d\u000a      These interactions typify best practice in terms of academic-operational\u000d\u000a      relationships [e]. The\u000d\u000a      underpinning research conducted by Bristol researchers has \"made an\u000d\u000a        ongoing contribution to the\u000d\u000a        research base and directly to decisions regarding operational\u000d\u000a        developments associated with\u000d\u000a        volcanic ash monitoring and forecasting...which is a major step forward\u000d\u000a        in national capability\" [e].\u000d\u000a    Socio-economic impact born of Bristol's research extends beyond\u000d\u000a      interaction with politicians,\u000d\u000a      decision makers and the public. Immediately after the Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull\u000d\u000a      crisis, Dr Kearns was asked\u000d\u000a      by British Airways to investigate potential volcanic ash using microscopic\u000d\u000a      techniques. Results of\u000d\u000a      energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis on particulate material adhering to\u000d\u000a      various external surfaces\u000d\u000a      of several British Airways aircraft (leading edges of wings, jet cowlings,\u000d\u000a      windscreens), suggest that\u000d\u000a      amongst a range of materials found, many particles &lt;3 microns had a\u000d\u000a      composition similar to that\u000d\u000a      known to have erupted at Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull. Engine manufactures also have a\u000d\u000a      critical position in\u000d\u000a      hazard mitigation. Whilst improvements in detection and prediction\u000d\u000a      (developed in part through\u000d\u000a      Bristol's research) are demonstrable, if the amount of ash that causes\u000d\u000a      engine failure is highly\u000d\u000a      uncertain, hazard mitigation remains significantly more challenging.\u000d\u000a      Bristol researchers have built\u000d\u000a      an excellent partnership with Rolls-Royce through interaction with the\u000d\u000a      engineering team\u000d\u000a      responsible for environmental engine protection which \"has been\u000d\u000a        invaluable in our understanding\u000d\u000a        of ash cloud detection and modelling.

Several strands of underpinning\u000d\u000a      research place the\u000d\u000a      School's academics at the forefront of their disciplines, and through\u000d\u000a      that, at the focal points of\u000d\u000a      discussion during and after the Icelandic ash crises. Specifically, these\u000d\u000a      include the interpretation of\u000d\u000a      fine ash in deposits [1,2], the fragmentation and dispersion of\u000d\u000a      ash [1,4], statistical prediction of\u000d\u000a      volcanic eruptions and repose periods [5], volcanic plume dynamics\u000d\u000a      [1], expert elicitation [3,5],\u000d\u000a      Scanning Electron Microprobe (SEM) analysis of volcanic ash and glass [6],\u000d\u000a      and satellite\u000d\u000a      observations of ash clouds [4]. Contributions from Bristol Earth\u000d\u000a      Sciences researchers are\u000d\u000a      described below:\u000d\u000a    Fragmentation, dispersion and deposition of volcanic ash are three\u000d\u000a      fundamental processes that\u000d\u000a      dictate an ash cloud hazard's severity and extent. The School,\u000d\u000a      particularly Prof. Sparks, is\u000d\u000a      responsible for seminal works on (i) mechanistic interpretation of ash\u000d\u000a      layers in volcanoclastic\u000d\u000a      deposits, (ii) relationships between clast size, column height and mass\u000d\u000a      eruption rate, and (iii) the\u000d\u000a      fluid dynamical behaviour of volcanic plumes and clouds [1]. Of\u000d\u000a      several key parameters,\u000d\u000a      composition and grain size in particular have a profound effect on the\u000d\u000a      impact felt by drifting ash\u000d\u000a      clouds during both airborne and depositional phases. Grain size and\u000d\u000a      composition can be quantified\u000d\u000a      using an SEM. Specifically, Dr Kearns' experiments, using novel techniques\u000d\u000a      in electron microscopy\u000d\u000a      including cryogenic electronprobe microanalysis, have been applied to a\u000d\u000a      range of volcanogenic\u000d\u000a      materials, and to the quantitative analysis of volcanic glass [6].\u000d\u000a      Using these techniques it is\u000d\u000a      possible to assess the likely risk posed to populations upon exposure, a\u000d\u000a      particular problem when\u000d\u000a      fine, carcinogenic ash can be regularly remobilised [2]. At the\u000d\u000a      other end of the observational scale,\u000d\u000a      satellite remote sensing provides a synoptic perspective that facilitates\u000d\u000a      whole-cloud observation\u000d\u000a      [4].\u000d\u000a    The Bristol volcanology remote sensing group, led by Watson, has\u000d\u000a      developed new instruments and\u000d\u000a      techniques for making high-resolution measurements of volcanic species [4],\u000d\u000a      and has used these\u000d\u000a      to improve understanding of physical process and constrain uncertainty in\u000d\u000a      observations of ash\u000d\u000a      clouds. Such observations proved vital during crises, and techniques\u000d\u000a      developed by Watson and\u000d\u000a      others are used routinely worldwide by Volcanic Ash Advisory Centres\u000d\u000a      (VAACs). The final strand of\u000d\u000a      research expertise the group offered during this crisis pertains to the\u000d\u000a      use of statistics to quantify\u000d\u000a      risk [3,5]; their contributions pertinent to aircraft hazard\u000d\u000a      mitigation are based upon statistical\u000d\u000a      analysis of eruption likelihood given historical evidence, and the\u000d\u000a      formalisation of decision making\u000d\u000a      during crises through expert elicitation [5].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40237","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3595528","Name":"Guatemala"},{"GeoNamesId":"3595528","Name":"Guatemala"},{"GeoNamesId":"3578097","Name":"Montserrat"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    In 1995, and almost overnight, Montserrat became dependent on\u000d\u000a      volcanological expertise, with\u000d\u000a      authorities needing advice to determine warning levels, travel\u000d\u000a      restrictions and evacuations.

For instance,\u000d\u000a      their expertise has been used to\u000d\u000a      quantify volcanic risk which \"enabled the UK and Montserrat Government\u000d\u000a        to start a more rational\u000d\u000a        plan for responding to the volcano, and in particular it assisted the\u000d\u000a        early stages of planning longer\u000d\u000a        term facilities in the North of the island to enable those who did not\u000d\u000a        wish to evacuate to remain on\u000d\u000a        island\" [a]. These decisions can be attributed directly to\u000d\u000a      Bristol researchers and continues to have\u000d\u000a      a  \"profound impact on the safety of the island's inhabitants\" [d].\u000d\u000a      Indeed, the Head of Disaster\u000d\u000a      Management for the UK Overseas Territories has stated; \"I have no\u000d\u000a        doubt that the hazard maps,\u000d\u000a        educational programmes, daily scientific reports in language that the\u000d\u000a        community understood and\u000d\u000a        close co-operation with the Government of the day, resulted in scores or\u000d\u000a        more of lives being\u000d\u000a        saved\" [a].\u000d\u000a    There are multiple lines of evidence of how Bristol's research is linked\u000d\u000a      to policy and decisions on\u000d\u000a      Montserrat. One current example is sand mining [d,e]. In the last\u000d\u000a      few years, sand mining has\u000d\u000a      become an important source of income for Montserrat. However, these\u000d\u000a      activities have caused\u000d\u000a      some environmental concerns, including destruction of the main roads from\u000d\u000a      truck movements, road\u000d\u000a      safety, and noise and dust nuisance to residents. One solution is to\u000d\u000a      develop the port at Plymouth\u000d\u000a      for export, however this brings workers into a potentially hazardous\u000d\u000a      region, despite volcanic activity\u000d\u000a      being classified as `low' for the last 2 years. Consequently, the SAC and\u000d\u000a      MVO were commissioned\u000d\u000a      by the Government of Montserrat National Disaster Preparedness and\u000d\u000a      Advisory Committee to\u000d\u000a      assess risks in relation to airport operations and commercial mining in\u000d\u000a      order to establish whether or\u000d\u000a      not various options were feasible. The SAC used knowledge of empirical\u000d\u000a      pyroclastic flow models\u000d\u000a      [6], and statistical frequency-magnitude relationships of dome\u000d\u000a      collapses to assess the risk and\u000d\u000a      quantify attendant uncertainties [5], using the formal expert\u000d\u000a      elicitation methods developed by\u000d\u000a      Aspinall [8]. Key research involving both current and former\u000d\u000a      Bristol PhD students supervised by\u000d\u000a      Sparks has also directly informed the estimates. From this work,\u000d\u000a      occupational risk levels to workers\u000d\u000a      were assessed and found to be 8-20 times higher than UK workers in the\u000d\u000a      extractive industries,\u000d\u000a      thus requiring additional efforts in monitoring and worker safety [b,e].\u000d\u000a      \"As a result, controlled export\u000d\u000a        of volcanic sand now takes place from the jetty in Plymouth\" [d].\u000d\u000a    The advice of Sparks and Aspinall through the RAP and SAC led to the\u000d\u000a      permanent establishment\u000d\u000a      of MVO with a dedicated building, employment of fifteen technical and\u000d\u000a      scientific staff and also\u000d\u000a      supports eight off-island administrative positions [a]. \"In a\u000d\u000a        population of only a few thousand, MVO\u000d\u000a        is a significant employer and a critical resource for the island and its\u000d\u000a        long-term sustainability\" [a].\u000d\u000a      Furthermore, the on-going monitoring and publicity around the Soufri&#232;re\u000d\u000a      Hills eruption has led to\u000d\u000a      this eruption being incorporated into the UK National Curriculum as a\u000d\u000a      G.C.S.E Geography case\u000d\u000a      study. The eruption and its mitigation policies have been studied by up to\u000d\u000a      962,238 school children\u000d\u000a      between 2008 and present [f].\u000d\u000a    The combination of volcanic process fundamentals (under Sparks), and\u000d\u000a      modelling of risk (under\u000d\u000a      Aspinall), provides the foundation of the risk assessment methodology that\u000d\u000a      has been applied\u000d\u000a      successfully on Montserrat since 1995. The MVO has established a testbed\u000d\u000a      for new monitoring\u000d\u000a      tools, including those that measure volcanic gases, deformation,\u000d\u000a      seismology and strain. More than\u000d\u000a      that, its management and decision making processes (designed and\u000d\u000a      implemented by Aspinall), are\u000d\u000a      still being used today, and tested and trialled worldwide in volcanic\u000d\u000a      settings as diverse as\u000d\u000a      Guatemala and Tristan de Cunha. This underscores the importance (and\u000d\u000a      ethos) of knowledge\u000d\u000a      sharing and risk reduction worldwide that is a leitmotif throughout the\u000d\u000a      work of Sparks and Aspinall;\u000d\u000a      \"the University of Bristol volcanology group have led some of the major\u000d\u000a        research themes globally\u000d\u000a        that feed into the day-to-day operations of volcano observatories. For\u000d\u000a        example, the work of\u000d\u000a        Professor Steve Sparks... has led to improved knowledge transfer on\u000d\u000a        volcanic hazards and risk\u000d\u000a        assessment tools\" [g], and \"the research performed by the\u000d\u000a        group has led to improved decision\u000d\u000a        support and information transfer for the world's volcano community\"\u000d\u000a      [g].\u000d\u000a    To that end, as well as setting up MVO and facilitating its growth into a\u000d\u000a      world-leading observatory,\u000d\u000a      Aspinall and Sparks have co-authored a substantial report (2011)\u000d\u000a      describing where this very\u000d\u000a      knowledge is most needed, as part of the Global Facility for Disaster\u000d\u000a      Reduction and Recovery\u000d\u000a      (GFDRR) [h]. The GFDRR was launched in 2006 by the World Bank as a\u000d\u000a      partnership between the\u000d\u000a      UN, donors and developing countries. It was established to help developing\u000d\u000a      countries, particularly\u000d\u000a      those identified as the most vulnerable natural disaster `hotspots', to\u000d\u000a      build their capacity for\u000d\u000a      disaster prevention, emergency preparedness, response, and recovery. The\u000d\u000a      report [h] presents\u000d\u000a      the results of a pilot study on the risk posed by volcanoes in the\u000d\u000a      priority countries of the GFDRR\u000d\u000a      and the World Bank and helps unveil how volcanic risk can impact the\u000d\u000a      social and economic profiles\u000d\u000a      of vulnerable countries; \"The aim of the study was to establish\u000d\u000a        science-based evidence for better\u000d\u000a        integration of volcanic risks in national Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR)\u000d\u000a        programmes in priority\u000d\u000a        countries, as well as regional cooperation in DRR programmes for all\u000d\u000a        countries supported under\u000d\u000a        GFDRR\" [i]. Since its launch, GFDRR has responded to the\u000d\u000a      growing needs and demands of\u000d\u000a      countries, currently funding more than 120 disaster risk reduction (DRR)\u000d\u000a      and inter-related climate\u000d\u000a      risk management programs in many disaster-prone low and middle income\u000d\u000a      countries. GFDRR has,\u000d\u000a      according to their website, spent over $197M in overseas programmes since\u000d\u000a      its inception and this\u000d\u000a      aid has been guided, in part, by the report [j]. The World Bank\u000d\u000a      states, \"the findings of this study\u000d\u000a        have been important in informing the continued development of the GFRDD\u000d\u000a        country programs,\u000d\u000a        which guide our interventions in 31 priority countries around the world.\u000d\u000a        Through this study we have\u000d\u000a        been able to more accurately reflect volcanic risk in our programmatic\u000d\u000a        approach\" [j]. The GFDRR\u000d\u000a      report, specifically the methodology highlighted within it, has also\u000d\u000a      shaped the thinking, and actions,\u000d\u000a      of the United Nations itself; \"This evidence, and the method developed\u000d\u000a        is study, has been critical\u000d\u000a        for the development of the next Global Assessment Report (GAR15)...This,\u000d\u000a        in turn, will have a\u000d\u000a        direct impact to national governments, decision makers and\u000d\u000a        practitioners, as well as\u000d\u000a        implementation pathways for mainstreaming volcanic risk reduction into\u000d\u000a        policies and practice\" [i].\u000d\u000a    The work of Aspinall and Sparks in volcanic risk reduction has had impact\u000d\u000a      worldwide. Through the\u000d\u000a      MVO, they have developed an exemplar of both monitoring capability and,\u000d\u000a      critically, effective\u000d\u000a      decision making [a,d,g]. Through their work with the World Bank\u000d\u000a      and the United Nations they have\u000d\u000a      delimited the countries most at risk and, therefore, most in need of an\u000d\u000a      understanding of the best-practices\u000d\u000a      of an exemplary volcano observatory such as MVO [i,j]. The report\u000d\u000a      [h] \"has been a\u000d\u000a        timely contribution to our continuous efforts to reflect the latest\u000d\u000a        scientific understanding of disaster\u000d\u000a        risk n the programming of our funding to vulnerable countries.

Through a better understanding of both risk\u000d\u000a      and decision making, hazard managers\u000d\u000a      are better armed to make good, effective choices that reduce exposure to\u000d\u000a      volcanic hazards even\u000d\u000a      during crises and in periods of great uncertainty.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Novel methods in applied physical volcanology, such as expert\u000d\u000a      elicitation, and hazard and risk\u000d\u000a      assessment, developed mostly during the ongoing volcanic crisis at\u000d\u000a      Soufri&#232;re Hills Volcano\u000d\u000a      (Montserrat), continues to inform decision making, worker and public\u000d\u000a      safety, and management of\u000d\u000a      administrative hazard zones that control access.

Over the\u000d\u000a      past 30 years, but particularly since the onset of the eruption of\u000d\u000a      Soufri&#232;re Hills (1995), they have\u000d\u000a      focused on understanding both volcanic processes and the development of\u000d\u000a      methodologies to\u000d\u000a      assess volcanic hazard and risk with applications and impacts at global,\u000d\u000a      regional, national and\u000d\u000a      local scales. The research has been supported through a number of large\u000d\u000a      grants from both the\u000d\u000a      academic and private sectors including NERC [1,2], World Bank\/UN [3],\u000d\u000a      and the EC [4].\u000d\u000a    The breadth and depth of both Sparks' and Aspinall's research into both\u000d\u000a      physical volcanology [5,6]\u000d\u000a      and volcanic risk [7-10] is considerable.

During their tenure, a different,\u000d\u000a      unique, approach to\u000d\u000a      compiling scientific advice in the face of uncertainty was pioneered by\u000d\u000a      Aspinall through a\u000d\u000a      procedure of structured `expert elicitation' [8]. This method\u000d\u000a      pools the opinions of a group of\u000d\u000a      specialists, using differential weights based on empirical testing of\u000d\u000a      their abilities to judge accurately\u000d\u000a      relevant uncertainties. The goal is to quantify these uncertainties for\u000d\u000a      appropriate inclusion in\u000d\u000a      decision making. Aspinall trialled this methodology at the start of the\u000d\u000a      Soufri&#232;re Hills eruption &#8212; the\u000d\u000a      first time a formal elicitation procedure was used in a live volcanic\u000d\u000a      crisis [a].

Members of staff were able to undertake industrially sponsored\u000a      contract research on a full-time basis without teaching commitments or the\u000a      requirement to publish in the academic literature. This context, together\u000a      with experience of manufacturability, commercial and end-user issues\u000a      related to developing `real' sensor systems was attractive to sponsors\u000a      looking to undertake development work outside the scope or capacity of\u000a      their in-house staff and too commercially sensitive to be undertaken\u000a      within a `conventional' academic environment.\u000a    The nature of the impact\u000a    Three types of impact are claimed for the work undertaken by the\u000a      University of Bedfordshire:\u000a    (1) Sensor systems produced by the group enabled sponsors to generate\u000a      data (that was otherwise inaccessible or prohibitively expensive)\u000a      enabling, supporting or facilitating manufacturing processes that, in\u000a      turn, better satisfied their customer needs.\u000a    (2) Generation of intellectual property to enable sponsors to maintain\u000a      and\/or improve their products and\/or services.\u000a    (3) A general impact on the wider community through the uptake of the\u000a      redox-mediated whole cell biosensor approach to rapid toxicity assessment\u000a      invented by Prof. Rawson (Pollutant detector. GB Patent 2189605A).\u000a    Process or means through which the research led to the impact\u000a    University of Bedfordshire staff were able to work for, with and in\u000a      industry to: design and manufacture prototype sensor systems; work with\u000a      sponsors to test prototypes under `real' conditions; and, where necessary,\u000a      work with third parties to transfer technology and facilitate scale-up\u000a      from laboratory (thousands) to manufacturing (tens of thousands) prototype\u000a      production.\u000a    Details of the beneficiaries\u000a    Work carried out by the University of Bedfordshire on behalf of Johnson\u000a      &amp; Johnson led to the generation of intellectual property. Although it\u000a      is difficult to quantify the economic value, it has enabled the company to\u000a      protect and enhance its significant share of the billion dollar market for\u000a      blood glucose measurement systems. This is a market in which the company\u000a      is determined to remain a leading player which is why it continues to push\u000a      for the widest possible protection of the intellectual property generated\u000a      on its behalf by the University (Dr Saini, 5.1).\u000a    The association between Unilever Corporate Research and the sensor\u000a      research group at the University of Bedfordshire extended over many years\u000a      covering (amongst others) the technology programme at Unipath Diagnostics\u000a      and the Healthy Ageing programme (2005-2009) managed by Michael Catt\u000a      (5.2). A fundamental objective of the research programme was to examine\u000a      the feasibility of analysing biological fluids for vitamin C levels as a\u000a      surrogate indicator for fruit and vegetable intake. This work was\u000a      initiated in light of the associations found in the EPIC study (Int J\u000a        Epidemiology 37 2008 978-987). Vitamin C is routinely added\u000a      to foodstuffs and beverages and the sensors developed were deployed for\u000a      material quality assessment within the business, both in the UK and\u000a      elsewhere in the EU. Exploratory product concepts were well received in\u000a      qualitative professional and consumer research. The programme included\u000a      exploration of other relevant biomarkers that informed the Healthy Ageing\u000a      programme and, although the sensors have yet to be commercialised, there\u000a      is still considerable potential for rapid assessment of markers of dietary\u000a      intake and Professor Catt continues to collaborate with the University of\u000a      Bedfordshire (e.g. ref 3.3).\u000a    Indicators of the extent of the impact\u000a    The extent of the impact of the University of Bedfordshire work on\u000a      Johnson &amp; Johnson's business is reflected by the international scope\u000a      of the patent applications (China, US and IPO agencies; section 5). The\u000a      position is similar with respect to the work for Unipath\/Unilever (US and\u000a      IPO patents).

In June 2013 this involved\u000a      working with government officials from the wider Caribbean and the USA.\u000a      The Jamaican government has now agreed to the development and\u000a      implementation of more effective MPAs around its coastline, as discussed\u000a      at the recent Caribbean Challenge Initiative (5.3). To inform public\u000a      debate, Crabbe has often been interviewed on Jamaican radio about\u000a      environmental issues, most recently in August 2013 concerning the Portland\u000a      Bight Reserve near Kingston.\u000a    In Belize, this led to a capacity-building exercise around MPAs in the\u000a      Meso-American Barrier Reef, which involved both local NGO community\u000a      workers and the government fisheries department, the last so that\u000a      community engagement could be directly interfaced with fisheries\u000a      operations and policy. Personal action plans were developed to facilitate\u000a      the future of sustainable MPAs in the MesoAmerican Barrier Reef system. An\u000a      NGO participant said `For the first time we were able to engage with\u000a      someone from the Fisheries Department to make a significant change to reef\u000a      preservation'. A fisheries manager said `As a result of this exercise we\u000a      can collaborate to protect our reefs and enhance our fisheries'. The\u000a      capacity building case study, uniquely involving the participants to\u000a      directly make measurements of coral growth and recruitment on coral reefs,\u000a      has produced new ideas to improve organisation, management, education,\u000a      support, and policy development in MPAs in Southern Belize (5.5). All\u000a      participants felt that training and capacity building to key staff members\u000a      was important, since this enabled them to enhance their skills in the\u000a      field thus raising their standards to a certain level so as to perform\u000a      better. The participants have agreed to maintain iterations among and\u000a      between their constituent groups to ensure continued sustainability of\u000a      both the reef and the fishing practices.\u000a    Involvement of the Department of Fisheries in our capacity building has\u000a      resulted in direct transfer of information to the communities and the\u000a      Government. The Director of Fisheries later said `This was an important\u000a      undertaking which has resulted in increased GDP from our fishing\u000a      industry'. The personal action plans that were produced have been\u000a      implemented, and taken back into their constituent communities. A key\u000a      outcome of our work has been that in Southern Belize three NGOs TASTE\u000a      (Toledo Association for Sustainable Tourism and Empowerment), TIDE (Toledo\u000a      Institute for Development and Environment) and Friends of Nature have been\u000a      incorporated into a single self-governing organisation, which spans four\u000a      MPAs (Marine Protected Ares). This means that areas between MPAs which\u000a      were previously subject to illegal fishing activity are now monitored and\u000a      policed. The merger has enabled assessment and enforcement across four\u000a      different MPAs. It also means greater efficiency per unit area in terms of\u000a      MPA management. In summary, our approach as part of a complex relationship\u000a      linking an ecosystem-based approach to fisheries management has resulted\u000a      in greater engagement from all stakeholders (5.4 - 5.6).\u000a    CONTRIBUTION:\u000a      Both these examples, in Jamaica and Belize, have important economic\u000a      impacts, based on our work at the University of Bedfordshire. Belize has\u000a      the highest annual capture production &#8212; the annual volume of aquatic\u000a      species caught by country for all commercial, industrial, recreational and\u000a      subsistence purposes, in 2010, for countries in the Caribbean for which\u000a      data is available. In 2010, Belize had 11.86% of its territorial waters as\u000a      MPAs (compared to &lt;2% in 2000), again, the highest value in the\u000a      Caribbean where data is available. Having a large percentage of its\u000a      territorial waters as MPAs, and in a coordinated network, reflects in the\u000a      value of a country's fishing industry. Our research has influenced the\u000a      increasing development of MPAs in the Caribbean.\u000a    In Belize, the fishing industry contributed 7.2% of the county's GDP in\u000a      2001, and our new measures (implemented in 2012) have enabled more\u000a      efficient use of marine staff time, by employing NGO staff, as well as\u000a      increasing the numbers of fish and invertebrates caught legally and\u000a      sustainably by Belize fishermen. This has increased the valuable lobster,\u000a      conch and snapper catches by c. 15% by mid-2013 from its value of c. 850\u000a      tonnes in 2007. In Jamaica, fishing is more a cottage industry, while the\u000a      reefs are an important part of the tourist industry. The new co-operative\u000a      management plans as a result of our research have multiple benefits &#8212;\u000a      increase in yields for the local fishermen, and help preserve the reefs as\u000a      a part of Jamaican ecosystems, while attracting increasing numbers of\u000a      international tourists, now approaching 2 million per annum (5.6). In both\u000a      countries, the measures adopted as a result of our research have promoted\u000a      the resilience of the coral reefs to increasing global warming and climate\u000a      change as well as increased income from fisheries.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Our award-winning work (Aviva\/Earthwatch International Award 2006) on\u000a      measuring growth of corals in relation to climate and environmental\u000a      changes linked to capacity building has informed managers and\u000a      policy-makers in developing countries of the measures required for an\u000a      integrated system of conservation and management. In Jamaica, our research\u000a      on modelling coral growth linked to discussions with local stakeholders\u000a      and the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) showed that\u000a      implementation of co-operative management plans can allow reef ecosystems\u000a      to withstand major physical effects; these plans have been implemented. In\u000a      Belize, we worked with local Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and the\u000a      Fisheries Department to enable them to both measure and model coral reef\u000a      growth, and so develop methods for sustaining their reefs. Our work has\u000a      enabled reef managers in Jamaica and Belize to monitor their reefs and\u000a      they have put in place new Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) so that their\u000a      reefs can be protected in times of climate and environmental change.

Novel computational models for coral\u000a      growth were developed, working initially on reefs in Indonesia in the\u000a      Coral Triangle. This was possible because of the equipment, expertise in\u000a      computing, and facilities available at UoB. We quantified the\u000a      size-structure of populations and the growth rates of corals in the\u000a      Caribbean from 2000-2008 to test whether coral colonies on fringing reefs\u000a      near Discovery Bay (Jamaica) or those on the Meso-American Barrier Reef\u000a      (Belize) showed resilience in the face of multiple acute stressors of\u000a      hurricanes and bleaching, in addition to overfishing and land development\u000a      (3.1). There was a major Caribbean-wide bleaching event in 2005, which\u000a      resulted in major losses of living coral on Jamaican reefs in 2006 and\u000a      2007. At many reefs live coral cover increased in both 2007 and 2008.\u000a      These studies indicated good levels of coral resilience on the fringing\u000a      reefs around Discovery Bay in Jamaica. We also collaborated with an\u000a      Australian coral reef scientist (Mallela) in work on Tobago reefs which\u000a      supported the previous work in Jamaica and Belize (3.2). We then\u000a      collaborated with other coral reef scientists and the USA National Oceanic\u000a      and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) linking orbiting satellite data with\u000a      underwater observations to develop a predictive tool for coral bleaching\u000a      and mortality (3.3).\u000a    Work at the University of Bedfordshire then showed that there were\u000a      significant linear relationships between reef rugosity (three-dimensional\u000a      complexity) and the growth and survival of young corals. Our findings\u000a      suggested that three dimensional topography and complexity is important\u000a      for reef resilience and viability in the face of environmental stressors\u000a      such as bleaching, and also supported the idea that aggregated spatial\u000a      arrangements of corals can influence the outcome of inter-specific\u000a      competition and promote species coexistence, important in times of reef\u000a      recovery after disturbance (3.4). Our work using capacity building in\u000a      Belize (3.5) linked environmental and social science techniques to produce\u000a      action plans for reef managers. We developed a collaboration with\u000a      scientists at the Key Laboratory of Biodiversity and Systems Biology at\u000a      Fudan University (ranked 5th of all Chinese Universities) in\u000a      Shanghai, and studied metabolic robustness under environmental stress &#8212;\u000a      including high CO2 concentrations &#8212; using a novel method &#8212;\u000a      Minimization Of Metabolic Adjustment Dynamic Flux Balance Analysis\u000a      (M-DFBA). Our work suggested that highly cooperative regulation assures\u000a      the robustness of biological systems, and that there is closer cooperation\u000a      under perturbation conditions than under normal conditions (3.6). Further\u000a      developments of modelling coral reef growth and resilience in the\u000a      Caribbean ensued (e.g. 3.6). Our collaboration with Fudan University has\u000a      extended to other environmental areas of high impact, for example using\u000a      modelling to show industrial pollution in China due to transfer of\u000a      industry (Zheng, W., et al. 2013.

Before Bd, wildlife\u000a      disease was considered a specialist, peripheral subject of interest, but\u000a      is now firmly on the ecology\u000a      and conservation biology agendas.\u000a    Bd surveillance\u000a    As a result of his research into Bd, Cunningham was invited in\u000a      2006 to become a founder member\u000a      of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) amphibian disease ad\u000a        hoc group. This group\u000a      reviewed available research (much from IOZ) and unanimously agreed to\u000a      recommend that\u000a      amphibian chytridiomycosis be listed by the OIE. This was agreed by the\u000a      OIE General Session in\u000a      May 2008, making amphibian chytridiomycosis (along with ranaviral disease)\u000a      the first OIE-listed\u000a      amphibian pathogen [a]. This listing made chytridiomycosis\u000a      internationally notifiable and thus\u000a      subject to OIE standards, which aim to assure the sanitary safety of\u000a      international trade in live\u000a      amphibians and their products. A total of 178 Member Countries are\u000a      Signatories to the OIE - these\u000a      countries are now obliged to instigate surveillance and control measures\u000a      for chytridiomycosis. As a\u000a      result, a network of government agencies, research institutions, NGOs and\u000a      other parties have\u000a      developed regional and national surveillance schemes. Our work has led to\u000a      diagnostic labs for Bd\u000a      detection being set up and staff trained by Cunningham, Garner and Becki\u000a      Lawson (IOZ Research\u000a      Fellow) in several countries [b].\u000a    Since 2009, the European surveillance effort has been coordinated through\u000a      the IOZ via the RACE\u000a      project, which involves NGOs, universities and government agencies in 15\u000a      EU Member and\u000a      Associate States [c]. Data from this and other projects, including\u000a      the UK national Bd surveillance\u000a      project (commissioned by the UK conservation agencies and Defra and\u000a      conducted by Cunningham\u000a      in 2008 and 2011), are open access and used by disease researchers across\u000a      the globe. The\u000a      results of our 2008 UK Bd surveillance, which involved the\u000a      training and engagement of hundreds of\u000a      citizen science volunteers, led to Natural England requiring any protected\u000a      amphibians being\u000a      translocated to be tested for, and free of, Bd prior to issuing a\u000a      translocation licence [d]. The\u000a      surveillance results also led to Defra commissioning IOZ to conduct a\u000a      three-year study to\u000a      investigate the epidemiology of the pathogen in the UK, which will be used\u000a      to inform UK\u000a      government policy on the control of Bd in the UK.\u000a    International policy\u000a    Although amphibians are not listed in the Appendices of the Convention on\u000a      Migratory Species,\u000a      chytridiomycosis was one of the diseases that alerted the Convention on\u000a      Migratory Species (CMS)\u000a      Scientific Council to the importance of disease as a conservation threat\u000a      to wildlife, prompting the\u000a      adoption of two CMS Resolutions: 9.8 Responding to the Challenge of\u000a      Emerging and Re-Emerging\u000a      Diseases in Migratory Species, Including Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza\u000a      H5N1 (2008), and\u000a      10.22 Wildlife Disease and Migratory Species (2011). Resolution 9.8 led to\u000a      the creation of the\u000a      UNEP-CMS and FAO Co-convened Scientific Task Force on Wildlife and\u000a      Ecosystem Health. In\u000a      2012, Cunningham was technical editor for the disease factsheet on\u000a      amphibian chytridiomycosis\u000a      which formed part of the Ramsar Wetland Disease Manual (Ramsar Technical\u000a      Report No. 7),\u000a      produced by the Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust for the Ramsar Convention\u000a      (an international treaty on\u000a      the conservation of wetlands) [e].\u000a    Mitigating the effects of Bd\u000a    Research by Cunningham, Garner and their students have developed chemical\u000a      antifungal\u000a      treatments for Bd (primarily using Itraconazole) for captive\u000a      animals and these are now used by\u000a      zoos (e.g. by the Team Leader in Herpetology, ZSL London Zoo) and others\u000a      across the world.\u000a      Working with Defra, we produced a national risk assessment for Bd\u000a      in the UK - the first of its kind\u000a      in the world [f].\u000a    In 2008, Cunningham convened an international workshop in Dominica, from\u000a      which\u000a      representatives of nine governments in the region attended.

As leader of the\u000a      Pathology and Diseases Working Group of the IUCN Declining Amphibian\u000a      Populations Task Force,\u000a      he co-discovered a novel chytrid fungus causing a disease of amphibians,\u000a      and showed that a\u000a      common infectious cause of amphibian mortality was associated with\u000a      population declines on two\u000a      continents. This work was described in Nature (394, 418-419) as\u000a      \"an exemplary example of\u000a      international scientific collaboration\". Following on from this, IOZ\u000a      researchers demonstrated that\u000a      the infectious agent, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd),\u000a      a non-hyphal chytrid fungus that\u000a      produces the disease amphibian chytridiomycosis, is a major cause of\u000a      amphibian mortality,\u000a      population declines and species extinctions globally [1].\u000a    Since then, IOZ scientists have significantly advanced our understanding\u000a      of amphibian\u000a      chytridiomycosis through a wide range of projects. In 2003, Cunningham\u000a      worked with post-doctoral\u000a      researchers Trent Garner and Matthew Fisher on a NERC-funded project to\u000a      investigate the\u000a      ecological and genetic determinants of Bd emergence in European\u000a      amphibian populations. This\u000a      research demonstrated that chytridiomycosis is caused by a novel, emerging\u000a      fungus that arose\u000a      through substantial recombination and chromosomal copy number variation\u000a      and that post-emergence\u000a      disease dynamics are governed by an interaction between pathogen genotype,\u000a      host\u000a      species and community structure and a range of environmental factors,\u000a      including altitude, water\u000a      and air temperature, and salinity [2] [3]. Furthermore, IOZ\u000a      scientists showed that not all cases of\u000a      emergence result in amphibian declines or even mortality [2] and\u000a      conversely that exposure, even\u000a      in the absence of infection, can result in amphibian mortality.\u000a    Since 2004, projects co-founded by IOZ with Fisher, now a Professor at\u000a      Imperial College, have\u000a      revealed the extent of the global distribution of Bd and have\u000a      described infection in more than 500\u000a      amphibian species [4]. IOZ has been working in the Caribbean since\u000a      2003 and in Europe since\u000a      2007 to investigate the ecology and infection dynamics of Bd in\u000a      multi-species host communities.\u000a      This work has identified areas and amphibian taxonomic groups that are at\u000a      greater risk of disease\u000a      emergence and decline due to chytridiomycosis [5] and we have\u000a      shown how the introduction of\u000a      non-native species, translocations for conservation purposes and the\u000a      amphibian trade are all key\u000a      routes for the range expansion of Bd [6].\u000a    Our disease mitigation research is on-going, but has included\u000a      investigating safe treatments to cure\u000a      the disease in captive animals; whether field treatments can be used to\u000a      reduce the impact of the\u000a      disease on wild populations of Critically Endangered amphibians; whether\u000a      the impact of the\u000a      pathogen can be reduced through pre-exposure of animals to a hypovirulent\u000a      lineage of the fungus);\u000a      and whether restocking is a useful conservation tool following declines\u000a      due to chytridiomycosis [7].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42992","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Research Councils UK","Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The deep ocean is our planet's largest realm, in which we are all\u000d\u000a      \"stakeholders\" through our use of its resources and the environmental\u000d\u000a      impacts of our everyday lives. But beyond the research community, there is\u000d\u000a      limited awareness of deep-sea environments and their biodiversity. We have\u000d\u000a      therefore created an integrated programme of public engagement with our\u000d\u000a      research, to share ongoing discoveries in deep-sea science with a global\u000d\u000a      audience, and to inspire and inform specific communities of interest and\u000d\u000a      place with our work. This programme has been highlighted by Research\u000d\u000a      Councils UK as an example of \"best practice\" for generating impact from\u000d\u000a      research [5.1].\u000d\u000a    Our public engagement programme combines three elements. Firstly, we have\u000d\u000a      worked with the media to share the findings of our research with\u000d\u000a      non-academic audiences worldwide. At key milestones in our research\u000d\u000a      process &#8212; awards of funding, preparation for fieldwork expeditions,\u000d\u000a      discoveries during fieldwork, and publication of papers &#8212; we have\u000d\u000a      produced press releases and worked with science journalists to generate\u000d\u000a      extensive coverage by print, online, and broadcast news outlets [5.2].\u000d\u000a      In addition, we have collaborated with documentary-makers to produce TV\u000d\u000a      and radio programmes featuring our findings and research process.\u000d\u000a    Secondly, we have presented and discussed our research directly with\u000d\u000a      public audiences through a series of talks and events [5.3]. For\u000d\u000a      these \"face-to-face\" engagement activities, we have targeted four\u000d\u000a      \"communities of place\" and \"communities of interest\": (i) our local\u000d\u000a      communities in the southern UK; (ii) users of the marine environment, at\u000d\u000a      events such as the Southampton Boat Show; (iii) retirees \/ life-long\u000d\u000a      learners, through networks such as Probus and University of the Third Age;\u000d\u000a      and (iv) school pupils and teachers, including live video links to classes\u000d\u000a      from deep-sea research expeditions, and contributions to Continuing\u000d\u000a      Professional Development (CPD) events for teachers. Our direct engagement\u000d\u000a      programme has also included the production of exhibits such as a life-size\u000d\u000a      display of deep-sea hydrothermal vents, to engage people with our research\u000d\u000a      at venues such as a music festival and a regional airport.\u000d\u000a    Finally, we have developed a network of resources for online engagement.\u000d\u000a      This network consists of an interactive website [5.4] enabling\u000d\u000a      audiences to follow \"live\" updates from our fieldwork expeditions and ask\u000d\u000a      questions; Twitter feeds enabling direct dialogue with individual research\u000d\u000a      team members at sea; a YouTube channel delivering video highlights from\u000d\u000a      previously unseen deep-sea regions; and free eBooks distributed by iTunes,\u000d\u000a      WHSmiths.co.uk and other online outlets [5.5].\u000d\u000a    As the three strands of engagement activities are embedded in our\u000d\u000a      research process (shown in the timeline summary below), their impacts\u000d\u000a      during the REF period are underpinned by our most recent research outputs,\u000d\u000a      rather than earlier papers. Our direct and online programmes have also\u000d\u000a      captured feedback from audiences, using a variety of methods from comment\u000d\u000a      boxes to video interviews, to inform and refine further engagement, and\u000d\u000a      the benefits of our programme have been two-way, with audiences providing\u000d\u000a      insights and wider perspectives of issues related to our research.\u000d\u000a    \"Reach\" of impact for media engagement activities is quantified by\u000d\u000a      audience numbers, and coverage of our research has reached audiences of\u000d\u000a      millions worldwide.

These reports are important reference\u000a      documents for policy makers. The Environment Agency also commissioned and\u000a      has subsequently used the GENIE team's projections of millennial timescale\u000a      sea level rise [3.3] to inform planning for future coastal flood\u000a      risk and long-term waste management.\u000a    The stark implications of this research, that cutting emissions may not\u000a      be enough to avoid dangerous climate change, led to the initiation and\u000a      chairing by Shepherd of the Royal Society working group on geoengineering.\u000a      According to Richard Heap, former RS Senior Policy Adviser [5.1] \"A\u000a        number of geoengineering strategies were beginning to emerge, but there\u000a        was a clear gap in knowledge about their viability and potential\u000a        impacts. The proposal led by John Shepherd highlighted the need to\u000a        address this gap and the significant risks this posed, particularly in\u000a        the political arena.\" The Royal Society (RS) report (2009) [5.2],\u000a      which objectively and authoritatively assesses geoengineering strategies\u000a      and their associated effects, has become the global standard reference for\u000a      policy-makers, opinion formers and potential investors. In the words of\u000a      Professor David MacKay, Chief Scientific Advisor for Department of Energy\u000a      &amp; Climate Change (DECC) \"It has influenced research, stimulated and\u000a        informed discussion and influenced governments and policy-makers\u000a        worldwide\" [5.3]. An example is the Scoping Report Large-Scale\u000a        Intentional Interventions into the Climate System? Assessing the Climate\u000a        Engineering Debate produced by the Kiel Earth Institute for the\u000a      German Government which cites the RS Report heavily and credits it with \"attracting\u000a        attention beyond academic circles\". The Royal Society report's\u000a      publication prompted extensive media coverage (Independent, Times,\u000a      Financial Times, Guardian, Economist, Observer, New Scientist, BBC, 2009,\u000a      2010, 2011 [5.4]), and briefings for DECC Secretaries of State Ed\u000a      Miliband (20 July 2009) and Chris Huhne with Minister of State Greg Barker\u000a      (29 November 2010).\u000a    \u000a    Figure 2: Geoengineering Strategies &#8212; Affordability and Effectiveness,\u000a        from [5.2]\u000a    \u000a     The report's emphasis on the need for international governance of\u000a      geoengineering led to Shepherd being invited to testify to a hearing by\u000a      the US House of Representatives' Committee on Science and Technology on 5\u000a      November 2009 to examine geoengineering [5.5]. In March 2010 the\u000a      House of Commons Science and Technology Committee also published the\u000a      report of an enquiry, The Regulation of Geoengineering, which\u000a      repeatedly cites the Royal Society report as evidence [5.6]. On 3\u000a      October 2011 the US Bipartisan Policy Committee (an NGO serving both\u000a      Houses of Congress and all political parties) published the report of a\u000a      study (to which Shepherd had been the sole foreign contributor) building\u000a      on the Royal Society report and recommending a major US research programme\u000a      in the area [5.7]. The UK government now has an interdepartmental\u000a      committee on geoengineering and an official position that follows the RS\u000a      report closely [5.8]. In addition, the IPCC also subsequently held\u000a      a special Joint Expert Meeting on Geoengineering in Peru in June 2011, and\u000a      referred extensively to the Royal Society report [5.9].\u000a    The Royal Society report asserted that public attitudes towards\u000a      geoengineering should be a critical factor in considering the future of\u000a      geoengineering &#8212; specifically whether (and if so how) the public think\u000a      that these technologies should be taken forward. This led NERC to invest\u000a      &#163;155,000 in the Ipsos MORI geoengineering public dialogue exercise, Experiment\u000a        Earth, in spring 2010 [5.10]. This gave 90 members of the\u000a      public, recruited at three centres around the UK, the chance to inform\u000a      future NERC decision-making on geoengineering. Each recruit attended 2\u000a      daylong workshops, with a subset attending a further event at Southampton\u000a      where Professors Damon Teagle and Richard Lampitt (NERC-NOCS) gave\u000a      presentations on potential geoengineering projects. The report of this\u000a      study presents a number of recommendations; for NERC and other research\u000a      funders and decision makers, for future public engagement on\u000a      geoengineering research and for communicating climate science.\u000a    Shepherd regularly engages with the public through popular science\u000a      articles (for example the Guardian 2011 Geoengineering: we need more\u000a        evidence before we cast our vote) or through frequently accepting\u000a      invitations to speak to a wide range of audiences who want to be informed\u000a      about geoengineering issues, in the UK and abroad. Venues include the\u000a      Royal Society, Oxford University, National Theatre, village halls and\u000a      Museum of Madrid (Fundacion Banco Santander public lecture), several of\u000a      these lectures are freely available online [5.10].\u000a    Since its publication the Royal Society report has been an important\u000a      reference in numerous public information documents produced by Governments\u000a      and International Organisations [5.10], for example in Australia (Geoengineering,\u000a      Occasional Paper Series, Issue 1.

This\u000a      threatens rapid and damaging global impacts, including floods, food\u000a      shortages and extreme weather. It is one of society's greatest challenges.\u000a      The 2006 Stern\u000a    Review estimated its overall costs at equivalent to losing at least 5% of\u000a      global GDP annually. Predicting the Earth's response to rising CO2\u000a      levels is essential to allow society to respond and adapt, but\u000a      conventional climate models are too complex and expensive for very\u000a      long-term investigations. During the late 1990s researchers at the\u000a      National Oceanography Centre Southampton (NOCS) (which brought together\u000a      two University of Southampton (UoS) departments and two NERC institutes)\u000a      recognised the need for more efficient models, that would permit the large\u000a      number of very long simulations required to undertake such long term\u000a      modeling investigations and quantify uncertainty. Funded by Natural\u000a      Environment Research Council (NERC), Bob Marsh (PhD student and then\u000a      researcher, UoS 1991-present), Neil Edwards (Research Fellow, UoS,\u000a      1997-2000) and John Shepherd (Professor of Marine Science, UoS, 1994-\u000a      present) developed a novel and efficient ocean-atmosphere model\u000a      (C-Goldstein). This became the core of the coarse resolution Grid Enabled\u000a      Integrated Earth system model (GENIE). Models of the land surface, the\u000a      cryosphere and other parts of the Earth system were then developed and\u000a      added, in collaboration with the Universities of Reading, Bristol, and\u000a      East Anglia and others between 2002 and 2005. Its first results were\u000a      published in late 2004 and 2005 [3.1], [3.2]. GENIE-class\u000a      models can run far faster than full climate models, permitting simulations\u000a      over many thousands (up to a million) years, yet retaining sufficient\u000a      complexity to give reasonably realistic quantitative and\u000a      spatially-resolved results. Research at Southampton and elsewhere [3.3]\u000a      quantified the extent of the fossil fuel \"hangover\", showing that the\u000a      effects of CO2 emissions may persist for many millennia after\u000a      they end, and that reducing emissions may not suffice to avoid dangerous\u000a      climate change.\u000a    \u000a     Figure 1: 1000 year simulations of global warming using the GENIE\u000a        Earth System model, from [3.3], coloured lines represent a range of\u000a        plausible CO2 emission scenarios.\u000a     \u000a     This led Professor Shepherd to initiate and co-chair a Tyndall Centre\u000a      Cambridge-MIT workshop, Macro-engineering Options for Climate Change\u000a        Management &amp; Mitigation in 2004, which stimulated serious\u000a      scientific consideration of geoengineering in the UK, and eventually led\u000a      to the Royal Society study of 2009 (see section 4).\u000a    An additional important aspect of GENIE was that for the first time it\u000a      enabled innovative work using large ensembles (collections of thousands)\u000a      of similar model runs to make formal statistical assessments of the\u000a      uncertainty in long-term climate projections (e.g. [3.1]).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42994","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2328926","Name":"Nigeria"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The nature of our work on seabed and near surface imaging and\u000a      interpretation provides us with\u000a      wide reaching and significant impact across national and international,\u000a      commercial and\u000a      government sectors including: sonar product development; marine cultural\u000a      heritage management;\u000a      mineral resource management and assessment; expert analysis to major\u000a      offshore infrastructure\u000a      projects; military and law enforcement support; and commercial and\u000a      military sector training:\u000a    a.

The Crown Estate Advisors &#8212; Geological: In addition to\u000a      work on archaeological sites our\u000a      expertise in near surface imaging and analysis of mineral resources has\u000a      been strongly endorsed\u000a      by the Head of Mineral and Infrastructure at The Crown Estate [5.5]\u000a      who summarised our impact\u000a      as follows: \"When I took on the role of Head of Minerals and\u000a        Infrastructure at The Crown Estate\u000a        they (UoS) were the natural choice to bring into our network of\u000a        experts to provide rapid and\u000a        professional advice on all aspects of seabed geology. The recent work\u000a        they have undertaken on\u000a        the sand resources of the Thames Estuary [5.6] currently\u000a        underpins our internal strategy of\u000a        resource management for this critically important area\". Marine\u000a      aggregate resources represent\u000a      revenue of c. &#163;15-20 million per annum to the Crown Estate.\u000a    d. Offshore Marine Infrastructure Development and Resource\u000a          Assessment: approaches to\u000a      the acquisition and analysis of geological and geophysical data for\u000a      cultural heritage management\u000a      have been adopted by two major environmental and engineering consultancy\u000a      firms AMEC Ltd. (a\u000a      FTSE 100 company with offices and projects in 40 countries) and Ramboll\u000a      Ltd. (190 offices in 21\u000a      countries). With AMEC, Dix and Sturt have led the marine archaeological\u000a      component of two major\u000a      nuclear power station re-developments (Hinkley Point C and Sizewell,\u000a      client EDF, 2009-2016), and\u000a      with Ramboll they are responsible for the entire marine archaeological\u000a      component of the largest\u000a      UK offshore windfarm which is currently being built &#8212; the London Array\u000a      (Dong Energy, EoN and\u000a      Masdar). When fully operational this windfarm will represent 7% of\u000a      Government's 2015 targets for\u000a      renewable sources. As stated by an Associate Director of AMEC Environment\u000a      and Infrastructure\u000a      UK [5.7] \"The approach to environmental impact assessment for\u000a        the marine archaeological record\u000a        developed by the UoS and used in collaboration with AMEC on the Hinkley\u000a        Nuclear Power Station\u000a        has been very well received by both the client (EDF) and the regulator\u000a        (EH). The success has\u000a        been such that we are spinning out the approach to projects not just in\u000a        the UK but across our\u000a        global company.\" In addition, Dix and Sturt have also provided\u000a      expert marine archaeological\u000a      support to major submarine pipelines and telecommunication routes (e.g.\u000a      the GLO-1 Cable route\u000a      Britain &#8212; Nigeria 2007-2008 and the Coots pipeline to the North Sea Carbon\u000a      Storage facility off\u000a      Teesside, 2008, both with METOC Ltd) and international power cables (e.g.\u000a      Britned, 2004-2005:\u000a      Britain &#8212; Netherlands). In 2013, Dix and Sturt established a spin-out\u000a      group (Coastal and Offshore\u000a      Archaeological Research &#8212; Southampton) with c. &#163;320k of projects already\u000a      in place.\u000a      Dix and Sturt also led the geological and archaeological component of the\u000a      Outer Thames Regional\u000a      Characterisation project. This was one of four Regional Environmental\u000a      Characterisation projects\u000a      commissioned by DEFRA as part of the Marine Environment Protection strand\u000a      of the ALSF. These\u000a      developed understanding of the seabed geology and the biological and\u000a      historic environment assets\u000a      of the most intensively used stretches of water on the UK shelf. This work\u000a      resulted in a publically\u000a      available report and WebGIS [5.8] which has had 830,750 hits since\u000a      June 2011. This work also fed\u000a      into the Marine Aggregate Regional Environmental Assessment initiative,\u000a      that provided a strategic\u000a      view of future marine aggregate extraction activities and their potential\u000a      cumulative and in-combination\u000a      effects to ensure that individual dredging permissions are suitably\u000a      informed. This\u000a      strategy has been endorsed by The Crown Estate and the Marine Management\u000a      Organisation.\u000a    e. Military and Law Enforcement support: following the\u000a      initial success of the 3D Chirp we were\u000a      approached by the Ministry of Defence in Salvage &amp; Marine Operations\u000a      to undertake a buried\u000a      object detection (including Unexploded Ordnance) survey in 3 Basin,\u000a      Devonport dockyard, prior to\u000a      its potential use as the storage site for the UK, decommissioned, nuclear\u000a      submarine fleet. This was\u000a      fully accomplished and a pre-use dredging strategy was successfully\u000a      derived (permission was\u000a      granted for this data to be used for publication [3.5]). Bull and\u000a      Dix were commissioned by the\u000a      Royal Navy (2002-present) to train staff and advise on the operations of\u000a      the Royal Navy's\u000a      hydrographic vessels. This included attending sea trials, teaching at HMS\u000a        Drake and onboard the\u000a      vessels, and the writing of the Standard Operating Procedures for Chirp\u000a      systems on the RN's fleet.\u000a      Dix has also modified the techniques developed at UoS for the\u000a      investigation of marine\u000a      archaeological sites for the underwater detection of buried cadavers in\u000a      response to requests from\u000a      both UK and international law enforcement agencies. As a consequence he\u000a      was made an Expert\u000a      Adviser for Hydro-Forensics for the Serious Organised Crime Agency [5.9]\u000a      and has, since 2008,\u000a      provided expert advice on 15 criminal cases both in the UK and abroad.

Over the last two\u000a      decades this work has extended to look at multiple aspects of near surface\u000a      archaeology and\u000a      geology of the continental shelf for both commercial and scientific\u000a      purposes:\u000a    a. RCUK Funded Research: Previous attempts by both the\u000a      academic and industrial communities\u000a      to image small buried artefacts in the marine environment met with limited\u000a      success due to\u000a      inappropriate equipment, inadequate data collection and processing\u000a      methods, and a dearth of\u000a      information on the acoustic properties of common archaeological materials.\u000a      UoS efforts to address\u000a      this began with Bull, Dix and Adam's Acoustic Methods in Archaeology\u000a      project. This project\u000a      involved pioneering the use of a high-resolution, sub-bottom profiling\u000a      system, 2D Chirp, to image\u000a      marine archaeological sites buried in the shallow subsurface. The ability\u000a      to reconstruct such buried\u000a      sites enhanced not only their intrinsic archaeological value but also\u000a      strategies of subsequent\u000a      heritage management. The results of this work were published in papers\u000a      that covered: the\u000a      development of the optimum Chirp processing flow; initial calculations of\u000a      the acoustic properties of\u000a      archaeological materials; the extraction of comparable physical properties\u000a      directly from the\u000a      acoustic data [3.1]; and the successful testing of these\u000a      approaches on two historic protected wreck\u000a      sites, the Mary Rose and the Invincible. Acknowledging the\u000a      inherent limitations of a 2D survey,\u000a      which samples data only from seismic waves travelling in one vertical\u000a      plane, UoS researchers (the\u000a      original team plus Henstock, Leighton and White) developed a new 3\u000a      Dimensional Chirp system\u000a      [3.2] to facilitate the sampling of the entire wave field in 3D and\u000a      so provide a more representative\u000a      visualisation of the subsurface. The crucial developmental break-through\u000a      that enabled the\u000a      collection of decimetre scale 3D volumes was solving how to position\u000a      source and receivers, in x, y\u000a      and z, at centrimetric accuracy, up to 10 km from a known absolute\u000a      position. This involved RTK\u000a      GPS, positioning source and receivers on a rigid array, and very careful\u000a      design of the system to\u000a      ensure that all timing was synchronised [3.2]. This project not\u000a      only included the development of the\u000a      new system, but also production of new Chirp waveforms to optimise\u000a      penetration and resolution in\u000a      a range of substrates and the collection of the first high resolution\u000a      (decimetre scale) 3D volumes\u000a      (from both geological and man-made sites). Subsequently, NERC and\u000a      UoS-supported PhD's\u000a      extended this work to develop additional methods for the extraction of the\u000a      physical properties of\u000a      sediments from acoustic data using attenuation techniques and the\u000a      collection of the first 3D volume\u000a      over an historic wreck site (the Grace Dieu) [3.3].\u000a    b. Government funded Research:\u000a    Additional funding for the application of both 2D and 3D Chirp to marine\u000a      archaeology was awarded\u000a      initially by the Royal Commission for Historical Monuments of England and\u000a      latterly the English\u000a      Heritage component of the Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund (EH-ALSF).\u000a      This supported both\u000a      the early phases of 3D Chirp development [3.2] and further\u000a      experiments to determine the acoustic\u000a      properties of a broader range of archaeological materials and how these\u000a      varied with their state of\u000a      preservation. Through an additional series of EH-ALSF funded projects the\u000a      marine geophysical\u000a      research work was extended (by Dix in collaboration with Sturt, UoS and\u000a      PhD students) to include\u000a      new marine geoarchaeological approaches to the investigation,\u000a      characterisation and interpretation\u000a      of the wider submerged archaeology (beyond wrecks) of the continental\u000a      shelf [3.4]. This work\u000a      includes recent investigations, with the Natural History and British\u000a      Museums, into the offshore\u000a      components of the oldest hominin occupation sites on the European\u000a      shelf. Further, Dix also led the\u000a      development of local and regional hydrodynamic and sediment transport\u000a      models specifically\u000a      designed for the management of both wreck and submerged landscape cultural\u000a      heritage assets.\u000a      The significance of this work has been recognised by Dix and Sturt being\u000a      editors of English\u000a        Heritage's 2013 Maritime Research Agenda and authoring a Chapter on\u000a      Marine Geoarchaeology.\u000a    c. Commercially Funded Research:\u000a    Technological aspects of 3D Chirp development (including the production\u000a      of a migration algorithm\u000a      for optimising the imaging and inversion of the 3D data) and additional\u000a      case studies on geological\u000a      targets (lacustrine debris flows) were funded by Kongsberg GeoAcoustics\u000a      Ltd. The latter work has\u000a      been extended (through funding of Vardy, UoS, by a Norwegian oil\u000a      industry consortium) to look at\u000a      marine slope stability mechanisms for offshore geohazards such as\u000a      underwater landslides.\u000a      Further, the MOD have funded a commercial project to use 3D Chirp to\u000a      identify the presence of\u000a      unexploded ordnance and other objects within a harbour basin [3.5].\u000a      Additionally, based on the\u000a      reception of the research work funded by the EH-ALSF scheme, the Resource\u000a      Management\u000a      Association (a consortium of Cemex UK Marine Ltd, Hanson Aggregates Marine\u000a      Ltd and Tarmac\u000a      Marine Dredging Ltd) funded a research project to develop both new\u000a      techniques of extracting\u000a      sediment transport data from swath bathymetry [3.6] and the use of\u000a      this data in hydrodynamic and\u000a      sediment transport models in the Eastern English Channel and the Severn\u000a      Estuary.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42996","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The 2008 finding, by a group led by Rohling, that global sea level could\u000a      rise 1.6 &#177;1 metres per century helped reshape the worst case scenarios\u000a      considered in planning documents worldwide. It provided the first\u000a      real-life estimates and in the UK helped to bring estimates down from very\u000a      high initial assumptions (UK Climate Projections UKCP09, [5.1];\u000a      Environment Agency (EA) Thames Estuary (TE) 2100 Plan [5.2]).\u000a      Assimilation of the work into planning arose from a combination of\u000a      scientific publications (which led to widespread international media\u000a      coverage across more than 400 news outlets) and active engagement at\u000a      expert workshops and conferences.\u000a    The UK's latest climate change projections present a \"sensible maximum\u000a        value\" for planning and flood risk assessments [5.1],\u000a      amongst others taken up by the EA [5.2]. The UKCP09's H++ scenario\u000a      warns of sea level rise between 0.93 and 1.9m by 2100; the upper estimate\u000a      directly relates to Rohling's estimates [5.1]. The EA uses values\u000a      of the H++ scenario in its flood risk management strategy for the Thames\u000a      Estuary, ensuring that its plans could cope with a sea level rise of 2 to\u000a      2.7 m; this \"reduction in worst case scenario for this century means\u000a        that a (proposed) tide-excluding estuary barrage will not be\u000a        necessary to manage flood risk this century and can be dropped from our\u000a        final options\" (TE2100 Plan [5.2]).\u000a    Rohling's research also informed the scientific underpinning of The\u000a      Netherlands' Delta Committee Report Working together with water: A\u000a        living land builds for its future [5.3], which presents an\u000a      integrated vision for the long term protection of the Dutch coast and its\u000a      hinterland extending to 2100 and beyond. The recommendations were\u000a      completed in 2008, presented to the Dutch Cabinet in 2010, ratified in\u000a      November 2011, and have been implemented since January 2012.\u000a    In New Zealand Rohling's work informed the 2008 report Climate\u000a        Change: Impacts on Dunedin, which recommended the adoption of a new\u000a      upper limit to sea level rise. These estimates, contained in Dunedin City\u000a      Council's Climate Change Predictions Policy (2011) are reflected\u000a      in council policies, for example increased minimum floor levels for new\u000a      buildings [5.4].\u000a    In Canada the British Columbia Ministry of Environment Climate Change\u000a        Adaptation Guidelines for Sea Dikes and Coastal Flood Hazard Land Use\u000a      (2012) make extensive use of Rohling's work (via the associated 2011 Draft\u000a        Policy Discussion Paper). Another contributor to this report Golder\u000a      Associates have used the new guidelines in their Harbourside development\u000a      in Vancouver and \"proposed a shoreline concept adapted for sea level\u000a        rise\". They also comment that \"Anticipating climate change is\u000a        now paramount for most land use and design projects\" [5.5].\u000a      Rohling's work is also used in Vancouver municipal authority's 2008 report\u000a      Vulnerability of Vancouver sewerage area infrastructure to climate\u000a        change and the City of Vancouver Climate Change Adaptation\u000a        Strategy (2012).\u000a    Other examples of a wide variety of uses include, Australia's Climate\u000a      Change White Paper (2008), the World Wildlife Fund's Arctic Programme\u000a      Report A closing window of opportunity &#8212; global greenhouse reality\u000a      (2008) and in the November 2012 World Bank report Turn down the Heat:\u000a      Why a 4 degree centigrade warmer world must be avoided.\u000a    Sustained public engagement has helped ensure that future sea level rise\u000a      remains at the forefront of public debate on climate change. Worldwide\u000a      media coverage (for example the BBC, Reuters, Chinapost.com) [5.6]\u000a      followed the online publication of [3.3] in December 2007 and [3.4]\u000a      in June 2009, resulting in continuing interactions with global broadcast\u000a      and print media, and email exchanges with the public. In December 2011 at\u000a      the American Geophysical Union Fall meeting (the world's largest\u000a      geophysical sciences conference), together with James Hansen and Ken\u000a      Caldeira, Rohling gave an hour-long press conference in which his\u000a      palaeoclimate research was covered [5.7]. This led to a USA Today\u000a      feature article [5.7] (referenced on its front page; 3.2 million\u000a      readers daily), which attracted 200+ reader\u000a      comments\/likes\/recommends\/tweets. The article was reproduced on ABC News\u000a      with 300+ audience comments\/likes\/recommends\/tweets, and led to a\u000a      nine-minute interview for Scientific American [5.8] (3.88 million\u000a      unique users per month).\u000a    Other dissemination efforts at focused workshops have included the\u000a      Challenger Society meeting on sea level change (Royal Society, Nov. 2010),\u000a      and a workshop at UNESCO's Venice office in 2010, which led to a UNESCO\u000a      report [5.9] looking at the future of Venice under climate change.\u000a    Rohling considers continued outreach directly to the wider public to be\u000a      important, because only education can change attitudes. In November 2011,\u000a      Rohling gave a keynote speech at a public engagement event on climate\u000a      change organised in Amsterdam by the Dutch media. It was attended by 300\u000a      members of the public and journalists. The debate was given extensive\u000a      coverage in the national daily newspaper NRC [5.10] (840,000\u000a      readers) and NRC.next (350,000 readers), as well as the climate blog of\u000a      Paul Luttikhuis, which has 20 million page views per month.

Around &#163;150 billion\u000a      of assets along the UK coastline are at risk from flooding, of which &#163;75\u000a      billion are in London alone. Consequently, most nations have developed and\u000a      implemented protection plans, using estimates of sea level rise based on\u000a      global warming scenarios.\u000a    However, there is a lack of data on the extent to which past sea level\u000a      rises exceeded present levels, prompting concerns that the world is\u000a      underestimating the scale of future sea level rise. Since the mid-1990s,\u000a      research by the University of Southampton at the National Oceanography\u000a      Centre, Southampton (NOCS), led by Eelco Rohling, Professor of Ocean and\u000a      Climate Change (1994-present), has developed with international\u000a      collaborators a new method of reconstructing sea level change by measuring\u000a      oxygen isotope ratios in fossils from the Red Sea. By studying how sea\u000a      levels changed during warmer periods between ice ages, a view has been\u000a      formed on how fast global ice volume\/sea level can change, with\u000a      implications for the future.\u000a    Prior to Rohling's methodology, first described in Nature in 1998\u000a      [3.1], researchers focused on fossil reefs to reveal the magnitude\u000a      of sea level peaks (highstands) of the past million years but could only\u000a      measure sea level lowstands back to the Last Glacial Maximum, 20,000 years\u000a      ago. The new method combined evidence of extreme high-salinity conditions\u000a      in the glacial Red Sea with a simple hydraulic control model of water flow\u000a      through the Strait of Bab-el-Mandab, which links the Red Sea to the Indian\u000a      Ocean. This new approach has produced sea level lowstand estimates\u000a      stretching back hundreds of thousands of years.\u000a    Supervised by Rohling and Dr David Smeed (NERC-NOCS), Mark Siddall\u000a      (University of Southampton PhD student 2001-2004) furthered the\u000a      methodology [3.2]. By combining oxygen isotope records from Red\u000a      Sea sediments with a hydraulic model of water exchange at Bab-el-Mandab,\u000a      the researchers could measure global sea level going back 470,000 years,\u000a      to an accuracy of &#177;6 m compared with previous ranges of &#177;15 m.\u000a    With the input of Research Assistant Katharine Grant (University of\u000a      Southampton 2005-present) the research matured to a complete record in\u000a      2008-2012 [3.3-3.5]. This included the first coherent estimate of\u000a      rates of sea level rise above the present, at 1.6 &#177;1 metres per century [3.3].\u000a      This has helped the UK government define their worst-case planning\u000a      scenario for future century-scale sea-level rises. Rohling's sea level\u000a      record for the past 520,000 years also revealed a strong correlation on\u000a      multi-millennial timescales between global sea level and Antarctic\u000a      temperature [3.4-3.5]. Rohling estimated that the sea level around\u000a      three million years ago &#8212; a period with near modern CO2 levels\u000a      &#8212; was 25 &#177;5m above the present. This indicates that future long-term sea\u000a      level rise could far exceed existing projections [3.4]. This was\u000a      supported by a major parallel effort led by Rohling, which established\u000a      that climate sensitivity to radiative forcing at that time was similar to\u000a      the present [3.6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42997","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The need for greater ingenuity in locating and extracting fossil fuels\u000a      has long been recognised in the face of the increasingly widespread\u000a      exploitation of the most obvious and easily accessible reserves. The\u000a      development of CSEM techniques at the University of Southampton has not\u000a      only made one of the most significant contributions ever to satisfying\u000a      this need: it has also given birth to an entirely new and commercially\u000a      viable industry. As noted by Chief Research Geoscientist at ExxonMobil\u000a      upstream research [5.1] \"The University of Southampton group\u000a        led by Martin Sinha and Lucy McGregor had a key role in the design and\u000a        successful completion of the first electromagnetic survey over a\u000a        hydrocarbon target in 2000. Subsequently this group have significantly\u000a        contributed to the development of the new CSEM industry\".\u000a    That industry continues to flourish today. This is illustrated by the\u000a      enduring success of the two spinout companies formed in the wake of the\u000a      first large-scale demonstration of CSEM and by the ever-growing evidence\u000a      of the technology's sustained value in the field of exploration.\u000a    Southampton's spinout firm, OHM, acquired Rock Solid Images, a company\u000a      specialising in rock physics and quantitative seismic interpretation, in\u000a      2007. Following divestment of the CSEM acquisition division of the company\u000a      (along with the OHM brand and name) the company was re-named Rock Solid\u000a      Images in 2010. It currently employs 45 staff [5.2]; Sinha stepped\u000a      down from the board in 2006. As an industry leader in the integration of\u000a      CSEM, seismic and well log data, RSI has provided services to clients\u000a      including international oil companies, small independents and national oil\u000a      companies.\u000a    The second company, EMGS, was formed in 2002 as a spinout from Statoil.\u000a      In 2011 EMGS acquired the former OHM acquisition division from its new\u000a      owners for over US$19 million. EMGS annual reports show that between 2008\u000a      and 2012 annual revenue has increased by over 70% from US$116 million to\u000a      greater than US$200 million, with a particularly large increase of 129%\u000a      between 2010 and 2011 [5.3]. In its 2012 annual report EMGS, which\u000a      currently employs more than 270 people states that more than 650 CSEM\u000a      surveys have been completed and observes: \"In recent years the\u000a        company's customers and large oil-consuming and gas-consuming nations\u000a        have perceived a growing and potentially lasting imbalance between the\u000a        supply of and demand for hydrocarbons. The demand for EM services\u000a        increased in 2011 and 2012.\"\u000a    This assertion is clearly supported by continued investment in survey\u000a      acquisition and analysis by a variety of oil majors (such as Statoil,\u000a      Shell, ExxonMobil and Chevron) and national oil companies (such as PEMEX,\u000a      Petrobras and Petronas). Since 2010 it has also been supplemented by a\u000a      number of studies that have highlighted CSEM's impact on exploration in\u000a      terms of substantially reducing risk and boosting success rates for\u000a      drilling - a particularly important benefit when companies cannot legally\u000a      book a surveyed site as an asset (for instance, for the purpose of\u000a      informing shareholders) until drilling has taken place.\u000a    For example, according to research published in The Leading Edge\u000a      [5.4] the monthly magazine of the Society of Exploration\u000a      Geophysicists, prospects that show a significant resistive anomaly are\u000a      approximately twice as likely to contain hydrocarbons than those that do\u000a      not. The study, the most extensive of its kind to date, said: \"It seems\u000a        a fair conclusion that the incorporation of CSEM data into [an] oil\u000a        company's work flow can significantly help de-risk prospects.\"\u000a    Research that appeared in May 2010 [5.5] in First Break,\u000a      a leading publication serving the geoscience and engineering community,\u000a      revealed that, conditional on non-commercial discoveries being counted as\u000a      dry wells, the drilling success rate is 50 per cent to 70 per cent for\u000a      wells drilled on prospects exhibiting a significant resistive anomaly -\u000a      compared with just five per cent to 14 per cent for wells drilled on\u000a      prospects without such an anomaly. The study concludes: \"The dollar\u000a        value of CSEM will show itself through a correct and repeated\u000a        application in a portfolio setting... The current empirical results\u000a        suggest a very significant value [for CSEM] in exploration settings.\"\u000a    ExxonMobil were one of the pioneers of CSEM (which they call R3M) in the\u000a      hydrocarbon industry. They apply the technology to improve success rates\u000a      of offshore exploration activities in deepwater, where a single wildcat\u000a      well can cost more than US$100 million. In the past 10 years, ExxonMobil\u000a      has acquired more than 70 marine surveys using CSEM technology, which has\u000a      accurately confirmed the predicted geological setting more than 70 % of\u000a      the time [5.6].\u000a    Shell use CSEM in favourable environments, including Tertiary plays.\u000a      Karman et al. (2011) report that they have drilled 27 wells on a selection\u000a      of 100 prospects mapped with CSEM since 2002. Of those 27, 22 were\u000a      discoveries (81% success rate, with an average pre-CSEM success rate for\u000a      these prospects of 47%), 17 had conclusive CSEM interpretations (defined\u000a      as those where a positive prediction was made). 15 of those that were\u000a      predicted to be discoveries were. The remaining two were predicted to be\u000a      dry and this was confirmed by drilling [5.7].\u000a    Southampton's work - which is currently continuing in collaboration with\u000a      Rock Solid Images and partners including oil major BP - has been\u000a      recognised with several awards and honours. In 2008 the Geological Society\u000a      of London presented Sinha with the William Smith Medal [5.8],\u000a      which is awarded annually for outstanding research in applied or economic\u000a      geology. In 2011 MacGregor was appointed the Society of Exploration\u000a      Geophysicists' Honorary Lecturer for Europe in acknowledgment of not only\u000a      her own contributions to the field of CSEM analysis and data integration\u000a      but also of CSEM's general impact and growing importance in reservoir\u000a      exploration and appraisal [5.9].

University of Southampton\u000a      (UoS) staff have played a pivotal role in devising, refining and applying\u000a      these revolutionary methods.\u000a    Electromagnetic surveying can determine directly whether a potential\u000a      hydrocarbon reservoir identified in seismic data has high or low\u000a      electrical resistivity. This is important, as the resistivity of\u000a      sedimentary rocks whose pore spaces are saturated with saline, aqueous\u000a      fluids is low - just a few times that of seawater - whereas the\u000a      resistivity of those whose pore spaces are predominantly filled with oil\u000a      or natural gas is much higher.\u000a    Southampton academics have led the world in CSEM for more than a decade [3.1-3.6].\u000a      Their contributions have included the development of survey geometries\u000a      that provide a diagnostic indicator of hydrocarbons' presence; a\u000a      deep-towed transmitter strong enough to overcome the signal attenuation\u000a      caused by seawater; and receivers of unprecedented sensitivity.\u000a    The first full-scale demonstration of this technology took place in late\u000a      2000. Professor Martin Sinha (Professor of Earth Sciences, 2000-2013) was\u000a      the scientific lead of a project conducted with Norwegian oil and gas\u000a      company Statoil and Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Southampton\u000a      provided the bulk of the equipment and crucial elements of the survey\u000a      design for the study, that was carried out on the RRS Charles Darwin,\u000a      offshore from Angola [3.2-3.4].\u000a    Other Southampton personnel included Dr Lucy MacGregor (NERC Research\u000a      Fellow, 2000-2002; co-founder of OHM, 2002) and Jenny Rust\u000a      (Instrumentation Engineer, 2000-2002; co-founder of OHM, 2002).\u000a      Southampton worked with Scripps to process, analyse, model and interpret\u000a      the data, and with Statoil and other partners, including ExxonMobil, to\u000a      verify the method. It became clear this was a surveying technique to\u000a      complement the existing seismic approach. The subsequent rush to\u000a      commercialisation resulted in two spinout companies: Southampton's\u000a      Offshore Hydrocarbon Mapping (OHM) and Statoil's EMGS, both founded in\u000a      2002.\u000a    UoS transferred the relevant technology, data analysis techniques and\u000a      software tools to OHM, and Southampton and OHM began working in tandem.\u000a      The company was floated on the London Stock Exchange's Alternative\u000a      Investment Market in 2004, when it was valued at &#163;49.3 million. From 2002\u000a      to 2006 Southampton and OHM defined, sought patent protection for, and\u000a      defended intellectual property generated by the research - a process that\u000a      included licensing and transferring patents to OHM.\u000a    Building on its earlier research, between 2003 and 2007 Southampton\u000a      optimised the quantitative analysis of co-located seismic and\u000a      electromagnetic geophysical datasets. This was achieved by developing\u000a      effective medium models that enabled the enhanced investigation of data\u000a      relating to sub-surface reservoirs. Sinha, Michelle Ellis (PhD student\u000a      2003-2008, post-doctoral researcher UoS 2008-2009, NERC-NOC 2009-2010,\u000a      then scientist and product manager OHM\/Rock Solid Images 2010-present),\u000a      Professor Tim Minshull (Professor of Geophysics) and Dr Angus Best\u000a      (Research Geophysicist, NERC-NOC) were involved in this work.\u000a    From 2007 to 2009 Sinha, MacGregor and Ellis developed higher-resolution\u000a      CSEM technologies through the HyPoMap (hydrocarbon pocket mapping) project\u000a      [3.6]. This work aimed to prolong the productive life of mature and\u000a      declining oil provinces, as well augmenting oil and gas recovery from\u000a      them. Ongoing research, led by Sinha, MacGregor and Best, has been focused\u000a      on acquiring and upscaling data from reservoir rocks with a view to\u000a      validating models of joint seismic-electrical properties.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42998","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Two major impacts can be traced from the Southampton SST research group:\u000a    A) The new capability to produce high-resolution blended SST datasets\u000a      through the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST) [5.1].\u000a      Such datasets have rapidly become an essential link in the data chain by\u000a      which ocean satellites improve the operational forecasting of\u000a      environmental conditions on land and at sea. They are used by US,\u000a      European, Japanese and Australian agencies to improve the reliability of\u000a      daily SST maps and hence weather forecasts.\u000a    B) The new use of shipborne radiometry to establish the absolute accuracy\u000a      of satellite SST measurements, traceable to international references,\u000a      allows global time series to be used with enhanced confidence for\u000a      monitoring the changes in spatial and temporal patterns of SST in response\u000a      to climate change.\u000a    A) Southampton's SST research activities contributed directly to the\u000a      creation of the GHRSST in 2002 through having trained its founding\u000a      director, Craig Donlon, and by supplying several Science Team members.\u000a      Their role in the successful evolution of GHRSST was to provide the\u000a      scientific understanding of temperature structure near the ocean surface.\u000a      This understanding was needed to underpin the procedures in the GHRSST\u000a      Data Specification which is the \"recipe\" for successfully blending data\u000a      from different satellites. Donlon et al. [3.3] describes the\u000a      challenge of persuading several major agencies to agree to a common\u000a      protocol for processing SST measurement from satellites. The newly\u000a      specified GHRSST products were first prototyped by the Medspiration\u000a      project [3.4] led from Southampton (2004-2008), that confirmed the\u000a      effectiveness of the GHRSST approach. Until this point global SST data\u000a      from individual satellite sensors had been inadequate for operational\u000a      applications requiring daily SST at fine spatial resolution. By 2008,\u000a      Medspiration data products, including AATSR data, were used routinely by\u000a      agencies around the world as the primary source for creating their own SST\u000a      analysis products. In 2009, the AATSR Exploitation Board acknowledged\u000a      that,\u000a    \"During the past two years, the operational use of (A)ATSR data has\u000a        taken a major step forward as a result of the ESA-funded Medspiration\u000a        project, the European backbone of GHRSST-PP\". \"A consensus view\u000a        is emerging that (A)ATSR data, although offering less coverage than\u000a        other sensors, are the most accurate available and can be used in\u000a        multi-sensor analysis schemes as the benchmark against which data from\u000a        other sensors can be bias-corrected\" [5.2]. Since 2008 the\u000a      UK Met Office has been producing their own daily global SST analysis,\u000a      OSTIA, that first grew from the availability of Medspiration products. The\u000a      Met Office operational Numerical Weather Prediction system switched to use\u000a      OSTIA after rapid melting of Arctic ice in 2007 had revealed problems in\u000a      their previous SST analysis. This change has measurably reduced errors [5.3]\u000a      and improved the quality of weather forecasts.\u000a    GHRSST is now a truly international collaboration with over US$18 million\u000a      invested across all of the project activities [5.4]. It provides\u000a      the framework within which all satellite SST data can be shared, indexed,\u000a      processed, quality controlled, analysed and documented. Global and\u000a      regional SST products are now produced by GHRSST regional data assembly\u000a      centres in Australia, Japan, USA and Europe. SST products are passed in\u000a      near real time to operational GHRSST global data assembly centres where\u000a      they are integrated together into reliable, error-quantified, analysed SST\u000a      maps, irrespective of cloud or weather.\u000a    High resolution SST maps based on GHRSST principles have become essential\u000a      inputs to local weather forecasting models in many parts of the world\u000a      making routine forecasts for many sectors of society. Meteorological\u000a      agencies aim, for example, to issue flood warnings, predict the extent of\u000a      ice on highways, or forecast rain probabilities in sufficient local detail\u000a      that users as diverse as water companies, road gritters or farmers at\u000a      harvest time can depend on them. The same SST maps are also needed by\u000a      ocean forecasting systems for offshore industry and military operations,\u000a      validation and forcing of ocean and atmospheric models, ecosystem\u000a      assessment, tourism and fisheries research, amongst many others. [5.5].\u000a    B) Southampton's development of the autonomous ship radiometer (ISAR)\u000a      introduced a significant improvement to the quality assessment of\u000a      satellite SST data. Comparison between satellite and ISAR measurements,\u000a      which both observe the skin SST, completely eliminates the ~0.3K\u000a      uncertainty from estimating &#916;T when using buoy measurements in\u000a      conventional validation. ISAR's calibration to better than 0.1K allows\u000a      validation of AATSR data to an equivalent precision for each individual\u000a      match-up between satellite and in situ observations. The high\u000a      quality of AATSR data confirmed by ISAR [3.6] has encouraged\u000a      widespread use of AATSR. It justifies the use of AATSR for bias adjustment\u000a      of inferior SST datasets when producing analysed SST maps [5.2]\u000a      with reliably estimated uncertainties. This is particularly valuable for\u000a      operational forecasting applications where quantification of forecasting\u000a      uncertainty is critical such as search and rescue or route-planning for\u000a      sea transport of large structures [5.5].\u000a    The Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) is the international body\u000a      established to ensure that the observations and information needed to\u000a      address climate-related issues are obtained and made available to all\u000a      potential users. It has defined 50 Essential Climate Variables (ECV), of\u000a      which SST is one, that are necessary to support the work of the United\u000a      Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Intergovernmental\u000a      Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Because ISAR is subjected to validation\u000a      against an infrared radiation source before and after each autonomous\u000a      deployment, every SST measurement is traceable to the S.I. reference\u000a      standards against which the radiation source is tested. Thus accumulated\u000a      ISAR observations can be treated as a SST \"reference dataset\", meeting the\u000a      strict traceability requirements of the GCOS and are therefore useful for\u000a      independent validation of other SST ECVs. The policy impact of this unique\u000a      capability, contrasting with conventional SST measurements, is now\u000a      acknowledged by Professor David Mackay, Department for Energy and Climate\u000a      Change (DECC) Chief Scientific Advisor:\u000a    \"We recognise...in-situ measurement using radiometers traceable to\u000a        international reference standards is highly desirable to ensure\u000a        climate-quality datasets\" [5.6].\u000a    The ESA Climate Change Initiative programme, overseen by Dr Craig Donlon\u000a      [5.7], has the task of producing a new SST dataset to the GCOS\u000a      specification of an Essential Climate Variable, which requires that\u000a      satellite SST validation must provide traceability to international\u000a      reference standards. Using ISAR to validate AATSR SST data now provides\u000a      the SI traceability needed to establish AATSR as the key input to the new\u000a      global SST time series. ISAR-type sensors are specified by ESA as\u000a      essential for validation of the AATSR successor instrument, SLSTR. This is\u000a      further evidence of the impact of Southampton's ship radiometry work on\u000a      ESA validation policy for climate quality satellite SST datasets [5.8].\u000a    The published success of ISAR deployments created a demand from agencies\u000a      around the world wishing to use shipborne radiometers. Since 2009, six\u000a      ISARs have been sold by UoS to Institutes in USA (2), Japan, China,\u000a      Denmark and UK, producing a turnover of &#163;250,000, supporting a technician\u000a      for two years and demonstrating a modest commercial and employment impact.\u000a      The Southampton group's major impact on operational applications of\u000a      satellite oceanography has been recognized by the presentation of the\u000a      prestigious 2011 Remote Sensing and Photogrammetry Society Award to\u000a      Professor Robinson [5.9].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Satellite measurements of sea surface temperature (SST) make a much\u000a      greater impact on weather forecasting and climate change detection since\u000a      University of Southampton (UoS) research revolutionised the way SST data\u000a      are processed.

These observe the ocean skin, the top millimetre, whereas\u000a      conventional thermometers on buoys measure temperature a few metres deep.\u000a      The difference between these, &#916;T, reaches 5K because of wind\u000a      cooling and solar heating, and is difficult to characterise. This creates\u000a      uncertainty &gt;0.3K when comparing individual satellite and buoy data,\u000a      hindering confirmation of ATSR's high accuracy for climate monitoring.\u000a      Moreover, ATSR was overlooked for operational applications (e.g. weather\u000a      forecasting) because of its poorer coverage. Thus despite the inherent\u000a      high quality and low noise of the sensor, the ATSR datasets were largely\u000a      ignored for 15 years.\u000a    This prompted Professor Ian Robinson's (UoS 1976 - present) research\u000a      group to study sea surface thermal processes, seeking to improve the\u000a      applicability of satellite SST data. Craig Donlon (UoS PhD 1990-94, UoS\u000a      postdoc 1994-97, visiting fellow 2004-08) sought ways to measure skin SST\u000a      from ships. In 1995, comparing observations from an early ship radiometer\u000a      to conventional thermometry, he obtained evidence that the cool skin\u000a      component of &#916;T is quantifiable to accuracies better than 0.1K [3.1],\u000a      and attempted direct validations of satellite SST using ship radiometers.\u000a      Subsequently Alice Stuart-Menteth (UoS PhD 2000-04) identified the diurnal\u000a      warming factors contributing to &#916;T [3.2].\u000a    In 1996 Robinson and Donlon drew together other SST experts from space\u000a      and meteorological agencies, including ESA, NASA, UK Met Office, Eumetsat,\u000a      RAL and M&#233;t&#233;o-France, to participate in the EU-funded Concerted Action\u000a      project for the Study of the Ocean's Thermal Skin (CASOTS). They developed\u000a      strategies for better determination of &#916;T and for reliable\u000a      shipborne radiometry, discovering that the quality of each SST measurement\u000a      from satellites must be evaluated in relation to the coincident ocean\u000a      conditions, such as time of day, wind and sunshine. These insights led in\u000a      2002 to the formation of the Group for High Resolution Sea Surface\u000a      Temperature (GHRSST) [3.3]. Donlon convened the first Science Team\u000a      (ST) meeting, was elected ST Chair in 2002, and employed as Executive\u000a      Director 2004-09. Robinson is a ST member (2003-13), joined by Southampton\u000a      colleagues A.Stuart-Menteth, D.Poulter and W.Wimmer for periods.\u000a    In 2004 Donlon and Robinson helped to formulate the GHRSST protocols for\u000a      producing usable SST datasets. These combine information from diverse\u000a      satellite sensors to achieve SST maps with fine space-time resolution,\u000a      full coverage and quantifiable accuracy. Robinson led the ESA- funded\u000a      Medspiration project (2004-2008) which developed the prototype GHRSST data\u000a      processing system, at last enabling AATSR data to underpin the evolution\u000a      of new classes of global SST datasets [3.4].\u000a    Concurrently Donlon designed the first infrared SST autonomous radiometer\u000a      (ISAR) for unattended ship deployment, building the prototype at\u000a      Southampton in 2001 [3.5]. ISAR measures in situ skin SST\u000a      with uncertainty &lt;0.1K, inter-calibrated against Syst&#232;me\u000a        International d'unit&#233;s (SI) standards. From 2004 to the present,\u000a      funded by a &#163;1 million+ contract from DECC, UoS researcher Werenfrid\u000a      Wimmer developed ship radiometry as a tool for validating AATSR data with\u000a      uncertainty &lt;0.1K, using many thousands of match-up data from\u000a      continuous monitoring by ISAR along UK-Spain ferry routes [3.6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42999","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2400553","Name":"Gabon"},{"GeoNamesId":"895949","Name":"Zambia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"203312","Name":"Democratic Republic of the Congo"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The de-nationalisation of its copper mines has powered economic growth in\u000d\u000a      Zambia over the last\u000d\u000a      decade [5.1]. The Economist ranks Zambia as one of the\u000d\u000a      world's fastest-growing economies over\u000d\u000a      this period and since 2000 average income per capita has risen more than\u000d\u000a      40 per cent. Copper\u000d\u000a      accounts for 80 per cent of Zambia's export earnings, which were 9 billion\u000d\u000a      US dollars for 2011.\u000d\u000a    Research at Southampton that successfully challenged conventional wisdom\u000d\u000a      on the formation of\u000d\u000a      copper deposits in Zambia, is credited with playing a key role in\u000d\u000a      furthering the development of the\u000d\u000a      Central African Copperbelt. Prior to studies led by Roberts, the Zambian\u000d\u000a      Copperbelt was regarded\u000d\u000a      as a mature exploration terrane, with limited opportunities for new ore\u000d\u000a      discoveries. Southampton's\u000d\u000a      intervention was timely as the renascent mining industry in Zambia was\u000d\u000a      attracting substantial\u000d\u000a      incoming investment from the world's mining giants. Insights published by\u000d\u000a      Roberts et al gave\u000d\u000a      mining companies the licence to be more creative in generating new targets\u000d\u000a      and allowed them to\u000d\u000a      manage risk more effectively. On behalf of Anglo American, Graham Brown [5.2],\u000d\u000a      Group Head of\u000d\u000a      Geosciences, comments that research at Southampton \"changed our\u000d\u000a        exploration targeting\u000d\u000a        methodologies and, by encouraging us to think about the process of\u000d\u000a        formation, opened up the\u000d\u000a        whole (copper) package, and made regions prospective that weren't\u000d\u000a        prospective previously.\"\u000d\u000a    The lessening of risk was crucial. The new Southampton research model\u000d\u000a      gave several mining\u000d\u000a      companies, including Anglo American, Equinox\/Barrick, First Quantum, Vale\u000d\u000a      and Rio Tinto, the\u000d\u000a      confidence to launch new exploration programs in the knowledge that viable\u000d\u000a      Cu-Co deposits\u000d\u000a      existed outside the regions explored under the traditional research\u000d\u000a      paradigm. The published\u000d\u000a      research provided these companies with the geochemical tools and\u000d\u000a      theoretical modelling to find\u000d\u000a      them. It has been impossible to obtain commercially confidential figures\u000d\u000a      detailing the amount of\u000d\u000a      investment global mining companies have poured into these programs. In\u000d\u000a      2012 Rio Tinto used the\u000d\u000a      new Southampton model to shift its exploration focus to a relatively\u000d\u000a      unexplored area south of the\u000d\u000a      Domes region, committing a substantive exploration budget. Adam Duffin [5.3],\u000d\u000a      Chief Geoscientist\u000d\u000a      at Rio Tinto, said: \"Rio Tinto has invested considerable resources in\u000d\u000a        copper exploration in Zambia\u000d\u000a        over the past two years based on the new understanding of the geology of\u000d\u000a        the copperbelt and its\u000d\u000a        mineral resources and enjoys a strong relationship with The University\u000d\u000a        of Southampton group led\u000d\u000a        by Steve Roberts which it has drawn on in developing our exploration\u000d\u000a        strategy.\" World-leading\u000d\u000a      exploration consultant Richard Sillitoe [5.4] notes: \"The\u000d\u000a        University of Southampton group led by\u000d\u000a        Steve Roberts has played a key role in an ongoing reinterpretation of\u000d\u000a        the geology of the Zambian\u000d\u000a        Copperbelt. This fresh vision is stimulating exploration activity in the\u000d\u000a        region, impacting on the\u000d\u000a        strategies that companies are employing and leading to increased\u000d\u000a        expenditure.\"\u000d\u000a    One of the most significant outcomes of this expanded exploration\u000d\u000a      activity in Zambia was the\u000d\u000a      opening, by Australian miners Equinox, of a new mine in Lumwana, in the\u000d\u000a      Domes region, in\u000d\u000a      January 2009, an asset that part motivated Barrick's takeover of Equinox\u000d\u000a      for &#163;4.5 billion in July\u000d\u000a      2011. The population of Manyama, the nearest settlement to the mine has\u000d\u000a      increased five-fold over\u000d\u000a      the last ten years. The opening of the mine has offered employment\u000d\u000a      (directly and indirectly) to\u000d\u000a      around 3000 Zambians in the region and improved local infrastructure [5.5].\u000d\u000a      Mike Richards [5.6],\u000d\u000a      former Chief Geologist at Barrick, said: \"The decade-long collaboration\u000d\u000a        between Steve Roberts's\u000d\u000a        team and our geology team in Zambia to reinterpret the geology of the\u000d\u000a        Zambian Copperbelt has\u000d\u000a        been an integral part of our exploration efforts in Zambia. It has had a\u000d\u000a        profound influence on our\u000d\u000a        exploration strategies, expenditure and success in the region.\"\u000d\u000a    The impact of the research has extended beyond Zambia. Mining companies\u000d\u000a      have applied the\u000d\u000a      Southampton model to similar environments in Gabon and Democratic Republic\u000d\u000a      of Congo (DRC).\u000d\u000a      Canada's Ivanplats led the discovery of the Kamoa mine near Lubumbashi,\u000d\u000a      the mining capital of\u000d\u000a      DRC, in 2011. DRC produces more than three per cent of the world's copper\u000d\u000a      and half its cobalt.\u000d\u000a      Kamoa ranks as the world's largest undeveloped high-grade copper\u000d\u000a      discovery, with 739 million\u000d\u000a      tonnes grading 2.67% copper. In Gabon another Canadian firm Armada\u000d\u000a      Exploration is investing\u000d\u000a      more than $5 million in exploration for copper in a region with a similar\u000d\u000a      formation history to the\u000d\u000a      Zambian Copperbelt [5.7].\u000d\u000a    Through research led by Roberts, a number of highly skilled scientists\u000d\u000a      that trained at Southampton\u000d\u000a      have filled high-profile industry posts.

Roberts' team\u000d\u000a      found that within the 800-million-year-old basin, ore formation had\u000d\u000a      occurred over a 300-million-year\u000d\u000a      period as a result of the thermochemical reduction of sulphate and metal\u000d\u000a      enriched hydrothermal\u000d\u000a      fluids introduced during basin inversion. This new evidence expanded the\u000d\u000a      applicable exploration\u000d\u000a      criteria to include additional, substantive structures that developed\u000d\u000a      within the basin during its\u000d\u000a      evolution [3.3].\u000d\u000a    The team extended their studies to the Cu-Co deposits of the Lumwana\u000d\u000a      Mine, in Zambia's Domes\u000d\u000a      Region, through the PhD studies of Bernau (2003-2007) and Nowecki\u000d\u000a      (2009-2012). The origin of\u000d\u000a      these deposits had been the subject of much debate.

The Rosebank project, a joint venture between Chevron North Sea\u000d\u000a      Ltd, Statoil (UK) Ltd,\u000d\u000a      OMV (UK) Ltd and DONG Exploration and Production (UK) Ltd was approved for\u000d\u000a      development by\u000d\u000a      Chevron in July 2012. UK Energy Minister at the time, Charles Hendry,\u000d\u000a      described the project as a\u000d\u000a      \"pioneer development\" with the potential to substantially increase the\u000d\u000a      UK's proven oil reserves, and\u000d\u000a      create more than a thousand jobs (3). Chevron's own reservoir mapping\u000d\u000a      model originally showed\u000d\u000a      that the development of Rosebank was not economically viable. According to\u000d\u000a      the Leading\u000d\u000a      Geoscientist at Statoil, new data from Aberdeen suggested greater\u000d\u000a      intra-reservoir sand\u000d\u000a      connectivity than previously calculated, effectively reducing the element\u000d\u000a      of risk in drilling for oil.\u000d\u000a      They reran the reservoir model by inputting Aberdeen's data and found that\u000d\u000a      the number of\u000d\u000a      producer wells required to commence production had fallen to nine from 15\u000d\u000a      at a saving of &#163;600m\u000d\u000a      (&#163;100m per well). Ellis says: \"The greater confidence in reservoir\u000d\u000a        connectivity ... increased the\u000d\u000a        recovery factor from 25 per cent to 40 per cent, again having a\u000d\u000a        significant increase on the reserve\u000d\u000a        base and project profitability.\" In effect this 15 per cent increase\u000d\u000a      proved the difference between the\u000d\u000a      continuation and abandonment of the Rosebank exploration.\u000d\u000a    Aberdeen's work on the Rosebank field had a direct impact on the\u000d\u000a      development of neighbouring\u000d\u000a      field Cambo, jointly operated by Chevron and Hess. The stratigraphic\u000d\u000a      framework devised by\u000d\u000a      StratLIP was applied during the drilling of an appraisal well and as a\u000d\u000a      Chevron Geologist confirms\u000d\u000a      (2), \"the decision to continue (with the project) was greatly\u000d\u000a        influenced by the application of the\u000d\u000a        framework\". Ablard says an ecosystem model developed by Aberdeen for\u000d\u000a        Cambo has been\u000d\u000a        \"instrumental in informing reservoir models giving a clearer\u000d\u000a        understanding of potential recoverable\u000d\u000a        volumes\". In other words StratLIP's input has enabled Chevron to\u000d\u000a      better identify the location of oil\u000d\u000a      and gas deposits in the Cambo field, which contributed to a decision in\u000d\u000a      November 2012 to drill the\u000d\u000a      Cambo-5 oil well (4).\u000d\u000a    In the wider Northeast Atlantic, StratLIP has greatly increased the\u000d\u000a      regional understanding of the\u000d\u000a      relationship of the dominantly volcanic Flett Formation to that of the\u000d\u000a      underlying marine sedimentary\u000d\u000a      rocks of the Lamba and Vaila formations. This has given energy companies\u000d\u000a      much greater\u000d\u000a      confidence in pursuing deeper exploration targets than would be possible\u000d\u000a      if they relied on seismic\u000d\u000a      data alone. In particular, the stratigraphical and palaeoenvironmental\u000d\u000a      context provided by\u000d\u000a      StratLIP's research has, according to Statoil (1), given the oil industry\u000d\u000a      the confidence to drill deeper\u000d\u000a      in areas of thick basalt lava cover. Statoil, with partners ExxonMobil and\u000d\u000a      Atlantic Petroleum, began\u000d\u000a      drilling its Brugdan II Well into a sub-basalt section offshore the Faroe\u000d\u000a      Islands in June 2012. As the\u000d\u000a      Leading Geoscientist at Statoil put it: \"The cost of a typical well\u000d\u000a        drilled in thick basalt areas can be\u000d\u000a        in excess of &#163;100 million and therefore not undertaken lightly.\"\u000d\u000a    An example of the risk involved in deep-water drilling in frontier\u000d\u000a      provinces came with the\u000d\u000a      abandonment in 2011 of Chevron's Lagavulin well, west of the Shetland\u000d\u000a      Islands, which cost &#163;170m\u000d\u000a      to drill. Findings by Jolley regarding the geology of the wider region are\u000d\u000a      informing Chevron's\u000d\u000a      explorations further afield, including more effective planning, to reduce\u000d\u000a      the risk of a similar outcome\u000d\u000a      in the future.\u000d\u000a    As well as benefitting the UK government's efforts to revive the UK's oil\u000d\u000a      and gas industry,\u000d\u000a      StratLIP's research has enabled the Faroese government to maximise the\u000d\u000a      economic potential of\u000d\u000a      the oil and gas resources situated within its maritime boundaries. The\u000d\u000a      SINDRI Group (5), set up by\u000d\u000a      the Faroese government, comprises oil companies operating in the Faroese\u000d\u000a      region.

It is these lavas that seal off the oil and gas\u000d\u000a      reservoirs.\u000d\u000a    Since 2006, multidisciplinary research by the University of Aberdeen's\u000d\u000a      StratLIP (Stratigraphic\u000d\u000a      Evolution of Large Igneous Provinces) research group has formulated\u000d\u000a      predictive models of\u000d\u000a      reservoir development and distribution in order to facilitate hydrocarbon\u000d\u000a      exploration and\u000d\u000a      exploitation of LIPs. Led by Professor David Jolley, Chair in Geology (at\u000d\u000a      Aberdeen since 2005), the\u000d\u000a      academics have studied environmental system processes in large lava fields\u000d\u000a      and mapped\u000d\u000a      sediments between the lava flows to identify the location of oil and gas\u000d\u000a      reservoirs. Through\u000d\u000a      extensive fieldwork, the team mapped the stratigraphy of the North\u000d\u000a      Atlantic Igneous Province\u000d\u000a      (NAIP) and carried out subsea vulcanological, lithological and\u000d\u000a      palynological analysis (1,2) to\u000d\u000a      identify stratigraphical hydrocarbon traps, informing applications by oil\u000d\u000a      and gas companies for\u000d\u000a      drilling licences within Faroese waters.\u000d\u000a    Interdisciplinary research demonstrated the impact of large-scale\u000d\u000a      volcanism on atmospheric\u000d\u000a      forcing, plant ecosystem dynamics and eutrophication events (2, 3). By\u000d\u000a      building a comprehensive\u000d\u000a      picture of previous climate change in LIPs, Jolley and colleagues were\u000d\u000a      able to identify the different\u000d\u000a      climatic events that had occurred within specific regions of the lava\u000d\u000a      field; for example, by studying\u000d\u000a      the effects of a hypothermal event on plants within the ecosystem. This\u000d\u000a      work allowed the research\u000d\u000a      team to devise a predictive model of intra-volcanic reservoir distribution\u000d\u000a      and contributed to greater\u000d\u000a      understanding of the location of oil and gas reservoirs in the Rosebank\u000d\u000a      field, located offshore\u000d\u000a      northwest of the Shetland Islands, and Corona Ridge in the Faroe-Shetland\u000d\u000a      Channel.\u000d\u000a    Further research into spatial recognition and mapping of plant ecosystems\u000d\u000a      within LIPs (2), allied to\u000d\u000a      more traditional geophysics-based flowfield mapping techniques,\u000d\u000a      underpinned major\u000d\u000a      reinterpretations of the distribution of oil and gas reservoirs within the\u000d\u000a      Rosebank and Cambo oil\u000d\u000a      fields. Stratigraphical analysis revealed that the reservoir sands had\u000d\u000a      come from the south, not the\u000d\u000a      east as previously thought, and that reservoirs could be found within\u000d\u000a      river valleys in the lava field\u000d\u000a      itself. Jolley's analysis of the Cambo oil field showed that the site was\u000d\u000a      higher in the drainage\u000d\u000a      system than initially predicted. This led to the repositioning of the\u000d\u000a      drilling well and fundamental\u000d\u000a      changes to the mapping models used by Chevron, the energy company leading\u000d\u000a      the exploitation of\u000d\u000a      the field, to improve their accuracy.

These can be combined\u000d\u000a        with our subsurface data to help estimate hydrocarbon volumes and build\u000d\u000a        reservoir models. A good example is the relationship between bed\u000d\u000a        thickness and net sand variations in levees. This data has been used in\u000d\u000a        areas where we have reservoirs in levee systems\".\u000d\u000a    BP have further added that \"the consortia is a prolific source of new\u000d\u000a        ideas and concepts for us. This allows us to understand the range of\u000d\u000a        possibilities in a system and have a more comprehensive appreciation of\u000d\u000a        the uncertainties in the reservoir system. These ideas can be built, in\u000d\u000a        an appropriate way, into our development plans for a field. Good\u000d\u000a        examples are the range of facies and stratigraphic architecture in\u000d\u000a        channel systems the team have documented; and the effect that Mass\u000d\u000a        Transport Complexes can have on reservoir distribution particularly\u000d\u000a        ponding and erosion\" [c2].\u000d\u000a    The recognition that turbidite sandstones may be ponded on the surface of\u000d\u000a      submarine mass transport deposits has substantially influenced the\u000d\u000a      understanding of reservoir geometries in, for example, offshore Sabah\u000d\u000a      (Murphy Oil), and in the Nile Cone, offshore Egypt (BG).\u000d\u000a    Our work on the formation and distribution of sand within submarine\u000d\u000a      levees (Birman et al., 2009) contributed to tens of millions of barrels of\u000d\u000a      additional estimated hydrocarbon reserves in levees within the Krishna\u000d\u000a      Godavari basin, offshore eastern India for BG, and assisted in a negative\u000d\u000a      development decision in offshore Egypt (Hess) with a probable saving of\u000d\u000a      hundreds of millions of dollars on the bottom line. The algorithm on which\u000d\u000a      these predictions are based is being used to develop a plug-in for\u000d\u000a      Schlumberger's Petrel seismic interpretation platform, in partnership with\u000d\u000a      Brazilian collaborators at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul; this\u000d\u000a      represents the first such tool for estimating reservoir in levees.\u000d\u000a    As well as the application offshore India, BG have used the results of\u000d\u000a      funded research to examine producing fields of West Delta Deep Marine\u000d\u000a      (WDDM) off the Nile Delta in Egypt. The Head of Geology for BG Group, has\u000d\u000a      clarified: \"Two examples of specific impact [...] occurred in Egypt\u000d\u000a        activities since 2010. The first example was applied during\u000d\u000a        re-evaluation of producing WDDM gas fields and re-building of reservoir\u000d\u000a        models to better match production history and constrain future\u000d\u000a        production forecast. Building on field observations from Slopes JIP\u000d\u000a        research, Professor Kneller had developed a geological model where\u000d\u000a        rugosity on the top of mass transport deposits controls distribution of\u000d\u000a        subsequent turbidite sands, reservoir thickness and aquifer\u000d\u000a        distribution. This model provide an explanation for the observation of\u000d\u000a        perched aquifers inferred from static reservoir pressure data. The model\u000d\u000a        [...] was incorporated into the reservoir model re-builds with\u000d\u000a        improvements in the accuracy of perched aquifer volumes. As a\u000d\u000a        consequence of the appreciation of considerable volume in several\u000d\u000a        perched aquifers, production strategy was updated to increase the\u000d\u000a        stand-off of well completions from the aquifer. This helped sustain\u000d\u000a        production from the WDDM fields and contribute to BG Group net\u000d\u000a        production in Egypt in 2010 of 48.1 million barrels of oil equivalent.\"\u000d\u000a      BG have gone on to confirm that research findings have also helped in\u000d\u000a      decision making for placement of development wells (at a cost of $5\u000d\u000a      million each) to access additional zones in levee facies, allowing access\u000d\u000a      to an additional several billion cubic feet of gas\u000d\u000a    2. Internationalisation\/training impact\u000d\u000a      Apart from our contributions to understanding of deep marine processes and\u000d\u000a      architecture, we have also been instrumental in the development of two\u000d\u000a      multi-million pound collaborative research programmes between Aberdeen and\u000d\u000a      two Brazilian universities (\"Integrated\u000d\u000a      Stratigraphic-Sedimentologic-Petrologic Study of the Clastic Rift Sections\u000d\u000a      of Santos and Campos Basins, Eastern Brazil\", at Universidade Federal do\u000d\u000a      Rio Grande do Sul; and \"Late Paleozoic de-glacial deposits in the Paran&#225;\u000d\u000a      Basin (Brazil) and their analogue in the Paganzo Basin (Argentina):\u000d\u000a      impacts on reservoir prediction\" at Universidade do Vale do Rio Sinos).\u000d\u000a      These are funded by BG under the Brazilian government's `Special\u000d\u000a      Participation' scheme, based on a production levy, and were designed to\u000d\u000a      inform BG's exploration strategy, specifically within the Santos and\u000d\u000a      Paran&#225; basins (offshore and onshore Brazil respectively).

Predicting and\u000d\u000a      characterising reservoir in the subsurface requires an understanding of\u000d\u000a      the depositional systems that contain the reservoir, geometry, internal\u000d\u000a      architecture, and porosity\/permeability distribution, all of which are\u000d\u000a      intimately related to processes of sediment transport and deposition.\u000d\u000a    Compared to most other depositional environments, direct observations of\u000d\u000a      deep-water processes and modern depositional architecture are relatively\u000d\u000a      few and difficult to obtain. Hence an understanding of deep-water systems\u000d\u000a      is necessarily derived from a combination of approaches based on models,\u000d\u000a      analogues, and remote sensing. This impact case study derives from a\u000d\u000a      research project established by Professor Ben Kneller, Chair of Petroleum\u000d\u000a      Geology at the University of Aberdeen since 2004. The project has been\u000d\u000a      undertaken in two phases funded by a consortium of oil company sponsors\u000d\u000a      through a Joint Industry Project, with results from the research projects\u000d\u000a      published on a project website turbidites.org, an Aberdeen-based research\u000d\u000a      platform initiated by and under the direction of Prof Ben Kneller. The\u000d\u000a      research project is led by, and has been designed by, Professor Kneller at\u000d\u000a      Aberdeen, with contributions from collaborators at Montana State\u000d\u000a      University, Colorado School of Mines and the University of California\u000d\u000a      Santa Barbara. , Fieldwork has been undertaken across a range of\u000d\u000a      international geological sites in South America and Europe that allowed\u000d\u000a      the team to investigate deep-water systems across a range of scales, from\u000d\u000a      that of sediment transport and depositional processes to that of\u000d\u000a      continental margins. The results have been applied to predictions of\u000d\u000a      hydrocarbon reservoir architecture. Total industrial income since 2004 has\u000d\u000a      been &#163;4.54M, through a combination of single-company sponsorship and\u000d\u000a      industrial consortia.\u000d\u000a    The research involves integration of multiple approaches to develop a\u000d\u000a      holistic view of deep-water sedimentary systems. Experimental modelling\u000d\u000a      and numerical simulation of flow processes and their resulting sediment\u000d\u000a      transport and deposition has improved understanding of turbidity current\u000d\u000a      processes, in particular the role of water entrainment on deposition,\u000d\u000a      controlling the shape of and sand distribution within submarine levees\u000d\u000a      (1); levee shape and sandstone distribution (i.e. reservoir) are largely\u000d\u000a      determined by the sea-floor gradient, and scale with the width of the\u000d\u000a      parent channel. Studies of the modern sea floor and comparisons with\u000d\u000a      ancient depositional systems using digital field techniques (3, 4) have\u000d\u000a      improved understanding of channel-fill architectures and lithology\u000d\u000a      distributions on sub-seismic scales. Subsurface observations using\u000d\u000a      industrial 3D seismic datasets and data from oil and gas wells, matched by\u000d\u000a      seismic forward models of unique seismic-scale outcrops, have placed these\u000d\u000a      observations in a larger context to better understand 3-dimensional system\u000d\u000a      architectures at the reservoir scale; in the sedimentary fills of channels\u000d\u000a      on the continental slope, there is a repeated pattern of architectures\u000d\u000a      that can be used to constrain reservoir distribution and connectivity in\u000d\u000a      subsurface channel systems. Understanding of deep-water sandstone\u000d\u000a      distribution has also been substantially improved in turbidites associated\u000d\u000a      with mass transport deposits; the shapes of reservoir sandstone bodies are\u000d\u000a      determined by their location with respect to such deposits, and on the\u000d\u000a      properties of the underlying deposits. The evolution of continental\u000d\u000a      margins (5) and sediment supply over millions of years (unpublished PhDs)\u000d\u000a      has led especially to the recognition of the effects of climate on\u000d\u000a      sediment supply at the scale of 105 to 106 years,\u000d\u000a      and its impact on continental margin architecture development; this shows\u000d\u000a      that the development of prolific slope channel reservoirs is linked to\u000d\u000a      large scale climate changes such as intensification of monsoons. The work\u000d\u000a      has been applied to reservoir prediction via the development of numerical\u000d\u000a      inversion approaches (6), forward seismic modelling (2), neural-net\u000d\u000a      recognition of lithofacies in the subsurface from wire-line logs, and the\u000d\u000a      use of architectural and process analogues in the subsurface.\u000d\u000a    The group has built on concepts and research output from precursor groups\u000d\u000a      set up by Kneller at Leeds University (Turbidite Research Group,\u000d\u000a      1992-2000) and University of California (turbidites.org, 2000-2004) and\u000d\u000a      broadened the research approach to include modelling and subsurface\u000d\u000a      interpretation.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43299","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3351879","Name":"Angola"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Hurst and his collaborators have established a global reputation for\u000a      identifying the presence and\u000a      significance of sand injectites in petroleum systems.

Currently several oil company sponsors,\u000a      including Marathon,\u000a      Premier Oil, Total and Statoil, amongst others, use SIRG's concepts and\u000a      data routinely in their\u000a      exploration programmes. Four case studies from these named companies offer\u000a      examples of this.\u000a    Marathon Oil participated in Phase 1 of the Sand Injectites research\u000a      programme. As a result of the\u000a      research findings concerned with intrusive traps Marathon discovered\u000a      Volund field in 2003, with an\u000a      expected gross value &gt;$6Bn (7). Following discovery SIRG worked closely\u000a      with the Volund field\u000a      development team, supporting validation of quantitative models of oil\u000a      production and advising on\u000a      appropriate geological procedure for drilling (7). The Chief Geoscientist\u000a      at Marathon Oil has\u000a      confirmed that SIRG's \"analogue data were a critical component of the\u000a        pre-exploration de-risking of\u000a        Volund and had a direct impact on the eventual approval to sanction\u000a        funding an exploration well\u000a        given by Marathon's Head Office, Houston\" (2).\u000a    This exploration success prompted new sponsor involvement with an\u000a      injectite exploration focus.\u000a      Encore (now Premier Oil) have used the results of research to confirm the\u000a      production potential of\u000a      the greater Catcher field in 2010, and have commented that \"EnCore's\u000a        discovery of Catcher,\u000a        Varadero and Burgman fields in Block 28\/9 was the UK exploration success\u000a        story of 2010.......\u000a        there is believed to be 400mmbo [million barrels of oil equivalent]\u000a        in place\" in which \"Prof Hurst's\u000a        research has had immediate effect on our evaluation of the Greater\u000a        Catcher area and we plan to\u000a        develop our working relationship with him. It appears that Sand\u000a        Injectite research is a rather\u000a        special feature of UK geological research with high relevance to the oil\u000a        industry and well deserving\u000a        of international recognition\" (3).\u000a    Statoil have financially supported Sand Injectites research from the\u000a      outset in the late 1990's. As a\u000a      result of research findings, Statoil were able to identify the widespread\u000a      presence of injected sands\u000a      within their field development areas, and were able to re-frame and\u000a      optimise their field\u000a      development strategies accordingly. The generic benefits of SIRG's\u000a      research to Statoil have been\u000a      summarised by a Senior Research Scientist (Exploration) for Statoil, in a\u000a      communication to the\u000a      University of Aberdeen: \"Statoil recognised the lack of research on the\u000a        enigmatic but often\u000a      regionally-developed features known as sand injectites. By investing in\u000a        the Sand Injectites\u000a        consortia at the University of Aberdeen Statoil has increased its\u000a        understanding of when, where and\u000a        how sand injectites form thus enhancing our understanding of their role\u000a        in basin evolution. Equally\u000a        important has been the generation of the first ever large outcrop\u000a        database of sand injectites that\u000a        helps all aspects of our subsurface evaluation, including seismic\u000a        interpretation, and reservoir\u000a        characterisation. In my daily work I use pictures and ideas from these\u000a        outcrops to educate and\u000a        illustrate how sand injectites are formed and expressed in the\u000a        subsurface\" (1). Most recently\u000a      Statoil's development of the Mariner field in the UKCS has been approved,\u000a      with a field\u000a      development strategy based around exploitation of reserves within sand\u000a      injectites, which is a direct\u000a      consequence of collaboration with SIRG. The field is believed to hold\u000a      reserves of approximately\u000a      300 million barrels with a commercial value of some $8 billion. As a\u000a      result of this field development\u000a      700 new jobs will be created (6). Statoil have confirmed that the SIRG \"group\u000a        has made tangible\u000a        contributions to Mariner's commerciality and allowed an appreciation of\u000a        the main uncertainties and\u000a        how to best geologically model them\" (5). Whilst production from the\u000a      field will not commence until\u000a      2017, the impact generated from government approval of development plans\u000a      is considerable in\u000a      guaranteeing future economic returns.\u000a    In the context of oilfield development SIRG research has played an\u000a      important role supporting\u000a      operators with well placement and optimising hydrocarbon recovery. In\u000a      2002, prior to development\u000a      of Girasol (offshore Angola, 1.55 MMB OOIP), Total Research in Pau invited\u000a      SIRG to examine\u000a      core data from Girasol and other offshore fields\/discoveries that \"confirmed\u000a        the presence of\u000a        significant sub vertical sandstone intrusions ...... their\u000a        identification gave the possibility of much\u000a        higher than expected vertical permeability between the main sandstone\u000a        reservoirs and consequent\u000a        improved aquifer support. This interpretation proved to be correct and\u000a        participated to the\u000a        understanding of the oil production and water-handling characteristics\u000a        of Girasol\" (4).\u000a    SIRG's transfer of research results to the oil industry is a prioritised\u000a      activity and has an increasingly\u000a      global impact. Company-specific workshops and field courses are also\u000a      common activities (in 2013\u000a      4 field trips are organised for the benefit of Premier Oil, Wintershall,\u000a      Cairn Energy, Maersk, Det\u000a      Norske, Statoil and Tullow Oil). Since 2008 approximately 150 oil-company\u000a      personnel have\u000a      attended field courses led by Hurst and colleagues and many more have\u000a      attended office-located\u000a      workshops. Courses are typically associated with specific oil fields or\u000a      are used to heighten the\u000a      awareness of sand injectites within companies.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Researchers in petroleum geology at the University of Aberdeen have since\u000a      the mid 1990's been\u000a      investigating the characteristics and geological context of sand\u000a      injectites. The geological contexts\u000a      within which injected sands are discovered have permitted a step change in\u000a      the production\u000a      potential in some oil fields (up to c. 1 billion barrels oil), and to\u000a      define new exploration targets (up to\u000a      250 million barrels oil) to make a significant increase to the overall\u000a      proven reserves of\u000a      hydrocarbons in any given province (e.g. the North Sea).

The\u000a      paucity of scientific\u000a      understanding meant that any practical or commercial implications that\u000a      sand injectites might have\u000a      were overlooked. However, in 1998 high-quality 3D seismic reflection\u000a      surveys over the Alba oilfield\u000a      (Statoil\/Chevron) revealed the common occurrence of sandstone intrusions\u000a      as entire or significant\u000a      components of oilfields, allowing the field development strategy for that\u000a      field to be optimised. Since\u000a      that time Professor Andrew Hurst has created the Sand Injectites Research\u000a      Group (SIRG) at the\u000a      University of Aberdeen to investigate these phenomena, and this group has\u000a      become the global\u000a      focus of knowledge for understanding the geological conditions that lead\u000a      to formation of sand\u000a      injectites, their significance in petroleum systems and, specifically,\u000a      their potential for holding\u000a      commercial volumes of hydrocarbon and hence as targets for exploration and\u000a      field-development\u000a      drilling. An invited 2007 Memoir (AAPG 87) documented the early stages of\u000a      research by SIRG and\u000a      associates, including oil industry partners. The Sand Injectites Research\u000a      Group (SIRG) has more\u000a      than 12 years continuous activity funded by the international oil industry\u000a      (BG, Cairn, Chevron, Det\u000a      Norske, DONG, EnQuest, JX Nippon, Kerr McGee, Lundin, Maersk, Marathon,\u000a      Premier Oil, Shell,\u000a      Statoil, Total, and Wintershall), to a total value of &#163;2.2 million.\u000a    By examining never-previously-described outcrop and examining\u000a      oil-industry subsurface data (1,2)\u000a      SIRG developed predictive models for the occurrence and geometry of sand\u000a      injectites that\u000a      previously were deemed random (3). Through understanding the relationships\u000a      between sandstone\u000a      distribution and their mechanism of formation it was recognised that\u000a      regionally-developed instability\u000a      in the very shallow (&lt;2 km burial) crust was caused by the focussing of\u000a      anomalously-high pore-\u000a      fluid pressure that caused the hydraulic fracture of low-permeability\u000a      strata and concomitant\u000a      fluidisation and upward injection of sand into the fractures. This group\u000a      of processes occur rapidly\u000a      (from days to weeks) and frequently mobilise 10-100's km3 of\u000a      sand. Such intrusions have occurred\u000a      in sedimentary basins globally throughout geologic time (2). As a result\u000a      of the research\u000a      undertaken, sand injectites are no longer considered to be occasional\u000a      anomalous features, but\u000a      often constitute the predominant occurrence of sandstone in many\u000a      petroleum-bearing basins, and\u000a      are hence of direct importance in hydrocarbon exploration and production.\u000a    SIRG's research has been undertaken through oil-industry-sponsored Joint\u000a      Industry Projects. Of\u000a      direct significance to hydrocarbon exploration-drilling SIRG's research\u000a      during phase 1 (2000-2003)\u000a      defined intrusive traps a new class (type) of hydrocarbon trap\u000a      (1). Specifically this stimulated\u000a      exploration for intrusive targets on the NW European Continental\u000a      Shelf and contributed to the\u000a      discovery (2003) and development of Volund field on the Norwegian\u000a      Continental Shelf (NCS) and\u000a      other exploration projects globally.\u000a    During phase 2 (2005-2009) SIRG's cross-disciplinary research team\u000a      determined the pore-fluid\u000a      pressures at which hydraulic failure occurred and the velocity, rheology\u000a      and turbulence of the\u000a      fluidised sand (3, 4). Thus for the first time the conditions of formation\u000a      of the external and internal\u000a      structures associated with sand injectites could be inferred (4, 5).\u000a      Relating the physical model to\u000a      characteristics of sand injectites preserved in the rock record provides\u000a      the key to understanding\u000a      why and if large-scale sand injection occurs and how to differentiate them\u000a      from depositional\u000a      sandstones when encountered in the subsurface, which is of critical\u000a      importance to the oil industry\u000a      when modelling the evolution of pore-fluid pressure and predicting\u000a      sandstone distribution in\u000a      petroleum systems. A further new hydrocarbon trap &#8212; extrusive &#8212; was\u000a      defined (6).\u000a    Current and future research (phase 3 commenced in 2013) examines in more\u000a      detail the\u000a      significance of sand injectites in basin\/petroleum system evolution, in\u000a      particular focussing on\u000a      mechanisms for the development of regional pore-fluid overpressures in the\u000a      very shallow crust (5).\u000a      Elevation of pore-fluid pressure is the driver of hydraulic fracturing and\u000a      sand fluidisation.\u000a      Constraining the geological conditions under which it occurs will allow\u000a      better pre-drill prediction of\u000a      the likelihood of occurrence of sand injectites as both discrete\u000a      sedimentary units or as modifiers of\u000a      depositional units.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43300","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Our cryospheric research offers benefits to the non-academic scientific\u000d\u000a      community and to the\u000d\u000a      public, through improved understanding of the stability of polar ice\u000d\u000a      sheets and via our contributions\u000d\u000a      to public debates and understanding of sea level change and climate\u000d\u000a      change.\u000d\u000a    Non-academic scientific beneficiaries\u000d\u000a   Over the last decade, the findings of our research have been disseminated to\u000d\u000a    the scientific\u000d\u000a    community via several pathways, and have had direct impact on the work of\u000d\u000a    non-academic\u000d\u000a    scientific institutions.

From\u000d\u000a      2007 until the launch of\u000d\u000a      CryoSat 2 in November 2010, ESA radar processing teams used our\u000d\u000a      understanding of the\u000d\u000a      temporal and spatial variations in the relative strength of natural\u000d\u000a      surface and near-surface radar\u000d\u000a      reflectors to help devise the most appropriate surface retracking\u000d\u000a      algorithms and compared airborne\u000d\u000a      and ground measurements of artificial corner reflector elevations to help\u000d\u000a      determine absolute\u000d\u000a      elevation accuracies.

This geometry gives rise to complex and poorly understood\u000d\u000a      physics that control\u000d\u000a      the flow of ice from the interior to the oceans. To be reliable predictors\u000d\u000a      of ice sheet stability,\u000d\u000a      computer models require much better knowledge of the geometry and physical\u000d\u000a      properties of the\u000d\u000a      bed of glaciated catchments that drain to the ocean. To this end, Bingham\u000d\u000a      (Lecturer 2009-2012;\u000d\u000a      Senior Lecturer since 2013) undertook the first systematic over-snow radar\u000d\u000a      and seismic surveys of\u000d\u000a      the vast Pine Island Glacier (PIG), West Antarctica's most rapidly\u000d\u000a      thinning region (1,2), with\u000d\u000a      colleagues including post-doctoral researcher Scott (employed at\u000d\u000a      Aberdeen 2004-2006). Bingham\u000d\u000a      mapped new regions of basal topography and differentiated wet and dry\u000d\u000a      basal sediments. He also\u000d\u000a      analysed data from airborne radar surveys to infer past ice-flow dynamics.\u000d\u000a      Bingham also\u000d\u000a      undertook the first systematic geophysical data acquisition across\u000d\u000a      Ferrigno Ice Stream, a key\u000d\u000a      region of high surface velocity and ice mass discharge from the\u000d\u000a      Bellingshausen Sea margin of\u000d\u000a      West Antarctica. His field investigations and subsequent analyses revealed\u000d\u000a      that a spatially distinct\u000d\u000a      region of high glacier ice velocities is steered far into the interior of\u000d\u000a      the ice sheet by the existence\u000d\u000a      of a significant tectonic rift that underlies the ice (3).

Marshall has been based at the University of York since 2002,\u000d\u000a      starting as a Research Fellow and progressing to Lecturer. Biodiversity\u000d\u000a      conservation is important for ecosystem health and as such is a key target\u000d\u000a      of the UN Millennium Development Goals and the Convention for Biological\u000d\u000a      Diversity.\u000d\u000a    Marshall's initial work in Tanzania (1998-2006) included field surveys of\u000d\u000a      wildlife for determining the threats of weak protected area designation on\u000d\u000a      forest biodiversity. Marshall used key animal and plant species as\u000d\u000a      indicators of ecosystem health, and emphasised the negative influences of\u000d\u000a      human activities on forest biodiversity. Marshall's early papers\u000d\u000a      emphasised the need for protected area designation to reduce threats to\u000d\u000a      biodiversity. Marshall also made notes and collections on the species\u000d\u000a      composition of these poorly explored areas, resulting in various notes and\u000d\u000a      popular articles.\u000d\u000a    In 2007-8, Marshall's natural history exploration then turned more\u000d\u000a      towards forest management, through his involvement on the Valuing the Arc\u000d\u000a      project. Under this project Marshall established permanent sample plots\u000d\u000a      for assessing carbon stocks in the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania. This\u000d\u000a      work was the first in the region to employ internationally standardised\u000d\u000a      methods for the measurement of above-ground carbon stocks, and hence\u000d\u000a      provided a baseline estimate for use in carbon creditation schemes. The\u000d\u000a      work showed that previous estimates have seriously over-estimated carbon\u000d\u000a      stocks due to inappropriate methods (Marshall et al., 2012a).\u000d\u000a    While working on the Valuing the Arc project (2007), Marshall also\u000d\u000a      carried out a consultancy for the WWF-Tanzania programme office with the\u000d\u000a      aim of providing ecological data for supporting improved conservation of a\u000d\u000a      threatened forest named Magombera. The surveys found that the Magombera\u000d\u000a      forest had huge value for biodiversity, especially among the trees, for\u000d\u000a      which &gt;40% were either threatened or restricted in range. These data\u000d\u000a      were used to compile recommendations for future management, including\u000d\u000a      habitat restoration, ecological monitoring, education and sustainable use\u000d\u000a      of natural resources (Marshall, 2008).\u000d\u000a    More recently, Marshall's biodiversity research in Tanzania led to a\u000d\u000a      formal link with the UK's most visited zoo, Flamingo Land (FL). This\u000d\u000a      spawned a wide-range of practically-orientated research projects\u000d\u000a      investigating biodiversity management, animal exhibit design, measuring\u000d\u000a      the success of environmental education, and the role of zoos. One of the\u000d\u000a      first research outputs from this new partnership was a review of the\u000d\u000a      effectiveness of zoo-led biodiversity conservation projects, culminating\u000d\u000a      in a report on the top ten species dependent on field conservation by zoos\u000d\u000a      for survival (Marshall et al., 2012b) and a proposed method for\u000d\u000a      development of zoo-based biodiversity action plans (Zoo BAPs: Hambly &amp;\u000d\u000a      Marshall, in press).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43426","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research of the York-led research group has led directly to the\u000a      establishment of the world's first network of high seas marine protected\u000a      areas (MPAs) in the north Atlantic. On the basis of the York work, in 2009\u000a      OSPAR accepted 'in principle' the scientific case and conservation\u000a      objectives for seven of the eight potential MPAs, six of which were then\u000a      created in 2010 (Figure 1). As the oceans are under increasing pressure,\u000a      the establishment of this network will provide protection from\u000a      exploitation and other damaging activities, so helping to rebuild depleted\u000a      populations of commercially important fish, as well as protecting other\u000a      wildlife and habitats like dolphins and birds.\u000a    This MPA network is groundbreaking on both scientific and political\u000a      grounds. Prior to its establishment, there were only two other high seas\u000a      MPAs, one in Antarctica and one in the Mediterranean. The high seas lie\u000a      beyond the 200 nautical mile limits of national sovereignty at sea and are\u000a      governed under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea which\u000a      came into effect in 1992. They constitute 45% of the area of the planet\u000a      but remain virtually unprotected, a place where overfishing and pirate\u000a      fishing is rife and few restrictions apply on what can be taken. There\u000a      have been widespread and steep declines in fish stocks as a result,\u000a      together with heavy collateral mortality of turtles, dolphins, birds and\u000a      other megafauna (as detailed in Roberts et al. 2006).\u000a    \u000a    Figure 1: OSPAR MPA Network, highlighting the six high seas MPAs\u000a        established in 2010 (outlined), based on work by Professor Roberts and\u000a        his team. The 500,000km2 refers to the area of the six MPAs, not the\u000a        area within the outline around them. Figure courtesy of BfN and OSPAR.\u000a   \u000a    The Law of the Sea was drafted in the 1970s and assumes full exploitation\u000a      of fishery and other resources. There is no provision for protected areas\u000a      within it and therefore no mechanism exists to establish them in the high\u000a      seas. This means that OSPAR, as a regional seas governance body, had to go\u000a      it alone, navigating a new legal pathway to MPA establishment while\u000a      undertaking delicate political negotiations to set up the network proposed\u000a      by Roberts and his team. Such negotiations expanded to include a regional\u000a      fisheries management body, the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission,\u000a      the International Seabed Authority and the International Maritime\u000a      Organisation. Roberts and other members of the York team took part in\u000a      several of these meetings, bringing the concept of marine protected areas\u000a      into their serious consideration. For this reason, the impact of the work\u000a      is two-fold. Not only has a network of six high seas MPAs been established\u000a      for the benefit of wildlife and people, but a mechanism has been\u000a      established to create more, both under the auspices of OSPAR, but also by\u000a      other regional seas bodies. Given that pressures on high seas living\u000a      resources are escalating, the need for many more MPAs is now obvious and\u000a      there have been urgent calls to create them from the 2002 World Summit on\u000a      International Development, the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, and\u000a      the UN General Assembly.\u000a    To make it easier for others to follow OSPAR's lead, York team members\u000a      and members of the German delegation and OSPAR secretariat published a\u000a      paper (O'Leary et al. 2012, Section 5, below) describing the scientific\u000a      and political processes followed and how they intertwined. They distil\u000a      from the experience words of advice to others to help them avoid the\u000a      pitfalls encountered and smooth the path to a much bigger global network\u000a      of high seas MPAs in the future.\u000a    It is too soon to say how well these MPAs are working since the high seas\u000a      are remote and monitoring difficult and expensive. As of 2013, some\u000a      management measures are still being negotiated with competent authorities.\u000a      However, three years on, the network is still unique. Because of his key\u000a      role in the creation of this network, Professor Roberts was invited to the\u000a      United Nations in May 2013 to address the first meeting of a UN body\u000a      tasked with amending the Law of the Sea to provide a new legal tool to\u000a      create marine protected areas. The OSPAR network was repeatedly referred\u000a      to at this meeting as a path breaking example of how protection can be\u000a      given to the high seas.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    History was made in late September 2010 when the world's first network of\u000a      high seas marine protected areas (MPAs) was declared in the North\u000a      Atlantic.

They approached Professor Roberts in 2008 based on his extensive\u000a      track record of research at York on the design and function of MPAs\u000a      (particularly Roberts et al. 2001, and 2003 a,b, see Section 3, below, for\u000a      all cited references). Roberts et al. (2001) provided the world's first\u000a      demonstration that marine protected areas can enhance surrounding\u000a      fisheries. Roberts et al. (2003a,b) set out criteria for design of marine\u000a      protected area networks, adaptations of which have since been widely\u000a      adopted, e.g. Convention on Biological Diversity criteria for high seas\u000a      MPAs, and OSPAR criteria for MPAs. Roberts was also approached to do the\u000a      work because of his seminal work on high seas conservation and MPA\u000a      establishment (Roberts 2002, Roberts et al. 2006), the latter work\u000a      showcased in 2006 by Roberts in a plenary presentation to the 8th\u000a      Conference of Parties to the United Nations Convention on Biological\u000a      Diversity in Brazil, which was attended by all of the parties to OSPAR,\u000a      including Germany. Roberts was asked by Henning von Nordheim of the German\u000a      delegation to assemble and lead an international team of experts on the\u000a      high seas and deep sea in the North Atlantic, to identify and draft\u000a      proposals for areas worthy of protection. The great majority of the\u000a      scientific analysis was done at York by Roberts (at York 1995-present,\u000a      Lecturer then Professor) and a team of three post-graduate students (Beth\u000a      O'Leary (at York 2008-12), Rachel Brown (at York 2008-13) and Melanie\u000a      O'Rourke (at York 2008-9). Two external scientific collaborators\u000a      contributed to two of the eight MPA proposals.\u000a    Between 2008 and 2010, this research network of academics,\u000a      non-governmental organisations and political partners worked closely to\u000a      identify sites worthy of protection, producing its first report on\u000a      candidate sites in 2008. The study identified eight potential MPA sites by\u000a      reviewing scientific literature on the all aspects of the physical and\u000a      biological features of the high seas in the North Atlantic, mapping the\u000a      distribution of significant and vulnerable marine habitats, consulting\u000a      with scientists familiar with the region to establish their views on where\u000a      the greatest threats to wildlife were, and prioritising areas currently\u000a      within reach of serious impact based on bathymetry and human uses such as\u000a      fishing. The sites chosen were spread over a range of habitats and\u000a      geographical zones to maximise representation of biodiversity. The\u000a      resulting network emphasises protection of rugged seamount habitats. They\u000a      are the richest in threatened species, are the target of intensive\u000a      fisheries and have the greatest level of historical impacts.\u000a    Assembling the scientific case was made difficult by lack of data due to\u000a      the high seas' remoteness. Nonetheless, robust cases for protection were\u000a      made based on a wide range of information, from bathymetry and geophysical\u000a      data to old whaling records and fishery investigations. Navigating the\u000a      politics was complex and often frustrating, and members of the York team\u000a      and network attended a series of international meetings to nurture the\u000a      proposals through. In the end, six of the original eight candidate sites\u000a      successfully made it through to designation.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43427","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1282028","Name":"Maldives"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The UNECE LRTAP Convention oversees the assessment of scientific evidence\u000d\u000a      that form the\u000d\u000a      basis of their effects based approach to identifying air pollution\u000d\u000a      emission control options across\u000d\u000a      Europe; detailed in their `multi-pollutant, multi-effect Gothenburg\u000d\u000a      Protocol on Acidification,\u000d\u000a      Eutrophication and Ground Level O3'.

In Europe, efforts were made\u000d\u000a      to compile data from\u000d\u000a      standardised experiments to develop concentration based exposure-response\u000d\u000a      relationships. These\u000d\u000a      were used to establish `Critical Levels' (CLs) providing a policy tool for\u000d\u000a      use in the `effects based'\u000d\u000a      approach adopted by the UNECE LRTAP to optimise emission control across\u000d\u000a      the region. However,\u000d\u000a      these concentration-based risk assessments were compromised in their\u000d\u000a      policy use since they were\u000d\u000a      not suitable for quantification of ecosystem damage and therefore could\u000d\u000a      not be used to estimate\u000d\u000a      the benefits of emission reduction methods. This was due to their only\u000d\u000a      being able to provide an\u000d\u000a      assessment of potential impacts since they did not incorporate modifying\u000d\u000a      factors (dependent upon\u000d\u000a      species traits and prevailing environmental conditions) considered to\u000d\u000a      affect plants sensitivity to O3.\u000d\u000a    Emberson's research centred on the development and application of a novel\u000d\u000a      flux-based risk\u000d\u000a      assessment method. This method applied knowledge of plant ecophysiological\u000d\u000a      processes to\u000d\u000a      estimate relative potential O3 uptake or stomatal O3\u000d\u000a      flux (O3 uptake via the leaf pores) and showed\u000d\u000a      that the geographical distribution of relative risk differed substantially\u000d\u000a      when using flux vs.\u000d\u000a      concentration based methods (Emberson et al., 2000). This flux-based\u000d\u000a      method was parameterised\u000d\u000a      for important European vegetation types forming the core of what was later\u000d\u000a      to become known as\u000d\u000a      the DO3SE (Deposition of Ozone and Stomatal Exchange) model\u000d\u000a      (Emberson et al., 2007). This\u000d\u000a      York developed model is the single model upon which the flux modelling\u000d\u000a      methods now used by the\u000d\u000a      LRTAP Convention are based.\u000d\u000a    To enhance the practical application of this flux-based method Emberson\u000d\u000a      worked with colleagues\u000d\u000a      from the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) in Norway who\u000d\u000a      assess\u000d\u000a      European air quality for the LRTAP Convention. These colleagues use a\u000d\u000a      chemical transport model\u000d\u000a      (CTM) to provide estimates of atmospheric O3 concentration.\u000d\u000a      Incorporation of equations based on\u000d\u000a      standard micrometeorological theory into the DO3SE model\u000d\u000a      allowed estimates of the O3 transfer\u000d\u000a      from the CTM output height to the vegetated surface. The original leaf\u000d\u000a      level stomatal O3 flux model\u000d\u000a      was also developed for an entire canopy adding non-stomatal O3\u000d\u000a      deposition processes (Emberson\u000d\u000a      et al., 2001). This allowed DO3SE to provide the estimate of\u000d\u000a      total O3 deposition in the EMEP CTM\u000d\u000a      integrating the assessment of O3 loss to the vegetated surface\u000d\u000a      layer as well as O3 ecosystem\u000d\u000a      damage. Evaluation against European observational data showed the model\u000d\u000a      performed well for a\u000d\u000a      range of vegetation types and climatic conditions (Tuovinen et al., 2004).\u000d\u000a    The DO3SE stomatal flux model was used in collaboration with\u000d\u000a      experimentalists from across\u000d\u000a      Europe; to derive novel flux-response relationships for a number of crop\u000d\u000a      (Pleijel et al. 2007); forest\u000d\u000a      (Karlsson et al., 2004; Karlsson et al., 2007) and semi-natural grassland\u000d\u000a      (Emberson et al., in prep)\u000d\u000a      species. These flux-response relationships have been used to establish new\u000d\u000a      flux-based CLs (Mills\u000d\u000a      et al., 2011a); as such they provide tools to ensure ecosystem protection\u000d\u000a      and allow cost-benefit\u000d\u000a      analysis of emission reductions to improve food security, carbon\u000d\u000a      sequestration and biodiversity.\u000d\u000a    The validity of the flux-based approach was tested through collaboration\u000d\u000a      with colleagues who host\u000d\u000a      one of the LRTAP Task Forces which assesses air quality damage to\u000d\u000a      vegetation (Integrated Co-operative\u000d\u000a      Programme on Vegetation). These colleagues collate observational and\u000d\u000a      standardised\u000d\u000a      experimental data describing O3 effects on vegetation across\u000d\u000a      Europe; comparisons of the\u000d\u000a      concentration and flux-based methods clearly showed that flux provided a\u000d\u000a      far more realistic\u000d\u000a      indication of the geographical distribution of O3 damage across\u000d\u000a      Europe (Mills et al. 2011b).\u000d\u000a    This research has been conducted since 1999 at the Stockholm Environment\u000d\u000a      Institute (SEI), part of\u000d\u000a      the Environment Dept. of the University of York where Emberson was first\u000d\u000a      employed as a research\u000d\u000a      associate and is now the Centre Director of the SEI York centre; as well\u000d\u000a      as a senior lecturer in the\u000d\u000a      Environment Dept.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43601","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"798549","Name":"Romania"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2264397","Name":"Portugal"},{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"},{"GeoNamesId":"732800","Name":"Bulgaria"},{"GeoNamesId":"3865483","Name":"Argentina"},{"GeoNamesId":"719819","Name":"Hungary"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    From a PhD student hypothesis in 2003, the jasmonate seed treatment has\u000d\u000a      been rapidly commercialised for use in global production, entering the\u000d\u000a      market in the USA in 2010. Use of the seed treatment is benefitting\u000d\u000a      growers by improving crop performance and will ultimately reduce the need\u000d\u000a      for pesticide inputs into agriculture. Commercialisation was achieved as\u000d\u000a      follows.\u000d\u000a    In 2004, after completing his NERC-funded PhD in the Lancaster\u000d\u000a      Environment Centre (LEC), Moore was awarded a fellowship from the\u000d\u000a      Horticultural Development Corporation designed to support knowledge\u000d\u000a      transfer from basic research to its applicationA. The\u000d\u000a      fellowship included the initial development of the seed treatment that was\u000d\u000a      then expanded through the award to LEC of the NERC follow-on awardB\u000d\u000a      which also supported the initial steps of intellectual property assessment\u000d\u000a      and protection, based both in the effectiveness of the technology and the\u000d\u000a      low toxicity of jasmonic acid and its analogues.\u000d\u000a    In 2007, we submitted a patent to protect the technology (International\u000d\u000a      Patent Publication No. WO 2008\/007100).C We also assigned the\u000d\u000a      technology to Plant Bioscience Limited (PBL), a company originally founded\u000d\u000a      jointly by the John Innes Centre and the Sainsbury Laboratory, with BBSRC\u000d\u000a      subsequently becoming a third partner, so that PBL now supports technology\u000d\u000a      development for a wide range of customers (http:\/\/www.pbltechnology.com\/).\u000a      We then worked with PBL to promote the seed treatment technology to\u000d\u000a      potential end-users. There was considerable commercial interest in this\u000d\u000a      technology. This was based partly on the mechanistic understanding that\u000d\u000a      the technology simply primed the crop to deploy its natural defence more\u000d\u000a      effectively when challenged by a pest, which was seen as reducing the risk\u000d\u000a      of pests developing resistance. The interest also resulted because the JA\u000d\u000a      seed treatment was seen to provide a valuable new approach in a market\u000d\u000a      where the range of available control measures was becoming increasingly\u000d\u000a      limited in many countries due to regulatory restrictions on many\u000d\u000a      conventional pesticides. In 2008, a world-wide exclusive licence for the\u000d\u000a      use of the seed treatment was assigned to Becker Underwood, an\u000d\u000a      international agrochemical company (www.beckerunderwood.com\/news\/becker-underwood-granted-exclusive-marketing-rights-for-patented-new-seed-treatment-technology\/),\u000a      subsequently (2012) acquired by BASF (http:\/\/www.basf.com\/group\/pressrelease\/P-12-419).\u000a      Since 2008, the companies have undertaken their own commercial\u000d\u000a      field-trials on a range of crop systems in North and South America and,\u000d\u000a      from 2010, have invested in trials required for formal registration of the\u000d\u000a      technology as a pesticide treatment under EU regulations. Work towards\u000d\u000a      registration is also progressing in Australia, Mexico, Brazil and\u000d\u000a      ArgentinaD. Apart from extending the geographical spread, the\u000d\u000a      JA seed treatment technology is also in development for use on maize,\u000d\u000a      wheat, rice, pulses, cotton and vegetables.D The results from\u000d\u000a      these trials are sufficiently positive for PBL to proceed with patents and\u000d\u000a      for BASF to enter pesticide registration procedures in a range of\u000d\u000a      countries. Patents have been granted in the USA (8,115,053 (2010) and\u000d\u000a      8,507,756 (2013) which extends the scope of the claims), Canada\u000d\u000a      (2,657,057), Europe (2,066,176), Australia (2,007,274,083), New Zealand\u000d\u000a      (574,108), Japan (532,293) and Mexico (304,248). Following the European\u000d\u000a      grant the companies have selected Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Switzerland,\u000d\u000a      Germany, Denmark, Spain, France, UK, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy,\u000d\u000a      Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Turkey for the initial national\u000d\u000a      patents. Applications are being examined in South Korea, Argentina and\u000d\u000a      Brazil.\u000d\u000a    Having acquired the licence, Becker Underwood proceeded very quickly to\u000d\u000a      roll-out the technology into commercial use. The Business Development\u000d\u000a      Manager responsible for the technology at PBL has noted \"This product\u000d\u000a        development timeline represents a major achievement and reflects the\u000d\u000a        strength of the innovation, the clear market opportunity ..... Within\u000d\u000a        the agricultural field PBL has never experienced such a short\u000d\u000a        development period from initial testing (and indeed filing of the patent\u000d\u000a        application) to product launch which was only two years.\"D\u000d\u000a      The commercial use of the JA seed treatment started by incorporating JA as\u000d\u000a      an integral part of their BioStacked&#174; seed technology, the subject of an\u000d\u000a      additional patent by Becker Underwood (US2012\/0077674 A1). Between 2012\u000d\u000a      and the present, Becker Underwood's BioStacked&#174; technologies, notably\u000d\u000a      their HP VaultTM product, a flagship product for the company,\u000d\u000a      which has been used primarily for soybean and peanut in the USA, with more\u000d\u000a      recent application for maize. In February 2013, the US EPA formally\u000d\u000a      approved the JA seed treatment as a bio-insecticide in February 2013 under\u000d\u000a      the trade name TarissTM, initially for pest control on canola,\u000d\u000a      rapeseed, mustard, safflowers and sunflowers.E The EPA also\u000d\u000a      recognised the high level of environmental and health safety of the\u000d\u000a      technology by granting exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for\u000d\u000a      residuesF, accepting the claims we had made when developing the\u000d\u000a      patent. Pesticide registration in Canada is pending approval and the\u000d\u000a      application for registration in Europe is planned for 2014. The company\u000d\u000a      has detailed plans for the technology to be rolled-out internationally as\u000d\u000a      the patent and pesticide registration processes are completed.\u000d\u000a    When Becker Underwood were acquired by BASF in late 2012, the BASF\u000d\u000a      statement recognized the key role of Becker Underwood's innovative seed\u000d\u000a      treatments \"...We are impressed with Becker Underwood's ability to\u000d\u000a        translate growers' needs into innovative, tailor-made solutions that can\u000d\u000a        promote higher yields while conserving resources....particularly in the\u000d\u000a        rapidly-growing seed treatment market, we will be able to develop\u000d\u000a        innovative solutions for agriculture...\"G\u000d\u000a    It remains hard to translate this measurable impact in the agrochemical\u000d\u000a      industry in to the wider economic benefits to growers, but some initial\u000d\u000a      estimates can be made from the use of the technology to date in the US\u000d\u000a      soybean market. Current sales represent treatments for seed sufficient to\u000d\u000a      sow approximately 2,500,000 hectares, i.e. within two years of its\u000d\u000a      introduction the technology is now used over roughly 8% of the total area\u000d\u000a      of soybean in the USA. Based on the company's field trial data, yield\u000d\u000a      increases of 2-7% are attainable from JA-containing treatment for soybean\u000d\u000a      seedD. Taking the most conservative yield increase (2%) and the\u000d\u000a      most recent (2011) data from the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation\u000d\u000a      (FAO) for average yields and farm-gate price for US soybean (http:\/\/faostat.fao.org\/)\u000d\u000a      such increases would represent an increase of 0.06T\/ha with a value of\u000d\u000a      approx. $25\/ha. Based on the use of seed treatment over 8% of the planted\u000d\u000a      area, this yield increase is equivalent to an increase of 135,000T in US\u000d\u000a      soybean production, with a farm gate value of approx. $60M in this one\u000d\u000a      crop for one year alone, even with a conservative estimate of the yield\u000d\u000a      benefits (2% not 7%). If these same assumptions are applied to the global\u000d\u000a      soybean crop, and also assuming no further increase in penetration beyond\u000d\u000a      the 8% currently seen in the USA, the use of the JA seed treatment\u000d\u000a      globally would result is an increase in annual global production of 0.4\u000d\u000a      million tonnes, worth $175 million.\u000d\u000a    Clearly, another impact that is expected to arise from the use of the\u000d\u000a      jasmonate seed treatment is a reduction in the need for chemical\u000d\u000a      pesticides used in commercial crop production. We have always been clear\u000d\u000a      that the seed treatment will be an additional tool in the armoury of pest\u000d\u000a      control that will continue to include chemical pesticides. However, the\u000d\u000a      effectiveness of the seed treatment in pest control, now confirmed by\u000d\u000a      independent researchH to include nematodes, provides a solid\u000d\u000a      basis for reduced pesticide use in many crops. So far as we are aware, at\u000d\u000a      this early stage in the commercial use of the technology, there is no\u000d\u000a      quantification of any such reduction even in soybean, However, in terms of\u000d\u000a      pesticide usage in that crop, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA)\u000d\u000a      identifies six major and ten minor pests attacking the US soybean crop.\u000d\u000a      USDA data also shows that chemical pest control in US soybean involves a\u000d\u000a      suite of approximately twenty active ingredients of which six (two\u000d\u000a      organophosphates (OPs) and four synthetic pyrethrenoids) dominate. Even\u000d\u000a      given the current use of on just this crop, modest reductions in pesticide\u000d\u000a      usage per unit area as a result of the jasmonate seed treatment would\u000d\u000a      result in substantial total reductions in input in to the environment.\u000d\u000a      These socioeconomic and environmental impacts of the jasmonate seed\u000d\u000a      treatment are expected to grow as the technology will continue to be\u000d\u000a      strongly developed by BASF for the foreseeable future. As PBL's Business\u000d\u000a      Development Manager has said \"Over the next few years it is therefore\u000d\u000a        expected that the .... impact of the JA seed treatment will be increased\u000d\u000a        substantially\".D\u000d\u000a    The impact resulting from rapid take-up of our seed treatment technology\u000d\u000a      has been recognized by external bodies.

Jason Moore, then a NERC-funded\u000d\u000a      PhD student (2000-2003, supervised by Paul and Taylor), showed that\u000d\u000a      increased resistance to beetle attack in Rumex spp. was directly\u000d\u000a      linked to reduced leaf expansion through changes in the biophysical\u000d\u000a      properties of leaves that led to leaf stiffening. We also showed that\u000d\u000a      these effects could be stimulated by the exogenous application of\u000d\u000a      jasmonates4-5. Seeing many published reports of attempts to use\u000d\u000a      foliar jasmonate sprays in crop pest control, Moore recognised that their\u000d\u000a      commercial failure could be linked to the negative effects on yield that\u000d\u000a      resulted from the associated plant physiological costs that he was\u000d\u000a      investigating. The scientific insights obtained during this PhD led us to\u000d\u000a      hypothesise that applying jasmonates to seed might induce resistance\u000d\u000a      without the associated detrimental effects. Moore also recognised that\u000d\u000a      this approach was sufficiently distinct to allow IP protection that would\u000d\u000a      not be possible with spray applications. He undertook initial experiments\u000d\u000a      with spider mites on tomato and proved that JA seed treatments did deliver\u000d\u000a      jasmonate-mediated resistance without the associated biological costs6.\u000d\u000a      Those data, and Moore's commercial insight, led Paul, Taylor and Roberts\u000d\u000a      to win a NERC follow-on award to investigate the commercial potential of\u000d\u000a      the jasmonate seed treatment, leading to patent applications and\u000d\u000a      commercial uptake (see section 4).

However, in the\u000a      late-1990s, sludge-to-land disposal was under threat due to concerns about\u000a      its potential contribution to environmental and human exposure to organic\u000a      chemical contaminantsE. In 2001, new legally enforceable limits\u000a      for selected organic compounds in biosolids were suggested by the EU that\u000a      &#8212; if enacted &#8212; would have effectively prohibited recycling to land.F\u000a      The economic and environmental implications of this would have been huge.\u000a      In the UK alone, annual costs for the water industry for disposal would\u000a      have trebled (from &#163;80M to &#163;240M a year).

Further, our findings highlighted\u000a      that biosolids would make only a minor contribution to human exposure via\u000a      crop plants, but that the surface application\/spraying of sludge onto\u000a      grassland could lead to transfers of persistent and bioaccumulatory\u000a      compounds to meat and milk. Since 2001, our research and its policy uptake\u000a      across Europe has ensured a sustainable risk-based approach has been\u000a      adopted that encouraged routine application of biosolids to land via\u000a      evidence-based codes of practice (Water UK 2004 and via later guidance\u000a      documentation Water UK 2010)D&amp;H. Thus, the impact of our\u000a      research continues, helping to enhance yields, save on landfill and\u000a      incineration, whilst recycling a growing waste product into a valued\u000a      resource.\u000a    Defining and guiding the regulation of flame retardant chemicals under\u000a        the Stockholm Convention. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are\u000a      a key group of flame retardant chemicals. Our research into the\u000a      atmospheric transport and bioavailability of deca-bromodiphenyl ether or\u000a      Deca- BDE (see Section 2i, 2iii, 2iv &amp; 2v) supported maintaining its\u000a      use while banning other PBDEs whose detrimental effects on human health\u000a      and the environment exceeded their socio-economic benefit. Deca-BDE is\u000a      widely used in electrical and electronic goods found in households and\u000a      offices (especially in high impact polystyrene (HIPS) casings), in\u000a      vehicles and in certain textiles and fabrics. In 1994, the European\u000a      Commission Regulation 1179\/94 listed Deca-BDE in the Priority List 1 as a\u000a      compound to potentially ban and designated the UK government as the Member\u000a      State rapporteur for the environmental assessment. In May 2009, the UK EA\u000a      released the Environmental Evaluation Report of Deca-BDEI The\u000a      final risk assessment document (EA, 2009) cited Lancaster research as\u000a      evidence for the global distribution of these chemicals. The European\u000a      Commission's Communication on the risk assessment of Deca-BDE confirmed\u000a      that the Member States scientists `have completed the risk evaluation\u000a        activities with regard to man and the environment\" for Deca- BDE and\u000a      that there are no significant risks to the environment or human health\u000a      which would justify risk reduction measures'. Maintaining the use of flame\u000a      retardants has positive net benefits reducing the number and impact of\u000a      fires. In Europe alone, the European Commission has estimated a 20%\u000a      reduction of fire deaths as a result of the use of flame retardants in the\u000a      past 10 years. An EC report demonstrated that 2,926 Europeans lost their\u000a      lives in 2005 in domestic fires, which in economic terms, this is\u000a      equivalent to about &#8364;12.6 billion or 0.17% of GDP. http:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/consumers\/safety\/news\/flame_retardant_substances_study_en.htm.\u000a      On that basis, a 20% reduction in deaths due to the continued use of\u000a      Deca-BDE flame retardants would represent an annual saving of almost 600\u000a      lives and &#8364;2.5 billion.\u000a    In addition to these three specific examples, the global impacts of our\u000a      world-leading research has been facilitated through Sweetman's leading\u000a      role in defining and developing the UK National Implementation Plan since\u000a      2007B and his participation in annual meetings of the UN\/ECE\u000a      Task Force on POPs on-behalf of Defra. In this way our long-term\u000a      monitoring data, modelling approaches and fundamental process-based\u000a      research, continue to provide evidence and policy advice directly to the\u000a      Parties of the Stockholm Convention. Sweetman's promotion to Senior\u000a      Lecturer during the REF period is both recognition of his contribution to\u000a      delivering high-level impact from LEC's research and an investment to\u000a      ensure that our research will continue to deliver impact in the future.\u000a      Our investment in new analytical facilities will also ensure that our\u000a      research continues to provide the evidence needed to balance the\u000a      restriction of some persistent chemicals with the need to ensure chemicals\u000a      whose benefits outweigh their risks remain in use, contributing valuable\u000a      economic and society benefits.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Global waste disposal strategies and chemical regulations have been\u000a      transformed through LEC's world-leading research into the environmental\u000a      sources, fate and behaviour of persistent organic pollutants (POPs).\u000a      Firstly, our research has directly supported controlled high temperature\u000a      incineration as a long-term option for the disposal of municipal waste, by\u000a      showing that well regulated incineration is not an environmentally\u000a      significant source of dioxin emissions.

Alcock, Dr C. Halsall).\u000a    The approach has been to combine\u000a      (i) state-of-the-art chemical analysis applied to determine the\u000a      distribution of POPs at trace and ultra-trace levels in space and time in\u000a      environmental media;\u000a    (ii) estimates\/measurements of emissions and sources of POPs to the\u000a      environment;\u000a    (iii) controlled laboratory and field experiments to quantify particular\u000a      processes and fates; and\u000a    (iv) the development and application of chemical fate models to protect\u000a      human and environmental health.\u000a    This `chemical mass balance and inventory approach' has been used to\u000a      develop a quantitative understanding of the contribution of particular\u000a      sources, practices, pathways, policies or actions on environmental levels\u000a      and the exposure to organisms, including people. This understanding has\u000a      been used to underpin effective decision making by Government, agencies\u000a      and industry in the UK and Europe, and by relevant international agencies\u000a      (e.g. the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants), and in\u000a      the development of waste and chemical management actions. Examples of\u000a      underpinning achievements and insights include:\u000a    (i) The first long-term ambient measurements and trends of dioxins\u000a      (PCDD\/Fs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated diphenyl\u000a      ether (PBDEs) and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This has been\u000a      funded continuously by DEFRA for &gt;20 years, to establish reliable\u000a      baseline data, and to connect links between sources and exposure via\u000a      `chemical fingerprinting', together with the first national and global\u000a      source inventories and environmental budgets to inform policy decisions.\u000a      This work changed the perceptions and focus of policy makers across the\u000a      world1,2,3.\u000a    (ii) The first conclusive evidence that dioxins are not just emitted from\u000a      industrial processes linked to the chlorine industry but have a natural\u000a      baseline level from diffuse combustion sources, clarifying that `zero\u000a      emissions' can never be achieved and cannot form a basis for policy3.\u000a    (iii) Our evidence-led risk-based approach to understanding the fate and\u000a      behaviour of persistent chemicals across human food-chains has maintained\u000a      the recycling of sewage sludge to agricultural land across Europe4.\u000a      This whole systems approach pioneered by the Lancaster group is now\u000a      enshrined in the risk assessment framework that underpins global policy\u000a      approaches to new classes of chemicals (DEFRA, 2012).\u000a    (iv) The establishment of the first pan-European and global background\u000a      air monitoring network, to provide scientifically-based context to\u000a      concerns that polar regions and their biota would be significant global\u000a      sinks for POPs5. Long-range transport of POPs was a key\u000a      evidence measure informing the continuation or cessation of use of\u000a      persistent organic pollutants under the Stockholm Convention.\u000a    (v) We pioneered approaches to quantify the relative importance of\u000a      primary and secondary sources of POPs to the environment over time, which\u000a      has informed decisions on which sources dominate and should be targeted,\u000a      the effectiveness of source reduction measures, the movement of POP\u000a      chemical distribution towards a state of global `air-surface partitioning\u000a      equilibrium' over time, and the relative importance of global source and\u000a      sink areas for selected POPs6.\u000a    Between 1993 and 2013, this area attracted research funding totalling\u000a      ~&#163;8M and supported &gt;60 PhD projects in LEC.

Our research emphasised (i) that many people experienced\u000d\u000a      the flood recovery process as more traumatic than the flood event itself\u000d\u000a      and (ii) that the impact of flood recovery on children and young people\u000d\u000a      was unrecognised in policy.

This involved:\u000d\u000a    1) Developing an online version of our \"Flood Snakes and Ladders' flood\u000d\u000a      recovery training tool. This was devised because research users said they\u000d\u000a      needed ways to demonstrate the complexities of the recovery process,\u000d\u000a      highlight the `recovery gap' and identify opportunities for intervention.\u000d\u000a    2) Undertaking a comprehensive review of the National Recovery Guidance\u000d\u000a      (NRG) for the Cabinet Office, identifying the key learning, gaps and\u000d\u000a      recommendations from the two Hull Flood StudiesD.

The resulting impacts are\u000d\u000a      detailed below.\u000d\u000a    1) Bringing recovery issues to the forefront of policy attention.\u000d\u000a      Prior to 2007, recovery issues were hardly considered in policy documents\u000d\u000a      and related support, which concentrated solely on the disaster itself and\u000d\u000a      the immediate emergency response phase which followed. Our research thus\u000d\u000a      provided policy makers with the evidence that transformed their\u000d\u000a      understanding of recovery. In particular, our work influenced the Pitt\u000d\u000a      Review (the government's national inquiry into the 2007 floods), where it\u000d\u000a      was used as a case study to demonstrate the impacts of flood recovery.E\u000d\u000a      This was particularly significant as, in the interim Pitt Review, health\u000d\u000a      and well-being were subsumed as one page within the \"Recovery\" chapterF.\u000d\u000a      In response to that interim review, we contributed specific evidence on\u000d\u000a      our insights, and the final Pitt Review incorporated a full chapter on\u000d\u000a      this topic, that highlights our work as a specific case studyE.\u000d\u000a      We also influenced post-Pitt policy development through responses to a\u000d\u000a      series of Defra consultations. Most explicitly, in relation to\u000d\u000a      consultation on property-level flood resilience measures, we recommended\u000d\u000a      the introduction of free surveys and a locally-flexible scheme to\u000d\u000a      subsidise the implementation of these measures, and that there should be\u000d\u000a      close liaison with local communities.G All these suggestions\u000d\u000a      were incorporated by Defra as part of a new &#163;5.6 million flood protection\u000d\u000a      grant schemeH.\u000d\u000a    2) Transforming national Guidelines on Community Resilience and\u000d\u000a        Recovery. The Cabinet Office is a major user of our research. They\u000d\u000a      requested our specific involvement in advising policy on community\u000d\u000a      resilience. We were invited to sit on the Community Resilience Programme\u000d\u000a      Steering Group which culminated in our research being quoted as a major\u000d\u000a      influence on policy:\u000d\u000a    \"The Civil Contingencies Secretariat has participated in the steering\u000d\u000a        group for the project, attended workshops and met the diarists to\u000d\u000a        understand the experiences of those affected by major flooding. Access\u000d\u000a        to the diarists, and hearing their experiences influenced the\u000d\u000a        consultation process and provided a constant reminder of the need to\u000d\u000a        ensure that community resilience is accessible and useful to all\u000d\u000a        community members. It also reiterated the need to facilitate increased\u000d\u000a        risk awareness within the population to better inform their decision to\u000d\u000a        get involved in preparing for emergencies.\"G\u000d\u000a    The Civil Contingencies Secretariat also incorporated our learning in\u000d\u000a      their work through `Flood Snakes and Ladders', an interactive flood\u000d\u000a      recovery simulation tool that we developed, and which was used by the\u000d\u000a      Civil Contingencies Secretariat on their staff training. The civil servant\u000d\u000a      who organised this said: \"I think the quotes really demonstrated to\u000d\u000a        them [fellow staff] the real impact on the ground and got many of\u000d\u000a        them to be quite reflective as a result... [The game was] a\u000d\u000a        brilliant way to demonstrate how exceptionally frustrating it would be\u000d\u000a        if it happened in real life.\"i \u000d\u000a    Directly following this, we were commissioned by the Cabinet Office to\u000d\u000a      undertake a comprehensive review of the National Recovery Guidance (NRG)\u000d\u000a      to ensure that it included learning from our research.

In 2011, DEFRA commissioned Frontier Economics\u000d\u000a      Limited to review climate change adaptation, specifically in the context\u000d\u000a      of health and well-being. The company drew extensively on our research,\u000d\u000a      citing us 26 times and stating that \"[our] interview with you directly\u000d\u000a        inform[ed] the `Health and well-being theme' of the report\"K,L.\u000d\u000a      This report has been highly influential, being cited by many organisations\u000d\u000a      in describing their plans for climate adaptation and being used by Defra\u000d\u000a      to inform the National Adaptation Programme.\u000d\u000a    5) Improving support for recovery in contingency planning world-wide.\u000d\u000a      While the Hull case study focussed on flooding, our insights are no less\u000d\u000a      pertinent to resilience to other disasters, natural or otherwise. Our\u000d\u000a      research is now delivering impacts beyond the UK, not least where climatic\u000d\u000a      extremes are bringing increased need for effective contingency planning\u000d\u000a      for natural disasters. We were invited to give two seminars at the\u000d\u000a      National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF) in Australia\u000d\u000a      in April 2011 and these seminars have had an impact on the work of local\u000d\u000a      disaster recovery agencies in Australia by providing them with further\u000d\u000a      evidence of the importance of tackling longer-term recovery issues. For\u000d\u000a      example the Principal Recovery Adviser to the Government of Victoria\u000d\u000a      commented \"....there has been a dearth of research that looks at the\u000d\u000a        'lived experience' of the recovery process. Even with major recent\u000d\u000a        events in Victoria such as the 2009 bushfire with 179 deaths and over\u000d\u000a        2,000 houses destroyed, the 2010-11 floods with around 2,000 homes\u000d\u000a        significantly flooded and many more impacted....

We have worked with Save the Children UK Emergencies team\u000d\u000a      to develop the Journey of Hope (JOH) UK; a post-disaster psychosocial\u000d\u000a      recovery programme for children, young people and their carers.

However, such planning has traditionally focussed on\u000d\u000a      risk assessment and emergency response, with recovery conceived of solely\u000d\u000a      in terms of repairs to infrastructure and short-term health protection.\u000d\u000a      Consequently, residents' needs for support during the longer-term recovery\u000d\u000a      process hardly featured at all in policy prior to our research, which has\u000d\u000a      provided new insights into the nature of disaster recovery.

Their collaboration initially took forward\u000d\u000a      three projects funded by the Environment Agency on flood warnings, risk\u000d\u000a      communication and flood resilience during 2006-8, as well as an FP7\u000d\u000a      project on social capacity building and natural hazards (CAPHAZ-Net). The\u000d\u000a      insights, and the close relationships with stakeholders built through\u000d\u000a      these projects, enabled a rapid response to the severe summer floods in\u000d\u000a      the UK in 2007, with two projects on the recovery process in Hull.\u000d\u000a    Responding to the 2007 floods, the first project, the Hull Floods study,\u000d\u000a      funded by the ESRC, EPSRC, and the Environment Agency (ESRC\/EPSRC RES\u000d\u000a      177-25-0004, 2007-9), was led by Medd and brought together an extended\u000d\u000a      research team including Walker, Dr Nigel Watson, Dr Maggie Mort\u000d\u000a      (Department of Sociology, Lancaster), and Dr Rebecca Whittle (lead\u000d\u000a      researcher). It focused specifically on the process of flood recovery and\u000d\u000a      the impact that the recovery process can have on building future\u000d\u000a      resilience. This represented a major shift from previous research focused\u000d\u000a      on prevention and responses to flood events. We used an innovative\u000d\u000a      longitudinal, qualitative, diary-based research design aiming to document\u000d\u000a      and understand the everyday experience of flood recovery. The project\u000d\u000a      involved intensive stakeholder engagement from the start, with local,\u000d\u000a      regional and national representatives informing the research as it\u000d\u000a      unfolded, and engaging directly with research participants. This was the\u000d\u000a      first time that the flood recovery process had been captured with this\u000d\u000a      level of detail and the project was subsequently assessed as `Outstanding'\u000d\u000a      by the ESRC. The key insights to emerge from this research3,4\u000d\u000a      were that, far from showing a steady process of improvement, flood\u000d\u000a      recovery is punctuated by a distinct series of `highs' and `lows', which\u000d\u000a      are closely tied with other events that are taking place in a person's\u000d\u000a      life, as well as with people's experience of the different agencies and\u000d\u000a      private sector companies involved in the flood recovery process (for\u000d\u000a      example, builders, insurance companies, etc.). It also allowed us to\u000d\u000a      demonstrate the crucial finding that people had to cope with the double\u000d\u000a      trauma that occurs when the first destructive event (the flood) is\u000d\u000a      compounded by secondary challenges that arise from poor treatment from the\u000d\u000a      companies and agencies that are supposed to be helping with the recovery.\u000d\u000a      The research identified a flood recovery gap, i.e. a gap between the\u000d\u000a      legally-defined contingency arrangements, provided for the affected\u000d\u000a      community by its public authorities and agencies, and the less\u000d\u000a      well-defined services provided by the private sector (e.g. insurance,\u000d\u000a      building industry).\u000d\u000a    Early within the project it emerged that there were specific issues\u000d\u000a      facing children and flood recovery, and therefore a second project (funded\u000d\u000a      by the ESRC RES 177-25-2009 and Environment Agency, 2009- 10), focused on\u000d\u000a      the specific experience of children in flood recovery in Hull. The project\u000d\u000a      was again led by the LEC team (Medd and Whittle plus Marion Walker:\u000d\u000a      February 2009 -April 2011), and included collaborations with the\u000d\u000a      Universities of Middlesex and Surrey. The research involved a\u000d\u000a      participatory methodology using \"story-boards', short one to one\u000d\u000a      interviews and focus groups with young participants as well as adults. The\u000d\u000a      core findings focused on the specific vulnerabilities experienced by\u000d\u000a      children and young people during the extended process of disaster recovery\u000d\u000a      and the need to accommodate children and young people's voices into\u000d\u000a      building resilience for the future5,6. Like the adults'\u000d\u000a      project, the Hull Children's Flood Project involved a high level of\u000d\u000a      engagement with stakeholders and the children and young people themselves.\u000d\u000a      For example, led by Marion Walker, the project team received additional\u000d\u000a      funding from the ESRC Festival of Social Science to develop an interactive\u000d\u000a      workshop on flooding and disaster recovery for children and young people6.\u000d\u000a      This included a `Flood Suitcase', specially-designed by a community\u000d\u000a      artist, which contained workshop materials and an adapted version of\u000d\u000a      `Flood Snakes and Ladders' &#8212; a flood recovery simulation exercise\u000d\u000a      developed from the adults' project as a means of enabling stakeholders to\u000d\u000a      experience the `ups' and `downs' of flood recovery.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43604","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Over a period of twenty years our fundamental research into root-shoot\u000d\u000a      signalling in relation to\u000d\u000a      drought has informed the development of a range of technologies through\u000d\u000a      which our science has\u000d\u000a      been applied to deliver environmental and commercial benefits in crop\u000d\u000a      productionA.

Water is\u000d\u000a      an especially pressing environmental, economic and social issue in China,\u000d\u000a      where the population of\u000d\u000a      more than 1.3 billion people, approximately 20% of the world population,\u000d\u000a      depends on only 7% of\u000d\u000a      the world's water supply. Almost 60% of Chinese agricultural land (approx.\u000d\u000a      69.6 m ha) is irrigated.\u000d\u000a      As noted above, exploitation of Lancaster's research in China began with\u000d\u000a      the joint grant to Zhang\u000d\u000a      and Kang in 1996. Their research has been continuously supported by\u000d\u000a      Chinese funders since that\u000d\u000a      date, and LEC continues to contribute direct inputs to those research\u000d\u000a      programs, via, for example,\u000d\u000a      substantial RCUK support focussed on delivering our research into Asia\u000d\u000a      (2008, &#163;25K; 2009, &#163;27K,\u000d\u000a      2012 &#163;180k) culminating in the RCUK China Bridge in 2009 (&#163;1.3M). Because\u000d\u000a      of LEC's continuing\u000d\u000a      collaboration with Kang at the Chinese Agricultural University and Zhang\u000d\u000a      (recently appointed as\u000d\u000a      Director of a State Key Lab in Agrobiotechnology in Hong Kong) we remain\u000d\u000a      closely and directly\u000d\u000a      involved with the on-going development and application of PRD-based\u000d\u000a      systems in Chinese\u000d\u000a      agriculture. To illustrate the reach and significance of the impacts\u000d\u000a      delivered through the application\u000d\u000a      of PRD-based approaches, we focus here on well quantified impacts in\u000d\u000a      northern China. We are\u000d\u000a      aware of the techniques being applied to improve irrigation in Gansu,\u000d\u000a      Shaanxi and Xingjiang\u000d\u000a      Provinces, but the best documented application comes from Gansu where\u000d\u000a      environmental\u000d\u000a      protection and restoration are high priorities for government, as\u000d\u000a      described in the letter from the\u000d\u000a      Gansu Provincial Department of Water ResourceK, \"Shiyang\u000d\u000a        River Catchment is a typical\u000d\u000a        ecologically fragile region with agriculture land of \"no grow without\u000d\u000a        irrigation\". The proportion of\u000d\u000a        water usage for agriculture in the area is over 90%. The water shortage\u000d\u000a        and the over-exploitation\u000d\u000a        of groundwater has caused serious ecological and environmental problems,\u000d\u000a        such as\u000d\u000a        groundwater level drop, vegetation degradation, shrinkage of oasis,\u000d\u000a        desertification, and soil\u000d\u000a        salinization and alkalization.\" The use of PRD-based technologies in\u000d\u000a      Gansu provides a focussed\u000d\u000a      example, not only of impact of Lancaster research on agricultural\u000d\u000a      production, but also far wider\u000d\u000a      socio-economic and environmental benefits.

The Lancaster\u000d\u000a      team, led by Prof Bill Davies\u000d\u000a      CBE and, until his retirement in 2001, Prof Terry Mansfield FRS, showed\u000d\u000a      that soil water status\u000d\u000a        sensed by the roots is communicated to the shoots via long distance\u000d\u000a        chemical signalling1. This\u000d\u000a      information allows the plant to regulate gas exchange, including water\u000d\u000a      loss via transpiration, and\u000d\u000a      growth as a function of water availability2. Davies and his\u000d\u000a      team (including Jianhua Zhang, David\u000d\u000a      Gowing, Carlos Trejo and Francois Tardieu) developed an entirely new\u000d\u000a      experimental technique,\u000d\u000a      the split-root method that allowed the impact of chemical signalling to be\u000d\u000a      separated from that of\u000d\u000a      altered water supply to the shoot. The Lancaster team went on to use this\u000d\u000a      technique to:-\u000d\u000a    (i) demonstrate unequivocally that chemical signals were central to\u000d\u000a      root-to-shoot\u000d\u000a      communication3 and then\u000d\u000a    (ii) identify abscisic acid as a dominant chemical signalling molecule\u000d\u000a      responsible for root-to-shoot\u000d\u000a      signalling under drought conditions4. These advances in the\u000d\u000a      fundamental\u000d\u000a      understanding of plant signalling subsequently led to:-\u000d\u000a    (iii) new insights in to the importance of chemical signalling under\u000d\u000a      environmental stress 5.\u000d\u000a      Finally, this led us, and others, to recognise\u000d\u000a    (iv) that new understanding of the effects of signalling science could\u000d\u000a      form the basis of new\u000d\u000a      techniques in agricultural irrigation.\u000d\u000a    These new irrigation techniques, specifically Partial Root Drying (PRD)2\u000d\u000a      and Alternate Wetting and\u000d\u000a      Drying (AWD)6, are the key element in the impact of our\u000d\u000a      research (see Section 4).\u000d\u000a    Our fundamental research has made a seminal contribution to its field\u000d\u000a      with references to Davies'\u000d\u000a      papers during this period totalling more than 10,000 in ISI Web of\u000d\u000a      Knowledge. The same research\u000d\u000a      has led to a very significant body of translational research showing how\u000d\u000a      fundamental plant\u000d\u000a      physiological ecology can be exploited to sustain\/enhance crop yields and\u000d\u000a      increase water\u000d\u000a      productivity in several parts of the world where sustained food production\u000d\u000a      under drought is crucial if\u000d\u000a      we are to feed an ever expanding world population. Our contribution to\u000d\u000a      this field is highlighted in a\u000d\u000a      paper by Kang and Zhang (J. Exp. Bot.

One of the most\u000d\u000a      important hydrological risks is flooding, which causes huge damage\u000d\u000a      globally, leading to enormous financial and human costs. Flooding is\u000d\u000a      managed through a combination of investment in flood defences, development\u000d\u000a      planning, insurance and emergency or disaster responses. All these\u000d\u000a      activities depend on accurate and detailed flood mapping or real-time\u000d\u000a      forecasts, both based on computer modelling. Governments and insurers\u000d\u000a      require flood models at multiple scales, from national assessments down to\u000d\u000a      local modelling in urban environments. Delivering such models is a\u000d\u000a      significant science challenge because flooding involves many factors that\u000d\u000a      control the occurrence, magnitude and timing of any given event.\u000d\u000a      Lancaster's developments in environmental modelling have been at the\u000d\u000a      leading edge of applying uncertainty concepts to risk models, and have\u000d\u000a      been applied world-wide by a range of end users. However, for this case\u000d\u000a      study we will focus on one specific example in which well-documented\u000d\u000a      impacts delivered by a commercial research user can be directly attributed\u000d\u000a      to Beven's research.\u000d\u000a    Tools for operational flood forecasting typically predict the depth of\u000d\u000a      water at specific locations on a river, but for planning and insurance\u000d\u000a      purposes it is much more important to have two-dimensional (2D) maps of\u000d\u000a      potential flood risk. To produce the most realistic mapping possible\u000d\u000a      demands 2D dynamic hydraulic flow models, which are computationally very\u000d\u000a      intensive, something that constrained widespread application by industry.\u000d\u000a      However, these constraints were lifted through insights resulting from\u000d\u000a      Beven's research on uncertainty methods which gave a stimulus to apply\u000d\u000a      parallel computing techniques for hydrological modelling (see Section 2).\u000d\u000a      This is summarised in the following timeline of some of the key\u000d\u000a      developments.\u000d\u000a    1993-1996 Beven's fundamental research on uncertainty methods\u000d\u000a      includes pioneering use of parallel computing in environmental modelling\u000d\u000a      (references 3 &amp; 4 in Section 2), including in PhD research by one of\u000d\u000a      Beven's students, Rob Lamb (1993-1996).\u000d\u000a    1996. Lamb graduates and maintains links with Lancaster research\u000d\u000a      on risk and uncertainty\u000d\u000a    2002. Lamb joins JBA, a consultancy working in flood risk\u000d\u000a      managementA which has its own in- house 2D flood inundation\u000d\u000a      model, JFlowB.\u000d\u000a    2005-2007. Drawing on his Lancaster research Lamb exploits\u000d\u000a      mass-market graphics processing units (GPUs, parallel processors designed\u000d\u000a      for computer graphics), allowing JBA to run flood models up to a thousand\u000d\u000a      times fasterC,D.\u000d\u000a    2006 onwards. JBA successfully apply JFlow GPU (see evidence of\u000d\u000a      impacts below)D.\u000d\u000a    2009-2011. Lancaster and JBA demonstrate use of JFlow within the\u000d\u000a      GLUE framework in the EPSRC-funded FRMRC project to produce the first\u000d\u000a      uncertainty-based flood maps, including Google earth visualisations.\u000d\u000a      Workshops run with EA, consultants, and town planning staff under\u000d\u000a      Catchment Change Network to disseminate the advances.\u000d\u000a    In summary, co-ordinated fundamental and technological advances, driven\u000d\u000a      by Lancaster's pioneering research and Lancaster-trained personnel, were\u000d\u000a      the enabling research that led JBA to develop the world's first\u000d\u000a      commercially successful GPU-based flood model, and Lancaster to produce\u000d\u000a      the first probabilistic flood risk maps. JBA's software system is now\u000d\u000a      being used world-wideB,C. While the major impacts of JFlow are\u000d\u000a      undoubtedly on those communities and individuals vulnerable to flooding\u000d\u000a      (see below) it is worth noting the commercial success of JBA as a UK\u000d\u000a      company. Since its formation in 1995, it has grown to become a major\u000d\u000a      employer of environment risk analysts, with more than 50 staff directly\u000d\u000a      employed in applying JFlow through JBA Risk management LtdD.\u000d\u000a      Revenues relating to JFlow are currently around &#163;3 million annually, and\u000d\u000a      the company's annual turnover overall is now approximately &#163;13 millionE.\u000d\u000a      In 2012, JBA was a finalist for the Royal Academy of Engineers (RAEng)\u000d\u000a      MacRobert AwardF for innovation, for its use of GPU processing\u000d\u000a      technology in JFlow. This award \"seeks to demonstrate the importance of\u000d\u000a      engineering and the role of engineers and scientists in contributing to\u000d\u000a      national prosperity and international prestige\". In selecting JBA as a\u000d\u000a      finalist, the RAEng recognised JFlow for \"outstanding technical\u000d\u000a        innovation with benefits to the community and commercial success\".\u000d\u000a      Know-how gained through Lancaster research was instrumental to this\u000d\u000a      success, which has enabled JBA to become a world leader, modelling more\u000d\u000a      rivers in more locations than any other company, for private clients and\u000d\u000a      government agencies in the UK and elsewhereD.\u000d\u000a    JFlow delivers maps and analytical products underpinning many assessments\u000d\u000a      of flood risk in the UK and beyondF. In England, the\u000d\u000a      Environment Agency's National Assessment of Flood Risks (NaFRA) 2009\u000d\u000a      estimates that one in six homes are at risk, with annual damage costing\u000d\u000a      more than &#163;1billion. Following major floods in 2007, Sir Michael Pitt's\u000d\u000a      review included the urgent recommendation for improved flood mapping, in\u000d\u000a      particular for floods caused not by rivers bursting their banks but by\u000d\u000a      overland runoff, and the incorporation of prediction uncertainties into\u000d\u000a      flood forecasting and planning. This type of mapping had not been done\u000d\u000a      comprehensively, partially because of the high computational cost. However\u000d\u000a      JFlow-GPU allowed JBA to produce the first national surface water flood\u000d\u000a        map, which JBA licensed to the Environment AgencyG. \"JBA\u000d\u000a      has subsequently delivered two major updates for the Environment Agency's\u000d\u000a      national surface flood mapsD,H. JBA also used JFlow for reservoir\u000a        inundation maps meeting Government's strategic needs under emergency\u000d\u000a      planning legislation, modelling potential impacts from breaching of 2100\u000d\u000a      reservoirs in the UKH - This provides information necessary for\u000d\u000a      public security at one tenth of the cost of alternative modelling\u000d\u000a      approaches also testedE.\u000d\u000a    The RAEng noted that \"JBA Consulting's flood risk modelling system,\u000d\u000a        JFlow, has become ... an essential tool for the UK's insurance industry\"I.\u000d\u000a      According to JBA, in 2013 \"GPU-based JFlow software is now used by 70%\u000d\u000a        of UK and 80% of Irish Insurers, including the top five UK insurers by\u000d\u000a        market shareD. Maps produced using JFlow were described\u000d\u000a      by leading insurer Aviva as \"revolutionary\"J. At a time when\u000d\u000a      many householders face problems obtaining household insurance due to flood\u000d\u000a      risk, a major societal benefit arising from the improved precision and\u000d\u000a      confidence delivered by JBA's use of JFlow has been to allow insurers to\u000d\u000a      qualify more than 600,000 properties in flood risk areas for insuranceK.\u000d\u000a    With the productivity gains realised through GPU parallel technology, JBA\u000d\u000a      has also been able to develop national flood maps for Ireland, France,\u000d\u000a        Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Belgium and\u000d\u000a        LuxembourgC,K. The lower cost of using JFlow instead of\u000d\u000a      more \"traditional\" approaches makes it ideal for modelling flood risk in\u000d\u000a      developing countries, where flood mapping has previously been uneconomic.\u000d\u000a      A prime example is the response to major flooding in Thailand in 2011.\u000d\u000a      This was one of the five costliest natural disasters in modern history\u000d\u000a      (with World Bank estimates of USD45.7 billion economic losses and some 1.5\u000d\u000a      million homes and other buildings affected). JBA \"was able to respond\u000d\u000a        by using JFlow to produce flood maps of the whole country within four\u000d\u000a        months\"E. This mapping helped to provide credible\u000d\u000a      information about flood risks that has been taken up by insurers and helps\u000d\u000a      to underpin the marketL\u000d\u000a    While JFlow's adoption of parallel computing technology forms a focussed\u000d\u000a      case study of the impact of developments driven by Lancaster's research,\u000d\u000a      there are other cases where our research has been at the leading edge of\u000d\u000a      applying risk and uncertainty concepts to floods and flood risk. One\u000d\u000a      example is the incorporation of Lancaster's flood forecasting methods into\u000d\u000a      the Deltares flood early-warning systemM that is \"... applied\u000a        as the primary operational flood forecasting tool used by flood\u000d\u000a        management authorities in basins across the continental United States\u000d\u000a        and Alaska, in England and Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Netherlands,\u000d\u000a        Germany, Austria, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Taiwan, Pakistan, the\u000d\u000a        Zambezi basin, Ghana, Canada, Colombia, Indonesia, Bolivia and by the\u000d\u000a        Mekong River Commission\"N.

The impact described in\u000d\u000a      Section 4 is based on the application of Beven's pioneering research in\u000d\u000a      computer modelling for hydrological prediction. Impacts have been achieved\u000d\u000a      especially through the development of the Generalised Likelihood\u000d\u000a      Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) approach, which required innovative methods\u000d\u000a      to implement the computationally demanding Monte Carlo simulation at its\u000d\u000a      core and, with Prof. Peter Young, Data Based Mechanistic modelling\u000d\u000a      techniques for adaptive probabilistic real-time forecasting. The\u000d\u000a      application of computationally intensive modelling has proved especially\u000d\u000a      valuable in river catchment management. It enables realistic modelling of\u000d\u000a      phenomena such as water quality and flooding, in combination with the\u000d\u000a      methods needed to assess risk and uncertainty that attempt to deal with\u000d\u000a      the sources of error in testing models more explicitly than traditional\u000d\u000a      statistical methods (e.g. see references 1 and 2, Section 3). Early\u000d\u000a      applications included novel analysis of uncertainty in flood-plain\u000d\u000a      inundation models (reference 3). Between 1993 and 2012, research in this\u000d\u000a      area has attracted research funding totalling approximately &#163;4.5M and\u000d\u000a      supported c. 18 PhD projects.\u000d\u000a    Beven and his co-workers recognized that the effective application of\u000d\u000a      models for risk and uncertainty assessments in the environmental sciences\u000d\u000a      required the application of then state-of-the-art advances in computing\u000d\u000a      power. That insight led Beven's team to pursue the innovative use of\u000d\u000a      parallel computing techniques emerging from the domain of High Performance\u000d\u000a      Computing into hydrological modelling, an advance which underpinned\u000d\u000a      numerous academic publications (see for example references 4-5 in Section\u000d\u000a      3). This early work laid the foundation for the later realisation by one\u000d\u000a      of Beven's students that computing systems designed for video gaming could\u000d\u000a      be adapted cheaply to overcome computational constraints on\u000d\u000a      two-dimensional flood inundation models used for flood risk management\u000d\u000a      (see Section 4). There is on-going iteration between Beven's fundamental\u000d\u000a      research (e.g. reference 6) and its application by government and industry\u000d\u000a      stakeholders, which continues to enhance impact. Beven led the Risk and\u000d\u000a      Uncertainty component in Phase 1 of the Flood Risk Research Management\u000d\u000a      Research Consortium (FRMRC1) funded by EPSRC, Defra\/EA and others\u000d\u000a      (2004-2012), and the GridStix forecasting project within the NERC FREE\u000d\u000a      Programme.

Specifically, the work led by Professor Tett saved the\u000a      UK approximately &#163;6 billion (as estimated by the Environment Agency) with\u000a      UK taxpayers as the ultimate beneficiaries.\u000a    The UWWTD governs how member states should treat sewage discharges into\u000a      coastal waters. It requires the application of tertiary treatment to\u000a      remove nutrients when discharges occur into eutrophic waters. In 1999, the\u000a      European Commission (EC) accused the UK of infracting the UWWTD by failing\u000a      to identify certain coastal waters in England and Wales as eutrophic, and\u000a      the case came before the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in 2007.\u000a      Defending the case involved empirical work on the relationships between\u000a      nutrients and algal growth and conceptual clarity around what was meant by\u000a      the key term undesirable disturbance taken from the UWWTD\u000a      definition of eutrophication.\u000a    In anticipation of this case, in 2004, DEFRA commissioned a review of\u000a      'undesirable disturbance in the context of eutrophication' from a group\u000a      led by Tett. The group (see Tett et al., 2007)3.1\u000a      concluded that `an undesirable disturbance is a perturbation of a\u000a        marine ecosystem that appreciably degrades the health or threatens the\u000a        sustainable human use of that ecosystem', and proposed methods for\u000a      detecting such disturbance. The methods were applied by a team including\u000a      Tett and colleagues from SAMS, CEFAS, the Agri-Food and Biosciences\u000a      Institute, and elsewhere, to show lack of undesirable disturbance in the\u000a      Irish Sea, one of the contested areas (Gowen et al., 2008)3.6.\u000a    During the defence, the UK was able to cite the undesirable disturbance\u000a      work and the arguments were accepted by the Court (e.g. para. 330, 332 &#8212; they refer to the paper as the Gowen report 2007)5.1,5.2. In\u000a      addition, evidence from Tett and Gowen on the biology of phytoplankton\u000a      growth was presented orally to court in April 2009. This drew on the CSTT\u000a      work and demonstrated that most UK coastal waters were light limited\u000a      because of turbidity, which was crucial in winning the case5.1.\u000a      In December 2009, it was announced that the UK had won the relevant part\u000a      of its case (ECJ, 2009), thus avoiding fines, and the necessity for very\u000a      expensive tertiary sewage treatment plants. The work has influenced other\u000a      areas of UK response to EU legislation, for example the EU's Marine\u000a      Strategy Framework Directive (adopted in June 2008). This aims to protect\u000a      the marine environment across Europe by achieving `good environmental\u000a      status' of the EU's marine waters by 2020, and to protect the resource\u000a      base upon which marine-related economic and social activities depend. As\u000a      in the case of the UWWTD, implementing the legislation requires conceptual\u000a      clarity about key terms and the scientific tools and procedures to measure\u000a      the relevant variables. In particular, it requires that the commission\u000a      should lay down criteria and methodological standards to allow consistency\u000a      of approach in evaluating the extent to which Good Environmental Status\u000a      (GES) is being achieved. The Commission established Task Groups of experts\u000a      to achieve this for each of the descriptors in the directive. Task group 5\u000a      reported on eutrophication in 20105.3. It included Tett as one\u000a      of the expert authors, and drew on the work on undesirable disturbance and\u000a      the plankton community index to establish standards that will be used in\u000a      implementing the directive across the EU, thus helping to maintain and\u000a      enhance the health of the marine environment within the EU.\u000a    Impacts of the work in defining assimilative capacity and undesirable\u000a      disturbance included policy on aquaculture, in particular on the siting of\u000a      finfish and shellfish farms5.4. Tett and Fernandes were authors\u000a      on the Huntington et al. 2006 report to the Directorate-General\u000a      for Fish and Maritime Affairs of the EC on `Some Aspects of the\u000a      Environmental Impact of Aquaculture in Sensitive Areas'. This has been\u000a      used by the EC to inform policy on aquaculture. It has also informed the\u000a      application of the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) sustainable fisheries\u000a      certification in Scottish waters. For example, the Shetland and Scottish\u000a      Mainland Rope Grown mussel Enhanced fishery was certified by the MSC in\u000a      April 2012, using Huntington et al. 2006 to support their\u000a      `principle 2 &#8212; ecosystem sustainability'5.5. This industry is\u000a      growing rapidly, with more than 7,000 tonnes produced in 2010. Its further\u000a      growth will be supported by the MSC accreditation.\u000a    Hence, the ENU work on healthy seas has established a strong tradition of\u000a      interpreting fundamental ecological concepts, such as ecosystem health,\u000a      and facilitating their application by policy makers in settings from\u000a      pollution control to ecosystem restoration.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Managing and conserving the marine environment requires defining what\u000a      constitutes healthy ecosystems and understanding the effects of pollution.\u000a      Edinburgh Napier University (ENU) research defining `undesirable\u000a      disturbance' allowed the United Kingdom (UK) to mount a successful defence\u000a      at the European Court of Justice in 2009 against alleged infraction of UK\u000a      obligations under the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive.

Three related questions underpin\u000a      this work from these origins until today: 1) How do we know what\u000a      conditions are `natural' or `healthy'? 2) How can we detect changes from a\u000a      healthy state? 3) How can we predict the impacts of pollution and\u000a      disturbance on marine systems? Answering these questions for phytoplankton\u000a      communities was the main focus of the group led by Professor Paul Tett\u000a      (ENU, 1996 - 2009, when the research underpinning this case was\u000a      conducted). Using modelling, field sampling and laboratory approaches, the\u000a      Tett group explored the relationships between nutrient inputs and\u000a      phytoplankton growth. They explained seasonal cycles under natural\u000a      conditions in Scotland (e.g. with J. Lee, ENU, 1996 - 2002)3.4\u000a      and in Northern Ireland (with E. Capuzzo, 2005 - 2011 funded by the Loughs\u000a      Agency), and under conditions of enhanced nutrient inputs (with V.\u000a      Edwards, 1997 - 2001, co-supervised with the Scottish Environment\u000a      Protection Agency; (SEPA))3.5.\u000a    This work modelled the `assimilative capacity' of water bodies. The\u000a      concept of assimilative capacity informs policy on pollution control. It\u000a      assumes that there are acceptable quantities of pollution that can be\u000a      absorbed by natural environments. Exceeding these limits results in\u000a      detectable impacts that should be avoided. For example, inputs of\u000a      nutrients that exceed limits can lead to eutrophication. The core\u000a      predictive model developed and refined by the Tett team (with the Scottish\u000a      Association for Marine Science, (SAMS)) is known as the CSTT (after the\u000a      `Comprehensive Studies Task Team' established by the UK Government). This\u000a      predicts plankton biomass given nutrient and light conditions. Model\u000a      predictions were validated, by ENU, SAMS and others, against observations\u000a      from the Mediterranean to the Arctic in the European project OAERRE3.3,\u000a      and in Loch Creran by ENU-SAMS PhD student C. Laurent 3.2.\u000a    Applying biological understanding to policy required clear definitions of\u000a      terms. The Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (EEC 1991) gives the\u000a      following definition of eutrophication: \"The enrichment of waters by\u000a      nutrients... causing an accelerated growth of algae... to produce an undesirable\u000a        disturbance to the balance of organisms present in the water\". Hence\u000a      defining `undesirable disturbance' is of crucial importance in applying\u000a      this directive. Work led by Prof. Tett, funded by the UK Government\u000a      (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; DEFRA) and with other\u000a      permanent ENU staff (Mark Huxham, 1995 &#8212; present, Teresa Fernandes, 1994 - 2012 and Linda Gilpin, 1996 &#8212; present), and colleagues from SAMS, the\u000a      Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS), Hull\u000a      University and elsewhere, produced a working definition of this term that\u000a      has since been used by policy makers3.1.\u000a    The latest developments in using phytoplankton science to inform policy\u000a      have come from the Tett team's invention of the Phytoplankton Community\u000a      Index (PCI). Work on undesirable disturbance showed how biomass\u000a      alone was an insufficient indicator: the balance of types of organisms is\u000a      also crucial. The PCI applies life form theory to phytoplankton modelling\u000a      which allows an understanding of when ecosystems are moving towards less\u000a      desirable states, without the burdensome requirement to identify all taxa\u000a      to species level.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43930","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","Natural Environment Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Our work has had local (environmental and social improvements), national\u000a      (policy development and implementation) and international (formation of\u000a      regional and international practitioner networks) impacts; has informed\u000a      policy makers and has raised awareness and understanding among the general\u000a      public in Kenya and the UK.\u000a    Coastal communities in Kenya suffer from chronic poverty.

Despite this high value they are being rapidly\u000a      destroyed, at rates exceeding those for terrestrial tropical forest,\u000a      through coastal development, aquaculture and logging. This case study\u000a      describes novel research (from 2002-2013) on mangroves and application of\u000a      this new understanding in practical ways to conserve them. Initial\u000a      research led by Professor Mark Huxham (ENU, 1995-2013), including PhD\u000a      students and research assistants at ENU, demonstrated juvenile fish use of\u000a      Kenyan mangroves using natural chemical tracers retained in adult fish3.6.\u000a      This helped make the case for the importance of mangroves as nursery\u000a      sites. Research then explored the processes of ecosystem recovery, driven\u000a      by the need to restore large areas devastated by industrial wood\u000a      extraction some 30 years previously. Two Kenyan and one Sri Lankan PhD\u000a      students, registered at ENU, as well as scientists from Kenya\u000a      (specifically, Dr James Kairo of the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research\u000a      Institute), Sri Lanka (Professor Loku Jayatissa) and the UK (especially Dr\u000a      Martin Skov, Bangor University and Professor Maurizio Mencuccini,\u000a      Edinburgh University) were heavily involved in this work, which has been\u000a      supported throughout by the Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO),\u000a      Earthwatch Institute. Large scale experiments (planting 5872 trees)\u000a      revealed the key physical and chemical constraints preventing natural\u000a      regeneration (increased wave impact and salinization), and determined the\u000a      nursery techniques and target species to be used in active restoration3.3, 3.4. In addition to these practical applications, ENU work\u000a      addressed questions of fundamental interest to ecosystem science,\u000a      including the role of species richness in ecosystem functions and of\u000a      positive facilitation in plant growth in harsh environments3.1.\u000a      We demonstrated for the first time how higher species richness and higher\u000a      density can contribute to survival and ecosystem restoration in mangroves,\u000a      and how altering planting strategies affects the forests' ability to keep\u000a      up with sea-level rise by raising the level of their substrates3.5.\u000a    Mangrove forests are amongst the most efficient natural carbon sinks and\u000a      are of global importance as carbon stores. One strand of ENU work has\u000a      focused on quantifying carbon flows in the forests, for example by looking\u000a      at rates of decomposition of below-ground carbon, and at the impacts of\u000a      cutting trees on greenhouse gas fluxes.

BBCT is a registered charity and\u000d\u000a      limited company devoted to translating what we have learned about\u000d\u000a      bumblebee biology into practical measures to conserve this declining group\u000d\u000a      of pollinators. The impacts outlined in this case study have all occurred\u000d\u000a      during the period 2008 &#8212; 2013 with the relevant underpinning research\u000d\u000a      outputs including; detailed knowledge of bumblebee foraging and nesting\u000d\u000a      needs, understanding of their distributions, population density and\u000d\u000a      dispersal abilities, and knowledge on the scale at which habitat\u000d\u000a      manipulations are required to influence bumblebee population size.\u000d\u000a    The charity has grown from a starting point of no paid staff, no members\u000d\u000a      and no funds to have 8,000 members (plus 13,000 followers on Twitter) and\u000d\u000a      provide employment for 12 staff (Feb 2013). It has main offices in\u000d\u000a      Stirling and Eastleigh (Hants), and further staff based in Kent and South\u000d\u000a      Wales. All members receive wildflower seeds, an identification poster and\u000d\u000a      a quarterly newsletter. They are strongly encouraged to get involved in\u000d\u000a      trust activities which include bumblebee identification training days and\u000d\u000a      three different bumblebee recording schemes. Between them these schemes\u000d\u000a      have so far generated &gt;100,000 individual bee records sent in by\u000d\u000a      &gt;12,000 recorders.\u000d\u000a    Impacts arising from this work:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Lobbying: Our activities have led to a number of invitations to meet\u000d\u000a        with politicians, including members of the Scottish and European\u000d\u000a        Parliaments, Ministers, and even an invitation to visit to No.10. We had\u000d\u000a        input to the recent \"Postnote\" (Parliamentary briefing notes) on\u000d\u000a        Pollination. Following the publication of two landmark papers in Science\u000d\u000a        on bees and neonicotinoid pesticides (Whitehorn et al. 2012, and one\u000d\u000a        from a French research group, Henry et al. 2012), Goulson has been\u000d\u000a        invited to give evidence to the Environmental Audit Committee\u000d\u000a        investigation into Insects and Insecticides, an enquiry which was\u000d\u000a        launched in part as a result of the publication of Whitehorn et al. He\u000d\u000a        was also asked to give a talk to the All Party Parliamentary Group on\u000d\u000a        Agroecology (both in Westminster). Goulson was asked by EFSA to input\u000d\u000a        into the development of new protocols for evaluating plant protection\u000d\u000a        products, and was invited to the Pesticide Safety Directorate in York to\u000d\u000a        discuss the safety of neonicotinoids. In April 2013 the EU announced a\u000d\u000a        two year moratorium on use of neonicotinoid insecticides on flowering\u000d\u000a        crops, an outcome which can be clearly traced back to the publication of\u000d\u000a        Whitehorn et al. and Henry et al (see section 5; Environmental Audit\u000d\u000a        Committee 2013).\u000d\u000a      Awareness: Since the launch of BBCT was featured in the front three\u000d\u000a        pages of The Independent, we have had much media coverage,\u000d\u000a        including substantial articles about bumblebees and their decline in The\u000d\u000a          Sunday Times, The Guardian, The Telegraph, The Daily Mail,\u000d\u000a        television coverage on BBC \"The One Show\" and BBC Breakfast News (Sept,\u000d\u000a        2008), and a 30 minute programme \"The Plight of the Bumblebee\" on Radio\u000d\u000a        4 (Oct, 2009). This media coverage has substantially raised awareness of\u000d\u000a        bumblebee declines and how they may be reversed in the public\u000d\u000a        consciousness. The publication of Whitehorn et al. (2012) was covered by\u000d\u000a        major national newspapers across the world (e.g. Washington Post, Le\u000d\u000a          Monde, Stern, New York Times), greatly increasing public and\u000d\u000a        political interest in the role of pesticides in bee declines.\u000d\u000a      Children: we have a mission to raise awareness in children (the land\u000d\u000a        managers of tomorrow), and to this end we obtained funding from Scottish\u000d\u000a        Natural Heritage to develop an education pack for primary schools. This\u000d\u000a        had input from educational specialists and was trialled in several\u000d\u000a        primary schools; it has since been requested and sent out to over 260\u000d\u000a        schools. Trust staff have visited many schools to talk about bumblebees\u000d\u000a        and advise on creating school wildlife gardens.\u000d\u000a      Wildlife gardening: In 2009 we teamed up with Wyevale Garden Centres\u000d\u000a        to run an \"Insect Weekend\" with displays illustrating the best plants\u000d\u000a        for bumblebees in 122 garden centres across the country. The trust has\u000d\u000a        distributed &gt;15,000 packs of wildflower seeds. Through an initiative\u000d\u000a        with Morrison's supermarkets, 200,000 packets of wildflower seed and\u000d\u000a        information on bumblebees were given away with bouquets of flowers in\u000d\u000a        2010.\u000d\u000a      Practical Conservation: The Trust set up the first \"Bumblebee nature\u000d\u000a        reserve\", an 8 ha grassland restoration project at Royal Society for the\u000d\u000a        Protection of Birds' (RSPB) Vane Farm, Loch Leven. We obtained funding\u000d\u000a        for a major (80 ha) grassland restoration project in Carmarthenshire\u000d\u000a        with the Grasslands Trust. With funding from Natural England and working\u000d\u000a        with various partners including RSPB, we co-ordinated a project to\u000d\u000a        reintroduce the extinct short-haired bumblebee to the UK: results from\u000d\u000a        summer 2013 have shown that at least some of these bees have now bred\u000d\u000a        successfully as new queens and workers have been observed. More than\u000d\u000a        1,000 ha of suitable bumblebee habitat have been created in SE Kent in\u000d\u000a        advance of the reintroduction attempt. Working with Farming &amp;\u000d\u000a        Wildlife Advisory Group and National Farmers Union, each spring and\u000d\u000a        summer our two conservation officers organise numerous \"farmers days\",\u000d\u000a        on-farm social gatherings at which farmers meet to discuss bumblebee\u000d\u000a        conservation and how best to manage bumblebee-friendly agri-environment\u000d\u000a        prescriptions. Farmers very readily grasp the importance of bumblebees\u000d\u000a        as pollinators of crops and wildflowers, and we have found that this\u000d\u000a        grass-roots approach to conservation is paying great dividends in terms\u000d\u000a        of delivering bee-friendly farming. Many more projects are in the\u000d\u000a        pipeline. Overall, so far the trust has played a role in the creation of\u000d\u000a        &gt;2,000 ha of habitat.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The Bumblebee Conservation Trust (BBCT), a conservation charity launched\u000d\u000a      at the University of Stirling in 2006, was aimed at bridging the gap\u000d\u000a      between research findings and conservation practice.

The group have also become involved\u000d\u000a      in understanding the effects that bees can have on biodiversity when\u000d\u000a      released outside their native range. Finally, studies of the sublethal\u000d\u000a      effects of pesticides on bumblebee colony growth have revealed that use of\u000d\u000a      systemic pesticides on flowering crops is likely to be having a major\u000d\u000a      impact on bumblebee populations (Whitehorn et al. 2012).\u000d\u000a    In combination with studies of bumblebees conducted by other research\u000d\u000a      groups elsewhere, we now have a clear idea how to conserve bumblebees;\u000d\u000a      they simply need enough of the right flowers, at the right times of year,\u000d\u000a      provided in patches distributed at an appropriate spatial scale. For some\u000d\u000a      species, action is urgently needed as current populations are too small to\u000d\u000a      persist in the long term; unless population size is increased they will\u000d\u000a      probably go extinct. This action needs to be integrated with farming\u000d\u000a      practices, including alterations to pesticide usage on flowering crops, to\u000d\u000a      produce a sustainable system whereby pollination services for crops and\u000d\u000a      wildflowers are secured. However, farmers, nature reserve wardens and\u000d\u000a      politicians do not read scientific journals. Much of the research that\u000d\u000a      goes on into how best to conserve declining species is never translated\u000d\u000a      into action, so the Bumblebee Conservation Trust was founded to bridge\u000d\u000a      this gap between research findings and conservation practice.\u000d\u000a    Goulson left Stirling in 2013, but BBCT remains based within Biological\u000d\u000a      and Environmental Sciences at Stirling and the work continues under\u000d\u000a      Whitehorn, Park and Tinsley who have retained a collaborative link with\u000d\u000a      Goulson. Another researcher within the group, Darvill, took up the\u000d\u000a      position of CEO within BBCT between 2009 and 2012.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44020","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1733045","Name":"Malaysia"}],"Funders":["Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    As an internationally leading expert on radiological protection of the\u000a      environment, Copplestone has been appointed to Committee 5 (Environmental\u000a      Protection) of the International Commission on Radiological Protection\u000a      (ICRP).

At the\u000a      radioecology end of the ERL's research spectrum, we have developed\u000a      radiological risk assessment methods for humans and wildlife, and assessed\u000a      the impacts of radionuclides released during radioactive waste management\u000a      and disposal, reprocessing, power generation and nuclear accidents. Our\u000a      current research in this area is focused on understanding the ecological\u000a      effects of ionising radiation, and how ecological systems adapt to the\u000a      environmental stress caused by such exposure. Models developed by\u000a      Copplestone of radionuclide transfer and behaviour have been used to\u000a      improve radiological risk assessments. We have also applied genetic and\u000a      molecular techniques to better understand radiological impacts on\u000a      wildlife. We continue to assist the Environment Agency in the development\u000a      of their approach to wildlife risk assessment from ionising radiation. Our\u000a      research into radionuclide transfer parameters to, and on the biological\u000a      effects of ionising radiation on, wildlife is contributing to the\u000a      development of international databases (www.wildlifetransferdatabase.org\u000a      and www.frederica-online.org\u000a      respectively). The scientific understanding derived from his research\u000a      is currently being used in the development of the International Commission\u000a      for Radiological Protection's (ICRP), recommendations for environmental\u000a      protection (he is a member of the ICRP's Committee 5).\u000a    At the physical end of environmental radioactivity research, we\u000a      specialise in laboratory, in-situ and mobile gamma spectrometry,\u000a      environmental dosimetry and the characterisation of radioactive hot\u000a      particles and developed the ISO17025 accredited ERL to demonstrate system\u000a      quality and traceability. The development of real time in-situ and mobile\u000a      gamma detector systems (exploiting new crystal technologies and\u000a      configurations) offer immediate benefits to surveys of contaminated land,\u000a      site characterisation and determining dose rates but is hindered by\u000a      variations in the vertical activity distribution leading to significant\u000a      loss of measurement accuracy. This research exploits characteristics of\u000a      scattered photon radiation using novel spectral algorithms, driven by\u000a      empirical and Monte Carlo approaches, to yield information on the spatial\u000a      (including depth) distribution of specific radionuclides in the\u000a      environment. Importantly, this approach provides the way forward for more\u000a      accurate in-situ estimation of environmental radioactivity concentrations\u000a      to: 1) support baseline surveys for environmental radioactivity; 2) enable\u000a      the detection of hot particles; and 3) provide accurate real-time\u000a      contaminated land assessment. The ERL undertook the first in-situ\u000a      radiometric survey at a national scale to estimate the background\u000a      radionuclide concentrations and contributions to external gamma dose rate\u000a      for Environment Agency, Scottish and Northern Ireland Funding for\u000a      Environmental Research, Food Standards Agency and Department for\u000a      Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. By exploiting airborne remote sensing\u000a      techniques we provided maps of the distribution of radionuclides in\u000a      estuarine environments for better dose characterisation of people and\u000a      wildlife. This was expanded further to establish the dose rates to\u000a      critical groups within the Ribble Estuary in support of the Environment\u000a      Agency's dose assessments, where it was demonstrated that the monitoring\u000a      of Beta and Gamma dose rates for regulatory purposes were inadequate. This\u000a      resulted in revisions in the statutory monitoring programmes taking\u000a      account of our recommendations on correct instrument deployment, use and\u000a      data processing.

Strategically, urban development was being constrained\u000a      because appropriately sustainable solutions could not be found to meet\u000a      societal and regulatory issues concerning environmental quality and\u000a      flooding. The initial objective of the research funded by stakeholders and\u000a      undertaken by the SUDS Scottish Centre of Excellence was to determine the\u000a      principles by which SUDS could be implemented most successfully in\u000a      Scotland and this was later extended to the remainder of the UK, to other\u000a      European countries and even more broadly from 2013 onward. Since 2005,\u000a      National (Scotland) policy has required all new developments to adopt\u000a      and\/or change their drainage approach and methodologies to include the use\u000a      of SUDS. However, prior to this, evidence of benefit and practical\u000a      implementation was not obvious and compelling to the number of different\u000a      stakeholder organisations involved in the requisite adoption of SUDS.\u000a    Therefore a series of prototype systems had to be constructed, their\u000a      performance monitored and results assessed. Once this stage was underway,\u000a      guidance was prepared, professionals trained and a wide public debate\u000a      commenced. There were three phases to Abertay's impact;\u000a    - 1998 to 2005 &#8212; a series of PhD and Masters field research programmes,\u000a      predominantly at Abertay, but also at partner universities benchmarking\u000a      performance of SUDS that was require for the implementation and policy\u000a      change\u000a    - 2005 to 2008 &#8212; the work was consolidated into guidance driven by\u000a      policy.\u000a    - 2008 - 2013 The group engaged with international programmes to\u000a      disseminate the outcomes nationally (UK) and internationally.\u000a    Specific impacts on public policies and services are as\u000a      follows (numbers refer to sources of evidence listed in section 5);\u000a    i) Public policy enabled through the monitoring programme. New methods\u000a      and monitoring techniques were developed by the research at Abertay to\u000a      support the policy changes [1].\u000a    ii) SUDS are required by the Water Environment and Water Services Act\u000a      (2006) but the method of implementation was not clear. Our research\u000a      informed the approach of SEPA to regulate SUDS through the Controlled\u000a      Activities Regulations and of SW in the development of a corporate\u000a      approach [1, 2].\u000a    iii) Delivery of a public service (by Scottish Water) has changed through\u000a      the development of a roll- out process and by means of costing the public\u000a      element of SUDS which are now part of `normal business' in Scottish Water.\u000a      The research was delivered into Scottish Water through KTP projects\u000a      KTP7116 and KTP7784. Of specific societal importance, the `reasonable\u000a      cost' of drainage has been defined. [2, 6].\u000a    The impact on international development policies is;\u000a    i) The impact continues through Abertay's involvement in the EU project\u000a      E2STORMED which commenced in early 2013 focusing on stormwater and energy\u000a      management using SUDS in six Mediterranean countries.\u000a    ii) Professor Jefferies presented a paper based on our research to the\u000a      24th Council of UN-Habitat early in 2013, which passed a resolution on\u000a      strengthening basic urban services [7]. Work with UN-Habitat continues\u000a      with a SUDS workshop in Kigali, Rwanda in May 2013 and the commissioning\u000a      of a drainage strategy for UN-Habitat [3].\u000a    The impact on practitioners and professional services are;\u000a    i) The SUDS design manual (CIRIA 2007) which was significantly informed\u000a      by our research is used by all practitioners in the field both in UK and\u000a      internationally (more than 40,000 downloads since publication in 2007).\u000a      [4, 5]\u000a    ii) SUDS for Roads &#8212; This design manual is targeted at road planners and\u000a      designers. [8]\u000a    iii) A community interested in bridging the gap between research and\u000a      practice (SUDSnet) was created as a vehicle to disseminate the research of\u000a      the group. This practitioner\/ stakeholder network is still very healthy 6\u000a      years after the EPSRC grant (GR\/S76816\/01) finished.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research and knowledge exchange led by Prof. Jefferies in sustainable\u000a      urban drainage systems (SUDS) has driven the design and integration of\u000a      SUDS into urban environments, into urban planning and everyday practice in\u000a      the UK, Europe and worldwide.

Underpinning research assisted in\u000a      determining the principles by which SUDS could be successfully implemented\u000a      in the UK by evaluating hydrological, environmental chemistry, cost and\u000a      socio-economic parameters of a number of prototype SUDS (an unproven\u000a      technology) in a step- by-step programme (McKissock et al., 1999). This\u000a      research was undertaken at Abertay where the team led by Prof. Jefferies\u000a      coordinated groups at a number of other UK universities. More recently\u000a      this researcher also extended to the Mediterranean region (Casal-Campos et\u000a      al., 2012).\u000a    Initial research focused on information gained from on-site performance\u000a      monitoring of a range of SUDS types &#8212; filter drains and infiltration\u000a      trench systems, permeable paving systems, swales, basins and ponds\u000a      (McKissock et al., 1999). Performance results were evaluated, using\u000a      bespoke scoring systems, giving indications of the varied behaviour of\u000a      systems in Scotland which was the only region of the UK where SUDS were\u000a      being built at the time. Hydraulic monitoring enabled comparisons of\u000a      performance in attenuating flow rates. The key hydraulic parameters\u000a      examined included percentage runoff, initial runoff loss, peak flow\u000a      reduction and lag time. In the case of in- ground systems, it was found\u000a      that existing hydraulic models were not adequate and an improved model was\u000a      developed based on the finite-volume-method and Darcy's law (Schl&#252;ter et\u000a      al., 2002). This model, which uses the acronym FVD was validated using\u000a      site data and was incorporated into the industry-standard software,\u000a      Infoworks Version 6.5.\u000a    It was found that the systems studied also performed well in removing\u000a      certain pollutants from urban runoff and in attenuating peak\u000a      concentrations of others (Napier et al., 2009). Pond water quality data\u000a      were interpreted by means of a water quality index which was modified from\u000a      an existing index for Scottish watercourses and is parameter weighted.\u000a      Later work showed that pollutants from motor vehicles presented serious\u000a      risks (Napier et al., 2008). The mass of lead, copper, zinc and polycyclic\u000a      aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) being released by automobiles in the UK was\u000a      estimated and showed that as other pollution sources are reducing,\u000a      automobiles have become a major source of environmental pollution with\u000a      copper, zinc and PAHs all trending upwards. A lab and field study used\u000a      twelve lysimeters, a laboratory based degradation study and field studies\u000a      on motorway SUDS installations to study the risks to groundwater from\u000a      passing highway drainage on to soil based SUDS. The vast majority of heavy\u000a      metals, PAHs and petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) were found to be retained in\u000a      the top 10 cm of soil, thereby impacting on soil function with time and\u000a      with potential implications for long term maintenance (Napier et al.,\u000a      2009).\u000a    Parallel but equally significant strands of the overall research\u000a      programme examined cost and social\/perception issues. Costs were addressed\u000a      by examining and reviewing specific sites in the UK and a much larger set\u000a      from the USA (Duffy et al., 2008). The perception of open-access\u000a      stormwater systems within residential areas, and in particular ponds, and\u000a      river management schemes was examined through survey techniques. Amenity,\u000a      recreational value and aesthetics of new schemes were found to be of major\u000a      importance for public acceptability, while function, efficiency, and\u000a      maintenance are primarily important in areas facing flooding problems.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44609","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This case study research and knowledge exchange undertaken by the Unit\u000d\u000a      has had a significant impact on local government organisations and the\u000d\u000a      public in terms of:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      effecting changes to public policy and services\u000d\u000a      raising the awareness and understanding of key stakeholders\u000d\u000a      impacting on environmental policy debate\u000d\u000a      changing to the way key information is presented to stakeholders\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Changes to public policy\u000d\u000a    A set of sustainability indicators were developed and are now published\u000d\u000a      and used by the Dundee City Council to ensure overall sustainability of\u000d\u000a      the Dundee Waterfront Development, the 3rd most active\u000d\u000a      regeneration project in the UK.

Our work\u000d\u000a      has culminated in the production of an integrated interactive\u000d\u000a      visualisation framework and toolset, enabling effective incorporation of\u000d\u000a      sustainable development principles, into the design of major\u000d\u000a      infrastructure projects.\u000d\u000a    The initial underpinning research by Blackwood and Gilmour (Ashley et\u000d\u000a      al., 2005 &amp; 2008) was initiated in response to the requirement for the\u000d\u000a      water sector to incorporate sustainability assessment within the decision\u000d\u000a      making process. The research formed part of three EPSRC Consortia projects\u000d\u000a      (Projects 1 to 3 as listed in section 3). Their research showed that, even\u000d\u000a      for an apparently straightforward either\/or question, the assessment of\u000d\u000a      relative sustainability is complex. Assessment requires a combined and\u000d\u000a      weighted evaluation of various social, economic, environmental, and\u000d\u000a      technical aspects resulting from the implementation and adoption of\u000d\u000a      alternative infrastructure developments, as well as an assessment of\u000d\u000a      public responsiveness to any encouragement to change practice and use.\u000d\u000a      Therefore, for the first time in the water sector, we developed a\u000d\u000a      framework tool (SWARD Tool) and applied SWARD to evaluate real case\u000d\u000a      studies involving practitioner decision making. We addressed concepts of\u000d\u000a      sustainability assessment and showed how multi-criteria decision support\u000d\u000a      systems can enhance the assessment of relative sustainability of a range\u000d\u000a      of options; thereby aiding decisions being made about investment.\u000d\u000a    The transferable insights from this research include:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000aHow decisions are made: We developed techniques that enable for\u000d\u000a        the first time an understanding of decision making related to\u000d\u000a        sustainable urban development (project 2);\u000d\u000a      \u000aHow stakeholders can be engaged: We developed methods for\u000d\u000a        engagement of key stakeholders, including the public, in decision-making\u000d\u000a        processes (projects 1, 2, and 3);\u000d\u000a      \u000aHow the efficacy of sustainable development can be analysed: We\u000d\u000a        demonstrated the benefit of decision support tools such as cost benefit\u000d\u000a        analysis and multi-criteria decision analysis for sustainability\u000d\u000a        decision making (project 1 and 2).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Our research was further developed and impacted upon the sustainable\u000d\u000a      development of Dundee Waterfront (Gilmour et al., 2011). With an\u000d\u000a      investment of &#163;1 bln, this is the 16th largest regeneration project in the\u000d\u000a      UK (2013), and is the 3rd most active project (2013). Its development\u000d\u000a      includes the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum at Dundee which will be an\u000d\u000a      international centre of design for Scotland and will host major\u000d\u000a      exhibitions helping people understand their cultural heritage. Using the\u000d\u000a      methods above, our research combined a series of criteria for sustainable\u000d\u000a      development (including energy efficiency of buildings, traffic noise,\u000d\u000a      economic benefit of different building functions, social acceptance of\u000d\u000a      building use and housing provision, and employment opportunities), and\u000d\u000a      considered how these criteria dynamically change with time (Gilmour et\u000d\u000a      al., 2011).\u000d\u000a    Through reviewing this work in discussions with stakeholders, we\u000d\u000a      identified the need for an effective communication tool, permitting\u000d\u000a      communication and interrogation of complex model outcomes to support\u000d\u000a      informed decision making in the face of multiple interacting factors\u000d\u000a      changing over time. Drawing upon the University's inter-disciplinary\u000d\u000a      approach to research and knowledge exchange, and making use of Abertay's\u000d\u000a      expertise in computer games technology, computing and engineering\u000d\u000a      (Falconer and Isaacs), a new inter-disciplinary research grouping was\u000d\u000a      established to address this need. This grouping initiated innovative\u000d\u000a      research that combined Blackwood and Gilmour's sustainability research\u000d\u000a      with parallel developments in interactive gaming technologies to create a\u000d\u000a      3D interactive visualisation platform. This Sustainability Assessment\u000d\u000a      Visualisation and Enhancement (SAVE) platform:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      allows the social, economic and environmental factors to be\u000d\u000a        visualised;\u000d\u000a      informs and thus supports decision-making processes;\u000d\u000a      provides a means of measurement, assessment or valuation of these\u000d\u000a        factors; and\u000d\u000a      offers analytical methods for the comparative assessment of these\u000d\u000a        complex data.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The SAVE framework transforms static 2D planning into a 3D interactive\u000d\u000a      and dynamic computer visualisation underpinned by sustainability modelling\u000d\u000a      to support stakeholders in their decisions to select sustainability\u000d\u000a      indicators (Isaacs et al., 2013). Visualisation overlay techniques were\u000d\u000a      developed to determine the most effective way to display and communicate\u000d\u000a      multiple sustainability criteria predicted by the sustainability models.\u000d\u000a      The development of this framework was underpinned by funding from a range\u000d\u000a      of sources and projects listed in section 3 (4-11).\u000d\u000a    "}]

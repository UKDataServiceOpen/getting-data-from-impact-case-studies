Since then Davies has continued to contribute to the Ofcom\u000d\u000a      research department with a real impact on how its policy nationally has\u000d\u000a      developed. As Alison Preston, Head of Media Literacy Research at Ofcom,\u000d\u000a      has said: `Both your academic literature review and also your previous\u000d\u000a      research ... were used in our thinking and analysis ... and consequent\u000d\u000a      policy recommendations. One of the related outcomes of this Review was\u000d\u000a      that the BBC ring-fenced its children's programming budget.'\u000d\u000a    (b) Helping to win a local TV licence: CMR and Voice of the Listener\u000d\u000a        and Viewer (VLV) As a Board member of the broadcasting consumer\u000d\u000a      group VLV until 2011, Davies organised and spoke at a number of VLV public\u000d\u000a      events, and in November 2011 she organised a joint seminar with Ofcom, VLV\u000d\u000a      and the University of Ulster's CMR in Belfast on the question of local\u000d\u000a      television franchises in the UK. This event was attended by programme\u000d\u000a      makers, policy makers and educators and resulted in the awarding of a\u000d\u000a      contract to a Northern Ireland production company. The importance of the\u000d\u000a      CMR research to this decision was confirmed by NI Ofcom Director, Jonathan\u000d\u000a      Rose in an email, dated 10th October 2012.\u000d\u000a    (c) Training, Briefing and Promoting the work of Children's TV\u000d\u000a        Producers\u000d\u000a    (i) IZI Munich:\u000d\u000a    The International study of Children's Humour, reported in RAE2008, was\u000d\u000a      conducted by the International Central Institute for Youth and Educational\u000d\u000a      Television (IZI), Munich in association with among others, the University\u000d\u000a      of Ulster's CMR.

M&#225;ire\u000d\u000a      Messenger-Davies has always tried to redress the balance by studying\u000d\u000a      empirically both audiences and producers, and as a result, has produced\u000d\u000a      data that has proved useful to both programme producers and broadcasting\u000d\u000a      policy makers.\u000d\u000a    Since the 1980s, she has been at the forefront of research into\u000d\u000a      children's and young people's programming and has especially pioneered\u000d\u000a      research into children's responses to programmes which have then fed back\u000d\u000a      into the programme makers themselves. Since Television is Good for\u000d\u000a        Your Kids (1989, 2001) was published (and helped to modify the 1990\u000d\u000a      Broadcasting Act to include Children's programming as a protected branch\u000d\u000a      of programming by British PSBs) this ongoing research into children's and\u000d\u000a      young people's relationship with the media has also been regularly adopted\u000d\u000a      by a variety of public bodies to inform debate and decision-making.\u000d\u000a    In 1997, Messenger-Davies was commissioned by the Broadcasting Standards\u000d\u000a      Commission (whose functions were taken over by Ofcom after the 2003\u000d\u000a      Broadcasting Act) to conduct a survey of children's TV provision in the\u000d\u000a      UK. This initiated a widespread public debate and provided a baseline for\u000d\u000a      children's provision that was built upon by the new regulator, Ofcom.\u000d\u000a      Ofcom has since produced regular data about children's media provision\u000d\u000a      from this baseline. In 2004, the year she was appointed to run the\u000d\u000a      University of Ulster's Centre for Media Research (CMR) Messenger-Davies\u000d\u000a      was commissioned by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) to\u000d\u000a      review the BBC digital channels and was instrumental in supporting the\u000d\u000a      continuing existence of the BBC's popular children's channels in the face\u000d\u000a      of arguments by commercial providers that they `unfairly' distorted the\u000d\u000a      market.\u000d\u000a    Industry-related audience studies include the BBC-funded project on\u000d\u000a      children and TV drama reported in Dear BBC (2001) and in 2007 the\u000d\u000a      AHRC\/BBC funded KEP project `What do children want from the BBC?' This\u000d\u000a      research was fed back to the producers of BBC's Newsround and was\u000d\u000a      utilised in their redesign of the Newsround website.\u000d\u000a    Over the last ten years, Davies has regularly been called upon for media\u000d\u000a      interviews in TV, radio and the press. The CMR's support of this work has\u000d\u000a      facilitated outreach to industry bodies; travel to industry events, such\u000d\u000a      as the World Summit on Children and Media in Johannesburg in 2006, and the\u000d\u000a      Prix Jeunesse in Munich, 2005, where Davies' funded work on children and\u000d\u000a      TV humour, as part of a team of international scholars brought together by\u000d\u000a      IZI, in Munich, was presented to an international industry audience.

It has been screened at Belfast Exposed Gallery, Feile an Phobail, Belfast\u000d\u000aand Armagh Local History Library. At Belfast Exposed, the screening was accompanied by four\u000d\u000aworkshops:\u000d\u000a1) A `50 Plus' group from West Belfast; 2) A16-18 years old group from Southern Regional College;\u000d\u000a3) A workshop with participants in the film; 4) A workshop with practitioners in oral history.\u000d\u000a78 people attended the Armagh public screening, which was followed by a full discussion with an\u000d\u000aaudience that ranged from 16 year olds to pensioners (evaluation forms available). The evaluations\u000d\u000aconfirm that the film and the methodology that it proposes, has had a positive impact on people's\u000d\u000aperception of the `other side' and has facilitated inter-communal dialogue and post conflict\u000d\u000areconciliation.\u000d\u000a3. Social Inclusion and Reconciliation (ii)\u000d\u000aUnheard Voices: Stories from the Troubles (2009) was produced with WAVE Trauma\u000d\u000aCentre in Ballymoney and screened at 7 public venues organised by the Good Relations\u000d\u000aDepartments of Ballymena, Coleraine, Moyle, Derry, Lisburn, Newtownards, Belfast and\u000d\u000aNewtownabbey Borough Councils. Total audience figures are now over 500 and each screening\u000d\u000awas followed by a discussion. The film proposed a method of dealing with trauma and memory for\u000d\u000avictims of the troubles, or the families of victims, and has been adopted as a methodology in\u000d\u000adealing with post-conflict memory and offers a methodology for post-conflict work in many\u000d\u000ainternational contexts. Detailed feedback confirms that the film and its innovative approach to\u000d\u000atrauma and memory has had a deep impact on formerly isolated victims and has helped in the\u000d\u000aunderstanding of conflict resolution.\u000d\u000a4. Social Inclusion and Reconciliation (iii)\u000d\u000aThe CMR-supported film Inside Stories: Memories of the Maze and Long Kesh Prison (2005)\u000d\u000a(submitted to the 2008 RAE) is based on selections from the Prisons Memory Archive (PMA). It\u000d\u000ahas had a substantial national and international profile since then, being screened at the South\u000d\u000aBank Digital Gallery (2008), Constitution Hill, Johannesburg (2008), Naughton Gallery, Belfast\u000d\u000a(2009), Belfast Prison (as part of Respect Week 2009).

The film proposes a methodology of dealing with memory and conflict\u000d\u000adeveloped in the University of Ulster and has had an impact specifically in other former conflict\u000d\u000acultures, especially South Africa where a similar process of post-conflict reconciliation has been\u000d\u000aproceeding in parallel with that in Northern Ireland.\u000d\u000a5. Social Inclusion and Reconciliation (iv)\u000d\u000aGreg McLaughlin and Steve Baker's book The Propaganda of Peace has also had an impact on\u000d\u000aNorthern Ireland's post-conflict culture as well as providing a test case for peace-building in\u000d\u000ageneral.

Much of this\u000d\u000aresearch was innovative and challenging and helped to raise awareness, among the general public\u000d\u000aas well as with media professionals, of the pressures and difficulties involved in covering a civil\u000d\u000aconflict. The unit's research concerned itself with fictional material (McLoone 1991, 1996, 2000,\u000d\u000a2008, 2010; Hill and McLoone, 1994, 1996), photography (Edge, 2000, Baylis and Edge, 2007)\u000d\u000alocal, national and international journalism (Gregory McLaughlin, 2002, 2004, 2006) and\u000d\u000adocumentary representations (C. McLaughlin 2010, G. McLaughlin and Baker, 2010). Most of its\u000d\u000aconcerns were with mainstream film and television but it was a characteristic of a number of\u000d\u000apublications emanating from the unit that they involved a continuing dialogue with media\u000d\u000aprofessionals themselves and the 1994 and 1996 publications were supported by the BBC, UTV\u000d\u000aand RT&#201; and had contributions from broadcasters across the independent sector.\u000d\u000aCentral to the debate was the question of national or cultural identity and related issues to do with\u000d\u000atolerance, diversity and equality of esteem. In particular, this research was concerned with how\u000d\u000adifferent groups were represented in the media (the nationalist and unionist communities in\u000d\u000ageneral, republican and loyalist paramilitaries in particular) and with identifying groups who went\u000d\u000alargely unrepresented as a result of security issues, policy decisions or professional practices\u000d\u000a(paramilitary activists, prisoners and ex-prisoners, victims of violence and their families, police\u000d\u000aofficers, prison officers and women in general). This research became increasingly more\u000d\u000aconcerned with other media practices &#8212; community video, independent production, on-line\u000d\u000acommunication as well as video installation and photographic representation. A growing concern\u000d\u000awas the need to develop other media outlets to achieve a more plural and inclusive representation\u000d\u000aand especially to access voices, opinions and stories that had been left unrepresented by\u000d\u000amainstream media sources (all of which were identified in the underpinning research).\u000d\u000aIn the last decade, Northern Ireland has moved from a society in conflict to a post-conflict society\u000d\u000aand the unit has continued to research the ways in which the media operate in and on this post-conflict culture. This case study demonstrates how the Unit's long experience with studying the\u000d\u000amedia in a period of conflict, prepared it well to research and make an impact in and on this post-conflict culture. Central here has been the research of McLoone (2010); Greg McLaughlin and\u000d\u000aBaker (2010). Of particular importance was Cahal McLaughlin's development of the Prisons\u000d\u000aMemory Archive (PMA), which was developed in the CMR during the period 2005-12 (with the\u000d\u000aassistance since 2008 of PhD researcher Jolene Mairs Dyer, now an ECR in the CMR).\u000d\u000aDuring the `Troubles' in Northern Ireland, prisons operated as both touchstone and tinderbox for\u000d\u000athe political climate outside their walls but for a whole variety of reasons, the stories of those most\u000d\u000adeeply involved could not be accessed or reported in the eye of the storm itself. The PMA is a\u000d\u000afilmed record of the memories of 175 ex-users of Northern Ireland's prisons &#8212; including prison staff,\u000d\u000aprisoners, teachers, visitors, maintenance workers and welfare officers. These are filmed in 'walk\u000d\u000aand talk' interviews inside the sites of Armagh Goal and the Maze and Long Kesh Prison, providing\u000d\u000aa unique record of these unheard voices and unseen stories. Jolene Mairs Dyer adopted and\u000d\u000aadapted the methodology to look at victims of violence giving them access to tell their own stories.\u000d\u000aThe key criteria of ethical co-ownership and location-as-stimulus help provide this archive with its\u000d\u000auniqueness.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"1423","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The Process\u000d\u000a    After the publication of his first article on Ealing's Saraband for\u000d\u000a        Dead Lovers (Johnston 2010),\u000d\u000a      Johnston contacted Studio Canal UK (then operating under the name Optimum\u000d\u000a      Releasing) to\u000d\u000a      discuss the release strategy for its Ealing Studios Collection range.\u000d\u000a      Liaising with Candy Vincent-\u000d\u000a      Smith (then Optimum's Head of Catalogue Development, DVD), it became clear\u000d\u000a      that Optimum\u000d\u000a      would welcome research-led support around catalogue development.

This\u000d\u000a      research cluster demonstrates the pivotal nature of audio-visual texts in\u000d\u000a      shaping concepts of attachment to place and social and cultural identity\u000d\u000a      from the national through to the local - with the latter providing the\u000d\u000a      unit's primary focus. Here, research has played an important role in\u000d\u000a      informing strategic practice at the regional East Anglian Film Archive\u000d\u000a      (EAFA), a repository of 12,000 hours of film and 30,000 hours of videotape\u000d\u000a      material either filmed in or relating to the East Anglia region (including\u000d\u000a      a significant proportion of material produced by regional commercial\u000d\u000a      broadcaster Anglia Television).\u000d\u000a    Development of the unit's research focus around geography and media\u000d\u000a      consumption was led by Jancovich and Mills. Arising out of The Place\u000d\u000a        of the Audience: Cultural Geographies of Film Consumption (BFI\u000d\u000a      2003), Jancovich has continued to publish on local media audiences,\u000d\u000a      cultural geography, and media consumption practices (Jancovich 2007,\u000d\u000a      2011). Mills' work on representations of different regional\/national\u000d\u000a      identities in British situation comedy (particularly `Welshness': Mills\u000d\u000a      2008) and the link between filmed location and place (Mills 2009) helped\u000d\u000a      define the unit's interests towards television's role in creating regional\u000d\u000a      and national identity.\u000d\u000a    Collectively, this work by Higson, Jancovich and Mills demonstrates how\u000d\u000a      important the visual representation of place and people can be in\u000d\u000a      mediating and sustaining local identities. That focus on geography and\u000d\u000a      local media, and the unit's continued relationship with EAFA, underpinned\u000d\u000a      a successful application for a large AHRC Resources Enhancement Grant\u000d\u000a      (2006-08, value &#163;412,910), which significantly enhanced access to EAFA\u000d\u000a      archive material through extensive preservation, digitisation, cataloguing\u000d\u000a      and public engagement activities. This development of EAFA as a research\u000d\u000a      and public resource, informed by unit research, is a key pathway to\u000d\u000a      impact.\u000d\u000a    The combination of EAFA materials made accessible by this grant\u000d\u000a      (particularly the Anglia Television collection) has given new emphasis to\u000d\u000a      unit's research on the role that archival materials and organisations play\u000d\u000a      in affirming and re-performing identities from the local through to the\u000d\u000a      national and beyond. Given the stress that local councils and public\u000d\u000a      service organisations place on maintaining local identity (particularly in\u000d\u000a      rural communities), the unit continues to develop this research strand\u000d\u000a      through new foci on community cinema (Rimmer, Aveyard) and local cinema\u000d\u000a      exhibition (Snelson), projects that intersect with the archival resources\u000d\u000a      of EAFA and other community partners, such as Village Screen and Norfolk\u000d\u000a      at the Pictures.\u000d\u000a    KEY RESEARCHERS, POSITIONS, DATES\u000d\u000a    The research was undertaken by:\u000d\u000a    Professor Andrew Higson (Senior Lecturer, UEA, 1995-2009)\u000d\u000a    Professor Mark Jancovich (Senior Lecturer, UEA, 2004-present)\u000d\u000a    Dr Brett Mills (Lecturer, UEA, 2005-10; Senior Lecturer, UEA,\u000d\u000a      2010-present)\u000d\u000a    Dr Tim Snelson (Lecturer, UEA, 2007-present)\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"1926","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Policy and Planning\u000d\u000a    1.

Central to his submission was the argument that\u000d\u000a      a successful strategy should be based on intellectual property targets,\u000d\u000a      rather than simply job targets. This was accepted in the InvestNI report,\u000d\u000a      Digital Contents Strategy for Northern Ireland subsequently\u000d\u000a      published in 2008. The impact of the submission can be seen in that the\u000d\u000a      first draft of this report was still based on job creation targets but the\u000d\u000a      final report was amended in line with Murphy's suggestion.\u000d\u000a    2.

The result of this\u000d\u000a      tradition of cutting-edge research is that the unit has been able to\u000d\u000a      impact on digital media policy in a significant way.\u000d\u000a    Digital Apps and Gaming\u000d\u000a      The application of digital technologies to new cultural aims has again\u000d\u000a      been a long interest of the unit's researchers and especially in their\u000d\u000a      potential as games for educational and cultural purposes (see Fleming,\u000d\u000a      Dan, 1996, Powerplay: Toys as Popular Culture). More recently, Helen\u000d\u000a        Jackson developed two pieces of artwork which explored the creative\u000d\u000a      possibilities of digital technologies and which provided the model for\u000d\u000a      developing locative media apps in this research round. God's Script\u000d\u000a      (2005) was a multi-linear narrative and hypertext adaptation of a Borges\u000d\u000a      essay and Isolation (2004) was an interactive, multimedia digital\u000d\u000a      art installation designed to generate an immersive experience for the\u000d\u000a      viewer (both submitted to the RAE 2008).

Our\u000d\u000a      research helped provide those MEPS who wanted reform in the media\u000d\u000a      relations service of the Parliament with the information and analysis\u000d\u000a      necessary to propose a set of priorities for change that was both\u000d\u000a      essential and which would help change the attitudes of those many MEPS who\u000d\u000a      were indifferent to, or blocking reform. That is an absolutely crucial\u000d\u000a      type of impact that is often missed by those unfamiliar with the mechanics\u000d\u000a      of politics &#8212; without the necessary information and analysis to\u000d\u000a      establish priorities that will help create viable reform proposals and\u000d\u000a      change attitudes, nothing can happen. Our most significant impact\u000d\u000a      was in playing a key role in providing these crucial change-enablers. The\u000d\u000a      evidence for that is provided by the one person with the long-term\u000d\u000a      detailed knowledge and overview of how the Parliament's media relations\u000d\u000a      work that is necessary to confirm our impact on the reform process. She is\u000d\u000a      Doris Gisela Pack, the German chair of the Parliament's committee that\u000d\u000a      investigates and oversees its media relations. In written evidence she has\u000d\u000a      said the following about our research, \"The continuing impact of their\u000d\u000a        work can be seen down to the present day, in, for example, the high\u000d\u000a        priority that is now being given to the Parliament's audio visual\u000d\u000a        service. Detailed interviews had been conducted throughout the then\u000d\u000a        DGIII for their 2004 article and had highlighted particularly the\u000d\u000a        failure to fund properly, staff adequately and use widely enough the\u000d\u000a        highly skilled audio visual unit within the press and information\u000d\u000a        service. That situation has been radically transformed since the\u000d\u000a        publication of their study and its provision of MPs and officials with\u000d\u000a        analysis that was helpful in identifying priorities for improvement. The\u000d\u000a        impact of their work can still be seen in the continuing acceptance of\u000d\u000a        the need to keep the audio visual service as a properly resourced and\u000d\u000a        appropriately used part of the Parliament's means of presenting itself\u000d\u000a        to the news media and the citizenry in general.\" She has confirmed also\u000d\u000a        the continuing impact of our work on the Parliament's website and said\u000d\u000a        that, in general, the information provided by our research was\u000d\u000a        \"important in helping identify the priorities for reform.\" It is\u000d\u000a      from 2004-2005 onwards that significant reforms in the Parliament's press\u000d\u000a      and information services finally started to occur. It is notable how many\u000d\u000a      of those reforms, which are continuing down to the present, correspond\u000d\u000a        directly with needs identified within the detailed findings presented in\u000d\u000a        our 2003 paper and our 2004 article (see section 2 above. As key EU\u000d\u000a      players such as Doris Pack can confirm, the European Union is very much a\u000d\u000a      proverbial supertanker that takes some time to change direction after it\u000d\u000a      has been decided that change is required and that is one of the reasons\u000d\u000a      why the impact of our research continues to be felt significantly down to\u000d\u000a      the present. To give just two from several examples, our findings on the\u000d\u000a      audio-visual unit's service, for example, have been followed by a\u000d\u000a      significant and still continuing upscaling of its resources and staffing\u000d\u000a      and a considerable raising of its profile, to the extent that it is now\u000d\u000a      advertised as one of the jewels in its crown by the press and information\u000d\u000a      service website. Our criticism of the fact that too many people working\u000d\u000a      for the press and information service lacked media training also has been\u000d\u000a      addressed post-2008, as can be evidenced from the webpages of Pinnacle (www.pinnaclepr.net\/), the\u000d\u000a      communications and public relations company that provided subsequent\u000d\u000a      training for the EU.\u000d\u000a    The `significance' of the impact of our work is that without it,\u000d\u000a      some of the key reforms that have modernized and made more effective the\u000d\u000a      Parliament's press and information offering would have struggled for both\u000d\u000a      priority and an adequate information base. That is evidenced by\u000d\u000a      the Parliament's media committee chair in her confirmation above of the importance\u000d\u000a      of our work in this regard. That in turn would seem to be the most\u000d\u000a        effective measure of our work's significance, given her unique role in\u000d\u000a        having a long-term, authoritative overview of the impact of our research\u000d\u000a        within the relevant reform process. She has further confirmed the\u000d\u000a      work's importance by stating that, `The size and nature of the\u000d\u000a        European Parliament's electorate means that the reach'\u000d\u000a      of Anderson et al.'s work has been, by definition, on a European scale\u000d\u000a        as far as its impact on press and information policy is concerned.'\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case study shows how high quality research into the key problems in\u000d\u000a      communicating the European Union and its ideas and policies, together\u000d\u000a        with the interactions of the researchers involved with politicians,\u000d\u000a      media personnel and officials, had a significant impact on how the EU\u000d\u000a      communicates with its citizens.

These both focus on the\u000a      three-dimensional (3D) structures of molecules and are computationally\u000a      demanding, especially when molecules are conformationally flexible,\u000a      i.e., can adopt a range of 3D shapes when they interact with a biological\u000a      macromolecular target, typically a specific protein in the body.\u000a    Ligand docking (the focus of GOLD) involves identifying those molecules\u000a      in a database that fit a target, in much the same way as a key fits into a\u000a      lock, since those with a good fit may be biologically active.\u000a      Pharmacophore mapping (the focus of GASP and GALAHAD) involves identifying\u000a      the structural features common to molecules that have already been shown\u000a      to be biologically active.\u000a    Sheffield research\u000a    Docking and pharmacophore mapping with flexible molecules are examples of\u000a      combinatorial optimization problems for which efficient, conventional\u000a      algorithms are not available. However, they are very well suited to\u000a      genetic algorithm (GA) techniques, the use of which in chemoinformatics\u000a      was pioneered in Sheffield work in the early Nineties and which form the\u000a      basis of GOLD, GASP and GALAHAD.\u000a    The GA in the Sheffield GOLD program identifies the best possible fit of\u000a      a flexible molecule into a target protein. This was an entirely novel\u000a      approach when the prototype program was first described in 1995 [R1],\u000a      following a collaboration with Wellcome (now GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK) by\u000a      Willett (Professor of Information Science since 1991). Extensive\u000a      development and testing [R2] in an MRC\/DTI LINK project at Sheffield\u000a      (&#163;205K, 1995-97) resulted in a program that was rapidly adopted by\u000a      industry once it was distributed by the Cambridge Crystallographic Data\u000a      Centre (CCDC, the industrial partner in the LINK project).\u000a    The GA in the Sheffield GASP program is analogous to that in GOLD: the\u000a      latter tests the fit of a molecule to a protein while the former tests the\u000a      fit of a series of active molecules to each other [R3]. GASP was developed\u000a      during the GOLD project and was subsequently commercialized by a US\u000a      chemoinformatics company, Tripos Inc. (St Louis, MO) to complement an\u000a      existing product, which was based on Sheffield research in the late\u000a      Eighties and which was less well-suited than GASP to the handling of\u000a      flexible molecules. A subsequent funded collaboration between Willett and\u000a      Tripos (&#163;121K, 2002-04) led to a novel method for aligning the 3D\u000a      structures of pairs of molecules [R4] that lies at the heart of a further\u000a      pharmacophore program, GALAHAD [R5], that Tripos now distributes. GALAHAD\u000a      also makes use of a multiple objective GA, an approach to optimization\u000a      that was first applied to chemoinformatics in a collaboration with GSK\u000a      (&#163;129K, 1999- 2002) by Gillet (then Senior Lecturer and Professor of\u000a      Chemoinformatics since 2009) [R6]. This approach has since been\u000a      successfully demonstrated in a range of other chemoinformatics\u000a      applications.\u000a    The high quality of the research carried out by the Sheffield\u000a      chemoinformatics group (Gillet, Willett and Holliday (Senior Research\u000a      Manager since 1999)) is further evidenced by:\u000a    \u000a       Inspection of the core journal for chemoinformatics, the Journal\u000a          of Chemical Information Modeling, where many articles are\u000a        published by industrial, rather than academic, researchers and where the\u000a        Sheffield group has provided more contributions than any other\u000a        organization over the journal's 53-year lifetime.\u000a       The Sheffield group being the recipients of 2012 Jason Farradane\u000a        Award of the UK Electronic Information Group \"in recognition of\u000a        outstanding work in the information profession\", the commendation\u000a        highlighting the \"joint research projects with many of the world's\u000a        leading pharmaceutical, agrochemical and software companies\".\u000a       Willett being the only person to have been the recipient of all three\u000a        of the American Chemical Society's awards for contributions to\u000a        chemoinformatics and the pharmaceutical industry: the 1993 Herman\u000a        Skolnik Award, the 2005 Award for Computers in Chemical and\u000a        Pharmaceutical Research, and the 2010 Patterson-Crane Award.\u000a    \u000a    The group's publications since 1993 have attracted over ten-thousand\u000a      citations in the Web of Science (WoS), with many of these\u000a      reflecting the impact of the work on industrial research. Multi- national\u000a      pharmaceutical companies that have cited Sheffield research at least 20\u000a      times include Abbott, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, GSK,\u000a      Merck, Novartis, Pfizer and Roche. The work has also been extensively\u000a      cited by the world's major chemoinformatics software and database\u000a      companies, with such companies citing Sheffield work at least 5 times\u000a      including Accelrys, BCI, CCDC, CCG, CEREP, De Novo, Leadscope, Molecular\u000a      Networks, OpenEeye, Schroedinger and Tripos.

Impact was explicit within the funding scheme\u000d\u000a      (EUFP7 Research for\u000d\u000a      the Benefit of SMEs) which required that the participating SMEs co-own the\u000d\u000a      IP and drive the\u000d\u000a      development and commercial exploitation of the project.

This led to\u000d\u000a      a body of research\u000d\u000a      focused on defining and validating theoretical models of information\u000d\u000a      behaviour which has resulted\u000d\u000a      in greater understanding of the range of interacting dimensions that\u000d\u000a      influence information practices\u000d\u000a      and behaviour [R1]. Building on Wilson's work, user-oriented approaches to\u000d\u000a      the development of\u000d\u000a      information-rich systems have been adopted in two more recent strands of\u000d\u000a      research at Sheffield: i)\u000d\u000a      the development and evaluation of information retrieval systems and search\u000d\u000a      engines; and ii) the\u000d\u000a      development and evaluation of enterprise knowledge systems.\u000d\u000a    Research by Dr Paul Clough, Dr Daniella Petrelli (Sheffield until 2011)\u000d\u000a      and Professor Mark\u000d\u000a      Sanderson (Sheffield until 2011) focused on the development of information\u000d\u000a      retrieval and access\u000d\u000a      systems for various tasks and domains. This included exploring new methods\u000d\u000a      for gathering users'\u000d\u000a      information needs and information about their online search tasks,\u000d\u000a      studying patterns of information\u000d\u000a      searching behaviours (e.g., through the analysis of transaction logs) and\u000d\u000a      developing approaches to\u000d\u000a      evaluate search systems (e.g., using controlled lab-based environments and\u000d\u000a      through\u000d\u000a      crowdsourcing). In the context of information retrieval systems\u000d\u000a      development, Clough and\u000d\u000a      Sanderson collaborated in the EU-funded project SPIRIT (grant n.\u000d\u000a      IST-2001-35047; total funding\u000d\u000a      &#8364;2.55M) in which user requirements and preferences were integral to the\u000d\u000a      design and\u000d\u000a      implementation of a spatially-aware search engine for location-based\u000d\u000a      search services, e.g., finding\u000d\u000a      local services when using mobile devices [R2]. In the context of\u000d\u000a      evaluation, Petrelli demonstrated\u000d\u000a      the value of user-centred evaluations as an essential method for designing\u000d\u000a      the user interface of a\u000d\u000a      cross-language information retrieval system [R3] in EU project Clarity\u000d\u000a      (grant n.

More recently, Clough and Sanderson investigated\u000d\u000a      the use of crowdsourcing\u000d\u000a      as a means of gathering relevance assessments for search results from\u000d\u000a      search services at the UK\u000d\u000a      National Archives [R4]. The basis of this research was to understand\u000d\u000a      current patterns of use for\u000d\u000a      existing information services and establish future processes for\u000d\u000a      evaluating search technology\u000d\u000a      developments.

This\u000d\u000a      framework has been\u000d\u000a      applied in the design and evaluation of a knowledge management framework\u000d\u000a      and system to\u000d\u000a      support knowledge intensive practices in SMEs [R6], through the EU-funded\u000d\u000a      project OrganiK\u000d\u000a      (www.organik-project.eu\/; grant n. 222225; total funding &#8364;1.1M).

Drawing on the findings of the\u000d\u000a      underpinning research, the conference raised awareness of a widespread\u000d\u000a      retreat of press and political freedom that has taken place in recent\u000d\u000a      years across many parts of post-Cold War Europe and Russia. The keynote\u000d\u000a      speaker was Jens Reich, former leader of New Forum pro-democracy movement\u000d\u000a      in East German.

It was attended by professionals including NGO\u000d\u000a      representatives, journalists and academics.\u000d\u000a    A Working Conference on the Safety and Protection of\u000d\u000a        Journalists: A Responsibility for the World was organised in London\u000d\u000a      in June 2011 by The Initiative on Impunity and the Rule of Law, a joint\u000d\u000a      initiative between CFOM and City University's Centre for Law Justice and\u000d\u000a      Journalism (CLJJ), with input from an Advisory Board drawn from a range of\u000d\u000a      key stakeholders [S1 and S2]. Fifty international participants\u000d\u000a      including representatives from UNESCO, Council of Europe, OSCE, Inter-\u000d\u000a      American Commission on Human Rights, UK Foreign Office, Swedish and\u000d\u000a      Norwegian National Commissions for UNESCO, leading NGOs, the International\u000d\u000a      Federation of Journalists and academics were brought together to discuss\u000d\u000a      and assess the effectiveness of existing legal, political and\u000d\u000a      institutional safeguards against violence directed at journalists because\u000d\u000a      of their professional work; and to present the case for more effective\u000d\u000a      international mechanisms to counter such crimes of violence and to end\u000d\u000a      impunity. UNESCO designated the Working Conference an official preparatory\u000d\u000a      meeting anticipating the 1st United Nations Inter-Agency Meeting on the\u000d\u000a      Safety of Journalists and the Issue of Impunity (and in Paris September\u000d\u000a      2011, CFOM presented further analysis and proposals for action). Attended\u000d\u000a      by UNESCO representatives, the event achieved an enhanced commitment by\u000d\u000a      state and non-state actors to legal and political mechanisms for improved\u000d\u000a      protection and ending impunity through actions subsequently taken forward\u000d\u000a      and included in the UN Action Plan. CFOM and the CLJJ produced and\u000d\u000a      presented two extensive research reports, a Political Aspects study (CFOM)\u000d\u000a      and a Legal Aspects Study (CLJJ via the School of Law). CFOM then\u000d\u000a      worked with IGOs and NGOs to influence the policies\/actions of national\u000d\u000a      governments in the lead up to the UN Action Plan\u000d\u000a    In 2010, when expert groups and stakeholders were asked to support the UN\u000d\u000a      Action Plan as a global priority, CFOM was already uniquely equipped to\u000d\u000a      respond by combining its academic research findings with first-hand\u000d\u000a      knowledge and practical advocacy skills. CFOM has provided materials and\u000d\u000a      advice for a range of beneficiaries such as standard-setting texts and\u000d\u000a      advice that has fed into programmes to combat violence against the news\u000d\u000a      media. CFOM, with other media freedom advocacy groups, successfully\u000d\u000a      proposed that the UK would table a proposal at the UNESCO International\u000d\u000a      Programme for Development of Communication Council (IPDC) for `an\u000d\u000a      action-oriented UN Inter-Agency meeting'. The impact of this was the\u000d\u000a      formulation of the 2012 UN Action Plan. In March 2012 CFOM provided advice\u000d\u000a      based on their research to the UK Foreign Office contributing to the UK's\u000d\u000a      readiness to resist moves by hostile states to curtail the UN Plan in\u000d\u000a      discussions in the UNESCO IPDC Council. Consequently the IPDC approved\u000d\u000a      UNESCO's strategy.\u000d\u000a    In order to influence media houses' engagement with the Action Plan, CFOM\u000d\u000a      and the BBC College of Journalism and Peter Horrocks, Head of Global News\u000d\u000a      [S3] co-hosted a Symposium on Media Responses to Matters of\u000d\u000a      Life and Death, at New Broadcasting House, London on 18 October 2012. The\u000d\u000a      meeting was specifically designed to bring together 60 leading news media\u000d\u000a      editors, frontline journalists, journalist associations and media freedom\u000d\u000a      NGOs from 15 countries. Funded by an Open Society award to CFOM, the\u000d\u000a      Symposium led to new commitment from news media houses to the UN Action\u000d\u000a      Plan process, including monitoring of the success of UNESCO's\u000d\u000a      Implementation Strategy. UNESCO's Director of Freedom of Expression and\u000d\u000a      Media Development, who attended and supported the Symposium, said that `with\u000a        the cooperation from the UN, the national authorities, civil society and\u000d\u000a        media professionals like you, including BBC and groups like CFOM, we can\u000d\u000a        make significant impact on improving the safety of journalists and\u000d\u000a        reversing the trend of impunity' [S4]. Harrison spoke about\u000d\u000a      the importance of the role of journalism education as a significant factor\u000d\u000a      in the protection of journalism and for the maintenance of standards in\u000d\u000a      journalism worldwide. A milestone was achieved when media houses endorsed\u000d\u000a      the 8-point London Statement, drawn up by CFOM, on journalists'\u000d\u000a      safety. The London Statement was signed by 46 editors and journalists\u000d\u000a      representing national and international media houses and focussed on the\u000d\u000a      need for media scrutiny of the behaviour of governments and judiciaries to\u000d\u000a      end impunity. The London Statement was presented to Janis Karklins, UNESCO\u000d\u000a      Assistant Director-General for Communication and Information at the UN 2nd\u000d\u000a      Inter-Agency Meeting in Vienna, 22-23 November 2012 [S5] and then\u000d\u000a      placed by UNESCO on its website [S6].\u000d\u000a    CFOM then had direct input in a number of ways into the drafting of\u000d\u000a      international legal and political texts on journalists' safety which\u000d\u000a      resulted in the inclusion of new policy actions in policy documents:\u000d\u000a    i. UNESCO Draft Plan of Action on Safety of Journalists. In 2011 and\u000d\u000a      2012, CFOM identified recommendations which were included in the final\u000d\u000a      text.\u000d\u000a    ii. UNESCO Implementation Strategy for the UN Plan of Action. In 2012 and\u000d\u000a      2013, CFOM utilised research to contribute substantially to multiple\u000d\u000a      drafts of the UNESCO Implementation Strategy Document with\u000d\u000a      recommendations, influencing decisions on Action Lines, priorities and\u000d\u000a      elements of the agreed text.\u000d\u000a    iii. CFOM was invited to present its recommendations for the\u000d\u000a      implementation of the Action Plan at the 2nd UN Inter-Agency Meeting on\u000d\u000a      Safety of Journalists (Vienna, November 2012). Its input was two-fold: a)\u000d\u000a      Monitoring of the UN Action Plan; b) Facilitating engagement with its\u000d\u000a      implementation by media houses and journalists' associations. The\u000d\u000a      involvement of media houses is a very significant development and has had\u000d\u000a      impact in developing the multi-stakeholder involvement in UN Action Plan\u000d\u000a      implementation.\u000d\u000a    iv. Following the 2nd UN Inter-Agency Meeting on Safety of\u000d\u000a      Journalists, Harrison and Horsley were invited to publish Censorship by\u000d\u000a      Bullet in British Journalism Review, which specifically drew\u000d\u000a      attention to the UN Action Plan and has had impact through the wide\u000d\u000a      dissemination among journalists, educators and the media industry (BJR\u000d\u000a      Vol. 24, No.1, March 2013).\u000d\u000a    v. In September 2012, CFOM provided advice on many occasions concerning\u000d\u000a      strategy and textual drafting of the UN Human Rights Council Resolution on\u000d\u000a      the Safety of Journalists, tabled by Austria and successfully adopted by\u000d\u000a      the Council.\u000d\u000a    vi. In January to March 2013, CFOM secured the inclusion of elements\u000d\u000a      including wording on `positive obligations' of States emphasising the\u000d\u000a      threats that can arise from misuse of law and regulatory intervention in\u000d\u000a      the Council of Europe Draft Resolution on the Safety of Journalists.\u000d\u000a    In addition, the CFOM website www.cfom.org.uk\u000d\u000a      is a significant information source and archive of legal texts and expert\u000d\u000a      analysis. It is specifically designed for use by IGOs, governments,\u000d\u000a      experts and media currently involved in the Action Plan, gets 600 unique\u000d\u000a      and returning visitors per month and was accessed in 20012\/13 by 967\u000d\u000a      unique visitors and 1,260 visitors in total.\u000d\u000a    B) Providing expert advice internationally to influence practice\u000d\u000a    Since November 2012 CFOM has been included as a provider of support for\u000d\u000a      the delivery of specific Lines of Action in the Implementation Strategy\u000d\u000a      for the UN Action Plan [S7] as well as several general actions\u000d\u000a      with other stakeholders.\u000d\u000a    CFOM is specifically mandated to: 1) provide assistance to fully\u000d\u000a      implement existing international norms and principles [2.1.1]; 2) to\u000d\u000a      identify and map the work of international organisations relevant to\u000d\u000a      journalistic safety and freedom of expression [3.1.1]; 3) cooperate with\u000d\u000a      the Regional Special Rapporteurs with their strategies and reports\u000d\u000a      [3.1.3]; 4) to incorporate a module on the safety of journalists and\u000d\u000a      impunity within the teaching curricula at postgraduate level [3.2.10]; 5)\u000d\u000a      to provide assistance to fully implement existing international norms and\u000d\u000a      principles, particularly within the framework of the international human\u000d\u000a      rights law, humanitarian law and criminal law [2.1.1]; 6) to liaise on\u000d\u000a      international events at which the issue of the safety of journalists could\u000d\u000a      be included [3.2.14]; 7) to develop partnerships with journalism schools\u000d\u000a      and other research centres to monitor and analyse relevant issues, and to\u000d\u000a      provide training where appropriate [3.3.7].\u000d\u000a    C) Incorporating issues of safety and impunity into journalism\u000d\u000a        training\u000d\u000a    CFOM has used its research into journalism education to assist UNESCO on\u000d\u000a      the development of a journalism education module presented at the World\u000d\u000a      Journalism Education Congress Brussels [S8]. CFOM is also\u000d\u000a      developing safety education in the curriculum for journalism students at\u000d\u000a      the University of Sheffield and is sharing findings and good practice with\u000d\u000a      other journalism educators. It is also mapping the worldwide provision of\u000d\u000a      safety in journalism curricula by journalism educators, something that is\u000d\u000a      currently unknown, but which needs to be established in order to evaluate\u000d\u000a      the role that education plays and should play in the implementation of the\u000d\u000a      UN Action Plan objectives. CFOM's research and action in the area of\u000d\u000a      safety in the curriculum, along with presentations at international events\u000d\u000a      and its continuing policy advice and advocacy activities meets its UN\u000d\u000a      Action Plan implementation obligations in B above.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The Centre for Freedom of the Media (CFOM) at the University of Sheffield\u000d\u000a      is among a core group of expert organisations helping to shape the work\u000d\u000a      programmes of UN agencies, the Council of Europe and other IGOs, to put in\u000d\u000a      place effective measures to safeguard free and independent media as well\u000d\u000a      as journalists' physical safety against violence and judicial harassment\u000d\u000a      and interference.

It applies its expertise to the development of public policies\u000d\u000a      and legal and political frameworks for safe environments for journalism\u000d\u000a      throughout the world. CFOM was established in 2008 by Professor Jackie\u000d\u000a      Harrison (University of Sheffield, since 1996) with William Horsley,\u000d\u000a      former BBC news correspondent and Media Freedom Representative of the\u000d\u000a      Association of European Journalists, and Jock Gallagher, former executive\u000d\u000a      director of the Association of British Editors and founder chair of the UK\u000d\u000a      Press Freedom Network. CFOM's work and rationale drew upon Harrison's\u000d\u000a      research into increasing political interference across Europe in the civil\u000d\u000a      freedoms of investigative public service news journalism and the use of\u000d\u000a      regulation and law to curb freedom of expression. Harrison's research at\u000d\u000a      CFOM brings together six related research themes:- [1] The justifications\u000d\u000a      and significance of freedom of expression, particularly freedom of speech\u000d\u000a      as a contested constitutional right or principle; the civil and democratic\u000d\u000a      role of journalism and the importance for the functioning of democratic\u000d\u000a      and pluralistic societies of balancing the protection of freedom of\u000d\u000a      expression rights with the need for news media standards and\u000d\u000a      accountability; and the threats that can arise from use or misuse of law\u000d\u000a      and regulatory intervention. [2] The positive and negative parts played by\u000d\u000a      European and member state broadcasting law and policy with regard to: a)\u000d\u000a      the use of neo-liberal economic policy across the single market and the\u000d\u000a      use of regulation and law to curb freedom of expression, b) the increasing\u000d\u000a      elevation of commercial over cultural criteria in European media policy\u000d\u000a      and, related to that, c) the ownership and control of media capital, the\u000d\u000a      public\/private use of media infrastructures and the restrictions on the\u000d\u000a      development of mature pluralist media landscapes. [3] The architecture and\u000d\u000a      civil power of the news with regard to the role and responsibility of news\u000d\u000a      media in civil society and democracy, and the imposition of constraints\u000d\u000a      (technological, regulatory, commercial and political) on investigative\u000d\u000a      news accuracy, truthfulness and freedom of expression. [4] The special\u000d\u000a      value attached to quality public service news media and norms of media\u000d\u000a      independence and responsible professional conduct, arguments for and\u000d\u000a      against public service broadcasting and communications and its `merit good\u000d\u000a      status,' the role of public service communication in civil society and the\u000d\u000a      restrictions placed (and proposed) on new forms and models of public\u000d\u000a      service communication. [5] The important role that the institutional news\u000d\u000a      media play in shaping a civil\/public sphere in terms of public sentiment,\u000d\u000a      public deliberation, democratic value and civic participation.

She is now working on an ESRC-funded initiative (with\u000a        the DIPEx charity and University of York and Oxford) to build a\u000a        multi-media internet resource for families and professional training\u000a        (launch in 2014) (http:\/\/bit.ly\/1a9F0rK).\u000a      \u000aPrompted reflection and change among health practitioners: The\u000a        research was presented, by invitation, to a wide range of practitioners\u000a        e.g. a `Masterclass' at the Institute of Medical Ethics [IME]\u000a        Annual Conference and talks to the Brighton and Sussex Medical School\u000a        and the Yale School of Medicine (as part of professional development\u000a        accredited courses). Presentations between 2010 (when the first research\u000a        began) and July 2013 (the REF impact cut-off) directly reached over 500\u000a        practitioners (e.g. GPs and intensive care, neurosurgery, rehabilitation\u000a        and palliative care specialists). Feedback surveys by event organisers\u000a        demonstrated impact on clinicians both professionally and personally.\u000a        Comments included: `Very thought provoking - interesting,\u000a          emotionally and intellectually challenging and I need\/want to go away\u000a          and reflect deeply on my view of the MCA [Mental Capacity Act] and its\u000a          application because I believe my opinion may have altered slightly'\u000a        and `Really brought the Mental Capacity Act and communication\u000a          between medics and families into the real world. Definitely going to\u000a          go home and make an advance decision' (BMA evaluation report about\u000a        JK's session at the IME conference). Practitioners were also influenced\u000a        by an exhibition developed as part of the research that involved family\u000a        members writing short messages and selecting images (chosen or\u000a        drawn\/photographed) to represent their experiences. The resulting\u000a        `Postcard' exhibition has been displayed at over two dozen venues and\u000a        events (e.g. requested twice for display at the BMA's London\u000a        headquarters). Feedback from event organisers, and comments in the guest\u000a        book (e.g. `haunting', `learned a lot', `unforgettable') suggest that\u000a        the exhibition ensured that the voice of families directly affected now\u000a        has a presence at key meetings where professionals debate relevant\u000a        issues.\u000a      \u000aEnriched public representation\/debate: In addition to working\u000a        with stakeholders as outlined above, JK has been consulted by\u000a        journalists\/documentary makers and engaged in debate with them. For\u000a        example, she co-authored a critical analysis of a Panorama programme\u000a        about the vegetative state that was published as an editorial in the\u000a        British Medical Journal (www.bmj.com\/content\/345\/bmj.e8045).\u000a        She has also been consulted by fiction writers (e.g. influencing the\u000a        representation of a coma ward in the detective novel `Rubberneck')\u000a        and served on the advisory board of a Wellcome Trust funded `Theatre\u000a          of Debate' play about neurotechnologies (which won a `Science Goes\u000a        to the Movies' award from the British Science Association). The research\u000a        led to the creation of a set of sonnets through a collaboration with a\u000a        poet to transform interview material into poetry (see www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HqA-vjB1OvQ\/).\u000a        It was also presented to a general public via a series of 6 community\u000a        events as part of a festival organised by JK - the evaluation of which\u000a        identified clear impact on attendees e.g. 93% indicated that attending\u000a        had impacted on their thoughts or feelings, and 79% reported they would\u000a        share the information gained in their professional or personal lives (http:\/\/bit.ly\/16ruO0K).

This is evidenced by requests\u000a      to translate executive summaries of the research for practitioners, the\u000a      use of the research to inform guidelines in the US (see `Factual\u000a      Statement' from source 5.7) and the Rockefeller Foundation's production of\u000a      a video-interview about part of the research under their `Innovative\u000a        Ideas with Global Impact' insignia\u000a      (youtube.com\/watch?v=kS1yZzrKSNg&amp;feature=youtu.be).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This research stimulated debate about the treatment of people in\u000a      vegetative and minimally conscious states, created new cultural\u000a      representations and informed interventions to enhance decision-making\u000a      processes.

Under the directorship of JK (Professor of\u000a      Communication Research in JOMEC, 2003 onwards) we have focused on\u000a      enriching public\/policy debate about ethics, cultural representation and\u000a      the social context of medicine\/science (see REF3a). The case study\u000a      presented here highlights one such initiative, focussed on\u000a      vegetative\/minimally conscious states. Such states are a shifting\u000a      scientific, socio-political phenomenon, with a complex cultural history.\u000a      Increasing numbers of people are now surviving catastrophic brain injuries\u000a      - partly because of developments in medical technologies. The `vegetative'\u000a      state was identified in 1972, the `minimally conscious' state in 2002 (to\u000a      describe patients who display very minimal\/intermittent consciousness).\u000a      Treatment decisions about these patients involve difficult clinical,\u000a      ethical and risk judgments and are subject to intense media interest,\u000a      rapidly evolving legal\/policy rulings (e.g. recent court cases) and\u000a      scientific enquiry (e.g. fMRI brain scans of `vegetative' patients). A\u000a      portfolio of 4 initiatives was developed by JK involving:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aProject 1: a review of existing literature on\u000a        vegetative\/minimally conscious states mapping out issues and gaps from a\u000a        humanities\/social science perspective. This was circulated to key\u000a        practitioners in 2010 and underpinned a successful bid by JK to the\u000a        Wellcome Trust for a symposium with leading stakeholders (see Section 3,\u000a        publication 1).\u000a      \u000aProject 2: an analysis of media reporting and press\u000a        releases, focusing on the reporting of emerging brain technologies for\u000a        vegetative patients, combined with interviewing families with experience\u000a        of such technologies (2011-12) (see Section 3, publication 2).\u000a      \u000aProject 3: an in-depth interview\/focus group study in\u000a        three specialist neurological units - examining experiences of long-term\u000a        care provision (2011-12) (see Section 3, publication 3).\u000a      \u000aProject 4: an interview study with over 50 clinicians\u000a        and families - focusing on decision-making processes, from intensive\u000a        care to courts (2010-present) (see Section 3, publication 4).\u000a    \u000a    Researchers involved: Project 1: JK solely responsible.

Project\u000a        3: Collaboration between JK and Julie Latchem, clinician at a\u000a      neuro-specialist care home - both equally involved in all aspects of the\u000a      project (design, data collection, analysis and writing up). Project 4:\u000a      collaboration between JK and Celia Kitzinger, Sociology Professor,\u000a      University of York - both equally involved in all aspects of project\u000a      (design, data collection, analysis and writing up).\u000a    Findings: This portfolio of research gave a multi-dimensional view\u000a      of the profound challenges for service-users, care-providers and policy\u000a      makers and identified gaps and tensions in clinician-family communication,\u000a      media representation and the surrounding public, legal, professional and\u000a      policy debates. Key findings included:\u000a    \u000a      Media stereotypes of the vegetative patient e.g. such patients are\u000a        routinely shown on television as if asleep with their eyes closed, but\u000a        eye-opening is a defining feature of the condition, and patients may\u000a        move and make sounds - a mismatch which contributes to conflict between\u000a        popular\/family expectations and mainstream clinical diagnoses\/prognoses.\u000a      Lack of clarity in reporting new scientific developments such as fMRI\u000a        scans on `vegetative' brains (e.g. failing to distinguish the\u000a        `vegetative' from the `minimally conscious' state) and a lack of\u000a        cultural representation of profound impairments associated with recovery\u000a        from the vegetative state - which has implications for how families\u000a        imagine possible outcomes and impacts on clinician-family communication\u000a        and negotiation.\u000a      Lack of accessible and accurate information for families, and lack of\u000a        support for families and clinicians making difficult decisions, combined\u000a        with misunderstandings about the legal framework for treatment under the\u000a        Mental Capacity Act 2005 (e.g. the media-promoted misconception that\u000a        `next of kin' can consent to treatment on an adult relative's behalf -\u000a        which is not the case in the UK).\u000a      Fragmentation of decision-making between different clinicians and\u000a        different professions (e.g. clinical and legal) and concerns about\u000a        continuity and quality of long-term care.\u000a      A cultural taboo about discussing end-of-life wishes, and a lack of\u000a        public information about how to draft legally binding advance decisions\u000a        in relation to medical treatment (e.g. some patients had previously\u000a        expressed strong views regarding refusing treatment in such situations,\u000a        but these were not legally binding because not in writing with a witness\u000a        signature).\u000a      Cultural\/psychological\/clinical\/legal issues around the role of risk\u000a        and `hope' and tensions around the `windows of opportunity' for\u000a        treatment withdrawal and the uncertainty of prognosis early on (i.e.\u000a        efforts to sustain life and allow a full assessment early on can leave\u000a        some patients suspended in states incompatible with their prior\u000a        expressed wishes - by which point they have become physiologically\u000a        stable).\u000a    \u000a    This multi-pronged initiative created an unprecedented in-depth study of\u000a      service-users\/family experience; produced a detailed examination of the\u000a      media\/cultural framing of these issues and compared these to both\u000a      family\/clinical experience and the scientific research. It also tracked\u000a      decision-making over time and space (crucially across different\u000a      treatment\/decision-making sites); and located these processes in their\u000a      cultural\/medico-legal context in England and Wales since the\u000a      implementation of the Mental Capacity Act [MCA] 2005. The breadth and\u000a      depth of the research portfolio allowed for the development of a series of\u000a      strategies for enriching media representation, improving\u000a      professional\/public debate and supporting good practice.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4231","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    In this field, UK policy often lays the foundation for EU initiatives.\u000a      UKCGO and EU Kids Online are widely acknowledged as primary sources of\u000a      evidence for the multiple stakeholders working to improve children's\u000a      literacy and safety online.\u000a    UK policy impacts\u000a    Informed by the findings of UKCGO, the Department for Education's Home\u000a        Access Programme offered reduced-cost, safe computer and internet\u000a      access to the UK's poorest children (2007-11). The UKCGO research\u000a      suggested that providing online access in disadvantaged families results\u000a      in educational benefits but that children's safety must also be addressed.\u000a    The research influenced the Byron Review (A), commissioned by\u000a      Prime Minister Brown. Byron said, \"I have approached classification of the\u000a      online risks to children...in line with a model developed by the EU Kids\u000a      Online project\". The research's benchmark findings broadened the risks\u000a      (cyber-bullying, `sexting' and privacy risks, as well as grooming by\u000a      paedophiles) addressed by successive awareness campaigns. The Byron Review\u000a      led to the UK Council for Child Internet Safety (UKCCIS), which produced\u000a      the UK's first Child Online Safety Strategy in 2011. This reflects the\u000a      research's stress on balancing opportunities and risks and enhancing\u000a      digital literacy. It led to the inclusion of e-safety in the school\u000a      computing curriculum and Ofsted inspection regime.\u000a    Efforts to empower children online in the UK gained impetus following the\u000a      success of the Home Secretary's Taskforce for Child Protection on the\u000a        Internet (2008). The Taskforce established self- regulatory codes of\u000a      guidance on Safe Search, Chat, Moderation, Social Networking and Mobiles.\u000a      Updated by UKCCIS in 2010, this resulted in multiple safety improvements\u000a      in industry provision and practice, benefiting UK child internet users and\u000a      their families. The codes (B) drew on the research's findings on\u000a      children's use of social networking sites, filtering and reporting tools,\u000a      and their practices of `friending', privacy, risk-taking and vulnerability\u000a      to harm.\u000a    Turning the strategy into action, UKCCIS' Advice on child internet\u000a        safety 1.0: Universal guidelines for providers (C) relied on the\u000a      research for its definitions and evidence of risk and harm. UKCCIS members\u000a      (commercial fixed line, handset, software and content providers, police,\u000a      schools and NGOs) promote this user-friendly safety advice to UK children\u000a      and parents, along with technical and human support such as customer\u000a      services, reporting tools, privacy settings and helplines. Livingstone's\u000a      research on the incidence of risk and gaps in parental mediation,\u000a      including parental struggles to install filters, informed the Internet\u000a      Service Providers' (UK fixed line) first Parental Controls Code of\u000a      Practice (D), signed by BT, Talk Talk, Virgin Media and Sky.\u000a      Endorsed by Prime Minister Cameron, domestic filters are now being turned\u000a      on unless the homeowner turns them off.\u000a    A key impact of the research was to change the terms of the public\u000a      debate, from panicky restrictions on children's internet use to\u000a      recognising children's rights online and awareness of the benefits of\u000a      active parental mediation. Livingstone's public outreach has been\u000a      extensive. National and international media reports of the research total\u000a      1800+, with Livingstone interviewed for the Daily Mail, Times,\u000a      Guardian, Der Spiegel, Huffington Post, Panorama,\u000a      Today, C4 News, GMTV Breakfast News, R4 Bringing\u000a        Up Britain, You and Yours, Woman's Hour, Sky News\u000a      and Newsnight. She contributed to Safer Internet Day, which the\u000a      BBC estimates 10% UK population (14% of teens) heard in 2013, two thirds\u000a      of whom said they would change their online behaviour as a result. www.saferinternet.org.uk\/about\/news\/1-in-7-teens-heard-about-safer-internet-day-2013\u000a    Since 2008, Livingstone gave 90+ talks to non-academic audiences (e.g.\u000a      conferences for Head Teachers, Directors of Children's Services, police,\u000a      clinicians, industry and the public). Some 40 non-academic reports and\u000a      writings were widely distributed: for example, in Digital Parenting\u000a        Magazine (1 million copies reached parents\/schools in 2010-12),\u000a      YouTube interviews (several thousand views e.g. \"Child abuse on the\u000a      internet: risks and reality\"; for UNICEF, viewed 1055 times). The EU Kids\u000a      Online network counts five times as many talks and media mentions; report\u000a      downloads are 20,000+ since 2010, website visits total several hundred\u000a      thousand.\u000a    European\/International policy impacts\u000a    EU Kids Online was closely involved in framing and evaluating new\u000a      industry self-regulation on social networking sites in 2009 (The Safer\u000a        Social Networking Principles for the EU) which resulted in higher\u000a      safety standards across the EU27. Building on this successful initiative,\u000a      and citing EU Kids Online findings on how young children go online, EC\u000a      Vice President Kroes established a Coalition of industry CEOs to `make the\u000a      internet a better place for children.' Livingstone presented the research\u000a      to the Coalition (Brussels, 2012: http:\/\/eprints.lse.ac.uk\/44213\/).\u000a      The Coalition confirmed implementation in 2013, citing EU Kids Online\u000a      findings (http:\/\/europa.eu\/rapid\/press-\u000a        release_MEMO-13-504_en.htm).The Coalition established higher\u000a      standards for parental controls, content classification, reporting tools,\u000a      privacy settings and elimination of child abuse images.\u000a    Following the EC's 2011 assessment (G) of child protection as part of the\u000a      Digital Agenda for Europe, a 2012 EC Communication established the first European\u000a        Strategy for a Better Internet for Children (D). Both the assessment\u000a      and the Communication relied on the research's framework and findings for\u000a      children's internet uses and literacy. This guided recent EU efforts to\u000a      empower children online through multiple literacy and safety initiatives.\u000a      For example, after EU Kids Online found that many children are\u000a      dissatisfied with available online content, notably in small language\u000a      countries, the EC Safer Internet Programme established the European\u000a        Award for Best Children's Online Content to promote online\u000a      opportunities for children (Livingstone chairs the European Jury). Insafe\u000a      - the European Network of Awareness Centres - used the findings (e.g. on\u000a      generational misunderstandings, digital skill gaps, emerging risks, needs\u000a      of young users) to target its efforts (e.g. http:\/\/www.saferinternet.org\/web\/guest\/digitaluniverse).\u000a      In the EC's `benchmarking of safer internet policies' (2013), the research\u000a      was identified as a major source for most member states and the sole\u000a      source of evidence in six (http:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/digital-agenda\/en\/creating-better-internet-kids).\u000a    In promoting online safety internationally, the OECD (E) cites the\u000a      research's \"positive correlation between individual psycho-social and\u000a      socioeconomic circumstances and risky behaviour.\" The International\u000a      Telecommunication Union developed its indicators and national strategy\u000a      guide (Child Online Protection) for 192 countries, noting \"there\u000a      has been little work done in articulating a statistical framework. The\u000a      main exception is the EU Kids Online Project.\" The research was heavily\u000a      cited in Harvard's (2008) report to the Attorney Generals of the US, Enhancing\u000a        Child Safety and Online Technologies and is the mainstay of the\u000a      European evidence base for the Family Online Safety Institute's industry\u000a      resource, GRID. Comparisons across place help tailor policy to the\u000a      cultural context: the EU Kids Online survey (5) was replicated in Brazil,\u000a      Russia and Australia, and adapted by UNICEF (F), GSMA, Ofcom, NSPCC, EC\u000a      Safer Internet Programme and others, being cited in policy and practice\u000a      documents in many countries.\u000a    Implementation\u000a    To ensure the policy and public benefits of the research, Livingstone\u000a      worked closely with numerous stakeholders, presenting findings to the All\u000a      Party Parliamentary Prevention of Suicide Group, British Chamber of\u000a      Commerce, Office of the Children's Commissioner, NSPCC, BECTA, BBC, Ofcom,\u000a      Inter-Ministerial Group on Violence against Women and Girls and diverse\u000a      companies (e.g. Google, YouTube, BT, Vodafone, Facebook, GSMA).\u000a    UK: She served on the Home Secretary's Taskforce for Child\u000a        Protection on the Internet and the Dept. for Education's Home\u000a        Access Programme (2009-10), and its panel, Assessing the impact\u000a        of the commercial world on children's wellbeing (2009). Ofcom\u000a      commissioned her for its evidence for the Byron Review. She gave\u000a      evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee (2008) whose\u000a      report led to UKCCIS (H). Livingstone is the UKCCIS Evidence Champion,\u000a      Executive Board Member (2009-) and founding Evidence Group chair. She is\u000a      on the Advisory Board, UK's Safer Internet Centre, and CEOP Command\u000a      Strategic Group (National Crime Agency).\u000a    EC\/International: Livingstone led the EU Kids Online network in\u000a      advising national and European stakeholders - notably, UNICEF, ITU and\u000a      OECD - and presenting the research on multiple occasions at the EC's Safer\u000a      Internet Forum, European Commission, European Parliament, Swedish\u000a      Presidency of the EU, Insafe, Internet Governance Forum, Family Online\u000a      Safety Institute, World Summit on Media for Children and Youth, among\u000a      others.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    LSE research has helped shape children's internet literacy and safety\u000a      policy.

It was funded by\u000a        the EC's Safer Internet Programme, which graded it `Excellent' (5, 6).\u000a        See www.eukidsonline.net\u000a\u000a    \u000a    In the early climate of techno-optimism and media panics, policy makers\u000a      divided into those (educators, civic bodies) seeking to maximise\u000a      opportunities and those (welfare, police, clinicians) concerned to\u000a      minimise risks. By looking at children's internet use in context, the\u000a      research showed the need for these approaches to be integrated (3, 6). It\u000a      developed a classification of online risks that recognises the child's\u000a      agency and skills and produced benchmark findings on risk prevalence (5),\u000a      which is now used by UK government and the EC. It demonstrated a `ladder\u000a      of online opportunities' which outlines an ideal-typical path that starts\u000a      with a child's reception of mass- produced content which he\/she then may\u000a      go on to use in a skilled, participatory and creative way.\u000a    To preclude an overly restrictive approach to parental and other safety\u000a      mediation, the research distinguished risk (e.g. exposure to online sexual\u000a      content) from harm (e.g. a child being adversely affected by such\u000a      exposure), showing that not all exposure results in harm. Thus the\u000a      research identified the socio-economic, demographic, psychological and\u000a      other factors that make children vulnerable, as well as the factors that\u000a      can help protect them, such as digital skills, parental mediation, use of\u000a      technical tools, and risk-taking - insofar as this builds resilience (6).\u000a      It found that a child's digital skills bring risks as well as\u000a      opportunities and that parental actions to reduce children's exposure to\u000a      risk can reduce their online opportunities (6). Ambiguous activities, such\u000a      as the risky opportunities of self-disclosure or making new contacts\u000a      online, need especial care (4, 6).\u000a    The research established a robust explanatory framework and a practical\u000a      measurement instrument for cross-national surveys (1, 2, 5), as well as\u000a      benchmark findings to assess children's online opportunities and risks in\u000a      the UK, Europe and internationally (1, 3, 5). This legitimated a policy\u000a      shift from risk avoidance - and the associated moral panics - to harm\u000a      reduction by targeting policy according to vulnerability and protective\u000a      factors.\u000a    Key Researchers: Professor Livingstone has been at LSE since 1990.\u000a      Her research project employed postdoctoral (Bovill 1995-2001, Bober\u000a      2003-5, Haddon 2006-14, G&#246;rzig 2009-11) and pre-doctoral researchers\u000a      (Helsper, &#211;lafsson).

The\u000d\u000a      public significance of Campbell's work was underlined when his book was\u000d\u000a      named Music Book of the Year in the Sunday Times (Ireland) (4 Dec\u000d\u000a      2011) and in the Hot Press Annual (2012), a rare accolade for an\u000d\u000a      academic text. This serves as evidence of the fact that Campbell's\u000d\u000a      research was registered and praised in the public realm.\u000d\u000a    ii. Public talks increasing public understanding and generating public\u000d\u000a        responses\u000d\u000a      Campbell presented his research in a range of public forums, including at\u000d\u000a      Headingley LitFest (8 March 2013), in a talk co-organised by the Irish\u000d\u000a      Arts Foundation, an Irish community organisation in Leeds. The talk took\u000d\u000a      place at the Headingley Enterprise and Arts Centre, and was advertised in\u000d\u000a      local media, such as the Yorkshire Evening Post (6 Mar 2013),\u000d\u000a      attracting 44 attendees. The organisers collated audience comments, all of\u000d\u000a      which were positive, and showed that Campbell's talk had increased\u000d\u000a      understanding of the experience and expressive cultures of the Irish\u000d\u000a      diaspora in England. The full comments (available from the HEI on request)\u000d\u000a      include the following:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      `This evening explored the ambivalence &amp; ambiguity of the\u000d\u000a        immigrant's child in a very thought- provoking way.

Very enlightening towards understanding';\u000d\u000a      `An entertaining &amp; knowledgeable talk about how 2nd generation\u000d\u000a        Irish musicians felt about being here and what they did with their music\u000d\u000a        to express their feelings. I learned a great deal';\u000d\u000a      `Thoroughly interesting and absorbing delivered by one who has\u000d\u000a        researched in depth. Raised a lot of issues which look as if they are\u000d\u000a        going to be pursued further by members of the audience, excellent!'\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Campbell's talk at Headingley also generated online responses, such as\u000d\u000a      blog entries, which show evidence of his work's impact on public\u000d\u000a      understanding of this topic. These included the following: `On the ninth\u000d\u000a      of March I met a lady who had attended this talk. She is married to an\u000d\u000a      Irishman and she told me how the insights given by Dr. Sean Campbell had\u000d\u000a      helped her understand her husband's experience of life in this country\u000d\u000a      more closely \"because he would never talk about it himself\". Such was the\u000d\u000a      impact of this humorous and knowledgeable speaker ... During the lively\u000d\u000a      Q&amp;A session that followed ... it was clear that Dr. Campbell had\u000d\u000a      touched the sensibilities of his full- house audience many of whom were\u000d\u000a      ... second (or even third or fourth) generation Irish'\u000d\u000a(http:\/\/headingleylitfest.blogspot.co.uk\/2013\/03\/dwellers-on-threshold-dr-sean-campbell.html).\u000d\u000a    Campbell also presented his research at other public talks, including at\u000d\u000a      `Culture Night', an Irish community event at London's Shortwave Cinema (23\u000d\u000a      September 2011) that attracted 70 attendees. The event's convenor provides\u000d\u000a      evidence of Campbell's impact in a letter (available from the HEI on\u000d\u000a      request) which includes the following: `Sean's talk expertly and\u000d\u000a      insightfully bridged the gap between many people on this Culture Night\u000d\u000a      which, in my role as programmer and producer, was ideal - the theme of the\u000d\u000a      evening was `nasc', the Irish for connection. It was wonderful to see\u000d\u000a      people from many walks of life and from such varying ages, intensely\u000d\u000a      debate the topics and questions posed from Sean's talk. In this regard,\u000d\u000a      his position as a keynote speaker provided immense and lasting work to the\u000d\u000a      evening and all that followed'. In 2012, Ireland's Department of Foreign\u000d\u000a      Affairs invited Campbell to speak about his book at the Irish Embassy in\u000d\u000a      London. At the event (12 June 2012), the Ambassador discussed the book's\u000d\u000a      themes, before Campbell gave a talk to the attendees, who included\u000d\u000a      high-profile figures from the realms of politics, media and music (see\u000d\u000a      Section 5.vii). This invite, and the talk Campbell gave in this forum,\u000d\u000a      evidences that his work was registered, and valued, at governmental as\u000d\u000a      well as public levels.\u000d\u000a    iii. Series Advisor role on TV documentary series generating public\u000d\u000a        responses and informing public debate\u000d\u000a      In 2011 Campbell was appointed Series Advisor on Guth: Musical Sons of\u000d\u000a        the Irish Diaspora, a six- part television documentary series\u000d\u000a      broadcast on TG4, a public service broadcaster for Irish- language\u000d\u000a      speakers, in 2013 (see Section 5.viii). The series drew on the themes and\u000d\u000a      ideas of Campbell's book in its exploration of the role of Irish ethnicity\u000d\u000a      in the lives and work of musicians of Irish descent. Campbell advised the\u000d\u000a      producers in face-to-face meetings, phone discussions and e- mail\u000d\u000a      exchanges, and was interviewed on camera, appearing in the series as an\u000d\u000a      onscreen contributor (particularly in episodes 3-5), discussing material\u000d\u000a      from his book. The primary stage of impact (of Campbell's research\u000d\u000a      informing a TV series) was extended when the series reached an audience of\u000d\u000a      approx. 100,000 in Ireland, generating a positive public response, with\u000d\u000a      responses on social media showing that the series had enriched\u000d\u000a      appreciation of culture. This is evinced in the following Twitter\u000d\u000a      comments:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      `great tv \"Guth\", Irish connections with musicians, reflecting on\u000d\u000a        class, race &amp; identity'\u000d\u000a        (https:\/\/twitter.com\/SorchaGeoghegan\/status\/391179136712318976);\u000d\u000a      `Excellent series exploring the music icon offsprings of Irish\u000d\u000a        emigrants'\u000d\u000a        (https:\/\/twitter.com\/MaireDineen01\/status\/391194869714001923);\u000d\u000a      `If you get the chance look out for Guth on @TG4TV re Brit bands with\u000d\u000a        strong Irish heritage - Smiths Oasis Dexys Costello Lydon'\u000d\u000a        (https:\/\/twitter.com\/Neekyatn\/status\/393661528747962368);\u000d\u000a      `Repeat of the Smiths documentary \"Guth \" on TG4 at 11.50pm tonight.\u000d\u000a        Explores the Irish ancestry and influences of the band.

The\u000d\u000a        series also informed public debates about the Irish diaspora in England,\u000d\u000a        with newspaper articles on this topic directly citing the material\u000d\u000a        presented in the series. One such article, in the Irish Independent\u000d\u000a        (readership: 120,000), observed: `this phenomenon of kids who were seen\u000d\u000a        as Irish by the English, and vice versa, and how this could be a\u000d\u000a        powerful creative force. But I would now see it as being more complex\u000d\u000a        again than that. They say that from time to time an Irish writer like,\u000d\u000a        say, Brendan Behan, emerges to give the English theatre a blast of\u000d\u000a        energy, and yet it is also true to say that the English theatre is\u000d\u000a        always there to recognise the raw talent of a Behan, to help turn his\u000d\u000a        ideas into actual plays. Likewise, The Smiths, subjects of last week's\u000d\u000a        Guth, had eight Irish-born parents between the four of them. So we need\u000d\u000a        to understand that this relationship with Britain has been far more\u000d\u000a        mutually beneficial than is generally admitted. That for all the\u000d\u000a        ass-kicking that the sons of Erin have administered to British culture,\u000d\u000a        it is also virtually unknown for the Irish to become internationally\u000d\u000a        successful without some significant contribution from a friendly\u000d\u000a        neighbour. So the Smiths, brought up in the Irish community in\u000d\u000a        Manchester, might have felt this separateness from England, but then\u000d\u000a        most artists, everywhere, feel a bit separate from their surroundings.\u000d\u000a        Again, I would prefer to join with Guth in rejoicing in such\u000d\u000a        complications, rather than to regret their intrusion on a more\u000d\u000a        simplistic nationalist narrative' (see Section 5.ix for reference). This\u000d\u000a        newspaper article shows how Campbell's research - through its\u000d\u000a        transposition into a TV documentary series - informed public debates.\u000d\u000a        The engagement initiatives outlined above had a wide public reach in the\u000d\u000a        UK and Ireland, increasing understanding of the experience and\u000d\u000a        expressive cultures of the Irish diaspora in England.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    In 2011-12, Campbell engaged in a range of media activities and public\u000d\u000a      talks to enable the effective sharing of his research on second-generation\u000d\u000a      Irish musicians in England. These activities disseminated new insights to\u000d\u000a      the public, increasing understanding of the experience and expressive\u000d\u000a      cultures of England's Irish, and informing public debates on this topic.\u000d\u000a      The activities comprised three strands:\u000d\u000a    i.

The book explores the work of second-\u000d\u000a      generation Irish creative figures from this `in-between' perspective,\u000d\u000a      whilst addressing the diverse ways in which this generation shaped popular\u000d\u000a      music in England. Existing accounts have neglected to consider this\u000d\u000a      generation's cultural agency, stressing the impact of the host culture on\u000d\u000a      the migrant group whilst overlooking the ways in which the\u000d\u000a      second-generation helped shape the host culture. Campbell's research\u000d\u000a      demonstrated this achievement via detailed case studies of three\u000d\u000a      high-profile projects: Kevin Rowland and Dexys Midnight Runners, Shane\u000d\u000a      MacGowan and The Pogues, and Morrissey\/Marr and The Smiths. His work\u000d\u000a      mapped the diverse `routes' pursued by second- generation Irish musicians,\u000d\u000a      illuminating their different styles and personas, and discrete social\u000d\u000a      locales (in Birmingham, London and Manchester). Critiquing accounts that\u000d\u000a      see such musicians as either `Irish' or `English', Campbell showed how\u000d\u000a      second-generation Irish music-making is a complex cultural process that\u000d\u000a      has exceeded both Irish ethnicity and English assimilation, and points to\u000d\u000a      an often intricate accommodation of Anglo-Irish issues (marked by\u000d\u000a      `in-betweenness'). Campbell's work thus detailed the complexities of\u000d\u000a      Irish-English identities, shedding light on the creative dynamics that\u000d\u000a      have emerged from this context, and complicating nationalist narratives.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4562","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This work has had impact on: Key Stage 5 (AS and A Level) curriculum\u000d\u000a      development; practice of\u000d\u000a      Key Stage 5 teachers; student understanding at Key Stage 5 and earlier\u000d\u000a      stages (which also has\u000d\u000a      impact on curriculum developments).\u000d\u000a    Curriculum Development\u000d\u000a      Our research is playing an important role in the development of new AS and\u000d\u000a      A level English\u000d\u000a      specifications. Clark's research on reader and writer inferences, and how\u000d\u000a      this can help students to\u000d\u000a      understand their own practice as well as texts and writers, has been\u000d\u000a      particularly influential. A wide\u000d\u000a      range of activities led to this impact. Clark was a consultant at an AQA\u000d\u000a      event on developing new\u000d\u000a      specifications at the University of Sheffield in 2012. With Dr. Andrea\u000d\u000a      Macrae (Oxford Brookes\u000d\u000a      University) and Dr. Marcello Giovanelli (University of Nottingham), he was\u000d\u000a      commissioned to write\u000d\u000a      HEA reports on `Lang\/Lit' work at school in 2012 and 2013.

These activities raise student awareness of the nature of\u000d\u000a      inferences they make when\u000d\u000a      reading and writing, and help them to adapt reading and writing practice\u000d\u000a      in the light of this. The\u000d\u000a      workshop, for 20 teachers, was oversubscribed and teachers provided\u000d\u000a      positive oral and written\u000d\u000a      feedback. Clark co-presented (with Dr. Gary Wood, University of Sheffield,\u000d\u000a      and Louis Blois,\u000d\u000a      teacher at Leggott Academy, Scunthorpe) a workshop on the UK Linguistics\u000d\u000a      Olympiad at a\u000d\u000a      conference for English teachers at the University of Huddersfield in 2012.\u000d\u000a      He has taken part in a\u000d\u000a      large number of Higher Education Academy subject centre workshops on\u000d\u000a      transition from A level to\u000d\u000a      BA level.

The work is underpinned by individual and collaborative\u000d\u000a      research carried out by Clark\u000d\u000a      on linguistics and English language, particularly his pioneering work on\u000d\u000a      linguistic pragmatics. Clark\u000d\u000a      and others have worked in these areas throughout the period from 1993\u000d\u000a      (researchers currently\u000d\u000a      working within this unit include Cobley, Farini, Gibb, and Shaw).\u000d\u000a      The indicative references below cover the broader range of work on\u000d\u000a      linguistic semantics and\u000d\u000a      pragmatics, prosodic meaning and phatic communication, all of which feed\u000d\u000a      into work on language\u000d\u000a      and linguistics at school. This research is relevant to work on language\u000d\u000a      in school curricula at all\u000d\u000a      stages. Nicolle (research assistant and lecturer 1996-1998) and Clark's\u000d\u000a      1999 paper builds on\u000d\u000a      Clark's early research on linguistic meaning (syntax, semantics,\u000d\u000a      pragmatics and meaning change).\u000d\u000a      It presents experimental work exploring how individuals understand\u000d\u000a      utterances in context. The\u000d\u000a      research was carried out between 1996 and 1998. Zegarac (research\u000d\u000a      assistant 1993-1995) and\u000d\u000a      Clark's 1999 paper extends this approach to language with a salient social\u000d\u000a      function: `phatic\u000d\u000a      communication', traditionally understood as having a primarily social\u000d\u000a      rather than a communicative\u000d\u000a      function. It shows how phatic communication can be understood within the\u000d\u000a      cognitive framework of\u000d\u000a      relevance theory and how this approach can account for social functions\u000d\u000a      associated with phatic\u000d\u000a      communication. This research was carried out between 1994 and 1999. Clark\u000d\u000a      (2012a) represents\u000d\u000a      a strand of research on the meanings of prosody (variation in pitch,\u000d\u000a      rhythm, timing and volume). It\u000d\u000a      considers how a relevance-theoretic approach can explain relations between\u000d\u000a      prosodic and other\u000d\u000a      kinds of meanings, the kinds of meanings they encode, and how specific\u000d\u000a      meanings are inferred in\u000d\u000a      specific contexts. This work was carried out between 2005 and 2012.\u000d\u000a      Clark's work on pragmatics (focusing on inferences involved in the\u000d\u000a      production and interpretation of\u000d\u000a      communicative acts) is also based on relevance theory (Sperber and Wilson\u000d\u000a      1986), which builds\u000d\u000a      on Paul Grice's groundbreaking work (Grice 1989) beginning in the 1960s.\u000d\u000a      Work in pragmatics has\u000d\u000a      developed from Grice's work in several directions. While relevance theory\u000d\u000a      adopts the Gricean view\u000d\u000a      that intentional communication is governed by ultimately rational\u000d\u000a      principles, it departs from Grice in\u000d\u000a      that its key theoretical assumptions are understood as law-like\u000d\u000a      generalisations about human\u000d\u000a      cognition and behaviour rather than norm-like principles to which\u000d\u000a      individuals aim to conform.\u000d\u000a      The vast majority of work in this tradition of pragmatics has focused on\u000d\u000a      the inferential processes\u000d\u000a      involved in understanding spoken and written utterances rather than on the\u000d\u000a      inferential processes\u000d\u000a      involved in production. Clark (2009) retains the focus on interpretation\u000d\u000a      and develops a\u000d\u000a      methodology for stylistic analysis (aiming to explain how texts have the\u000d\u000a      effects they do on readers).\u000d\u000a      He (2012b) extends this approach to consider inferences made by writers\u000d\u000a      and editors in the\u000d\u000a      production and redrafting of texts, and how this approach can help to\u000d\u000a      account for literary criticism,\u000d\u000a      interpretation and evaluation. Clark and Owtram (2012) discuss how this\u000d\u000a      approach can be\u000d\u000a      developed in pedagogical and other contexts to help writers develop their\u000d\u000a      writing and reflect on\u000d\u000a      their own practice by focusing on the inferential processes of readers and\u000d\u000a      writers.

A series of four linked events organised by Little and chaired\u000d\u000a      by Littler have been regularly oversubscribed with audiences ranging from\u000d\u000a      40 to 300 attendees and transcripts appearing on Open Democracy's Our\u000d\u000a        Kingdom blog site (see video:\u000d\u000a      http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mIVxeJX-3qU).\u000d\u000a    Collaborations of this kind are typical of the group's work, reaching\u000d\u000a      large audiences through strong links with media outlets as well as civil\u000d\u000a      society, public policy and party political groups as appropriate to the\u000d\u000a      nature of their work. A spokesperson of the New Economics Foundation\u000d\u000a      stated that such collaborations `represent[ed] an excellent example of\u000d\u000a        the interaction between a university, think tanks and civil society'.\u000d\u000a      We identify three specific examples of impact below.\u000d\u000a    a. Public perception and discussion of the financial crisis and the\u000d\u000a        future of political economy\u000d\u000a    Rutherford's work is highly influential in public policy debates. He was\u000d\u000a      involved, through Soundings, in coordinating numerous\u000d\u000a      impact\/engagement activities including the `Class and Culture' series of\u000d\u000a      talks in 2008 (online debate edited by Little) and After New Labour (2008)\u000d\u000a      with The Guardian (http:\/\/pennyred.blogspot.co.uk\/2008\/11\/after-new-labour-report-on.html).\u000aThese\u000a      activities brought together academics, NGOs, journalists, activists and\u000d\u000a      politicians from the Treasury, TUC, War On Want, the Family and Parenting\u000d\u000a      Institute, as well as universities of Essex, Jiao Tong, Jawaharlal Nehru\u000d\u000a      and Cambridge to work on alternative cultural economies. Rutherford has\u000d\u000a      been described as one of the Labour Party's 'leading thinkers' (http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jonathan_Rutherford)\u000d\u000a      and has had articles published across a range of well known high\u000d\u000a      circulation media outlets while working at Middlesex, including The\u000d\u000a        Guardian, New Statesman, Total Politics, and others.\u000d\u000a    b. The emergence of intergenerational politics\u000d\u000a    Little's edited e-books Radical Future (2010) and Regeneration\u000d\u000a      (2012) on the identities, politics and predicaments of people under 30 had\u000d\u000a      been downloaded over 60,000 times and over 90,000 times respectively by\u000d\u000a      June 2013 (data provided by publisher, July 2013). The books helped to\u000d\u000a      establish the discourse of intergenerational politics in the UK. Radical\u000a        Future was featured in a Guardian election special as well\u000d\u000a      as on the Comment is Free blog. Attendance at the launch event for\u000d\u000a      Regeneration (http:\/\/www.if.org.uk\/archives\/1826\/regeneration-book-launch-at-foyles)\u000d\u000a      demonstrated the level of public interest (this was oversubscribed with\u000d\u000a      capacity for 150). The books have also acted as the hub for a network of\u000d\u000a      young activists, campaigners and journalists.\u000d\u000a    The chair of the leading think-tank Compass acknowledges the\u000d\u000a      impact of this project stating: `The work that Dr. Ben Little has done\u000d\u000a        around intergenerational politics helped us develop our thinking around\u000d\u000a        youth policy, directly informing the proposals advanced in the manifesto\u000d\u000a        entitled \"Plan B: a good economy for a good society\", launched in London\u000d\u000a        in October 2011, which received the support of over 100 leading\u000d\u000a        economists.'\u000d\u000a    This approach to intergenerational politics also informs more general\u000d\u000a      `youth' issues. One of the co-directors of Intern Aware\u000d\u000a      collaborated with Little on a project that helped them to collect over\u000d\u000a      1,500 letters addressed to MPs. This initiative resulted in a\u000d\u000a      parliamentary debate on the issue of unpaid internships, a debate that is\u000d\u000a      still ongoing with further discussion planned this year. A global\u000d\u000a      campaigner for Oxfam GB who collaborated with 100 of Little's\u000d\u000a      students for the production of a high quality video on the issue of tax\u000d\u000a      justice reports that `the experience was valuable to me in my role as\u000d\u000a        organiser as it was an opportunity to find modes of communicating\u000d\u000a        current issues in ways that were relevant' for young people.\u000d\u000a    Little has organised a range of political briefing events on this subject\u000d\u000a      and he was invited to brief the leader of the Labour Party as part of a\u000d\u000a      group of young activists in November 2012, with a follow-up meeting in\u000d\u000a      July 2013 and more planned for the future.\u000d\u000a    c. New ways of thinking about consumption\u000d\u000a    This was facilitated by Littler's collaboration with the `Church of Stop\u000d\u000a      Shopping' and participation in ESRC-funded seminars with staff from the\u000d\u000a      Fairtrade Foundation and the AHRC-funded Ethical Consumption seminar. The\u000d\u000a      Chair of Compass describes how: 'The research of Dr. Jo\u000d\u000a        Littler has forwarded our engagement with consumer politics, lending us\u000d\u000a        an effective conceptual framework linking radical politics with consumer\u000d\u000a        society.'\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Cultural studies at Middlesex has often exemplified the New Left\u000d\u000a      tradition that played an important role in founding the discipline.

What links the work together is an\u000d\u000a      orientation towards cultural research as an important form of\u000d\u000a      participation in public debate in the work of researchers including Little,\u000d\u000a      Jo Littler (Senior Lecturer 2000-2012), Kobena Mercer (Research Associate\u000d\u000a      2000-2002), Professor Jonathan Rutherford (1994-2011), Professor\u000d\u000a      (Baroness) Lola Young (1992-2002) and the collective use of the journal Soundings\u000d\u000a      (1995-present) as a vehicle for dissemination and collaboration with party\u000d\u000a      political and civil society organisations.\u000d\u000a    Research has revolved around a core team of Ben Little, Jo\u000d\u000a      Littler and Jonathan Rutherford. Little currently co-edits Soundings\u000d\u000a      with Sally Davison, Littler is an editorial board member, and Rutherford\u000d\u000a      edited the journal from 2003 to 2012. Members of the group work closely\u000d\u000a      with the founding editors of the journal: Stuart Hall and Doreen Massey at\u000d\u000a      the Open University and Michael Rustin at the University of East London.\u000d\u000a      Links with the New Left roots of the journal's approach to cultural\u000d\u000a      studies have always been made explicit and renewed through a range of\u000d\u000a      activities. Funded by Middlesex, Little followed the recent launch of After\u000a        Neoliberalism: The Kilburn Manifesto with the re-release (with a new\u000d\u000a      introduction by Michael Rustin and a public event) of The May Day\u000d\u000a        Manifesto of 1967\/8, a key New Left document originally written by\u000d\u000a      Stuart Hall, Raymond Williams and Edward Thompson.\u000d\u000a    While the group's research at Middlesex is situated within analysis of\u000d\u000a      the contemporary cultural conjuncture and the hegemony of neoliberal\u000d\u000a      ideology, individual researchers cover distinct areas within this frame.\u000d\u000a      Rutherford's interest in identity and masculinity has informed his\u000d\u000a      longstanding work with political parties. His collection Race,\u000d\u000a        Identity &amp; Belonging (2008) is the latest example of this\u000d\u000a      strand. Rutherford has produced a series of works in collaboration with\u000d\u000a      Jon Cruddas MP. Their work on the cultural construction of conservatism\u000d\u000a      produced the collection Is the Future Conservative? in 2008, which\u000d\u000a      contained some of the background conceptual work to what would become\u000d\u000a      known as `Red Toryism' and `Blue Labour', political philosophies designed\u000d\u000a      to create formations that would orientate mainstream political parties\u000d\u000a      away from the neoliberal consensus.\u000d\u000a    Little's work has focused on the engagement of young people with\u000d\u000a      politics. His PhD (2010) looked at the way in which 1980s comic books\u000d\u000a      created a space for reflection on the complex shifts in identity politics\u000d\u000a      and the ways in which young people were encountering and making sense of\u000d\u000a      these changes. His work grew to encompass collaborations with activists\u000d\u000a      (Little and Grayson 2011) and he has also been writing and presenting on\u000d\u000a      social movements, popular culture, campaigning, the network society and\u000d\u000a      media technology. This work directly informed his editorship of the Radical\u000a        Future series (2010, 2012).\u000d\u000a    Littler's work on the mediation of ethical consumption has involved\u000d\u000a      collaborations and interviews with international academics and activists\u000d\u000a      and extends across the publication of her book (2009) and an array of\u000d\u000a      related articles.

ADMOS tracks people and determines their\u000a      approximate age and gender and whether or not they have noticed the\u000a      advert. GMPR technologies on real-time detection and tracking, recognition\u000a      and depth estimation are critical to the project. There are four SMEs on\u000a      the project from Belgium and The Netherlands, Spain, and Hungary.

This collection has a\u000a      designated status, meaning it is internationally important. Scanning and\u000a      modelling the metallic objects was extremely difficult due to their\u000a      shininess and complex surface shapes [Source 4]. Our research on\u000a      structured light methods using both multiple and single stripe scanning\u000a      was crucial in overcoming these problems. This project produced a digital\u000a      record of the collection, thus helping wider understanding of the city's\u000a      contemporary and historical contribution to the metalwork industries. The\u000a      3D models are universally accessible through standard web browsers located\u000a      on the Museums' Sheffield website [Source 5]. The `Man of Steel' will be a\u000a      `made in Sheffield' 30m tall stainless steel landmark and visitor centre\u000a      for the Yorkshire and Sheffield region celebrating the community's\u000a      connections with the steel industry [Source 6 - 9]. In 2012 GMPR\u000a      technologies were used to scan a model of the sculpture to a high\u000a      resolution of 4 vertices per millimetre. The scanned model has over 2\u000a      million faces. It has been a critical tool in allowing architects to place\u000a      it within virtual models assisting visualisation of the sculpture's final\u000a      appearance and also in helping to obtain the required planning\u000a      permissions.

There are three themes to the GMPR\u000a      research using active methods: (i) the development of unique\u000a      structured light techniques for 3D scanning and reconstruction, (ii)\u000a      pattern recognition using the acquired 3D data, and (iii) developing\u000a      mathematical models for 3D data compression. The technologies were\u000a      entirely developed within Sheffield Hallam University (SHU) by Professor\u000a      Marcos A Rodrigues (SHU 2001- 2003 Reader; 2003-present Professor) and Dr\u000a      Alan Robinson (SHU 2007-2009 Senior Lecturer; 2009-present Principal\u000a      Lecturer), mainly employing internal funding, but also benefitting from\u000a      financial support from JISC [Grant 3], marketing and financial support\u000a      from the previous Regional Development Agency, Yorkshire Forward\u000a      (2005-2008), commercial licensing [Licence 1], and European funding [Grant\u000a      1, 2]. At the start of this research, in 2001, the state of the art in 3D\u000a      scanning using structured light were single stripe systems or coded light\u000a      patterns. The research gained momentum after 2004 with our patented\u000a      uncoded multiple line projection technique [Ref 1]. The distinguishing\u000a      feature of this new technology is speed and accuracy as it can provide\u000a      accurate real time 3D reconstruction from a single 2D image using uncoded\u000a      structured light and it can operate in real time regime both in the\u000a      visible, and near-infrared, spectra.\u000a    The latest (2011) GMPR scanner has a resolution of 0.25mm in the\u000a      horizontal (4 vertices per millimetre) and 0.5mm in the vertical direction\u000a      (2 vertices per millimetre). This has been possible because we were able\u000a      to solve and refine (2004-2011) a fundamental problem: reliably to detect\u000a      and index stripes in the scene. The counterpart to the indexing problem in\u000a      passive methods is the stereo vision image correspondence problem.\u000a      However, the GMPR technology is superior to stereo vision in relation to\u000a      speed and accuracy, as it can perform 3D reconstruction in 40ms and it is\u000a      much more reliable especially for smooth or featureless objects - a\u000a      well-known issue where stereo vision fails. There is a strong continuing\u000a      interest in active structured light technology as evidenced by the Kinect\u000a      box from Microsoft using coded structured light. Our technology has\u000a      greater accuracy and measurement density than Kinect, making it\u000a      appropriate to applications in the medical, industrial inspection, quality\u000a      control, and security domains.\u000a    Our research was partially guided by the National Science Foundation Face\u000a      Recognition Grand Challenge set in 2005 to improve 2D face recognition\u000a      success rates by using 3D face measurements. Our accurate scanned facial\u000a      data allowed us to pursue original solutions and 2D- 3D eye detection\u000a      algorithms such that a 3D mesh of the face could be recognised. This\u000a      involved developing unique methods and algorithms for 2D image and 3D mesh\u000a      processing including automatic 3D pose normalisation, automatic feature\u000a      extraction and cropping of the face region in 3D space [Ref 2]. Fast\u000a      eigenvector decomposition methods were developed for 3D face recognition\u000a      with high degree of accuracy [Ref 3, 4]. We demonstrated (in 2010-2011)\u000a      real time processing by showing that in just over one second the following\u000a      tasks could be accomplished: face tracking with superimposed eye\u000a      detection, the 2D image being automatically taken according to some\u000a      predefined constraints of face size and pose, 2D image processing with\u000a      median and weighted mean filter, uncoded line detection and indexing,\u000a      point cloud reconstruction in 3D, mesh triangulation, automatic 3D pose\u000a      normalisation and feature detection, and recognition from a database.\u000a    3D data files are normally large as it is necessary to represent the\u000a      geometry and the connectivity of the mesh. There is a strong requirement\u000a      for 3D data compression using mathematical modelling for improved database\u000a      performance, network transmission, remote processing and visualisation.\u000a      The emphasis of current research is on 3D mesh compression methods [Ref\u000a      5], and on developing solutions for robotics [Ref 6], and medical\u000a      engineering [Ref 7]. Standard approaches to 3D data compression are\u000a      focused on encoding the connectivity of the mesh with geometry as a\u000a      dependent property. We took the inverse approach of encoding the geometry\u000a      having connectivity as a derived property. Novel compression methods based\u000a      on partial differential equations (PDEs) were demonstrated by iteratively\u000a      solving Laplace's equation over the 3D mesh domain expressed by an\u000a      elliptic PDE. We showed (in 2012) that PDE surfaces are appropriate to\u000a      represent and unpack large data files yielding compression rates of over\u000a      97% (typically from 17MB to 0.45MB).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4984","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2287781","Name":"Ivory Coast"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"226074","Name":"Uganda"},{"GeoNamesId":"2361809","Name":"Burkina Faso"},{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Impact of the technology for research participants\u000a      The Kheti technology provided farmers living in remote villages with\u000a      relevant and accurate on-the-spot agricultural advice from a trusted\u000a      source (the advisor for the co-operative). Farmers who used photographs\u000a      and audio to communicate the problem typically experienced a turnaround\u000a      time from query to response - of between 12 and 48 hours. Prior to Kheti,\u000a      the agricultural advisor would have needed to visit each village involving\u000a      a half or whole day's journey over dirt roads.\u000a    In field trials conducted with the collaborating farmers' co-operative,\u000a      over 200 messages were exchanged in the 3 month trial period, with over\u000a      100 different farmers using the service. Ninety eight messages were\u000a      translated into English and analysed. Of these messages, 17 different\u000a      crops were discussed, with queries being mostly concerned with identifying\u000a      and eradicating crop pests, poor crop development, and crop disease\u000a      symptoms. Major pest problems were identified and addressed promptly (e.g.\u000a      a Hock Moth attack on a farmer's Soya field), which may have prevented a\u000a      significant loss of annual income for farmers affected in that village\u000a      (Ref 5).\u000a    In 2009, the project received the Manthan award for best practice in\u000a      digital inclusion (Source 1). Rizvi and members of the co-operative\u000a      travelled to New Dehli to collect the award and the project was widely\u000a      reported in the Indian print media, including the Times of India. The\u000a      Manthan Award was launched in 2004 by the Digital Empowerment Foundation,\u000a      in partnership with the World Summit Award and the Department of IT, of\u000a      the Government of India (and other partners). The annual award recognises\u000a      the very best in e-Content and digital practices for development.\u000a      Initially this was for the Indian sub-continent, but now covers the entire\u000a      South Asia and Pacific region.\u000a    Impact for software design organisations\u000a      Our collaborators in India, Safal Solutions, have revised their software\u000a      development processes to integrate the novel methods and techniques\u000a      generated by the Rural e-Services project. They have applied these methods\u000a      to multiple IT design projects over the past 5 years, all reflecting our\u000a      research finding concerning institutional strengthening as a crucial\u000a      element of ICTD. Safal's projects have focused on management information\u000a      systems (MIS) for institutions associated with both microfinance and\u000a      primary agricultural co-operatives (PACS) (Source 2).\u000a    Through the dissemination of our novel methods, we have developed a\u000a      relationship with a team at SAP Research (Karlsruhe, Germany) who are\u000a      conducting projects using mobile phones to connect agricultural supply\u000a      chains in West Africa. Dearden used key findings from the Rural e-Services\u000a      study (Refs 3, 4, 5) to advise SAP Research on ways of combining agile\u000a      software development with participatory institutional development\u000a      strategies. This resulted in the development by SAP Research of a\u000a      methodology called DRAMATICS (formerly, TIM), the associated methods and\u000a      applications for which are described (in Ref 6, Source 3). At the core of\u000a      the DRAMATICS methodology is a clear definition of roles including\u000a      internal and external software developers and a locally based `change\u000a      manager' (equivalent to the `development project manager' role identified\u000a      in Ref 4). The DRAMATICS methodology also extends the work of Rural\u000a      e-Services by defining a sequence of phases of project evaluation, each of\u000a      which demands different frequencies of software iteration and different\u000a      process models for managing software changes.\u000a    Impact for farmers and farming Co-operatives\u000a      In collaboration with the Centre for People's Forestry (CPF), Safal has\u000a      applied our new participatory methodologies to develop a management\u000a      information system, both for CPF and the Primary Agricultural Co-operative\u000a      Societies (PACs), that the centre supports. The CPF and their partners are\u000a      providing valuable agricultural information, advice and business credit\u000a      lines to over 10,000 people in Andhra Pradesh, including 3000 PACS\u000a      members.\u000a    SAP Research has adopted and adapted our methods to design and deploy\u000a      novel software using mobile phones to support co-operatives of Cashew\u000a      farmers and Shea Nut collectors in Ghana and Burkina Faso (Ref 6). The\u000a      resulting applications improve the traceability of produce in the supply\u000a      chain, enabling the co-operatives to qualify for Fair Trade premiums. The\u000a      technologies are now being used to increase the incomes of over 8000\u000a      farmers in West Africa, with plans to extend the work to support 10,000\u000a      cocoa farmers in Ivory Coast for the 2013 harvest (Sources 3 and 4).\u000a    Impact on microfinance co-operatives\u000a      Safal Solutions has used the methodologies devised through Rural\u000a      e-Services to develop IT systems for microfinance in India (Source 2).\u000a      Microfinance involves groups of people on very low incomes (usually women)\u000a      forming joint savings and loan clubs within their villages and keeping\u000a      paper records. Savings rates may be as little as 10 or 20p per week.\u000a      Although the amounts involved may not be sufficient to open a bank\u000a      account, good record keeping (including digitising records) allows\u000a      individuals and the group to build up a credit history and so access small\u000a      loans. However, capturing the data from these village savings club is\u000a      challenging and labour intensive. Safal's software and socio-technical\u000a      model helps microfinance NGOs to efficiently capture and manage this data,\u000a      enabling some of the poorest members of Indian society to access banking\u000a      services. Safal's new software has been applied by: the Jeevika project in\u000a      Bihar state, which provides financial services to 700,000 women; TRIPTI in\u000a      Orissa state which aims to support 300,000 women; and Arohan, a\u000a      microfinance institution in West Bengal which serves 300,000 families.\u000a    Impact on students in developing countries\u000a      The Rural e-Services project was used to underpin an 18 month British\u000a      Council-funded Education Partnership with Africa between SHU and Makerere\u000a      University, Uganda. As a result of the partnership, 50 students at\u000a      Makerere have been supported in developing innovative mobile applications\u000a      to address challenges and opportunities they identified, both nationally\u000a      and within their local communities. The student projects included: an\u000a      automated reminder system for pregnant women reminding them of clinic\u000a      appointments and encouraging good pre- and post-natal care; an SMS query\u000a      routing system to enable a community of farmers to share knowledge with\u000a      each other; an SMS based sports betting application; collecting water\u000a      &amp; power meter readings using mobile phones; and an SMS based\u000a      `recommendation community' for restaurants and hotels in Uganda.

Collaborators at other institutions with lesser\u000a      roles were: Xiaolan Fu, a development studies researcher at the University\u000a      of Oxford, who employed a researcher to undertake a comparative study of\u000a      business models of ICT in agriculture in developing regions (not\u000a      published). In addition, Paul Matthews, who was employed by the Overseas\u000a      Development Institute (an aid NGO) at the start of the project and later\u000a      joined the University of the West of England, advised on knowledge\u000a      management and co-authored one paper (Ref 5). Dearden was a Reader at\u000a      Sheffield Hallam University (SHU) throughout the project. Dearden started\u000a      at SHU in January 2000, and held the post of Senior Lecturer before\u000a      appointment to Reader in November 2005 (a post he currently holds). Rizvi\u000a      was employed by SHU from January 2007 to April 2009. SHU subcontracted\u000a      software development work to Subodh Gupta of Safal Solutions,\u000a      Secunderabad, India, a small software development company specialised in\u000a      working with development NGOs.\u000a    Rural e-Services developed new software design methods, combining\u000a      insights from participatory IT design, agile software methodology, and\u000a      participatory social development. After reviewing literature (Ref 1),\u000a      Dearden's team undertook action research with a co-operative of small\u000a      farmers in Madhya Pradesh, India. Under guidance and supervision from\u000a      Dearden, Rizvi collaborated with Safal Solutions to conduct the fieldwork\u000a      and design and build the software. The methods are reported in Refs 2, 3\u000a      and 4 and the Kheti technology (Ref 5).\u000a    Research outputs are of two contrasting types. First, a socio-technical\u000a      system (Kheti) and second, recommendations for software design methodology\u000a      in ICTD.\u000a    The design of Kheti was guided by the priorities of the co-op members\u000a      themselves. The Kheti software running on mobile phones allows farmers\u000a      (with limited literacy) to create multimedia messages incorporating images\u000a      and audio and send them to a web portal that can be accessed later by the\u000a      agricultural advisor for the co-operative. Phones are held by local co-op\u000a      representatives, who are paid to visit regularly a small number of\u000a      villages and support the co-op members in those villages. The co-op\u000a      representative typically visits on one afternoon to collect queries, and\u000a      returns the following day to deliver the advice. Previously the\u000a      agricultural advisor would have had to visit the farmer, and could only\u000a      hope to visit each co-op member about once per year. Kheti is distinctive\u000a      in that it not only provides a more efficient channel for delivering\u000a      agricultural advice, but crucially it helps to build social capital in the\u000a      co-operative. It does this by linking members between different villages,\u000a      and promoting more regular links between remote villages and the advisor\u000a      at the centre (Ref 5).\u000a    Important advances were also made regarding software development methods\u000a      for ICTD projects. First, Rural e-Services identified the importance of\u000a      sustained relationship building between software providers and beneficiary\u000a      communities as an initial phase of such interventions to enable honest and\u000a      open critiques of software proposals (Refs 1, 2, 3, 4). Second, Rural\u000a      e-Services shows how agile software development methodologies need to be\u000a      adjusted in order to address the needs of rural development. For example,\u000a      whilst agile software development recommends very short development cycles\u000a      delivering new software over periods of a few weeks, in ICTD projects it\u000a      can be important to slow down the iteration cycles to ensure that\u000a      community members have sufficient time to learn and adjust to the latest\u000a      software developments. The project also identified a new team structure\u000a      for developing technology in ICTD projects by promoting a tight\u000a      collaboration between a local development project manager who focuses\u000a      primarily on the organisational change in the community, whilst having a\u000a      good understanding of technical possibilities, and software developers who\u000a      must have some awareness of the community situation, but should remain\u000a      technically focused. These findings and their implications are reported in\u000a      detail in Refs 5 and 6.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"4985","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The social impacts of the research were primarily related to how the\u000a      research prompted positive change within Wakefield prison and more widely\u000a      within the Prison Estate of England and Wales (Sources 1, 2, 3 and Ref 3).\u000a      The report for Grant 1 (Ref 3) pointed to areas where prison practices\u000a      were in need of improvement and the prison management was keen to address\u000a      these issues and work with the research team. They collaborated with the\u000a      research team in a successful ESRC research application (Grant 2). This\u000a      grant enabled issues highlighted during Grant 1 to be addressed through a\u000a      series of interactive workshops with staff and prisoners. The local\u000a      impacts of these grants derive from highlighting the inadequacy of\u000a      categorising and responding to prisoners on the basis of only one strand\u000a      of identity (e.g. ethnicity or faith; age or sexuality) (Source 3). This\u000a      was most marked in the prisoner workshop where prisoners explored their\u000a      own intersecting identities and considered the implications of this for\u000a      how they would work with prisoners in the future. The workshop helped the\u000a      prison move to a unitary\/amalgamated system of prisoner reps.\u000a    The Governor states:\u000a    `The workshop enabled the reps to explore how [the amalgamated system\u000a        of prisoner reps] might be achieved and develop their understanding of\u000a        other areas of diversity. Following the workshops a new training package\u000a        was developed to assist prisoner reps in this important work.'\u000a      (Source 3)\u000a    Linked to this was, initially, a local change in how the prison chose to\u000a      report `incidents' triggered by diversity-minority identities. Prior to\u000a      the research the prison only officially recorded `racial incidents'.\u000a      Following recommendations arising from Grants 1 and 2 the reporting form\u000a      was redesigned to reflect all aspects of diversity and was known as the\u000a      `Diversity Incident Reporting Form' (DIRF).\u000a    At a national level, impacts have occurred with regard to policies,\u000a      procedures and practices (Source 1 and Source 3). The Head of NOMS\u000a      Equalities Unit (HoEqu), a member of the initial project's advisory\u000a      committee, states that the on-going work associated with Grant 1 and the\u000a      resulting reports have influenced the Equalities Unit in shaping the new\u000a      national `Equalities Framework' (PSI 32\/2011) (Source 1). Research\u000a      findings have also underpinned NOMS' decision to commission good practice\u000a      guidance for prisoner equalities' representatives and to develop a\u000a      national training package in relation to diversity related issues (Source\u000a      1). The diversity incident reporting form (DIRF) developed at Wakefield\u000a      was introduced into all prisons in England and Wales (Source 1). This\u000a      change was implemented in January 2011 (subsequent visits to HMP Wakefield\u000a      have confirmed that implementation has taken place) (Source 1).\u000a      Additionally, research findings from Grants 1 and 2 highlight much\u000a      uncertainty in relation to transgender prisoners, with the issue of\u000a      searching prisoners being seen as particularly sensitive.\u000a    Following our research, the HoEq notes,\u000a    `A final example [of impact] is the request for guidance in relation\u000a        to the treatment, including searching, of transgender prisoners. Revised\u000a        national policy on the searching of trans prisoners has been issued, and\u000a        a draft of a Prison Service Instruction on the care and management of\u000a        trans prisoners produced as part of the equalities policy framework.'\u000a      (Source 1).\u000a    Additionally the Lead National Trainer in relation to transgender issues\u000a      has acknowledged the impact of the workshops (Source 2). Furthermore, HoEq\u000a      (Source 1) notes that the research helped him to re-think how his Unit\u000a      supports individual prisons in relation to diversity related issues. In\u000a      particular, Ref 3 highlights how prisoners distrust official means of\u000a      resolving problems (e.g. the complaints system and the racial incident\u000a      reporting system) and prefer to work with their `reps' to resolve issues\u000a      informally. Prison staff also pointed to the very positive role that\u000a      prisoner `reps' had in informally resolving issues.\u000a    In the light of this HoEq notes how the research developed:\u000a    `our growing sense of the importance of face-to-face interactions\u000a        between staff and prisoners in ensuring fairness in prisons. This ...\u000a        contributed to our decision to develop a project to introduce structured\u000a        communications techniques in the prison setting, which we are piloting\u000a        in three prisons ...'(Source 1)\u000a    Finally, in relation to research practice in prisons, research findings\u000a      arising from Grant 1 confirmed that AI was suitable for use in High\u000a      Security settings.\u000a    HoEq notes:\u000a    `Seeing that the researchers were able to take the Wakefield prisoners\u000a        through the discovery, dreaming, designing and destiny phases to\u000a        generate some positive feedback about the prison and to identify some\u000a        practical suggestions as to how things could be made better for them has\u000a        provided helpful impetus to us to find other ways of doing prisoner\u000a        consultation.' (Source 1)\u000a    In 2011 Prof Cowburn (and his Colleague Dr Lavis) were short-listed for\u000a      the Howard League Research Medal for their ESRC-funded research. The\u000a      Howard League for Penal Reform celebrates the work of academics and\u000a      researchers whose work offers genuine new insights into the penal system.\u000a      The award of its Research Medal acknowledges high quality research that\u000a      has succeeded, or can demonstrate that it has the potential, to have an\u000a      impact on non- academic audiences (Source 4).\u000a    The present projects mark a successful beginning to what is a longer term\u000a      endeavour. Grant 1 was a pilot and Grant 2 was a KE project; taken\u000a      together they have had significant applied impact within NOMS,\u000a      particularly within the secure prison estate. In brief the impact can be\u000a      described as humanitarian. The findings of Grant 1 and the learning\u000a      processes embodied in Grant 2 have enabled penal practices with diversity\u000a      minority prisoners to become both more aware and more respectful and thus\u000a      more effective. However, these projects are only a beginning. The ESRC,\u000a      taking into account the impacts of the projects, has now funded a larger\u000a      three years study in three prisons (Grant 3), it is anticipated that this\u000a      work will build on the impacts of the two projects reported here.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This impact case study emanates from two ESRC grants.

Professor Cowburn started\u000a      employment at SHU on 1st September 2008 as a Principal Lecturer\u000a      in Criminology, and he was awarded a personal Chair in Applied Social\u000a      Science in February 2010. He took early retirement in March 2013, but\u000a      assumed the title of `Emeritus Professor of Applied Social Science' on\u000a      retirement. The underpinning research was conducted between March 2009 and\u000a      July 2010 whilst he was in full time employment at the University.\u000a    Two ESRC funded projects are central to the research underpinning this\u000a      case study (Grants 1 and 2). The first study in 2009 (Grant 1) developed\u000a      from Professor Cowburn's work as a member of the Independent Monitoring\u000a      Board (IMB) at Her Majesty's Prison Wakefield, where he became aware of\u000a      staff discontent with official ways of `measuring the quality of prison\u000a      life' because they were considered to lack depth and ignored good work\u000a      within the prison. Grant 1 facilitated a pilot study with two aims: (i) to\u000a      explore positive and negative aspects of prisoners' life in one Wing of\u000a      the prison, using Appreciative Inquiry (AI) methodology; and (ii) to test\u000a      the suitability of AI as a methodology for exploring prisoners' responses\u000a      to policies and practices in relation to diversity. The study had four\u000a      means of data collection: (i) documentary analysis; (ii) AI interviews\u000a      with a sample of prisoners; (iii) an AI informed survey of all the\u000a      prisoners on the pilot Wing; and (iv) two AI informed focus groups with\u000a      prison staff. Professor Cowburn and Dr Lavis contributed equally to this\u000a      collaborative project and both undertook the research, with some\u000a      additional support from a research assistant (Bird, employed at SHU for\u000a      the project duration) under their joint supervision.\u000a    Research insights from this project are theoretical - they found\u000a      AI to be a successful methodology for exploring the experiences of\u000a      prisoners from minority diversity groupings (Ref 1, Source 1). AI reduced\u000a      the suspicions of prison staff and enabled both prisoners and prison staff\u000a      to talk more freely about their experiences (Ref 1, Source 1, Source 2),\u000a      both good and bad, of living and working in prison. Moreover, the project\u000a      highlighted the importance of understanding prison identities (in-mate and\u000a      staff) as intersectional, multi-layered and contingent on both place and\u000a      time (Ref 2, Ref 4, Ref 5). Research insights were also policy-related\u000a\u0009  and practical in that the project identified a range of\u000a      positive and negative practices of prison staff and highlighted policy\u000a      implications for improving life in prison (Ref 3, Source 1, Source 2 and\u000a      Source 3)\u000a    Grant 2 addressed issues highlighted by Grant 1 through four interactive\u000a      workshops with staff and prisoners: (i) the role, tasks and identities of\u000a      the Diversity specialist staff and how they related to the `safer prisons'\u000a      unit (Prison staff); (ii) the nature of identity and the importance of\u000a      intersectional identities in being a prisoner representative (Prisoners);\u000a      (iii) sensitive searching of diversity-minority prisoners (Staff); (iv)\u000a      understanding and managing sexualities and (trans) gendered prisoners\u000a      (Staff).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"5252","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"2328926","Name":"Nigeria"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"290557","Name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"GeoNamesId":"878675","Name":"Zimbabwe"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Strand 1\u000d\u000a      The research work discussed above provided the 10 stage framework of the\u000d\u000a      ASK online tool.

The research\u000d\u000a      was thus a direct response to a cultural need. The first story was the\u000d\u000a      withdrawal of a video designed to combat what was widely perceived as a\u000d\u000a      rise in homophobia among football fans. The Professional Players' Union\u000d\u000a      (PFA) had indicated it would cooperate with the Football Association in\u000d\u000a      promoting the video, but later, for reasons which remain opaque, decided\u000d\u000a      against this. In several stories reporting the incident, the PFA's Chief\u000d\u000a      Executive suggested he did not feel the timing of the campaign was right.\u000d\u000a      In a related media story, the publicist Max Clifford announced that some\u000d\u000a      of his clients who were professional footballers had declared to him that\u000d\u000a      they were gay. He advised them not to disclose their sexual preferences\u000d\u000a      for fear of an adverse reaction. In a widely quoted remark, Clifford\u000d\u000a      submitted his thoughts on football as \"stuck in the dark ages,\" the\u000d\u000a      implication being that the culture of the sport was not prepared for\u000d\u000a      openly gay players. Clifford's detrimental assertions were not challenged;\u000d\u000a      indeed there was tacit agreement with his contentions. In the event, the\u000d\u000a      research exposed these kinds of assumption as erroneous, with serious\u000d\u000a      implications for the lives and well-being of players.\u000d\u000a    The difficulty of testing football fans' attitudes was forbidding.\u000d\u000a      Conventional research methods would not yield reliable data. The\u000d\u000a      researchers - Ellis Cashmore and Jamie Cleland [now working at\u000d\u000a      Loughborough University] - decided to use an innovative method: setting up\u000d\u000a      a web-based domain that incorporated a questionnaire, replete with\u000d\u000a      hyperlinks to pertinent stories and space for narrative accounts. Hence\u000d\u000a      the objective was to elicit qualitative data from an online research\u000d\u000a      instrument, which bore the URL: www.topfan.co.uk.\u000d\u000a      While online research had been conducted before, few if any had pursued\u000d\u000a      qualitative material. Hence there was an experimental element to the\u000d\u000a      research methods. To this end, the questionnaires contained embedded links\u000d\u000a      that took users to sites where they could read, ponder and ruminate on\u000d\u000a      issues related to the subject area. This was not interactive in the\u000d\u000a      conventional sense, but had the effect of triangulating the process i.e.\u000d\u000a      between subject\/participant, researcher and free-standing narrative.\u000d\u000a      Topfan elicited several thousand responses, ensuring an excellent\u000d\u000a      sampling, and is still running.\u000d\u000a    The research directly led to two publications, both in academic,\u000d\u000a      peer-reviewed journals, one American, the other British. The peer\u000d\u000a      reviewers' comments were obviously supportive of both the finding and the\u000d\u000a      methods employed.\u000d\u000a    Additionally, the same platform has been used for successive research\u000d\u000a      projects. In particular, another sport-related project on attitudes\u000d\u000a      towards race in football management - and thus an exploration of the\u000d\u000a      reasons for the paucity of black managers in British football - elicited\u000d\u000a      sufficient interesting material to warrant another article published in an\u000d\u000a      academic journal, Ethnic and Racial Studies. While black people\u000d\u000a      are over-represented (by proportion of population) among players, they\u000d\u000a      rarely make a successful transition to coaching and especially to\u000d\u000a      management.

Presenting at Treadwell's is by\u000d\u000a      invitation and entry to each lecture costs the public between &#163;7-15. There\u000d\u000a      were 50 places at each of MacCormack's talks, all of which sold out. These\u000d\u000a      people came from many areas of public life. They included artists, medical\u000d\u000a      and legal professionals, public workers, and students of various\u000d\u000a      disciplines. MacCormack's talks increased their understanding of the\u000d\u000a      ethical relation between art and experience as it translates to mediation\u000d\u000a      between different subjects. In her talks on cinema, occultism and the\u000d\u000a      esoteric, MacCormack drew attention to a neglected strand through the lens\u000d\u000a      of feminism, focusing on sexuality and the social demonization of\u000d\u000a      alterity, and thus addressing issues of social inclusion and cohesion.\u000d\u000a    In addition to the lecture series, MacCormack also spoke about her\u000d\u000a      research at a range of public festivals.

Research for this was\u000d\u000a      conducted at Anglia Ruskin, where MacCormack has been employed since 2001,\u000d\u000a      first as a lecturer, then a senior lecturer, and now as Reader. The\u000d\u000a      research began with a series of articles (see Section 3) initiated in 2006\u000d\u000a      that sought to deal with issues of spectatorship differently via\u000d\u000a      Continental Philosophy, feminism and queer theory in order to study the\u000d\u000a      impact of cinema on the constitution of alternate identities. Through this\u000d\u000a      goal, the ethical impact of how images are received, and how this\u000d\u000a      reception can extend to a more ethical operation of social inclusion for\u000d\u000a      different subject positions through art, was analysed. Two articles cited\u000d\u000a      in Section 3 were adapted and in 2007-8 the rest of the monograph was\u000d\u000a      completed, before it was published in 2008. It was funded by a prestigious\u000d\u000a      AHRC Research Leave Award (&#163;23,000). Key findings included the following:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      How we watch, rather than what we watch, is capable of constituting an\u000d\u000a        openness to difference, which translates to openness to other subjects,\u000d\u000a        that can affect social policy;\u000d\u000a      Art, while occupying a fictive space, is real in its capacity to alter\u000d\u000a        ideologies and actions in the social sphere;\u000d\u000a      The relationship between desire and the cinematic image - what\u000d\u000a        MacCormack terms `cinesexuality' - allows spectators to contemplate the\u000d\u000a        ways they watch in an ethical operation of self-reflection, thus making\u000d\u000a        them accountable active viewers rather than passive spectators.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Through eight chapters (85,000 words) various issues that extended beyond\u000d\u000a      cinema studies were also challenged. These included:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The connectivity between cinema and all art, beyond the discretion of\u000d\u000a        medium;\u000d\u000a      The redundancy of genre;\u000d\u000a      Challenges to concepts of `perversion' and `normativity' in reference\u000d\u000a        to desire and its relationship with identity through what can be\u000d\u000a        considered examples of `extreme' perversion;\u000d\u000a      The necessity of feminism, queer theory and other philosophies of\u000d\u000a        alterity as they can be translated into daily life beyond both\u000d\u000a        spectatorship and academics.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    MacCormack's book is highly regarded. Catherine Grant chose Cinesexuality\u000d\u000a      as academic book of the week in The Times Higher Education (18 Dec\u000d\u000a      2008), calling it an `ambitious and avowedly experimental work on film\u000d\u000a      spectatorship ... in which meanings of gender, sexuality, propriety and\u000d\u000a      subjectivity are problematised'.\u000d\u000a    Joanna McIntyre in M\/C Reviews said: `It is easy to foresee the\u000d\u000a      importance of this book as a defining text. Scholars of film, feminism,\u000d\u000a      queer theory, post-structuralist theory and philosophy will no doubt tease\u000d\u000a      out the complexities of MacCormack's work throughout the coming years to\u000d\u000a      discover multiple applications and possible expansions'.\u000d\u000a      (http:\/\/reviews.media-culture.org.au\/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=3411).\u000d\u000a    Cinesexuality has formed the basis of journal articles, such as\u000d\u000a      Tim Huntley's `Abstraction is Ethical: The Ecstatic and Erotic in Patricia\u000d\u000a      MacCormack's Cinesexuality' (Irish Journal of Gothic and Horror\u000d\u000a        Studies, Issue 8, June 2010).\u000d\u000a    In Anglia Ruskin's External Assessment Exercise in 2012, the External\u000d\u000a      Assessor gave the book a 4* rating.

The\u000a      impacts have a range of implications for individuals, their organizations\u000a      and professional bodies.\u000a    The project co-constructed new understanding and practices that effected\u000a      changes in self- understanding beneficial to individuals and the practice\u000a      community. It facilitated emergent meanings and discourses that began to\u000a      generate new ways of thinking about their work. These changes were\u000a      reported instantaneously by some practitioners in response to the initial\u000a      semi- structured qualitative interviews\/focus groups and captured\u000a      subsequently in email correspondence and follow-up interventions. Impacts\u000a      included reflexive understandings of occupational roles and feedback\u000a      received emphasised that practitioners found interviews and focus groups\u000a      to be `therapeutic', `thoroughly stimulating', and `what the professional\u000a      bodies should be doing'. It appeared that the research process allowed\u000a      practitioners to share frustrations, the peaks and troughs of their\u000a      emotional labour (Yeomans, 2007) and to raise questions about the nature\u000a      of professional roles and professional bodies.\u000a    Project design took place in January 2013 with preparatory informal\u000a      discussions and interviews in February, March and April. A researcher\u000a      began work in June and interventions and impacts gathered and assessed\u000a      throughout the project on an iterative basis (up to five face-to-face\u000a      meetings with each volunteer over the course of the project).\u000a      Dissemination to the practitioner community took place from November\u000a      onwards (including Thought Leadership article in International PR\u000a      Association Journal; presentations to professional bodies). A working\u000a      paper that reviewed the pilot study and impacts was submitted to Synthesis\u000a      (the working paper series for the Media, Communications and Performing\u000a      Arts Division), uploaded in December 2013 and made available through the\u000a      institutional e-repository.\u000a    Strategies and processes to enable impact\u000a      The project investigated practitioner understandings of knowledge in\u000a      practice specifically in relation to processes of evaluation and the\u000a      conceptualization of value. Biographical data provided insights into\u000a      career trajectories and progression, personal development opportunities\u000a      and promotion and conceptualizations of senior status within the\u000a      occupation. Understanding the attitudes, behaviours and specific practices\u000a      of PR practitioners in relation to research-based practice, including the\u000a      evaluation of PR impacts, was important. The project involved liaison with\u000a      professional bodies, such as the Chartered Institute of PR (CIPR) and the\u000a      PR Consultants' Association (PRCA) in Scotland and the use of CIPR\u000a      databases within Scotland. CIPR publicised the study and helped to recruit\u000a      participants, incentivising this by offering CPD points for participation\u000a      in all stages.\u000a    The investigation sought to delineate how practitioners understand the\u000a      connection between certain types of knowledge and expertise in relation to\u000a      their linguistic and symbolic work and its societal impacts. The ways in\u000a      which practitioners translate knowledge capital into discourse and\u000a      influence was explored and the implications of this for professional\u000a      standing and society more widely was taken into consideration.\u000a      Relationships among practitioners, specifically the nature of the\u000a      community of practice and ideas about professionalism,\u000a      professionalisation, the role of professional bodies and the notion of\u000a      professional practice, were examined. Taking into consideration responses\u000a      from initial informal conversations and more formal interviews and focus\u000a      groups, the project made further critical interventions in the population\u000a      with a small study sample, offering free choices about the form of\u000a      intervention. These included personal journals, prescribed reading around\u000a      identified issues, analytical exercises, and in all cases, reflective\u000a      discussion. The overwhelming preference was for one-to-one follow-up\u000a      tailored to needs identified by practitioners but contextualised\u000a      conceptually by the research team to include key areas such as evaluation,\u000a      creativity, and reflexive and critical thinking.\u000a    This case contributed self-understanding and insights that could\u000a      influence future practice among creative service providers\u000a      (PR\/communications practitioners), professional bodies and clients. In\u000a      addition to reported individual interventions and the proactive interest\u000a      of professional organisations it is expected that there will be\u000a      longer-term impact as researchers and participants collaborate within\u000a      professional networks to facilitate critical analysis and occupational\u000a      change.\u000a    The evidence is self-reported from individual practitioners at a personal\u000a      level in terms of insights and personal impressions and from professional\u000a      bodies in terms of requests for further involvement in the context of\u000a      providing support and discursive contexts for senior practitioners.\u000a      Although the research team questioned the PR concept of `senior\u000a      practitioner' it became clear in the course of the project that this\u000a      cohort lacked concepts and language to articulate their expertise and that\u000a      the published literature had so far failed to capture this or to engage\u000a      practitioners themselves in more conceptual reflection and deeper level\u000a      engagements\/learning. Typically research into practice has focused on\u000a      description of roles or techniques or prescriptive recommendations.

This analysis\u000a      was subsequently extended to investigate accounts of professional work\u000a      presented through a popular genre of a best practice case study\u000a      (2007), identifying the influence of the discourse of professionalism in\u000a      the way in which expert knowledge is understood and fused with\u000a      professional action.\u000a    The recasting of PR practitioners as technologists of discourse (Leitch\u000a      and Motion 1997, Weaver et al 2006), rather then communication managers\u000a      (Grunig 1992; Grunig, Grunig &amp; Dozier, 2002), brought with it a new\u000a      impetus to consider the role and impact of PR practice in terms of how it\u000a      shapes social identities and relations. In this context, understanding of\u000a      the nature of knowledge routinely used in practice, as well as the\u000a      question about the degree of autonomy conferred by professional expertise\u000a      on the PR professional, or conversely, the malleability of PR practice to\u000a      other kinds of knowledge present in institutional contexts where PR work\u000a      is negotiated and delivered, take on a new meaning.\u000a    Research was conducted as part of the study (L'Etang and Powell, 2013)\u000a      and underpinned impact throughout the process. Interventions were\u000a      conducted by L'Etang, Powell and Pieczka.

It was much more about\u000d\u000a      licensing, the business side... that's why at the last meeting we were\u000d\u000a      both at, I thought, I'm doing the education side... we are talking about\u000d\u000a      cultural shift...CAP needs to bring about that kind of change. AlcoLOLs\u000d\u000a      have already started that conversation. [My colleague's project] is in\u000d\u000a      Portobello and Piershill, so a lot of young people would be [from]\u000d\u000a      Portobello and Craigmillar area so being at Portobello [High School] and\u000d\u000a      having done the AlcoLOLs adds to the conversation. I think there is [more\u000d\u000a      need] to build on the dialogue that is already happening in Portobello\u000d\u000a      High [School] .... We work with different schools Castlebrae, Holy Rood,\u000d\u000a      Portobello in the area .... My sense from the education side of things is\u000d\u000a      that young people in Portobello seem to have more openness to speaking\u000d\u000a      about attitudes towards alcohol. They've got a broader understanding of\u000d\u000a      the social control, influences and impact of alcohol use and that to me is\u000d\u000a      quite different comparing to, for example to Castlebrae. The pupils there\u000d\u000a      don't have the same level of awareness, I would say. ... In Portobello,\u000d\u000a      especially the older year groups, I work with them and they seem to have a\u000d\u000a      very open attitude towards alcohol. It's not to say that they are\u000d\u000a      necessarily not drinking or ...but they seem to be more informed in making\u000d\u000a      choices about alcohol use.... That they can articulate...it could be\u000d\u000a      because the school is very supportive but just the way they were talking\u000d\u000a      about it is very similar to the principles of AlcoLOLs, I would say based\u000d\u000a      on watching [your video at the event]. Some of the young people that were\u000d\u000a      at that event I met them later at schools and they were able to articulate\u000d\u000a      within the group. So in some way I think that directly contributed to\u000d\u000a      giving them confidence in speaking about alcohol.\"\u000d\u000a    Impact on Health\u000d\u000a    Dr Alastair MacGilchrist, Consultant Gastroenterologist\/Hepatologist, NHS\u000d\u000a      Lothian:\u000d\u000a    \"I am a liver specialist, working every day with patients whose health\u000d\u000a      and lives are being blighted by the adverse consequences of drinking too\u000d\u000a      much alcohol. Despite many public health campaigns regarding the dangers\u000d\u000a      of alcohol, the problem has continued to increase until liver disease is\u000d\u000a      now the second commonest cause of death amongst adults of working age. It\u000d\u000a      is striking, and alarming, how many young patients I now see with this\u000d\u000a      problem. The ineffectiveness of previous public health campaigns is this\u000d\u000a      area may be due to the \"top down\" approach to education. I was therefore\u000d\u000a      greatly impressed and encouraged by the AlcoLOLs film which takes an\u000d\u000a      entirely fresh approach with the emphasis on peer-to-peer education and\u000d\u000a      support. It appears to be strikingly successful and has been rolled out\u000d\u000a      from the original to five further local schools. As well as viewing the\u000d\u000a      original film, I have contributed to group sessions where the youngsters\u000d\u000a      are being trained to inform, help and support their fellow schoolchildren.\u000d\u000a      Again, I was most impressed with the vigour and enthusiasm of both the\u000d\u000a      leaders and the participants, and have genuine hopes that this approach\u000d\u000a      could herald a breakthrough in this crucial area. Therefore, I fully\u000d\u000a      support this application to remake the film to make it suitable for a\u000d\u000a      wider audience as I am convinced that there is merit in pursuing this\u000d\u000a      schoolchildren-directed approach to reducing alcohol harm in young\u000d\u000a      people\". \u000d\u000a    ","Title":"\u000d\u000a    Peer learning through dialogue: young people and alcohol\u000d\u000a    ","UKLocation":[{"GeoNamesId":"2650225","Name":"Edinburgh"}],"UKRegion":[{"GeoNamesId":"2638360","Name":"Scotland"}],"UOA":"Communication, Cultural and Media Studies, Library and Information Management ","UnderpinningResearch":"\u000d\u000a    The project responded to the need identified by the Scottish Government\u000d\u000a      following its establishment of the Scottish Youth Commission on Alcohol\u000d\u000a      (SYCA), a 12-month project set up to enable young people to conduct their\u000d\u000a      own inquiry into the social problem of alcohol in Scotland. The\u000d\u000a      Commission, which reported in March 2010, articulated the need to promote\u000d\u000a      and evaluate peer education approaches and the desirability of young\u000d\u000a      people acting as `co-designers of alcohol and education packages'. This\u000d\u000a      project addressed these recommendations and, in the process, effected\u000d\u000a      personal change and influenced policy perspectives.\u000d\u000a    The project drew on theories of dialogue and deliberative democracy which\u000d\u000a      combined a strong stance on the ethics and role of social communication\u000d\u000a      with extensive empirical insights, particularly in the fields of community\u000d\u000a      development and public policy. The key themes in the literature can be\u000d\u000a      seen as addressing the problem of social capital and governance, the\u000d\u000a      nature of social relationships constituted through communication\u000d\u000a      practices, the question of the relationship between knowledge, action and\u000d\u000a      policy (Habermas, 1987; Putnam, 2000; Fischer, 2009; Gastil, 2008;\u000d\u000a      Anderson et al, 2004). The project focused in particular on the extensive\u000d\u000a      argument about the transformative power of dialogic communication (Gastil\u000d\u000a      and Levine, 2005) ascribed to its ability to build common ground (if not\u000d\u000a      always consensus) while at the same time acknowledging difference as\u000d\u000a      legitimate and an enriching feature of social life.\u000d\u000a    The project adopted the methodological approach of action research to\u000d\u000a      help young people to change their practices of learning about alcohol\u000d\u000a      (focusing on three types of knowledge: reflective, relational and\u000d\u000a      practical) through a peer-led collaborative approach. The intervention was\u000d\u000a      designed to create learning and self-reflection, and was carried out\u000d\u000a      through pupil-led dialogue groups in a two-meeting programme working with\u000d\u000a      diverse groups of pupils. The programme was supported by a custom-made\u000d\u000a      education film (meeting 1) that led to modelling of constructive\u000d\u000a      behaviours, including communication behaviours and through a game designed\u000d\u000a      for this purpose by the original group of volunteers (meeting 2). The\u000d\u000a      project delivered relevant outcomes at individual and group levels and\u000d\u000a      influenced the ways in which policy-makers and health communicators think\u000d\u000a      about how young people approach the issue of alcohol.\u000d\u000a    The case study, built on critical research on dialogue and its\u000d\u000a      application in a range of applied and policy contexts, was conducted by\u000d\u000a      Magda Pieczka, Emma Wood and Oliver Escobar at the Queen Margaret\u000d\u000a      University Centre for Dialogue and disseminated among a range of\u000d\u000a      practitioner and academic audiences through conference presentations and\u000d\u000a      scholarly outputs, for example Pieczka, Wood &amp; Escobar (2010), Escobar\u000d\u000a      (2010), (Pieczka &amp; Wood (2013) (see References to Research).

The AlcoLOLs project received &#163;58K funding from the Robertson\u000d\u000a      Trust (Scottish independent grant-making body) in October 2012 to fund\u000d\u000a      fully the first year of a three-year project to extend the project to five\u000d\u000a      high schools in North East Edinburgh, in areas of the highest levels of\u000d\u000a      social deprivation in the city (Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation,\u000d\u000a      2012). The project will involve approximately 500 teenagers by December\u000d\u000a      2013 and 3500 teenagers by December 2015.

Changed the practices of web designer research participants,\u000d\u000a        enabling them to enhance the ID accessibility of the websites they build\u000d\u000a    Web designer research participants took a number of actions to change\u000d\u000a      their web design practices and include web users with ID amongst their\u000d\u000a      audiences as a direct result of the research. Participants reported\u000d\u000a      using recommended ID accessibility techniques to improve the ID\u000d\u000a      accessibility of their websites, including:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      changing the way they use imagery, so it is more relevant to and\u000d\u000a        supportive of text;\u000d\u000a      using large fonts to enhance readability of text;\u000d\u000a      using simple text, or encouraging copy writers to do so, to enhance\u000d\u000a        readability of text;\u000d\u000a      beginning user testing at the start of a web design project;\u000d\u000a      building both rich media and plain text versions of webpages, to cater\u000d\u000a        for the accessibility needs of diverse populations of users;\u000d\u000a      re-visiting and improving previously built websites to enhance their\u000d\u000a        ID accessibility by implementing some of the techniques listed in the\u000d\u000a        above bullet points;\u000d\u000a      limiting choice on each page [2].\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    One said \"I can confirm that my practice was changed by the experiences I\u000d\u000a      had at the INMD workshop.

Facilitated INMD web designer participants to undertake ID-targeted\u000d\u000a        web design\u000d\u000a    An unintended but welcome impact of Kennedy's research was that\u000d\u000a      participants went on to design websites targeted specifically at web users\u000d\u000a      with ID, putting into practice the research findings relating to the web\u000d\u000a      accessibility needs of this group of web users. Three participants\u000d\u000a      contributed voluntarily to the production of the INMD website, designed\u000d\u000a      specifically with the accessibility needs of ID web users in mind, whilst\u000d\u000a      others developed prototype sites targeted at ID web users, such as a\u000d\u000a      website for the charity 1A Arts, a centre in London supporting local\u000d\u000a      children, young people and adults with ID. As further examples, the\u000d\u000a      following projects were developed with The Rix Centre, a charitable\u000d\u000a      organisation committed to exploring the benefits of new media for people\u000d\u000a      with ID [3]:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      ClickStart: template for people with ID to make their own websites, in\u000d\u000a        use by 10 London Boroughs and 240 trainee web information providers with\u000d\u000a        and without disabilities (www.clickstart.org.uk).\u000d\u000a      In-Folio: e-portfolio application for people with ID to record\u000d\u000a        material about their lives and experiences.

Creative industry\u000d\u000a      professionals were effectively engaged in co-development of inclusive\u000d\u000a      design best practice on INMD and have genuinely embedded this knowledge in\u000d\u000a      practical ways that have direct impact for people with disabilities across\u000d\u000a      the UK\" [3] (Director, The Rix Centre).\u000d\u000a    4. Shared ID web accessibility expertise with other relevant\u000d\u000a        organisations\u000d\u000a    In addition to facilitating web designer research participants to work\u000d\u000a      with the national charity, The Rix Centre, the research also positioned Kennedy\u000d\u000a      and INMD collaborators as experts in this field. Kennedy has acted\u000d\u000a      as a consultant and shared the research findings with charities dedicated\u000d\u000a      to improving the lives of people with ID, such as People In Action\u000d\u000a      and CHANGE.\u000d\u000a    \"The expertise [...] shared with us around the development of websites\u000d\u000a      that are accessible for people with learning disabilities really supported\u000d\u000a      CHANGE to create a website that is more accessible to and\u000d\u000a      representative of our volunteers and staff who have learning disabilities.\u000d\u000a      You have supported us to develop a great platform for making the wider\u000d\u000a      community and other organisations more aware of the access needs of people\u000d\u000a      with learning disabilities\" (Accessible Information Manager, CHANGE)\u000d\u000a      [4].\u000d\u000a    The Director of Cognable (an INMD collaborator) reports that INMD\u000d\u000a      directly led to him being asked to join a group of people working on a W3C\u000d\u000a      WAI Application Note (an appendix to its accessibility guidance) relating\u000d\u000a      specifically to the needs of web users with ID and that his \"involvement\u000d\u000a      served to highlight the complex and diverse web accessibility needs of\u000d\u000a      people with cognitive and intellectual disabilities, a knowledge area\u000d\u000a      which had not been well represented in WAI historically.\" Also, \"as a\u000d\u000a      result of INMD, I was invited by the then Minister for Further Education\u000d\u000a      to join a UK government round table discussion on Accessibility of\u000d\u000a      Creative Digital Tools, at which I also promoted the accessibility needs\u000d\u000a      of people with cognitive and intellectual disabilities\" [5].\u000d\u000a    5. Advanced knowledge and good practice within a wider audience,\u000d\u000a        beyond the research project, through a website dedicated to sharing ID\u000d\u000a        accessibility techniques\u000d\u000a    The website www.inclusivenewmedia.org\u000d\u000a      was developed to share research findings, to advance knowledge and good\u000d\u000a      practice and to communicate ID web accessibility techniques. It offers\u000d\u000a      comprehensive resources, including materials adapted from the research\u000d\u000a      findings and workshops and was developed in collaboration with the BBC's\u000d\u000a      Usability and Access Team. Eleven members of this team beta-tested the\u000d\u000a      website, which raised awareness and advanced knowledge of ID accessibility\u000d\u000a      issues amongst a team responsible for ensuring BBC services are usable by\u000d\u000a      all users, including those with disabilities. A survey of BBC\u000d\u000a      representatives following INMD revealed support for the research in\u000d\u000a      improving ID web accessibility: \"Overall, an excellent summary of issues\u000d\u000a      of ID and great advice on how to improve sites to take into account those\u000d\u000a      who suffer from ID\" (BBC Information Architect\/Usability Consultant) [6].\u000d\u000a    As further evidence that the research has engaged a wide audience, the\u000d\u000a      INMD website received 250,000 hits within six months of its launch in\u000d\u000a      November 2009 and more than 200,000 hits in the following year. Its\u000d\u000a      significance was noted by Eric Meyer, a widely-followed and prominent\u000d\u000a      world-leading web developer in October 2009, who commented that the work\u000d\u000a      is \"important, and the more insights you can give us, the better\" [7].\u000d\u000a      The website continues to serve as an ID accessibility resource,\u000d\u000a      consistently receiving 10,000 page hits per month. As further examples of\u000d\u000a      engagement, Clearhelper, a US website sharing best practices of\u000d\u000a      accessibility for people with ID, shared the research findings [8],\u000d\u000a      and in March 2013, on SLD-forum, a Department for Education forum for\u000d\u000a      professionals working with people with ID, INMD was praised, in particular\u000d\u000a      the site's top tips [9].\u000d\u000a    6. Raised the confidence of people with ID\u000d\u000a    A final impact of the INMD project was to raise confidence amongst people\u000d\u000a      with ID. Twenty-nine people with ID took part in the research project as\u000d\u000a      website testers. Ellingham Employment Services, through which they were\u000d\u000a      recruited, confirmed that: \"participation in this project proved\u000d\u000a      beneficial to our service users, in terms of increasing their confidence,\u000d\u000a      self esteem and understanding of the work place. [...] This was helpful in\u000d\u000a      building the participants' understanding of their own accessibility issues\u000d\u000a      and encouraging them to consider support needs. [...] I have no doubt that\u000d\u000a      participation in the INMD project was extremely helpful for all the\u000d\u000a      service users who were involved, both in terms of personal development and\u000d\u000a      consolidating understanding\" [10].\u000d\u000a    Therefore, although Kennedy's research did not include\u000d\u000a      longitudinal strategies to identify whether people with ID find the\u000d\u000a      websites that INMD participants make now more accessible than\u000d\u000a      those they made prior to INMD participation, this end user group\u000d\u000a      benefited from the research. By concentrating on equipping professionals\u000d\u000a      and relevant organisations with the tools to improve the design of\u000d\u000a      websites, encouraging them to make the web more ID accessible, Kennedy's\u000a      research advanced knowledge and good practice amongst web designers to\u000d\u000a      include people with ID in the WWW.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Kennedy's research advanced knowledge and good practice amongst web\u000d\u000a      designers to enable them to include people with intellectual disabilities\u000d\u000a      (ID) amongst their website audiences and thus improve web accessibility\u000d\u000a      for this user group.

Therefore Kennedy secured a grant [G1] to examine\u000d\u000a      ways to ensure the WWW is accessible to all, with a specific focus on\u000d\u000a      people with ID.\u000d\u000a    The research project, Inclusive New Media Design (INMD), was based on the\u000d\u000a      premise that influencing web designers, as the service providers, would\u000d\u000a      make the web more accessible for web users with ID. It explored the best\u000d\u000a      ways of encouraging web designers to include people with ID amongst their\u000d\u000a      website audiences by examining: the place of existing web accessibility\u000d\u000a      guidelines in the practices of web designers; the factors that affect the\u000d\u000a      take up of accessibility guidance; the effectiveness of existing guidance\u000d\u000a      as a way of achieving accessible design; and the effectiveness of other\u000d\u000a      approaches to encouraging ID accessibility [E].\u000d\u000a    Working with Siobhan Thomas (then of University of East London; now of\u000d\u000a      London Southbank University) and Simon Evans (of Cognable, accessibility\u000d\u000a      research and development consultancy), Kennedy led this AHRC\/EPSRC\u000d\u000a      Designing for the 21st Century funded project from May 2007 to\u000d\u000a      August 2009. Research preparation took place while Kennedy was at\u000d\u000a      the University of East London (May 2007 &#8212; Jan 2008). The empirical\u000d\u000a      research (Feb &#8212; Nov 2008) and subsequent analysis and dissemination (Dec\u000d\u000a      2008 &#8212; Aug 2009) were led by Kennedy from the University of Leeds.\u000d\u000a    Thirty-one web designers participated in the research and attended nine\u000d\u000a      ID accessibility training workshops. The types of websites which they\u000d\u000a      designed were diverse, with participants employed in telecoms, public\u000d\u000a      media companies, education and other public sector organisations, and\u000d\u000a      commercial design agencies; five participants were self-employed. INMD\u000d\u000a      employed twenty-nine people with ID as testers, recruited from Ellingham\u000d\u000a      Employment Services, an organization dedicated to finding employment\u000d\u000a      opportunities for people with learning difficulties, to attend four of the\u000d\u000a      workshops and work as experts in their own web use. They tested a number\u000d\u000a      of websites, some of which were designed by INMD participants. All testers\u000d\u000a      were at the mild end of the ID spectrum, with reasonable functional\u000d\u000a      ability and computer literacy &#8212; such abilities were deemed necessary in\u000d\u000a      order to facilitate web designer participants' communication with them.\u000d\u000a    Kennedy's research identified that existing accessibility guidelines (the\u000d\u000a      Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) of the World Wide Web\u000d\u000a      Consortium's Web Accessibility Initiative (W3C WAI)) do not address the\u000d\u000a      accessibility needs of people with ID [B]. The research identified\u000d\u000a      alternative strategies to enhance ID web accessibility, concluding that:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      there is widespread commitment to web accessibility amongst web\u000d\u000a        designers [A], which constitutes an integral part of their\u000d\u000a        professional practice [C];\u000d\u000a      it is possible for web designers to implement some ID accessibility\u000d\u000a        techniques, including changing the way they use imagery, so it is more\u000d\u000a        relevant to and supportive of text; using large fonts to enhance\u000d\u000a        readability of text; using simple text, or encouraging copy writers to\u000d\u000a        do so, to enhance readability of text; building both rich media and\u000d\u000a        plain text versions of webpages, to cater for the accessibility needs of\u000d\u000a        diverse population users [F];\u000d\u000a      opinions diverged regarding whether it was more effective to regulate\u000d\u000a        web accessibility or leave web designers to self-regulate [D];\u000d\u000a      significant obstacles to ID accessibility exist, most notably other\u000d\u000a        stakeholders and decision- makers in the web design process and the need\u000d\u000a        to balance the accessibility requirements of people with ID with the\u000d\u000a        needs of other web users [B].\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a      The research (specifically the literature review and dialogues with web\u000d\u000a        users with ID) concluded that these actions would improve web\u000d\u000a        accessibility for people with ID [F]:\u000d\u000a     \u000d\u000a develop an online resource about ID accessibility;\u000d\u000a      include ID specific guidance within existing accessibility guidelines;\u000d\u000a      engage with ID web users in the design process;\u000d\u000a      develop research with people at the profound end of the ID spectrum;\u000d\u000a      engage with a diverse range of stakeholders.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6400","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aImpact on BBC's archive strategy and approach to public engagement.\u000d\u000aPopple's research has informed the BBC Archive's strategy and its approach towards opening up\u000d\u000atheir archives, both in terms of access and engagement, and particularly in terms of exploring the\u000d\u000apotential of the archives as a basis for a public democratic space. The Controller of Archives and\u000d\u000athe Digital Public Space for the BBC confirms this, stating that:\u000d\u000a\"[T]his research has significantly influenced the development of our strategy in relation to our\u000d\u000aapproach to public engagement &#8212; in particular the role of User Contributions to help describe, to\u000d\u000aaugment and responsibly reuse the materials we hold. It has also informed our thinking regarding\u000d\u000aour aspirations for the democratisation of access to our archives in general.\" [A]\u000d\u000aThe research has also informed the subsequent approach and activities of the BBC in their\u000d\u000aattempts to use creatively the archive and further democratise access to its collections. This\u000d\u000aincludes making more content available as an educational resource and also exploring new ways\u000d\u000aof engaging and delivering the service. For example, the development of the Research and\u000d\u000aEducation Space (RES) project (January &#8212; December 2013), a partnership programme between\u000d\u000athe BBC, Jisc and the British Universities Film and Video Council aimed at opening wider archives\u000d\u000afor UK-based teaching and learning, has been attributed to Popple's initial research. The\u000d\u000aController of Archive Development for the BBC, referencing RES, stated that, \"We could never\u000d\u000ahave achieved this level of ambition without the pioneering work of The Miner's Project...we are all\u000d\u000amost grateful for your bold and innovative approach\" [A].\u000d\u000aFurthermore, the research has also helped the BBC address concerns over the need to affirm\u000d\u000arelationships with its audiences and enhance public engagement. In a speech in the Prix Italia\u000d\u000aConference in 2011, the BBC Controller of Archive Development used Popple's research as a\u000d\u000acentral case study and noted that the Miners' Strike participants' contributions were \"illuminating,\u000d\u000aespecially in terms of how they had felt manipulated by some sections of the media. There was\u000d\u000amuch discussion in our focus groups on the whole question of trust and it was agreed that by\u000d\u000amaking archive materials freely available, and acknowledging the issues attached to them, the\u000d\u000aBBC had an opportunity to regain the confidence it had lost in some quarters.\"(Ageh 2011:13) [B].\u000d\u000aIn his supporting testimonial, the Controller added, \"I am convinced that the findings of your work is\u000d\u000ahelping us in relation to building public confidence in the organisation by allowing us to engage in a\u000d\u000amutually beneficial, two-way dialogue with individuals and communities that will, over time, allow\u000d\u000athe people of the UK to feel they have a genuine and trusted relationship with the BBC.\" [A]\u000d\u000aImpact on BBC coverage of the anniversary of strike\u000d\u000aPopple's research also informed and influenced the BBC's coverage of the 25th anniversary year\u000d\u000aof the strike in 2009. Through listing the BBC holdings relating to the strike, the report for the BBC\u000d\u000anotes that the research provided \"a definitive list of what content actually exists and can be re-used\" [2]. The findings, which were always planned to coincide with this significant anniversary,\u000d\u000aalso helped shape the BBC coverage by highlighting a variety of different accounts, which as a\u000d\u000aresult, incorporated a range of perspectives that would otherwise not have been possible. This\u000d\u000aserved to preserve and present cultural heritage in a new light, highlighting previously marginalised\u000d\u000aviewpoints and more generally, influenced the wider understanding of this time in social history.\u000d\u000aThis was noted by the BBC Controller of Archive Development in 2011:\u000d\u000a\"The feedback we've been getting throughout this project has resulted in all of us having a more\u000d\u000arounded and nuanced understanding of the miners' strike than we had previously. The information\u000d\u000aand knowledge that was contained in our footage was very important &#8212; but it has been enriched\u000d\u000aand given extra context by our engagement with the people directly involved in the strike at the\u000d\u000atime. Until we engaged with them, it was just a few cans of film on a shelf in a storeroom. Now,\u000d\u000ait's a living resource.\" (Ageh 2011:17-18) [B].\u000d\u000aBBC Yorkshire also gives testimony to the significance of Popple's research in its coverage. BBC\u000d\u000aSouth Yorkshire's web resources used stories drawn from the project's participants [C], in addition\u000d\u000ato using the Strike Stories films [4], and the Head of BBC Yorkshire stated:\u000d\u000a\"Your case study using BBC archives allowed people to tell their stories and to engage with the\u000d\u000amaterial which has not been seen for many years. The stories have already been used on\u000d\u000atelevision, radio and online and will serve as a reference for future generations. I am convinced we\u000d\u000awould not have heard the stories without your involvement.\" [D]\u000d\u000aImpact on civic society and public engagement\u000d\u000aPopple's research also had additional benefit for the participants of the projects. The Fusion\u000d\u000aproject bought several people together to articulate their feelings of being misrepresented and\u000d\u000aallowed them to address their own relationships, encouraging reconciliation with people and\u000d\u000agroups with very different perspectives on the strike. It increased the participants confidence to\u000d\u000acontribute to public debate and develop their own interests, for example, one participant now leads\u000d\u000athe national campaign for a public enquiry into events at the Battle of Orgreave in June 1984 and\u000d\u000aattributes Popple's research to her ability to develop this campaign and engage with the media [E].\u000d\u000aAnother participant, a striking miner, has also gone on to record his experiences during the strike\u000d\u000afor a book, Digging the Seam, which reflects on the legacy of the dispute and explores cultural\u000d\u000arepresentations of the strike and how music, photography and cinema responded and contributed\u000d\u000ato the strike [F].\u000d\u000aThe research also clearly demonstrated the potential for collaborative design and the genuine\u000d\u000apublic commitment and desire to engage with, and take ownership of, cultural heritage resources.\u000d\u000aTheStrategic Partnerships Executive for BBC Research &amp; Development stated: \"Your project has\u000d\u000aimpacted on the work and approach of BBC Archives in relation to thinking about collaborative\u000d\u000aengagement with BBC audiences and the recognition of the important role they play\" [G].\u000d\u000aFinally, the BBC representative noted in the internal report following the Fusion project that,\u000d\u000a\"The choice of the miners' strike 1984\/5 for this research was an inspired one and came from the\u000d\u000aUniversity of Leeds... few other events had such an impact on social and political lives. [....]\u000d\u000aThrough this research we can begin to understand what is important to communities about how\u000d\u000athey are represented in the archives. We can also start to understand the passions and sense of\u000d\u000aownership the BBC audience has when engaging with what is essentially their archive.\" [H]\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aResearch by Popple has focused on the potential for public collaboration and democratic\u000d\u000aengagement with digital archives.

Using the BBC archives as a major case\u000d\u000astudy, he examines ownership of cultural heritage resources and how institutions, by opening up\u000d\u000adigital archives in terms of access and engagement can develop democratic public spaces [1].\u000d\u000aThe BBC has one of the largest broadcast archives in the world, with over 12 million items\u000d\u000aincluding documents, television and radio broadcasts, photographs and online content, and the\u000d\u000acollection of the BBC's broadcasting history is in the process of being digitised. Popple's research\u000d\u000afocuses on how the BBC can best present its archive as part of its public value remit, which has\u000d\u000araised key questions about institutional ownership of the materials and how the BBC can affirm its\u000d\u000arelationships with the public. At the Edinburgh International Television Festival in 2003, Greg Dyke,\u000d\u000aas BBC Director General, spoke about the BBC Archive and said that \"the people of Britain have\u000d\u000apaid for it and our role should be to help them use it.\" [1].\u000d\u000aPopple's research interests have led to joint initiatives with the BBC to explore the potential of the\u000d\u000aBBC's archives, and particularly as a democratic public space. The research has developed\u000d\u000amodels through which audiences can access and engage with the archive and begin to use it as a\u000d\u000acreative resource. Three key projects outline this research:\u000d\u000aThe Open Archive Project (September 2007-August 2008), funded by a grant from the AHRC\/BBC\u000d\u000aKnowledge Exchange Partnership [RG1], saw Popple investigating how the BBC might use its\u000d\u000aarchive holdings via an `Open Archive'. Designed to understand the relationships that audiences\u000d\u000amight have with the archive, the project examined historical representations and how the BBC\u000d\u000acould digitally facilitate audiences' ability to interact with, comment on and contextualise the\u000d\u000amaterials. Significantly, the research focused on how the BBC deals with its regional audience,\u000d\u000ademonstrating how regional, rather than national news and historical agendas, may by prioritised\u000d\u000ato provide audiences with material that could be used to construct and make sense of their own\u000d\u000ahistories and memories of important or sensitive events.\u000d\u000aAs part of the research, Popple produced a report, jointly with a BBC link partner, Heather Powell,\u000d\u000awho managed access to BBC staff and resources, aimed at advising future policy of the BBC [2].\u000d\u000aSuggesting the best ways of democratising and enriching public use of the archives, it advocated\u000d\u000aadding the perspectives of citizens to existing broadcast records and the promotion of collaborative\u000d\u000aactivities beyond blog comments and tagging, to open digital storytelling and the development of\u000d\u000auser generated content (UGC).\u000d\u000aThe project focused on the major historical event of the Miners' Strike (1984-85); the BBC provided\u000d\u000aextensive coverage of the strike, which was seen as controversial and attracted great criticism from\u000d\u000avarious sides in the dispute, and so the project enabled Popple to bring together groups directly\u000d\u000ainvolved or affected by the strike to explore how the event has been represented in the BBC\u000d\u000aArchive. Participants included former miners, retired police officers, women's groups, local history\u000d\u000agroups and political activities, who were tasked with responding to the content of the BBC archive,\u000d\u000are-examining the coverage and challenging the `official' version of events. The research also listed\u000d\u000aBBC holdings relating to the strike as a resource for the BBC [2].\u000d\u000aThe wish to translate these findings into tangible impact formed the basis of a subsequent project,\u000d\u000aFusion (February 2009 - June 2009), also funded by the AHRC\/BBC Knowledge Exchange\u000d\u000aPartnership [RG2]. It aimed to facilitate a redressing of misrepresentations and the contestation of\u000d\u000aeditorial decisions, allowing for the enrichment of archival content through fuller contextualisation.\u000d\u000aThe research explored how communities might take ownership of cultural and historical materials\u000d\u000ain which they are represented, and how they could use archival sources to give voice to their own\u000d\u000astories and construct their own histories [3]. The research resulted in the joint creation of a series\u000d\u000aof films, under the title \"Strike Stories\" that told participants' own stories and offered new\u000d\u000aperspectives. [4]. Popple further explored the findings of the Open Archive Project and Fusion in\u000d\u000a[5], examining the BBC's attempt to democratise their archives.\u000d\u000aThe third project builds upon this research by drawing on aspirations expressed by the participants\u000d\u000afor a stronger partnership based approach to the building of community history and heritage. A pre-project in 2012 (a Creative Technology Lab) initially modelled an online resource called Pararchive\u000d\u000athat allowed the public to use online archives as a means of digital storytelling, to enable\u000d\u000acommunity research and develop creative and democratic engagement. Popple subsequently\u000d\u000asecured funding from the AHRC in August 2013 [RG3] to conduct further research into the design\u000d\u000aand creation of open digital archival resources to examine how communities and cultural heritage\u000d\u000aorganisations can co-create, design and build a genuine open community digital space. The\u000d\u000aPararchive: Open Access Community Storytelling and the Digital Archive project commenced on\u000d\u000aOctober 1st 2013.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"6418","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Evidence of engagement with the `Youth Amplified' resources can be used\u000d\u000a      to demonstrate how\u000d\u000a      Coleman's research has informed debate, made available new content\u000d\u000a      and influenced practice for\u000d\u000a      education providers.\u000d\u000a    There is also strong evidence of improvements in young people's\u000d\u000a      confidence when speaking in\u000d\u000a      public and their ability to express ideas and opinions in communities,\u000d\u000a      schools and workplaces, as a\u000d\u000a      direct result of engaging with the `Youth Amplified' resources.\u000d\u000a    In terms of informing and influencing education providers, by October\u000d\u000a      2012 over 200 schools\u000d\u000a      across England and Wales had registered an interest in incorporating the\u000d\u000a      `Youth Amplified'\u000d\u000a      resources into teaching and the \"comprehensive guide for educators\" on the\u000d\u000a      website has been\u000d\u000a      downloaded over 300 times since the website's launch.\u000d\u000a    Teachers who have adopted the `Youth Amplified' resources have reported\u000d\u000a      marked improvements\u000d\u000a      in the confidence and ability of students, where they are now able to\u000d\u000a      speak in public in ways that\u000d\u000a      they were not able to do previously. For example:\u000d\u000a    By the end of the second session, all students successfully stood in\u000d\u000a      front of the group\u000d\u000a      and delivered a speech without notes, something which I think they were\u000d\u000a      highly unlikely\u000d\u000a      to feel confident doing at the start ... [A]\u000d\u000a    Between January and May 2013, over 30 workshops , designed to supplement\u000d\u000a      the online\u000d\u000a      resources, were requested by a variety of schools, youth centres,\u000d\u000a      University student groups and\u000d\u000a      adult education classes. The aim of these workshops was to help teachers\u000d\u000a      and youth workers\u000d\u000a      support young people to develop and articulate arguments in a confident\u000d\u000a      and effective fashion.\u000d\u000a    Feedback from these workshops suggests that exposure to both the online\u000d\u000a      resources and face-to-face\u000d\u000a      activity sessions led young people to feel more confident about applying\u000d\u000a      newly-discovered\u000d\u000a      principles of confident self-expression:\u000d\u000a    The student's feedback afterwards was extremely positive, all of them\u000d\u000a      believed that it\u000d\u000a      has increased their confidence in performing before a crowd and they felt\u000d\u000a      prepared to\u000d\u000a      do it again ... An unexpected outcome from the workshop was the students\u000d\u000a      wanting to\u000d\u000a      deliver something similar to younger years in the school. As we are trying\u000d\u000a      to develop\u000d\u000a      not only non-academic skills in our students, including leadership, this\u000d\u000a      was a break\u000d\u000a      through. [B]\u000d\u000a    Working in collaboration with the Twist Partnership, which works with\u000d\u000a      disadvantaged school\u000d\u000a      students to enhance their civic and leadership skills, Coleman ran\u000d\u000a      two workshops for year 11\u000d\u000a      pupils from the Langdon School in Newham, East London. Twist's Education\u000d\u000a      Director commented\u000d\u000a      on the impact of these sessions:\u000d\u000a    During the workshops, the students seemed to grow in confidence\u000d\u000a      immensely. Students who\u000d\u000a      had been quiet and reserved for most the year suddenly found that they\u000d\u000a      were able to speak\u000d\u000a      out in front of a large group. The most striking of these was Robin who is\u000d\u000a      normally extremely\u000d\u000a      shy and silent but managed a dramatic reading to a large audience. She\u000d\u000a      said that she never\u000d\u000a      thought that she would be able to do anything like that. I was surprised\u000d\u000a      at how many shy and\u000d\u000a      reserved students seemed to find a \"voice\". A year 11 boy, who had been\u000d\u000a      silent for most of the\u000d\u000a      trip, flourished and completely stole the show. [C]\u000d\u000a    After working with the Youth Ampified resources, she was of the opinion\u000d\u000a      that\u000d\u000a    The change in the students was quite miraculous. I would love to\u000d\u000a      incorporate the project into some\u000d\u000a      of the leadership programmes that Twist runs for young people. I feel that\u000d\u000a      it could have a dramatic\u000d\u000a      effect and most particularly on those young people who are at risk of\u000d\u000a      exclusion.\u000d\u000a    Although designed to be used by 11 - 18 year olds, the creation of new\u000d\u000a      educational materials from\u000d\u000a      Coleman's research has also engaged wider audiences, as evidenced\u000d\u000a      by the adoption of the\u000d\u000a      `Youth Amplified' resources by the Workers' Educational Association (WEA),\u000d\u000a      the UK's largest\u000d\u000a      voluntary-sector provider of adult education, as part of its Community\u000d\u000a      Action Learning Programme.\u000d\u000a      Workshops, based on the expressive capacities identified by Coleman,\u000d\u000a      have been run for over 200\u000d\u000a      WEA students to date. Coleman is currently collaborating with the\u000d\u000a      organisation's director of\u000d\u000a      education to further adapt some of the content for additional use by adult\u000d\u000a      learners, to inform\u000d\u000a      personal and professional development.\u000d\u000a    As the WEA moves forward into a new phase of its work, responding to the\u000d\u000a      difficult\u000d\u000a      social and economic pressures around us, we shall be focusing much more on\u000d\u000a      the\u000d\u000a      skills and values of citizenship and will be making use of Coleman's\u000d\u000a      research &#8212; and\u000d\u000a      working with him &#8212; with a view to ensuring that the courses we offer are\u000d\u000a      relevant to the\u000d\u000a      needs of people who have much to contribute to the social conversation,\u000d\u000a      but lack the\u000d\u000a      confidence or verbal skills to make themselves heard. [D]\u000d\u000a    As further evidence of the research's scope, the `Youth Amplified'\u000d\u000a      resources have also been used\u000d\u000a      throughout a series of workshops from January to May 2013, aimed at\u000d\u000a      encouraging youth\u000d\u000a      participation in local government. This has had a notable impact in the\u000d\u000a      capacity of youth\u000d\u000a      representatives in Leeds Youth Council, the UK Youth Parliament and the\u000d\u000a      Leeds Children in Care\u000d\u000a      Council to speak up about issues that affect them:\u000d\u000a    The training gave me more confidence in leading sessions during the Leeds\u000d\u000a      Youth Council\u000d\u000a      meetings, and gave me the confidence needed to be an authority, and make\u000d\u000a      my voice heard.\u000d\u000a      (Student, Notre Dame College, Leeds, and Chair of Leeds Youth Council) [E]\u000d\u000a    As another example of the research's influence in informing and shaping\u000d\u000a      strategy and policy\u000d\u000a      provisions aimed at young people, its value has also been credited by\u000d\u000a      Leeds City Council, which is\u000d\u000a      providing a programme of training and personal development for the first\u000d\u000a      time ever, to equip\u000d\u000a      children and young people with the skills and confidence to meaningfully\u000d\u000a      contribute to decision\u000d\u000a      making processes:\u000d\u000a    [T]he findings of the research has given a good intellectual foundation\u000d\u000a      on which decisions about\u000d\u000a      the direction of youth voice and participation in Leeds can be based.

[4,5]\u000d\u000a    Coleman examined and evaluated the extent and quality of\u000d\u000a      programmes and materials designed\u000d\u000a      to enhance public expression (often referred to as `speaking and listening\u000d\u000a      skills'), both within and\u000d\u000a      beyond the school curriculum, from October-December 2011. As a result of\u000d\u000a      this research,\u000d\u000a      Coleman was able to identify that while there was a drive to\u000d\u000a      motivate young people to speak about\u000d\u000a      a range of civic-related themes, there was very little material to show\u000d\u000a      young people how to speak\u000d\u000a      about these themes and other issues of concern to them [5].\u000d\u000a    The grant also provided Coleman with the opportunity to further\u000d\u000a      investigate young people's\u000d\u000a      experiences of and frustrations in public speaking, by organising a series\u000d\u000a      of face-to-face\u000d\u000a      interviews, surveys and workshops from January-March 2012 with young\u000d\u000a      people from schools in\u000d\u000a      Leeds, the Leeds Youth Service and a youth theatre. Coleman worked with an\u000d\u000a      applied drama\u000d\u000a      practitioner to run the workshops. Drawing on previous theoretical and\u000d\u000a      empirical research [1-3],\u000d\u000a      and the findings of the interviews, surveys and workshops, Coleman\u000d\u000a      then identified six expressive\u000d\u000a      capacities (confidence; projection; persuasion; negotiation; listening and\u000d\u000a      argumentation) which\u000d\u000a      were integral in helping young people overcome difficulties in\u000d\u000a      communicating to wider audiences.\u000d\u000a      [5,6]\u000d\u000a    Each expressive capacity then formed the content of the `Youth Amplified'\u000d\u000a      web-based educational\u000d\u000a      resources, which were specifically designed to support young people in the\u000d\u000a      development of these\u000d\u000a      skills.

Until 2008, rare historic films about the city were scattered\u000a      amongst a wide range of institutions and private collectors. Many of these\u000a      films have since been donated for preservation. Fifty of them are now\u000a      preserved in the National Film Archive, North West Film Archive and\u000a      digitised for permanent display as part of Screenonline and in the\u000a      `History Detectives' Gallery, new Museum of Liverpool.\u000a    Public screenings, exhibitions, lectures, seminars and events have made\u000a      this rich film heritage available to a wide range of audiences. Screenings\u000a      have taken place at various Merseyside locations including Foundation for\u000a      Art and Creative Technology (FACT) media centre, Woolton Cinema, UCI Edge\u000a      Lane, Liverpool School of Architecture (LSA).\u000a    Public impact: response to the screenings has shown warm\u000a      enthusiasm: \"a very useful service to the community and to historical\u000a        records\", \"brilliant glimpse into the past!\" \"let's have more of\u000a        these events please\", \"films should be shown more often here!\", with\u000a      28 of 37 respondents rating a FACT event as excellent and a further 9 as\u000a      good (attendance 90). Between September 2011 and January 2013, 907 people\u000a      watched NWFA screenings with City in Film content at events in\u000a      Liverpool, Sefton, Knowsley and Wirral. Other screenings and events have\u000a      included large scale public events such Mitchell and Kenyon's\u000a        Liverpool Films' in their original Edwardian venue (full house, 800\u000a      people), 9 screening and discussion events from 2008-9 with contributions\u000a      from local filmmakers, artists and community activists, contributions to\u000a      the Waterfront Screening series (Tate Liverpool 2008), Terence\u000a      Davies Public Lecture, Liverpool University (2010, full house 250 people).\u000a      Public attendance at these screenings and events has ranged from 30-800\u000a      participants. Participants ranged from predominantly young professionals\u000a      at FACT and LSA to mixed family audiences at UCI and elderly people at\u000a      Woolton.\u000a    Visits and requests for material on Liverpool and Merseyside from\u000a      personal researchers to programme producers, professional researchers and\u000a      educators have increased by 6-8% at North West Film Archive since 2008, a\u000a      rise that can be directly attributed to the change in the archive's\u000a      collecting policy in respect of material from Merseyside, the publicity\u000a      generated by the project (interviews for local, regional and national\u000a      television, radio and press included North West Tonight, GMTV,\u000a        ITV Granada, Radio Merseyside, Liverpool Daily Post and Echo; for\u000a      example, BBC\u000a        report, 2009) and increased public engagement through local\u000a      screenings and events. Enquiries about developing this material for\u000a      educational use in schools have been received from local groups such as Lovehistory,\u000a      a Liverpool based education charity.\u000a    Institutional impact: City in Film, in partnership with\u000a      North West Film Archive, North West Vision and Media, Liverpool Libraries\u000a      and Liverpool Record Office, contributed to the development of a `place'\u000a      page featuring Liverpool for the British Film Institute's Screenonline\u000a      resource. Some 45,518 visitors have viewed the Screenonline\u000a      Liverpool on Screen pages at March 2013, although this figure does not\u000a      account for links from associated works and biographies. This `very\u000a      successful programme' received a special mention by the BFI as an\u000a      innovative model for a new on-line resource A Portrait of Britain,\u000a      in the BFI's memorandum to the House of Lords Select Committee on\u000a      Communications, in its inquiry into the British film and television\u000a      industries, 2009. (see section 5:1)\u000a    Community impact: Heritage film is now part of the Museum's\u000a      education programme to stimulate engagement in citizenship and community\u000a      action. In consultation with Hallam, Mark Bareham of Soap Box Films is\u000a      developing a lottery funded project with the Museum (as part of their\u000a      education programme) to run a series of workshops and create an on-line\u000a      archive of material made by Community Productions Group, a co-operative\u000a      media resource that documented co-operative business and voluntary schemes\u000a      in Merseyside in the 1980s. A pilot screening and discussion of this\u000a      material announced in gallery attracted 30 adult participants of mixed\u000a      ages: average response to questions such as `how useful is material to\u000a      start a discussion' was 9.8, and `importance of making it readily\u000a      accessible' 9.9. Comments included `Very relevant to today', `Scary and\u000a      relevant', `Really interesting and inspiring', `Good to relate today's\u000a      struggles to the past' (April 2012). The project includes the development\u000a      of educational resource materials that will be piloted in community\u000a      settings as well as schools and colleges.\u000a    Hallam also provided consultation and support for Pidgin\u000a        Productions lottery awarded project `Back to\u000a        the Timepiece', a documentary that contributes to the history of\u000a      Liverpool's black community.\u000a    2) Impact on methods and practices\u000a    The Museum of Liverpool, opened in 2011, is the first purpose-built\u000a      museum in the UK for over 100 years. According to its\u000a        web page it is now the most visited museum in the country outside\u000a      London.\u000a    Workshops, led by our researchers, introduced museum staff to the technological\u000a        and methodological insights and tools developed in the research\u000a        projects. This has changed the ways curators at the Museum think about\u000a        accessing their collections. The Museum's curators expressed an\u000a      interest in developing the public's access to their collections through\u000a      the use of an interactive map as part of discussions about the new Museum\u000a      of Liverpool's use of film in exhibition galleries. Traditionally, the\u000a      public have had no means of accessing a museum's catalogue.\u000a    Geo-coding the catalogue and digitising images of many of the\u000a        artefacts relating to the Merseyside area and storing them in a GIS\u000a      system has enabled the public to access their local history by touching a\u000a      map on a screen in the History\u000a        Detectives Gallery. A menu gives access to a wide range of material\u000a      including, but not limited to, film materials made available for public\u000a      display through collaboration between the researchers, amateur filmmakers,\u000a      North West Film Archive and the BFI.\u000a    The interactive map has been accessed by more than a million visitors\u000a        to the Museum. (current footfall 1,188,226 since the gallery opened\u000a      in December 2011 against a target of 750,000).\u000a    The map is facilitating public participation in psycho-geographic\u000a        narratives of memory and identity around issues of place through\u000a      themed workshops e.g. by the creation of `trails' which become part of the\u000a      map (c.f. Radical City, Radical Women impact narrative).\u000a    Dr. Rob Philpott, Head of Field Archaeology, commenting on participating\u000a      in the network, stated that \"`The workshops have been intellectually very\u000a      stimulating...[they] created an enhanced awareness of developing\u000a      technologies in areas as diverse as GIS, GPS, mobile phone applications,\u000a      architectural reconstruction, music and film, and social history. I\u000a      anticipate that the workshops will have a series of longer-term, perhaps\u000a      less immediate, benefits in the way the Museum of Liverpool team will\u000a      develop the displays on gallery'\" (AHRC\/BT network report Feb 2011).\u000a    Dr. Les Roberts is a consultant advisor on `City in Film' projects in\u000a        Bologna and Vienna. This latter project proposes to use film to\u000a      examine how public space has changed over time using a similar approach to\u000a      City in Film.

From its inception, therefore, the research was\u000a      fully engaged with and responsive to, the policy development needs of both\u000a      the ECU itself and of the wider sector that it serves, especially in terms\u000a      of evidence-based guidance to meet legal obligations and develop best\u000a      practice in the light of the new requirements relating to religion or\u000a      belief of the 2010 Equalities Act. 56 sector stakeholders engaged\u000a      with the project's report at a launch seminar held in London on 11.7.11.\u000a      Since publication on the ECU website, up until the 17th October\u000a      2013, there had been 1,351 unique views of the full report and 523 visits\u000a      to the Executive Summary. In a statement on the launch of the report, the\u000a      ECU stated it would be \"prioritising areas recommended within the\u000a        report for future work\" A specific example of this was the project's\u000a      research into the acceptability among higher education staff and students\u000a      of religion or belief data monitoring questions; its inclusion in its own\u000a      survey of the category option of \"spiritual\" and the ECU's consultative\u000a      work with the Higher Education Statistical Agency that was informed by the\u000a      research. The resulting impact of the research can be evidenced in the\u000a      current form of the HESA staff and student record religion and belief data\u000a      fields which include the UK National Censuses' data categories, but with\u000a      the addition of the category of \"spiritual\" used by the project. This is\u000a      significant in that it goes beyond the categories used in the UK National\u000a      Censuses, while through HESA standards the reach of its impact extends to\u000a      the policy and practice of universities and higher education colleges\u000a      throughout the UK.\u000a    2.] The \"Religion and Belief, Discrimination and Equality\" project\u000a      includes impact on policy development and understanding through Weller's\u000a      (2011) commissioned report for the EHRC on Religious Discrimination in\u000a        Britain: A Review of Research Evidence, 2000-2010 (Manchester:\u000a      EHRC).

In total participants identified 263\u000a      hopes\/objectives of which 23% were \"surpassed\" and 56% were \"satisfied\",\u000a      providing evidence that the workshops met many of the needs of a broad\u000a      range of practitioners\/research users, while also contributing further\u000a      primary research data to the finalisation of the project's results.\u000a    3.] As a result of a competitive application process, in which the\u000a      University's Centre for Society, Religion and Belief's Centre's research\u000a      leader in this field cited his research on religion and belief,\u000a      discrimination and equality, Weller was in 2010 appointed and served\u000a      (until the Panel's abolition by the present Coalition Government) as one\u000a      of 13 members of the expert panel on Faith providing confidential advice\u000a      to the Secretary of State, other Ministers and Civil Servants in the UK\u000a      Government's Department of Communities and Local Government on \"engagement\u000a        with faith communities, and the impact of Communities and Local\u000a        Government policy on faith communities.\"\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study focuses on the reach and significance of the impact\u000a      achieved particularly by a body of research conducted from within the\u000a      Centre for Society, Religion and Belief, and especially involving the work\u000a      of Weller and Cheruvallil-Contractor.

A web\u000d\u000a      indicator, in the narrow\u000d\u000a      sense, is a metric derived from web-based data. The research involves\u000d\u000a      conceiving new metrics\u000d\u000a      and developing methods to capture them, including methods for counting and\u000d\u000a      reporting the number\u000d\u000a      of hyperlinks pointing to a web site (in various ways) and methods to\u000d\u000a      count the number of web\u000d\u000a      sites or other entities mentioning each one of a given set of documents.\u000d\u000a      In the broader sense, web\u000d\u000a      indicators also include graphical representations of web-based phenomena,\u000d\u000a      such as network\u000d\u000a      diagrams of the connectivity of a set of web sites. Below are two\u000d\u000a      illustrative examples.\u000d\u000a    A majority of the SCRG's research before 2008 was dedicated to developing\u000d\u000a      the theoretical and\u000d\u000a      methodological foundations of link analysis. Two papers are cited below to\u000d\u000a      reference this research\u000d\u000a      direction. As part of this, software was also developed for automatic link\u000d\u000a      analysis, which was then\u000d\u000a      upgraded in the current REF period for use with new types of web\u000d\u000a      indicator.\u000d\u000a    A series of studies led by Kousha and Thelwall (2008-2011) developed\u000d\u000a      web-based impact metrics\u000d\u000a      for academic journal articles, conference papers and books, and these were\u000d\u000a      subsequently used in\u000d\u000a      projects for Nesta, Jisc, More 2, Lot 2 and the Belgian Government as\u000d\u000a      described in section 3.\u000d\u000a      These are similar to traditional citation metrics, counting how often\u000d\u000a      documents are cited, except\u000d\u000a      that the citations are calculated from the web rather than from\u000d\u000a      traditional citation indexes, such as\u000d\u000a      the Web of Science. The development of the metrics includes evaluations\u000d\u000a      and the construction of\u000d\u000a      filtering methods. For instance, one project demonstrated that it was\u000d\u000a      possible to count citations to\u000d\u000a      journal articles from books using Google Book Search, conducted an\u000d\u000a      evaluation to demonstrate\u000d\u000a      that the results were reasonable (correlating significantly with\u000d\u000a      traditional impact indicators) and\u000d\u000a      gave new and important results (evidence of the impact of\u000d\u000a      humanities-oriented research that was\u000d\u000a      not well reflected in traditional metrics). The automatic method included\u000d\u000a      heuristics to generate\u000d\u000a      queries to identify citations to articles from the article title, author\u000d\u000a      names, and publishing journal\u000d\u000a      title. The methods were incorporated into the Webometric Analyst software\u000d\u000a      to allow them to be\u000d\u000a      used quickly and efficiently on large-scale datasets.\u000d\u000a    As part of the 2008-2009 Rindicate Contract for the Directorate General\u000d\u000a      of Research (DG\u000d\u000a      Research) in the EU, Thelwall adapted his existing software SocSciBot to\u000d\u000a      crawl and analyse the\u000d\u000a      hyperlinks between the web sites within four specific fields, to draw\u000d\u000a      network diagrams and\u000d\u000a      calculate metrics from the networks. Our research developed an effective\u000d\u000a      way to gather the data\u000d\u000a      and an effective selection of metrics for analysing the data, drawing upon\u000d\u000a      prior webometric\u000d\u000a      research and the field of Social Network Analysis (SNA). We claim that\u000d\u000a      this is a more\u000d\u000a      comprehensive approach to analyse emerging trans-disciplinary fields (the\u000d\u000a      target of the contract)\u000d\u000a      than a traditional scientometric approach relying upon citation analysis\u000d\u000a      and patent analysis\u000d\u000a      because it includes important actors, such as scholarly societies and web\u000d\u000a      portals, that do not\u000d\u000a      publish patents or journal articles. This was used in the Rindicate\u000d\u000a      project described in section 3, as\u000d\u000a      well as in the UN, BBC WST, and Oxfam projects also described below.\u000d\u000a    The main researchers were Mike Thelwall, Kayvan Kousha and David\u000d\u000a      Wilkinson, with Pardeep\u000d\u000a      Sud conducting follow-on research in the same area, including altmetric\u000d\u000a      research (which we expect\u000d\u000a      to have a measurable impact in 2014), and with Gareth Harries (now\u000d\u000a      retired) having previously\u000d\u000a      conducted relevant research as part of the SCRG.

Yahoo! incorporates a\u000a      question and answer forum (Yahoo! Answers) in which users ask questions\u000a      and other users suggest answers. Yahoo! then presents these suggested\u000a      answers back to the original questioner and anyone else interested in the\u000a      question. Questions often elicit many suggested answers, some of which are\u000a      useful and others are unhelpful, inaccurate or spam. In response, Yahoo!\u000a      ranks the answers and returns them in order, with the most promising\u000a      answers being returned first. Unfortunately, promising answers can be very\u000a      difficult to detect automatically so answer-ranking is a difficult\u000a      problem. Using SentiStrength, Yahoo! has improved the ranking of the\u000a      suggested answers to questions by detecting sentiment in the answers and\u000a      also by detecting sentiment in feedback sent to the answerers (e.g.,\u000a      gratitude or criticism). The reasons why SentiStrength rather than any\u000a      other sentiment analysis software has made this possible are its speed,\u000a      its ability to process informal text, and its capability to effectively\u000a      process general web text.

Answers service [ref 11] and so the potential number of\u000a      beneficiaries of an improved Yahoo! Answers is 200 million per year. More\u000a      specifically, these 200 million persons are more likely to find good\u000a      answers to questions that they think are important enough to pose to\u000a      Yahoo! Answers. These questions are likely to cover a wide variety of\u000a      issues from work-related to relationship advice. The improvement of a\u000a      service to satisfy a wide variety of information needs for hundreds of\u000a      millions of people generates a huge benefit to society.

Each tweet was\u000a      classified for sentiment by SentiStrength and the proportion of positive\u000a      and negative tweets on each day was highlighted on the London Eye, turning\u000a      it into a huge pie chart by lighting up bulbs on the outside of the wheel\u000a      and then continuing into a light show for 30 minutes. This entertaining\u000a      use funded by EDF Energy was accompanied by a control room open to the\u000a      public at the base of the London Eye to explain how the technology worked.\u000a        Evidence: see cited articles\/web pages.

SentiStrength is part of an additional similar\u000a      project that is secret but will be described on the SentiStrength website\u000a      in February 2014.\u000a    Economic prosperity (improved customer relations and marketing):\u000a      SentiStrength has improved marketing and customer relations management for\u000a      businesses and their clients from 2010 onwards. These businesses are in\u000a      the online market intelligence sector and have their own text gathering\u000a      and analysis software that they offer as a service to their clients (e.g.,\u000a      Inbenta's multilingual Social Media Monitoring and Social Media Management\u000a      tools). SentiStrength is superior to traditional sentiment analysis\u000a      programs for (a) its generic ability to give good performance across a\u000a      range of texts, (b) its capability to process the informal text typical of\u000a      the social web, (c) its speed, and (d) its transparency and ease of\u000a      customisation for particular customer requirements, including language.\u000a      SentiStrength is used to provide sentiment analysis for their clients for\u000a      the text that they gather, which is typically free text customer feedback\u000a      about their products (e.g., tweets, forum posts). Businesses using this\u000a      sentiment-enhanced customer relations management services can quickly\u000a      identify when their products or brands are starting to attract negative or\u000a      positive comments in the social web and can react accordingly, such as by\u000a      making product modifications or by emailing individual unhappy customers\u000a      to offer advice. This impact has been realised in the users of customer\u000a      relations and marketing services that incorporate SentiStrength. Services\u000a      like CompanyBook extend this capability to sentiment analysis of other\u000a      businesses with social media data. Some users have also developed\u000a      SentiStrength for different languages (Atbrox: Finnish, Inbenta: Spanish,\u000a      French, Portuguese), extending its scope of impact. Evidence:\u000a      sales and sales agreements.\u000a    Public discourse: SentiStrength aided public understanding\u000a      of social phenomena in 2012. SentiStrength was used to analyse tweets\u000a      relevant to political and other events to give insights to the public\u000a      about these events. For example, analyses of tweets relating to the UK\u000a      riots were published in The Guardian newspaper as part of a wider\u000a      investigation of the Riots led by the University of Manchester.\u000a        Evidence: see cited Guardian article.

Significant research into\u000a      sentiment analysis methods has conducted by computational linguists,\u000a      typically focusing on the commercially relevant domain of product reviews,\u000a      with the goal of helping market research by automatically extracting\u000a      consumer opinions about clients' products. In contrast, the SCRG developed\u000a      sentiment analysis software from an explicitly social perspective,\u000a      focussing on general social web texts rather than product reviews. The\u000a      SCRG's key contributions are the following.\u000a    * Developing a new dual positive-negative sentiment strength\u000a      classification scheme that gives each text a simultaneous positive and\u000a      negative score. This is based upon social psychology of emotions that\u000a      believes humans to be capable of feeling positive and negative sentiment\u000a      simultaneously, and our own observation that positive and negative\u000a      sentiment are frequently expressed simultaneously in the social web, even\u000a      in short phrases such as \"miss you\".\u000a    * Developing a set of relatively domain independent sentiment analysis\u000a      techniques (i.e., not specific to one type of data or type of web site)\u000a      targeted at the short informal text typical of the social web. As an\u000a      example, one rule specifies that additional duplicate letters in a\u000a      sentiment word beyond 1 increase the strength of sentiment in the word:\u000a      haaaapy is equivalent to \"very happy\".\u000a    * Encapsulating the sentiment analysis methods within a commercial\u000a      product, SentiStrength, that is fast enough to handle large volumes of\u000a      text. The Windows version SentiStrength is free online on the web site\u000a      sentistrength.wlv.ac.uk and there is also a Java version, which is the\u000a      commercial product.\u000a    * Evaluating SentiStrength against a range of alternatives, showing that\u000a      SentiStrength gives comparable accuracy with a fraction of the effort.\u000a      These alternatives are a range of standard machine learning methods with\u000a      various different feature sets - mainly 1-3 grams with feature selection,\u000a      a total of 690 main variations.\u000a    * Modifying the initial version of SentiStrength to make it more\u000a      language-independent and supporting the development of different language\u000a      versions by ourselves and others (currently English, Dutch, German,\u000a      Spanish, Finnish, and Russian). The modifications are twofold: ensuring\u000a      that all language-specific resources are in external plain text files for\u000a      ease of adaptation, and adding parameters that can be customised by\u000a      language. For instance, the negation position parameter allows negating\u000a      words to modify preceding sentiment words in languages like German in\u000a      which negating words occur after sentiment words (e.g., The formulation \"I\u000a      am happy not\" is OK in German but not in English).\u000a    * Proving the value of SentiStrength through its application to\u000a      understand the role of sentiment in different social web domains,\u000a      including extended studies of Twitter and YouTube.\u000a    The main researchers are Mike Thelwall, Kevan Buckley, Pardeep Sud and\u000a      Georgios Paltoglou. The research was conducted by these researchers and Di\u000a      Cai, all at Wolverhampton University.

For instance, a\u000a      special issue of Garden\u000a        History (2007) on the cultural and historical geographies of the\u000a      arboretum co-edited by Elliott has\u000a      been widely distributed. 1,600 copies were sent to members of the Garden\u000a      History Society,\u000a      subscribers to Garden History and additional purchasers, whilst\u000a      many copies were also distributed\u000a      by the conference speakers internationally and through Institute of\u000a      Chartered Forester's website\u000a      (from 2011) and by other digital means. Elliott's research has informed\u000a      the restoration and\u000a      management of public parks in Derby and Nottingham and he was consultant\u000a      and contributor to\u000a      the BBC Radio 4 `Parkmasters' series presented by Dr. Tristram Hunt (2007,\u000a      repeated). In 2010, at\u000a      the invitation of BBC History Magazine, Elliott nominated the\u000a      Derby Arboretum as one of the\u000a      hundred most important British historical places and was interviewed for a\u000a      companion volume\u000a      published by BBC Books in 2011 which reported in the Derby Evening\u000a        Telegraph in November\u000a      2011 and Elliott was interviewed by BBC Radio Derby at the Derby\u000a      Arboretum.\u000a    (4.2) Elliott's studies on landscape history have also impacted upon the\u000a      education and\u000a      development of the arboricultural profession and campaigns for the\u000a      conservation and management\u000a      of historic tree collections. In October 2011, Elliott was invited by\u000a      Institute of Chartered Foresters to\u000a      lecture on `How Britain's Great Arboreta have shaped Forestry and\u000a      Arboricultural Knowledge' as\u000a      part of their annual National Study Tour at Kew Gardens. The ICF is the\u000a      royal chartered body for\u000a      forestry and arboricultural professionals in Britain which provides\u000a      support to members, guidance\u000a      and information to the public, as well as training and educational\u000a      development for members of the\u000a      profession. In 2013 Elliott was again invited by the ICF to lecture at Kew\u000a      on `The History of British\u000a      and Irish Estate Arboretums'. This conference was entitled `Castlewellan\u000a      Arboretum: the last great\u000a      garden restoration?' and highlighted the heritage and botanical importance\u000a      of Castlewellan\u000a      Arboretum and Annesley Garden, Co. Down, Northern Ireland, aiming to\u000a      foster academic and\u000a      community-supported restoration projects. The conference attracted a large\u000a      audience and the\u000a      proceedings (including Elliott's lecture presentation) have been widely\u000a      distributed through the\u000a      Barcham's Tree Company website.\u000a    (4.3) Elliott's studies of landscape and the history of science have also\u000a      had a significant public\u000a      impact through the work of Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site,\u000a      Derbyshire museums and\u000a      Derby Local Studies Library. He is a member of the DVM World Heritage Site\u000a      Research and\u000a      Publications Committee which advises the Partnership on educational and\u000a      cultural matters and\u000a      publications and has overseen the establishment of an educational trust.\u000a      He is also a member of\u000a      DVMWHS Research Steering Group which is currently defining research\u000a      priorities for academics,\u000a      local history and heritage groups across the Valley and beyond. As a\u000a      member of the Joseph Wright\u000a      of Derby National Steering Group, Elliott has assisted the in\u000a      interpretation and development of the\u000a      Wright collection and the foundation of Derby Museums Trust. For the\u000a      HLF-funded `Enlightenment!\u000a      Derbyshire Setting the Pace in the 18th century' project,\u000a      Elliott has provided support and advice to\u000a      museum curators concerning the choice of scientific instruments and other\u000a      objects that ought to be\u000a      acquired and supplied pre-publication copies of chapters from Enlightenment,\u000a        Modernity and\u000a        Science book to inform the acquisition strategy. The project has\u000a      also encouraged volunteering\u000a      opportunities, workshops, special exhibitions, summer walks and other\u000a      activities involving Elliott\u000a      and Derby University students. Elliott was invited to speak at a public\u000a      conversation on the impact of\u000a      the British Enlightenment at a `Lunar Society Museums at Night' event at\u000a      Buxton Museum, 13 May\u000a      2011 alongside Dr. Kim Sloan and Dr. Frances Carey of the British Museum\u000a      and Jonathan Wallis\u000a      of Derby Museums. Over 70 people attended this event, which exceeded the\u000a      gallery capacity\u000a      whilst over 87,000 visitors have visited Enlightenment exhibitions in the\u000a      county, over 5,000 people\u000a      have benefitted from related educational activities and events and there\u000a      have been over 30,000\u000a      blog hits. Elliott also contributed material on `Provincial Museums and\u000a        Cabinets of Curiosity' to the\u000a      exhibition The Visual Poetry of 1001 Objects (January 2012-January\u000a      2014) at Derby Museums\u000a      which re-discovers and reinterprets some of the reserve collections,\u000a      whilst the one-day\u000a      interdisciplinary conference that he co-organised at the Enterprise Centre\u000a      in Derby on the East\u000a      Midlands Enlightenment (June 2013) in co-ordination with Derby Museums\u000a      Trust brought together\u000a      members of the general public, museum, library and heritage professionals\u000a      and academics,\u000a      helping to forge closer links between universities, external organisations\u000a      and the general public\u000a      and to engage new audiences in the regional history of Enlightenment.\u000a    (4.4) Finally, the public impact of Elliott's research in this field is\u000a      also evident in the AHRC-funded\u000a      Nottingham Green Spaces Community History project which has reinforced\u000a      engagement between\u000a      academia, local government and heritage and community groups. In\u000a      partnership with Professor\u000a      John Beckett of Nottingham University, Nottingham City Council, the\u000a      Friends of the Nottingham\u000a      Arboretum, Friends of the Forest and the Nottingham Women's History group,\u000a      and through the\u000a      work of two research fellows, the project has encouraged greater public\u000a      involvement in shaping the\u000a      future development, management and uses of Nottingham green spaces and is\u000a      having a significant\u000a      community impact. The project has encouraged community groups and\u000a      volunteers to research,\u000a      identify and transcribe source materials which are being used to inform\u000a      information boards,\u000a      websites and an exhibition in new visitor centres at the Forest and the\u000a      Arboretum. Community\u000a      groups and audiences have been engaged by a variety of means including the\u000a      creation of a project\u000a      website, regular public meetings, public talks in the parks, the\u000a      production of postcards, posters and\u000a      other publicity material and the use of social networking sites.

Underpinning Elliott's research is the idea that\u000a      historical analysis of place\u000a      benefits from approaches from cultural and historical geography, landscape\u000a      history, the history of\u000a      science and urban history. Part of this work has focussed on the cultural\u000a      and historical geographies\u000a      of arboretums including an AHRC-funded project on arboreta in\u000a      collaboration with Professor\u000a      Charles Watkins and Professor Stephen Daniels at the University of\u000a      Nottingham (2003-7). Elliott\u000a      has explored the science and culture of nineteenth-century British\u000a      arboretums, or tree collections,\u000a      and demonstrated how the development of these was fostered by a variety of\u000a      factors including\u000a      global trade and exploration, the popularity of collecting, the\u000a      significance to the British economy\u000a      and society, developments in Enlightenment science, changes in landscape\u000a      gardening aesthetics\u000a      and agricultural and horticultural improvement. Arboretums were idealized\u000a      as microcosms of\u000a      nature, miniature encapsulations of the globe and as living museums. The\u000a      work critically examined\u000a      different kinds of arboretums in order to understand the changing\u000a      practical, scientific, aesthetic and\u000a      pedagogical principals that underpinned their design, display and the way\u000a      in which they were\u000a      viewed. Elliott's research into arboretums has also had an important\u000a      international dimension and\u000a      compares the development of British and Irish arboretums with those in\u000a      Europe, the USA and other\u000a      countries, whilst the ecological impact of tree collections and the\u000a      interface between heritage,\u000a      conservation, restoration and the management of tree collections was also\u000a      been addressed in an\u000a      international conference at the Linnaean Society in 2006 and a series of\u000a      publications. These have\u000a      included `The Nottingham Arboretum: natural history, education and leisure\u000a      in a Victorian regional\u000a      centre', Urban History 35 (2008), 48-71 and The British\u000a        Arboretum: Trees, Science and Culture in\u000a        the Nineteenth Century (2011), the first comprehensive study to\u000a      address this aspect of Victorian\u000a      science and culture, most of which was written by Elliott.\u000a    (2.2) Elliott has taken the research on urban green spaces and arboretums\u000a      forward in various\u000a      studies. In The Derby Philosophers (2009) and Enlightenment,\u000a        Modernity and Science (2010) he\u000a      has explored the relationship between landscape, place and scientific\u000a      culture with case studies of\u000a      urban botanical gardens, Erasmus Darwin's gardens, meteorology and\u000a      electricity and urban\u000a      science. It is also evident in two community history projects on urban\u000a      green spaces that he has\u000a      helped to facilitate between 2011 and 2014. Elliott was invited by the\u000a      Friends of the Nottingham\u000a      Arboretum to give an anniversary lecture in the park in 2012 which\u000a      inspired an application by them\u000a      to the Community Heritage Project Challenge Fund in 2012. This led to the\u000a      more ambitious AHRC\u000a      Nottingham Green Spaces Community History project (2013-14) co-directed\u000a      with Professor John\u000a      Beckett of the University of Nottingham. This was a joint application\u000a      between Nottingham\u000a      University, Derby University, Nottingham City Council, Friends of the\u000a      Nottingham Arboretum,\u000a      Friends of the Forest and Nottingham Women's History group. The project\u000a      was assessed by the\u000a      AHRC panel as grade 5: `a proposal that is internationally excellent' in\u000a      term of scholarship,\u000a      originality, quality and significance which should be \"funded as a matter\u000a      of priority\". Using a\u000a      community history model, the Nottingham Green Spaces Project adopts the\u000a      urban history\u000a      approach utilised by Elliott in his essays on the Derby and Nottingham\u000a      arboretums.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"9054","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3190538","Name":"Slovenia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Relationship to the research\u000d\u000a    In articles, papers and performance, Boddington researches the relationship\u000d\u000a    between people and virtual environments.

The virtual component was an imaginary forest\u000d\u000a      landscape constructed with the 3D application server Open Simulator (an\u000d\u000a      open source equivalent of Second Life). At FACT Liverpool (16 March-27 May\u000d\u000a      2012), participants (54% male and 46% female, age 18 to 54 years, of which\u000d\u000a      6% were disabled) collaborated with the creative team to develop resources\u000d\u000a      for the artworks. 8 workshops were run together with 9 female students\u000d\u000a      from Weatherhead Media Arts College. Around 30 people attended a `Meet the\u000d\u000a      artist' event. In total, 20,360 visitors attended the events. At Europe\u000d\u000a      House, London, 825 people visited the exhibition on 9 days in September\u000d\u000a      2012.

This has led to an international E- Motional festival. The\u000d\u000a      website has attracted 840 unique visitors and 419 Facebook followers. In\u000d\u000a      London, 9 artists, 13 participants and 80 audience members benefitted from\u000d\u000a      the project.\u000d\u000a    Collectively these projects have a wide international reach and\u000d\u000a      significance, challenging the participants to reconsider their\u000d\u000a      relationship to technology and the ways in which virtual worlds and\u000d\u000a      telepresence might operate in terms of ethics, learning, work and social\u000d\u000a      interaction. They enabled young professionals and others to acquire\u000d\u000a      self-confidence, develop their creative thinking and explore issues of\u000d\u000a      identity, communication and teamwork for the 21st century. At the same\u000d\u000a      time the project has changed perceptions of women in technology creating\u000d\u000a      space for a `feminine presence' in a male dominated field. As Michael\u000d\u000a      Takeo Magruder, artist-in-residence, King's College London, notes: `The\u000d\u000a      workshops show young people what is possible, what workplaces of the near\u000d\u000a      future will look like, what will be the advantages and challenges. They\u000d\u000a      demystify this technology for young people.

Unitre have offered to collaborate by distributing the\u000a      questionnaire to their 268 regional branches in Italy.\u000a    In the summer of 2012 - following the successful British Academy\u000a      Mid-Career Fellowship, 325 questionnaires were distributed in Rome. The\u000a      City Council supported the project by inviting the project team to discuss\u000a      it and present it to over 300 elderly gathered for an event organized by\u000a      the Deputy Mayor and by offering a main meeting room for an event\u000a      organized with the City to present the findings of the Rome project in May\u000a      2013, as well as transporting the elderly involved in the project to the\u000a      event. Moreover, the Deputy Mayor of Rome has sustained the data gathering\u000a      in all the over 140 centres for old people present in Rome [see letter\u000a      with note of the Deputy Mayor]. Participants defined the project as `a\u000a      real opportunity' for actively engaging the elderly, while others\u000a      commented on the `enriching experience of sharing memories with others who\u000a      had lived through the same years' (Angelo Del Treste, 6\/5\/2013).\u000a    The Memoro website has a special section dedicated to the Lost Audiences\u000a      Project, where the pilot interviews have been uploaded in 2010. So far,\u000a      the videos have been seen over 6380 times, demonstrating a real interest\u000a      for the subject. However, the highest level of impact was demonstrated\u000a      through the event organised in Rome on 6th of May 2013. The event was\u000a      supported by the City Council, which provided their main event room as\u000a      well as free transport to get the elderly involved in the project to the\u000a      venue. The event gave Dr Treveri-Gennari the opportunity to present the\u000a      results of the project to not to only the participants but also to elderly\u000a      from several Old People Centres in Rome, City Council representatives,\u000a      University students from Film Studies and Architecture Degrees of the\u000a      Universita di Roma La Sapienza (first University in Rome), as well as film\u000a      industry representatives. A feedback form was given to all participants\u000a      and the answers provided clearly demonstrate not only an impact on the\u000a      processes of commemoration but mainly a significant role the project\u000a      played on the relationship between the elderly of the city and their\u000a      cultural life: several participants commented on the importance of `being\u000a      allowed to remember the best times of their lives'; `the importance of\u000a      sharing their memories with a wider audience'; `how this project has given\u000a      value to the memories of the elderly'; `how this project has given them\u000a      the opportunity not to be reflecting only negatively about the past, but\u000a      being actively part of a communal process which highly regards memories\u000a      and the elderly' (Angelo Zarfani, 6\/5\/2013; Teresa Gervasi Rabitti,\u000a      6\/5\/2013; Giuseppina Muzzatti, 6\/5\/2013).\u000a    The Rome project also has a facebook group page\u000a      (https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/238705016228814\/?fref=ts)\u000a      with 148 members. Members have contributed to the page by discussing and\u000a      sharing their memories, uploading photos and suggesting possible\u000a      collaborative initiatives (for instance working on a project on mapping\u000a      closed cinema venues).\u000a    Elderly people presented at the event expressed interest in the outcomes\u000a      of the research, with which they agreed, but also commented on the\u000a      importance of such a project not only to reflect on the value of people's\u000a      memories, but mainly on the way this process has allowed them to reflect\u000a      with others on the meaning of cinema in their lives. Several members of\u000a      the audience who had not taken part in the research were keen to find out\u000a      about the website and the publication of the outcomes because they were\u000a      interested in the results of the project. Two actresses, as well as two\u000a      projectionists who had worked in the film industry in the 1950s took part\u000a      in the event and asked to be involved in the project (Nandy Primavera,\u000a      Lucia Modugno, Ciro Giorgini, Roberto Parisi). The representatives of the\u000a      City Council have asked to expand this project, in order to involve a\u000a      bigger number of elderly people and this interest from the Council has\u000a      already demonstrated the importance of the project on different aspects of\u000a      the social life: one representative asked to work on an initiative which\u000a      can bridge the young and the older generation, working with elderly people\u000a      who can tell their memories to children in schools; another asked to work\u000a      on the processes of commemoration of the city, by developing a project on\u000a      lost cinema theatres in Rome, so important for the elderly people and\u000a      their cultural past. The national press was involved: an article was\u000a      published in the main Rome newspaper Il Messagero, which sells around\u000a      230,000 copies every day and has a mainly elderly readership. Moreover,\u000a      three articles were published on the Press Agency AGI (Agenzia\u000a      Giornalistica Italia), one of the Italian leading press agencies.\u000a    Following Treveri-Gennari's involvement in the project, she was asked to\u000a      work on a similar initiative for the Centenary of the Phoenix Cinema in\u000a      Oxford. The CityScreen programmer for the cinema has invited her to\u000a      analyse memories of Phoenix cinema-goers and the results of this research\u000a      will be available in the volume The Phoenix Picturehouse. 100 Years of\u000a      Cinema Memories (forthcoming in November 2013).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research insights from Oxford Brookes University's Dr Daniela\u000a      Treveri-Gennari on the practice of cinema-going in 1950s Italy has raised\u000a      public awareness of the importance of autobiographical memories in the\u000a      elderly as well as actively involved the elderly in reconstructing the\u000a      history of an important time in Italian film industry. These benefits of\u000a      the project were achieved through innovative British Academy funded\u000a      research-led collaborations between Dr Daniela Treveri-Gennari (Oxford\u000a      Brookes University) and colleagues at Exeter and Bristol Universities,\u000a      working with Memoro (a non-profit initiative dedicated since 2007 to\u000a      divulgate memories of people born before 1940), Rome City Council and the\u000a      University of the Third Age.

The article (2013) Lost Audiences:\u000a      Memories of cinema-going in 1950s Rome was submitted to publication to\u000a      Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television (available on request)\u000a      and the article written with Professor John Sedgwick (Utrecht University)\u000a      `Film popularity, programming patterns and audience choices in 1950s Rome'\u000a      will be submitted at the end of September to Film History (available on\u000a      request).\u000a    The project has now been expanded to the whole Italian territory in a\u000a      collaborative research which involves the University of Bristol and\u000a      Exeter. This project was funded by the AHRC (&#163;654,000) (Ref.\u000a      AH\/K003453\/1).\u000a    In the first part of the project (on Rome) Trevari-Gennari investigated\u000a      how the memory of events related to cinema-going were woven into people's\u000a      personal narrative, as well as whether the geographical location was\u000a      significant in the data if compared to the rest of the country. The social\u000a      connotation of cinema - vividly described by the participant - is not only\u000a      evident in terms of relationships (love, friendship, family and marriages)\u000a      and identity formation but also in the role of the vivid personal events\u000a      as one of the temporal landmarks in autobiographical memory: `first\u000a      experiences' (Shum 1998: 423). The memory of cinema going is therefore\u000a      associated to what Stubbings (2003: 69) defines `key aspects of the\u000a      lifecycle': the first time of smoking a cigarette, the first time of\u000a      seeing Sophia Loren on the big screen, but more the first kiss as well as\u000a      the first time the participant fell in love with a future husband or wife.\u000a    The initial outcomes of the research demonstrate - differing from\u000a      official histories of Italian cinemas - that the location memories were\u000a      much stronger than narratives, dates of first screenings or actors seen in\u000a      films. Cinemas' geographical locations were noticed in the responses of\u000a      the participants, underpinning Annette Kuhn's argument that `place is\u000a      extraordinarily insistent in memories' (2010: 275). Names and exact\u000a      addresses of the cinemas attended were often remembered more easily than\u000a      the films or the stars seen. Trevari-Gennari also created a geographical\u000a      map of cinema-going in Rome (available on the web at: http:\/\/www.memoro.org\/it\/brookes\/)\u000a      to analyse against the programming dataset and to assess against the\u000a      memories of local audiences, in order to investigate `the ways in which\u000a      different places have different meanings for different sections of the\u000a      populations' (Jancovich and Faire 2003: 24). Topographical memory and\u000a      local belonging are important to reflect upon the vital relationship\u000a      between the cultural geography of the city and cinema-going.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"12077","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    There was considerable press response to the finding that many active,\u000d\u000a      new manifestations of feminism exist in Britain, with similar\u000d\u000a      characteristics to 1970s feminism.\u000d\u000a    The Guardian (2010) cited the findings as `one of many signs that\u000d\u000a      we seem to be entering a new heyday for British feminism', naming Aune and\u000d\u000a      Redfern two of `the next famous five young feminists'. New Statesman\u000d\u000a      (2010) explained: `Reclaiming the F Word...charts the emergence of\u000d\u000a      a new breed of feminist: young, political, pragmatic and attuned to issues\u000d\u000a      of class and race, violence and power that are elided by sex-and-shopping\u000d\u000a      feminism'. Evening Standard (2010) said the book `hopes to dispel\u000d\u000a      the notion that feminism is a derogatory word, one which is no longer\u000d\u000a      needed or wanted', adding: `This is full-on fighting feminism, of the\u000d\u000a      marching and protesting kind. A little less angry than its Seventies\u000d\u000a      sister, perhaps, but sharing much of the same DNA'.\u000d\u000a    The book ignited public debate about the vibrancy of contemporary\u000d\u000a      feminism. London Review of Books (2011) debated the effectiveness\u000d\u000a      of `the feminist revival that's said to be going on', adding: `evidence of\u000d\u000a      such a movement might include recent books such as Reclaiming the F\u000d\u000a        Word.' New York Times (2012) listed it as one of five books\u000d\u000a      responsible for shifting public debate about feminism `from the perennial\u000d\u000a      `Where is feminism?' debate to `What can this resurgent feminism\u000d\u000a      achieve?''\u000d\u000a    Reclaiming the F Word attracted reviews by the national and\u000d\u000a      international press, women's organisations and readers' websites. Bloggers\u000d\u000a      commented that it introduced and inspired readers towards activism to\u000d\u000a      challenge gender inequalities: `If you have a younger sister, teen\u000d\u000a      daughter...who's been known to preface a pro-feminist thought with \"I'm\u000d\u000a      not a feminist, but...,\" RFW might just be the thing to bring her\u000d\u000a      around' (Easyvegan, 2010); `The great thing about the book is that it is\u000d\u000a      littered with quotes, statistics and examples, and each chapter ends with\u000d\u000a      a \"Take Action!\" box that lists a few easy activism tips, thereby\u000d\u000a      encouraging the reader to acknowledge what is wrong but also take action'\u000d\u000a      (glandtastic.blogspot 2012).

Aune's\u000d\u000a      media articles (Ms Magazine 10\/2010, TES 02\/2012) highlighted\u000d\u000a      young people's role, and suggested how teachers could teach feminism.\u000d\u000a      Interviewed by civil society and women's organisations (New Left Project\u000d\u000a      03\/2010, Feministing (USA, 10\/2010) and De Wereld Morgen (Belgium,\u000d\u000a      03\/2013)) and on TV and radio (BBC Radio Derby 1\/11\/12, BBC 1 News at Ten,\u000d\u000a      07\/2011), Aune discussed the need for feminist activism to alleviate\u000d\u000a      gender inequalities.\u000d\u000a    Aune's talks, debates and panel discussions at non-academic events\u000d\u000a      included: seven student feminist societies, three bookshops, one book fair\u000d\u000a      (Edinburgh, 2010), women's groups (Derby Women's Centre 2012, Progressive\u000d\u000a      Women, London 2010, Nottingham Women's Centre 2013), secularist\u000d\u000a      organisations (London and Glasgow 2011), a teachers' conference (Durham,\u000d\u000a      2011) and women's conferences (Feminism in London conference, 2010;\u000d\u000a      National Union of Students Women's Conference, Oxford, 2011; Women of the\u000d\u000a      World Festival, London, 2012; Bristol Women's Literature Festival 2013;\u000d\u000a      Derby International Women's Day 2013).

Outputs included five films. Art works challenging\u000d\u000a      stereotypes were exhibited in numerous locations and made into postcards\u000d\u000a      and a DVD. A website http:\/\/www.representing-ageing.com\/\u000d\u000a      was created as a permanent resource and teaching aid, and features the\u000d\u000a      project films, exhibition areas and art work samples.

The Labour Party Commission on Older Women cites the impact report\u000d\u000a      in its Interim Report (Sept 2013: p31).\u000d\u000a    The End of Award report explains that participants felt activities made a\u000d\u000a      lasting impact on their quality of life; their attitude towards their\u000d\u000a      ageing was significantly altered as a result of taking part: it `brought\u000d\u000a      attention to them as individuals' and `celebrated' their ageing.\u000d\u000a      Exhibition visitors commented on their `celebration of the ordinary',\u000d\u000a      calling for `more truthful images of older women in the media.' Exhibition\u000d\u000a      questionnaires show that 87% of visitors found the exhibition `good' or\u000d\u000a      `very good'; 83% found it `thought-provoking' and 88% would like to see\u000d\u000a      more images of older women displayed in public -`I've thoroughly loved\u000d\u000a      this exhibition.

The research countered this, showing that those involved in\u000d\u000a      new forms of British feminism are concerned about many of the issues\u000d\u000a      associated with 1970s feminism (notably economic inequality and violence\u000d\u000a      against women).\u000d\u000a    In the second, complementary project, Hogan, Professor of Cultural\u000d\u000a      Studies &amp; Art Therapy, was co-investigator, contributing the visual\u000d\u000a      methodology employed and leading the visual art project stream of the Representing\u000a        Self Representing Ageing project (RSRA), an ESRC project within the\u000d\u000a      cross-council New Dynamics of Ageing Programme, conducted collaboratively\u000d\u000a      with the University of Sheffield. This included running practical\u000d\u000a      workshops, co-organising the launch, and liaising with the curator for\u000d\u000a      exhibition selection and management. The research comprised four projects\u000d\u000a      with different groups of older women. Over 30 research outputs were\u000d\u000a      produced between October 2009 and 2013. Responding to needs identified at\u000d\u000a      the Second World Assembly on Ageing (2002) to challenge stereotyped images\u000d\u000a      of ageing, particularly of older women, this study used creative arts to\u000d\u000a      interrogate images of ageing with a view to highlighting discrimination,\u000d\u000a      challenging stereotypes, and emphasising older women's capacity and\u000d\u000a      contribution to society. In doing so, it built upon Hogan's previous work\u000d\u000a      on gender and art therapy (which includes many articles and three edited\u000d\u000a      volumes; these books (Feminist Approaches to Art Therapy, 1997, Gender\u000a        Issues in Art Therapy, 2003, and Revisiting Feminist Approaches\u000d\u000a        to Art Therapy, 2012) are now established in the curriculum for the\u000d\u000a      training of art therapists.

The company works\u000a      with major companies such as Disney, Adultswim, Microsoft, Electronic\u000a      Arts, CapCom and many more, its games having been played across many\u000a      platforms by some 60 million people to date.\u000a    Parsler's research has directly shaped the design strategy of all of\u000a      Mediatonic's social or mobile game releases, having been applied to\u000a      several design briefs, some of which are detailed below. The research was\u000a      applied directly by Parsler (in authoring game mechanics) and indirectly\u000a      (in advising others) to eight separate projects, each a significant, well\u000a      financed endeavour. A full list of the impact achieved by this research\u000a      would be impossible within the available space. Two notable examples are\u000a      as follows:\u000a    Superbia (Disney, 2012): This game is aimed at early and\u000a      pre-teens and allows players to personalise their own space while\u000a      progressing through a series of pre-defined challenges. The whole of the\u000a      core structure of the game was devised with reference to the research\u000a      insights detailed above. Specifically, what were deployed in the game were\u000a      insights into the manner in which a sense of ownership of labour and\u000a      consumption within game activities can be experienced as amounting to an\u000a      impression of freedom on the part of the player. This allowed the design\u000a      to both grant the player the expected freedoms (they make\u000a      ice-cream, get paid, and buy clothes and furniture) but also to grant them\u000a      some real, deeper, freedoms (as to exactly how they choose to navigate the\u000a      game and present themselves to others), which ultimately led to a higher\u000a      level of overall satisfaction and led to the game offering less shallowly\u000a      `consumerist' a playing experience than would otherwise have been the\u000a      case. The game is free to play, has achieved a player base of more than\u000a      one million in the UK and is being launched across Europe. Games of this\u000a      kind frequently fail to understand that mere consumption alone is\u000a      not enough to create a meaningful experience (which is vital if players\u000a      are to engage with it every day for months or years) and fail to achieve\u000a      any market penetration. Even with the backing of a major corporation,\u000a      there are hundreds of examples of games of this kind that have failed both\u000a      commercially and artistically. The success of this example can be\u000a      attributed specifically to the implementation of the research insights\u000a      detailed above.\u000a    Amateur Surgeon: Bleed Everywhere (2012): This game is part\u000a      of Mediatonic's hugely successful Amateur Surgeon franchise (with 65\u000a      million + downloads). Following a `freemium' model, in which players can\u000a      play the game for free but pay for extra services, the percentage of\u000a      players that monetise (choose to pay) is one of the most significant\u000a      industry metrics.\u000a    [text removed for publication]\u000a    The game received a 2013 BAFTA nomination for best online browser game\u000a      and established Mediatonic as a world leader in freemium social gaming.\u000a    [text removed for publication]\u000a    The logic of the research in both cases suggested that more value would\u000a      be associated with rewards for which players were made to work harder than\u000a      is common practice in such games; and thus that when players were allowed\u000a      to pay to gain those rewards more quickly, they would pay more money more\u000a      frequently. The research, which focuses on the formal structures available\u000a      to implement such a system, informed the specific manner in which the\u000a      design team created a particular balance in the effort\/reward loop.\u000a    [text removed for publication]\u000a    The beneficiaries of this research are Mediatonic and the companies for\u000a      which it has produced these and other successful games, each of which has\u000a      benefitted commercially; also the wider constituencies of players who have\u000a      enjoyed an enhanced playing experience as a result of the improvement of\u000a      game design resulting from the application of the research insights.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research on forms of agency in digital games has been directly applied to\u000a      major game releases in Facebook and social-mobile development,\u000a      demonstrating substantial and measurable commercial impact with global\u000a      potential within a highly competitive industry. Specific research insights\u000a      have affected key aspects of the design of individual games, resulting in\u000a      higher than usual success rates for the titles involved. These insights\u000a      have also improved the playing experiences of large numbers of players, as\u000a      demonstrated by the level of take-up, creating a broader cultural impact.\u000a      The impact is significant, in substantially improving the performance of\u000a      games, and has extensive reach via the numbers of players who have\u000a      benefited from an improved experience.\u000a    To date the research has had impact on more than one million players and\u000a      helped to secure multiple contracts worth more than &#163;2 million for the\u000a      British game company Mediatonic.

The research, developed over several years in\u000a      the published material detailed below, offers important insights into the\u000a      nature of the balance between freedom of action and constraints in digital\u000a      games. It draws on and informs the formal structures (rules) of such\u000a      games, providing the first sustained taxonomy of the forms agency can take\u000a      within digital games. It is a powerful tool for the design of game\u000a      structures and has been successfully and repeatedly applied to major game\u000a      releases as well as further works in progress.\u000a    Parsler has applied a theoretical approach to game design to better\u000a      understand how the formal structures of a game create an experience that\u000a      seems to the player to be `free' but which &#8212; as in inherent in the medium\u000a      &#8212; has significantly to be constrained. The work builds on previous\u000a      research within game studies that has examined agency (if not always by\u000a      name) as well as more traditional philosophical perspectives (notably,\u000a      those related to questions of free will), combined with extensive\u000a      experience of game design. This combination of insights has enabled the\u000a      creation of game rules that allow for a particular impression of freedom &#8212;\u000a      a major aspect of gaming pleasure &#8212; within a structured experience.\u000a    That games constrain players while providing them with space to act\u000a      within defined parameters is not a new insight. But this is the first work\u000a      to look closely at what exactly that means at the level of the manner in\u000a      which formal game structures are created and to offer a sustained analysis\u000a      of such structures. This approach has produced both a general framework\u000a      for the understanding of game structures as a whole and, through more\u000a      focussed application, specific insights into the most appropriate rules to\u000a      use in certain circumstances.\u000a    Such application is wide ranging, but some specific examples include:\u000a    \u000a      How players perceive non-player characters (NPCs) within games to be\u000a        individuals in their own right, even when they are functions of the\u000a        code.\u000a      An understanding of the way ownership of in-game labour, purchase with\u000a        that labour and in-game consumption are equated with freedom within a\u000a        digital game setting.\u000a      How the act of creation, even when such creation may well be strongly\u000a        constrained and not `real' creation at all, can create a sense of\u000a        authorship of their experience on the part of the player.\u000a      How value is associated with the acquisition of virtual goods and\/or\u000a        progression within a game, and how something that feels to the player to\u000a        have been `earned' in this manner has much greater value to them than\u000a        would otherwise be the case.\u000a    \u000a    This research addresses issues relating to the fundamental nature of game\u000a      design and as such is detailed, nuanced and complex. Much of the research\u000a      requires it to be applied before its utility becomes apparent. Such\u000a      application is on-going and, while it has presently been applied mostly to\u000a      `freemium' model games, has much wider implication and utility within the\u000a      gaming industry.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"12396","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Petley's work on press regulation (and in particular on the matter of\u000a      privacy and press freedom) led to his being asked to give oral evidence to\u000a      the Department of Culture, Media and Sport joint committee in 2012 and to\u000a      the Press Complaints Commission's Governance Review in 2009. As a result\u000a      of his work on media freedom and regulation, he was asked by the Equality\u000a      and Human Rights Commission to comment on a draft of the Human Rights\u000a        Review 2012, and by the Director of Public Prosecutions to comment\u000a      on draft guidelines on the public interest for prosecutors involved in\u000a      cases involving journalists. He also gave evidence to the Making Good\u000a        Society report published by the Carnegie Trust.\u000a    In 2011 the Leveson Inquiry was established to investigate the role of\u000a      the press and police in the phone-hacking scandal, and more generally to\u000a      enquire into the culture, practices and ethics of the press. As the\u000a      concerns of the Inquiry were central to Petley's own work, he submitted\u000a      written evidence to it, and was subsequently invited to give oral\u000a      evidence. He is a founder member of Hacked Off (the campaign group created\u000a      in July 2011 that led to the setting up of the Inquiry in the first\u000a      place), and also of the Media Reform Coalition, which was set up by\u000a      academics and NGOs when the Inquiry was announced to help to coordinate\u000a      responses to Leveson. One of these NGOs is the Campaign for Press and\u000a      Broadcasting Freedom, of which he is co-chair, and which has campaigned\u000a      for years on precisely the issues of central concern to the Inquiry. In\u000a      the wake of the Leveson Inquiry he has intervened extensively in the\u000a      debate around how best to implement Leveson's proposals, and in this\u000a      respect he writes among others regularly for Inforrm, a highly respected\u000a      and authoritative blog which is run by Hugh Tomlinson QC, of Matrix\u000a      Chambers.\u000a    Petley has established a productive relationship with the BBFC, and\u000a      contributed (at their invitation) a substantial chapter to a book\u000a      published in 2012 by BFI\/Palgrave to mark the Board's centenary year. He\u000a      also wrote a chapter on current BBFC practice for the edited collection Controversial\u000a        Images. He has published lengthy interviews with both the current\u000a      Director and his two predecessors, and has regularly engaged in public\u000a      debates of one kind or another as a means of impacting upon public\u000a      perceptions of this aspect of the censorship process. In November 2012 he\u000a      took part in two discussions at the National Film Theatre season marking\u000a      the Board's centenary. These matters are extremely hard to quantify, but\u000a      he would certainly claim to have had impact on the relaxation of film and\u000a      video censorship in the UK since the late 1990s, and on the fact that\u000a      there have been no major moral panics over film and video violence during\u000a      the same period. In this respect, it is significant that he was asked by a\u000a      DVD distributor to help it with its submission of a particularly\u000a      controversial film to the BBFC (Cannibal Holocaust); this was\u000a      originally banned outright, then cut by over six minutes, but on this\u000a      submission it was cut by a mere sixteen seconds.\u000a    Petley's concern with censorship also led to his involvement in\u000a      high-profile campaigns in connection with the 2008 Criminal Justice and\u000a      Immigration Act, following evidence provided to the Home Office during\u000a      consultation preceding the measure. He was among a small group of\u000a      academics who briefed Liberal Democrat MPs in their attempt in April 2008\u000a      to amend clauses defining `extreme pornography'. On the basis of expertise\u000a      gained during the genesis of the Act, Petley has on several occasions\u000a      briefed the solicitor (Myles Jackman of Hodge, Jones and Allen) who has\u000a      taken the lead role in defending cases brought under these clauses since\u000a      they came into effect in January 2009. He has also acted as an expert\u000a      witness in a case involving internet material prosecuted under the Obscene\u000a      Publications Act. This came to court on 29 June 2009 and immediately\u000a      collapsed. All the cases in which he was involved were successfully\u000a      defended, demonstrating a direct impact on the outcome of these. He is a\u000a      member of the advisory board of Index on Censorship, and of a new\u000a      high-profile group, Censure, recently established by Myles Jackman to\u000a      challenge the government's apparent desire to extend still further\u000a      controls over material, both off- and on-line, which it considers to be\u000a      unacceptable. He has been invited to join the editorial board of the new\u000a      Taylor and Francis journal Porn Studies, which came about as\u000a      result of the Sexual Cultures conference at Brunel, which he helped to\u000a      organise. Petley was also a member of a small group of academics consulted\u000a      by Dr Tanya Byron when compiling her report Safer Children in a\u000a        Digital World, published in 2008.\u000a    In all of these cases, the main impact of Petley's interventions role has\u000a      been to inform public and political debate in key areas relating to\u000a      various forms of regulation that shape the nature of media content\u000a      consumed by the British population at large. These have included very\u000a      high-profile issues in which Petley's research-based arguments have gained\u000a      a strong voice in fora at the highest levels of national policy-making and\u000a      inquiry and in national media.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Julian Petley's research into media policy, regulation and\u000a      censorship has impacted on public policy debate through a number of\u000a      invitations to give evidence to the Joint Committee on Privacy and\u000a      Injunctions, the Press Complaints Commission's Governance Review, the\u000a      Crown Prosecution Service's consultation on prosecutions involving\u000a      communications sent via social media, and, most recently, the Leveson\u000a      Inquiry into the Culture, Practice and Ethics of the Press.

His initial\u000a      research findings in this area focused on the operation of film and video\u000a      censorship in the UK, examining in particular the workings of the British\u000a      Board of Film Classification (BBFC). Particularly as a result of his work\u000a      on the `video nasty' panic of the early 1980s, which was re-ignited in the\u000a      wake of the murder of James Bulger in 1993, his research has produced\u000a      ongoing insights into the role played by moral panics in legitimating\u000a      censorship, and in particular into the role played by the press,\u000a      politicians and moral entrepreneurs in helping to create and sustain such\u000a      panics. His research in these interlinked areas demonstrated that the UK\u000a      has among the strictest film and video censorship in Europe, that much of\u000a      the `effects' research which purports to justify such censorship is\u000a      questionable, and that film and video censorship in the UK needs to be\u000a      understood as an apparatus which involves far more than simply the\u000a      activities and policies of the BBFC.\u000a    He has written extensively about the provisions in the Criminal Justice\u000a      and Immigration Act 2008 which make it illegal even to possess what it\u000a      defines as `extreme pornography', and about Ofcom's refusal to allow\u000a      certain kinds of `adult' material to be shown, even late at night and in\u000a      encrypted form, on the television channels which it licences. His concern\u000a      with censorship has also led him to undertake research into attempts to\u000a      block and filter the internet, and to prosecute users of online material\u000a      which the authorities have deemed to be illegal. This has involved\u000a      research into the Internet Watch Foundation and the Authority for\u000a      Television on Demand. In particular, he has adduced evidence for the\u000a      arguments that, even in a democratic country such as the UK, the internet\u000a      is by no means the censor-free zone which it is commonly supposed to be,\u000a      and that surveillance of Internet users is increasingly being employed to\u000a      encourage them to self-censor their online activity.\u000a    From the early 1990s onwards, Petley's work offered insights into the\u000a      causes and consequences of the `de-regulation' of broadcasting by measures\u000a      such as the Broadcasting Act 1990 and the Communications Act, 2003. In\u000a      particular, his research provided evidence for the claim that the `de-regulation'\u000a\u0009  of British broadcasting threatened to make it much more like\u000a      the press, whose standards are generally regarded to be far lower than\u000a      those of the broadcast media. This, in turn, led Petley to undertake\u000a      research into the problems and shortcomings of the British press. In\u000a      particular his research has focussed on the extent to which the daily\u000a      press in Britain can be considered to be a `Fourth Estate', and the\u000a      efficacy or otherwise of the Press Complaints Commission as a form of\u000a      `self-regulation'. Ever since the Press Complaints Commission was\u000a      established in 1991, his research has repeatedly demonstrated that the PCC\u000a      is not a regulator (as it habitually claimed to be) but is simply a\u000a      mediator of complaints. It was thus particularly gratifying that, after\u000a      decades of denial, the PCC finally accepted this fact in front of Lord\u000a      Justice Leveson in January 2012. Petley's research has also demonstrated\u000a      that a press regulated solely by market forces will produce oligopoly,\u000a      overweening proprietor power, debased, market-driven journalism, and a\u000a      situation in which governments are liable to become subservient to media\u000a      barons. Again, thanks to the revelations which led the Leveson Inquiry,\u000a      and to the evidence laid before the Inquiry itself, this analysis is now a\u000a      great deal more widely accepted than it once was, and it is a mark of the\u000a      impact of Petley's work in the field of the press that he was asked to\u000a      give both written and oral evidence to the Inquiry. In the period\u000a      following the publication of Lord Justice Leveson's report, he has been\u000a      deeply engaged in efforts to try to ensure that its recommendations are\u000a      put into practice &#8212; through activities including lobbying, contributing to\u000a      several different blogs in the field, writing for the British\u000a        Journalism Review, and in his capacity as co-chair of the Campaign\u000a      for Press and Broadcasting Freedom and an active member of the pressure\u000a      groups Hacked Off and the Media Reform Coalition.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"12397","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    This research project had a positive and empowering impact on the diverse\u000a      group of volunteers who participated in the theatrical production in terms\u000a      of political consciousness and self-esteem, as demonstrated by their own\u000a      comments both in the film and outside. Audiences for both the theatrical\u000a      production and the documentary film also benefitted from an engagement\u000a      with the question of class that challenged dominant conceptions and which\u000a      enhanced their understanding of a major public issue at a time of\u000a      considerable social dislocation, as evidenced in responses during\u000a      screenings attended by the creators and comments posted on the film's\u000a      website.\u000a    Fifteen volunteers participated in the theatrical project. They ranged\u000a      from some in their teens to others in their 50s, which enabled the film to\u000a      explore problems for working people that are recycled across the\u000a      generations. Younger participants talk about how the project awoke an\u000a      interest in political issues and how it provided them with a framework to\u000a      understand things they only knew before somewhat inchoately or\u000a      intuitively. The project helped place individual experiences in a wider\u000a      class context, thus enhancing their knowledge of social and historical\u000a      determinations. Older participants talk of having their political\u000a      interests reawakened. In the documentary we see the participants telling\u000a      their stories &#8212; literally to the rest of the group for the first time,\u000a      then dramatising those stories in rehearsals and reflecting on these and\u000a      how the process of production got them thinking about the significance of\u000a      what happened in new ways. This process of production and\u000a      reflection is critical to the impact of the film itself because audiences\u000a      see the protagonists growing, learning and achieving something\u000a      important about their lives.\u000a    The theatrical performances (six in three cities) had a major impact on\u000a      the approximately 260 people who saw the shows, especially in Salford and\u000a      Manchester. Audiences recorded their favourable responses in a comments\u000a      book (pages of which can be found on the film website). Here is an\u000a      indicative example: `Great energy &#8212; sincerity &amp; REAL &#8212; well done.\u000a      Loved every second of it. It really makes you think.' The actress Sinead\u000a      Cusack saw the play in London and described it as `so moving and funny and\u000a      politically smart... the sort of things that should be heard and seen on\u000a      the stage'. The connection between Engels' text and the contemporary\u000a      situation, the authenticity of the performances and the representation of\u000a      class issues from a working class perspective, had a significant impact on\u000a      audiences. They were intellectually stimulated and emotionally moved by\u000a      the play.\u000a    The documentary film built upon the network of interest the theatrical\u000a      performance had generated. It premiered at the Salford Arts Theatre (as\u000a      the play had done) on April 5th 2013. The film was subsequently\u000a      shown in museums, cafes, bookshops, theatres, community centres,\u000a      independent cinemas and universities around the UK (and the Republic of\u000a      Ireland). More than 30 screenings to both working and middle class\u000a      audiences were organized between April-July 2013, viewed by more than\u000a      1,000 people. In this period the film sold 165 copies after screenings or\u000a      from the film website while another 95 were sold via the retailers\u000a      Bookmarks and Housemans. The film was sold by Bookmarks as part of a\u000a      special offer with Ken Loach's film Spirit of '45, to which it was\u000a      favourably compared in reviews and in post-screening Q&amp;As.\u000a    Most of the screenings were attended by Wayne and his co-director,\u000a      engaging audiences in discussions that increased the impact of the film as\u000a      a stimulator of debate and dialogue about class and representation.\u000a      Typically audiences spoke of how the film had `fired' them up and how\u000a      `incredibly powerful' they found the film. They were also fascinated to\u000a      learn about the unusual model that underpinned the making of the play.\u000a    The film focuses on the process of theatrical production and\u000a      audiences appreciated and understood that this was a metaphor for what can\u000a      be achieved by collective, collaborative work on the part of the working\u000a      class. As one review put it: `we see a sense of solidarity and\u000a      understanding develop through the realisation of shared experiences and\u000a      their common place in the class system. A hint of the strength that can\u000a      come through collective organising can be seen' (Left Unity website). Salford\u000a        Online described the film as `a real history lesson and a true\u000a      monument to Salford solidarity'. The Salford Star noted: `the film\u000a      shows...it's back to the days of Engels and poverty, with a bullet'. The\u000a      film also made an intervention into the heart of the political\u000a      establishment. Wayne and O'Neill published an article about the film in\u000a      the Labour Party newspaper Tribune. On the invitation of Labour MP\u000a      John McDonnell the film screened in the House of Commons on 11 June 2013.\u000a      Referring to `distortions' in our political system, McDonnell wrote: `This\u000a      film makes a significant contribution to tearing aside that veil of\u000a      distortion and manipulation'. Labour MP and historian Tristram Hunt wrote\u000a      in an email that the film `made me think about some of Engels' work in a\u000a      new way'. Trade unions recognised the relevance of its social and human\u000a      rights agenda to their members: the Irish Congress of Trade Unions invited\u000a      the film to be screened at their Festival of Ideas in June 2013 and the UK\u000a      TUC screened the film at Congress House to approximately 160 people. The\u000a      film also had an international reach &#8212; screening as part of the Workers\u000a      Unite! Film Festival in New York and selling around the world, including\u000a      Canada, America, Australia and Latin America. The depth of the film's\u000a      impact on some audiences is recorded on the film's website. Working class\u000a      audiences especially felt that the saliency of class as a lived experience\u000a      had been given an all-too rare expression by the film.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This unique theatrical and film project is based on the use of volunteers\u000a      to produce work inspired by a combination of their own experiences of\u000a      class and Friedrich Engels' book The Condition of the Working Class in\u000a        England. It created significant impact for those taking part,\u000a      offering beneficial new experiences of creative collaboration and\u000a      association, authoring their own stories and developing fresh\u000a      understandings of the wider context of their own individual experiences &#8212;\u000a      a process unprecedented in mainstream media that constitutes a significant\u000a      contribution to the documentary genre.

This revenue stream, provided by the Higher\u000a      Education Initiative Fund, is designed for projects that create a\u000a      reciprocal transfer of knowledge between academia and civil society. This\u000a      project was inspired by Friedrich Engels' book The Condition of the\u000a      Working Class in England written in 1844. The research hypothesis of the\u000a      project is that Engels' work retains strong relevance to contemporary\u000a      social conditions where the supposed `death of class' in public discourse\u000a      and consciousness does not correlate with the deeper realities of social\u000a      dislocation and cleavage in contemporary Britain. Class has very largely\u000a      disappeared from the academic agenda while within the mainstream media it\u000a      appears typically as desperately impoverished stereotypes. In particular,\u000a      with the domination of the media by a professional middle class with\u000a      increasingly attenuated connections to working people in a society where\u000a      stratification is deepening, working class people have little chance to be\u000a      agents in the process of representation. At the same time, with arts and\u000a      community theatre suffering from cuts in grants that have accelerated with\u000a      the onset of the 2007-8 economic crisis, the opportunities for working\u000a      people to express themselves creatively and to be the authors of their own\u000a      narratives, has dramatically decreased. The problem of cultural\u000a      representation is symptomatic of the problem of political representation\u000a      for working people with many commentators discussing the death of social\u000a      democracy and representative politics.\u000a    In order to a) demonstrate the research hypothesis concerning the\u000a      contemporary relevance of Engels' analysis of how class shapes the\u000a      everyday lives of working people, b) demonstrate the importance of working\u000a      class people telling their own stories and c) demonstrate the\u000a      critical\/reflective benefits to well-being of artistic expression and\u000a      creative collaboration, a unique film and theatre project was devised. An\u000a      open call was issued for volunteers in Salford and Manchester to come\u000a      together and produce a theatrical play based on their own classed\u000a      experiences and Engels' 1844 text. No previous theatrical experience was\u000a      necessary. The call attracted that strata of working class people that\u000a      Gramsci would have called the `organic intellectuals' &#8212; i.e. rooted in\u000a      working class life but educated or self educated beyond the compulsory\u000a      education system. The project was filmed by Wayne (and his co-director\u000a      Deirdre O'Neill) and this provided the narrative backbone to a documentary\u000a      film that charted the process of theatrical production and situated it\u000a      within a wider historical and social context using archive footage and\u000a      interviews with other Manchester and Salford people outside the theatre\u000a      project. This research project constructed what Walter Benjamin would have\u000a      called a 'constellation' between 1844 and today. This methodological\u000a      strategy illuminates the continuing class-stratified nature of\u000a      contemporary British society. Wayne and his co-director worked with an\u000a      artistic director to develop the play. Wayne &amp; O'Neill ensured that\u000a      the play developed within a framework inspired by the works of\u000a      director\/writers\/theorists John McGrath and Augusto Boal. These\u000a      practitioners were most appropriate given the working class and historical\u000a      scope of the project. The originality of the documentary film that emerged\u000a      from the theatre project is that it breaks from decades of documentary\u000a      storytelling that speaks on behalf of working people. Instead the film\u000a      allows working class people to tell their own stories, articulate their\u000a      own experiences, recognise the legitimacy of their identities, recover\u000a      their collective experience and memory from its marginalisation within the\u000a      public sphere and engage in cultural production that fosters their\u000a      creativity and imaginations. The film achieved these goals by its\u000a      participatory-observational methodology, unique collaboration between film\u000a      and theatre and subversion of the reality TV paradigm.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14046","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The main beneficiaries of the research have been archivists (BFI, BBC,\u000a      BBC Birmingham, MACE), industry professionals (Members of Women in Film\u000a      and Television), and members of the public, at both local and national\u000a      level. The project's main impacts are:\u000a    (1) Informing the ethics and practice of archiving and preservation in\u000a        television. One key focus of the research is archiving and media\u000a      practice in relation to the value and preservation of women's television\u000a      which has often been dismissed as ephemeral. The project's research has\u000a      directly impacted upon the preservation and availability of archival\u000a      holdings of women's television, highlighted the importance of gendered\u000a      categories of television in decisions about preservation and raised\u000a      awareness of the feminist politics of archiving.\u000a    Work in archives by members of the project team has already uncovered key\u000a      personnel (Doreen Stephen in particular) and untouched files such as those\u000a      in the BBC written archives on Wednesday Magazine (a little known\u000a      arts programme produced for women) which Irwin is helping to get\u000a      catalogued.Members of the team are working closely with key archivists in\u000a      the industry and have conducted a number of interviews with them,\u000a      including Steve Bryant and Lisa Kerrigan at the NFTVA, Garry Campbell at\u000a      BBC Birmingham, and Richard Shenton McQueen at MACE. These interviews have\u000a      enabled the team to establish the ways in which decisions have been taken\u000a      about the preservation of women's television and to enter into a dialogue\u000a      with the industry which will inform their practice. (A report written\u000a      specifically for industry and archivists will be produced at the end of\u000a      the project).\u000a    We have also formed a relationship with the Women in Film and Television\u000a      organisation and its Chief Executive. Wheatley and Wood gave a\u000a      presentation on early findings from the project to 25 key female industry\u000a      personnel (from SKY, Virgin, BBC and ITV) on 21\/9\/11 at the Theatre's\u000a      Trust, London. The organisation has since collaborated on a public\u000a      engagement event at the BFI in London and contributed to our conference in\u000a      May 2013 `Television for Women: International Perspectives' where the team\u000a      disseminated findings to reach an international audience.\u000a    In June 2012 the team organised an event called `Career Girls on the\u000a      Small Screen' at the BFI Southbank, featuring a presentation by Rachel\u000a      Moseley and Helen Wheatley, extracts from archive shows featuring working\u000a      women such as The Rag Trade, Compact and The Liver\u000a        Birds, and a panel discussion with prominent women in television,\u000a      including Abi Morgan (writer of The Hour), Hilary Samon (executive\u000a      producer of Silk) and Amanda Redman (actress), chaired by Kate\u000a      Kinnimont of WFTV.This was an enormously successful event, filling 112 of\u000a      a possible 134 seats in National Film Theatre 3 and the postcards filled\u000a      in by the audience, and follow-up emails received by the team indicate\u000a      that its research encouraged people to think about the representation of\u000a      women on television in new ways. The BFI's TV programmer reported that the\u000a      event had provided `a greater understanding of the way women have been\u000a      represented historically at work on TV' and that the project offered `new\u000a      critical tools of analysis to better understand patterns across television\u000a      history'. The media industry participants also expressed that the event\u000a      had made them think differently about the ways in which television\u000a      represented working women. The event was featured in `The Cultural\u000a      Highlights you have to see' section of the `i' newspaper (20.6.2012).\u000a    Connecting women with their television history and cultural heritage.\u000a      The project has had a Facebook page since 2011, a Twitter presence and a\u000a      blog. Through existing networks and the placement of a Facebook ad, the\u000a      page now has a growing and lively community and is active every day, with\u000a      members discussing and sharing their memories of and thoughts about\u000a      women's television past and present.\u000a    This use of social media together with a range of press opportunities and\u000a      public engagement events, has shared the research with the wider national\u000a      public, extending its `reach'. Adverts for participants to interview were\u000a      placed in Women's Weekly, Yours, Saga, TV Times and The\u000a        Lady. Yours ran a small feature with the advert. Rachel\u000a      Moseley was invited to talk about the project on Radio 4's Woman's Hour on\u000a      19\/8\/11 and links to the project webpages and Facebook page appeared on\u000a      the website. Following this a report by Chris Arnot about the project\u000a      appeared in the Education Guardian 5\/9\/11. The project has also\u000a      prompted stories in local press, including the Coventry Evening\u000a        Telegraph and the West Briton. From this publicity women\u000a      came forward to take part in the study.\u000a    The project's other major and most innovative impact strategy to connect\u000a      the project to the wider public's sense of television heritage has been a\u000a      `pop-up' exhibition in conjunction with ArtSpace\/Coventry City Council.\u000a      The `shop' ran for the calendar month of May 2012 and looked at the\u000a      relationships between women viewers and television pop music programming.\u000a      Featuring documents, artefacts, quotes from the research findings, and a\u000a      video feed of archive television, this exhibition enabled members of the\u000a      public to share their memories via a visitor's book, postcards and short\u000a      `on the spot' interviews, and led to some longer, in-depth interviews\u000a      following the event. Impact was measured via questionnaire postcards and a\u000a      visitor's book which logged visitors' reactions to the exhibition. This\u000a      showed not only that people had learned from the exhibition and had a\u000a      better understanding of British television history as a result of their\u000a      visit, but also that people valued the opportunity to revisit their own\u000a      memories of television and that they valued the chance to find out about\u000a      academic research. The `pop-up shop' attracted media coverage locally\u000a      being featured in the Coventry Evening Telegraph (27.4.2012; daily\u000a      circulation 31,000) and on BBC Coventry and Warwickshire radio (30.4.2012,\u000a      average 86,000 weekly listeners, BBC figures).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This AHRC-funded research project examining the production and\u000a      consumption of women's television in Britain between 1947 and 1989 has\u000a      documented, for the first time, the development of programmes made\u000a      explicitly for a female audience, their production culture and the\u000a      responses of female audiences.

Her research into\u000a      television and audiences has been published widely and she is widely known\u000a      through two seminal book length studies which were written during her time\u000a      at DMU: Talking With Television (2009), and (with Beverley Skeggs)\u000a      Reacting to Reality Television (2012) (from the ESRC funded 'Making\u000a      Class and Self through Televised Ethical Scenarios' project, undertaken in\u000a      collaboration with Skeggs and Thumim). In these studies, Wood developed a\u000a      `text-in-action' methodology to capture the dynamic nature of television\u000a      viewing, emphasising the importance of method selection to the\u000a      understanding of this kind of data, and drawing attention to the form\u000a      as well as the content of participants' responses: see 'Oh\u000a      goodness, I am watching reality TV' (Skeggs, Wood and Thumim, 2008).\u000a    The next stage in the research was to undertake a diachronic, historical\u000a      study of the distinctive interaction of women viewers with this new form\u000a      of domestic technology. Wood was approached by colleagues at Warwick\u000a      University to apply collaboratively for AHRC funding to research\u000a      television programming made for and watched by female audiences during a\u000a      significant period of British television history: 1947-1989. Prof Helen\u000a      Wood (co-Investigator) and PhD student Hazel Collie were based at De\u000a      Montfort University. The Principal Investigator Dr Rachel Moseley,\u000a      co-investigator Dr Helen Wheatley and Post-Doctoral Research Fellow Dr\u000a      Mary Irwin were based at Warwick University. It is from this AHRC funded\u000a      collaborative project (running from September 2010 to April 2014) between\u000a      De Montfort and Warwick Universities that the reported impacts were\u000a      realised\u000a    This project had three key strands: 1) Interrogating the television\u000a      production culture and policy which produced a strong vein of programming\u000a      for women, through sources such as the BBC written archives and the ITC\u000a      collection at the BFI (archival work on which was conducted by Irwin at\u000a      Warwick); 2) documenting, using listings magazines, popular publications\u000a      for women, and television archives, the factual and dramatic programming\u000a      that was addressed specifically to a female viewer, to establish and\u000a      attempt to protect what is available in the archives (archival work by\u000a      Irwin at Warwick, textual analysis by whole team); and 3) conducting\u000a      interviews with women from different generations across Britain during\u000a      2011-12 to obtain 30 oral histories detailing their memories of television\u000a      during the period in question. These interviews used the theoretical\u000a      paradigms developed in Wood's previous research to explore the role of\u000a      television in women's personal narratives, examining the importance of\u000a      television in personal relationships and the domestic sphere and\u000a      uncovering the significance of less typically `feminine' genres such as\u000a      sport, music programming and natural history (conducted by Collie and Wood\u000a      at De Montfort). The overall result of the research has been a deeper\u000a      understanding of women's interaction with television, and a greater\u000a      awareness of the need to preserve the archive of televisual history as a\u000a      resource for future historians of twentieth century history and culture.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14825","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"732800","Name":"Bulgaria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Our work has had impact in this area through three principal activities:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aPublic engagement &#8212; using our skills as public historians, and\u000a        through collaborative work with regional and national organisations, to\u000a        deploy archives, archive-based research and archive-based multimedia\u000a        products to increase public engagement and understanding of media and\u000a        cultural history;\u000a      \u000aMedia production &#8212; using our skills as media and cultural\u000a        historians and as media producers to produce exemplar multimedia\u000a        products built upon archive material, as well as new forms of\u000a        crowd-sourced archives;\u000a      \u000aAdvisory roles &#8212; using our expertise as users and exploiters of\u000a        archive material and contributing to public advisory and policy bodies\u000a        to extend the digitisation and cataloguing of archives, widen access to\u000a        archives, and promote the use of archives in new multimedia products.\u000a    \u000a    These activities have expanded during the survey period, as emergent\u000a      researchers have joined the Heritage, History and Archives team, and as\u000a      the number and variety of the organisations with which we work has\u000a      increased. The resultant expansion in the significance and reach of our\u000a      work can be seen in a number of specific examples. Collectively this work\u000a      represents a commitment to collaboration and co-curation with a variety of\u000a      institutions and communities of interest, and it has contributed to the\u000a      enhancement of cultural life, public debate and policy, and professional\u000a      practice.\u000a    This increase in scale of impact can be seen clearly in our public\u000a      engagement work. Long, for instance, has been engaged in a long-term\u000a      partnership with the Library of Birmingham (LofB), which holds archives of\u000a      Charles Parker and Philip Donnellan material associated with their radio\u000a      and film documentary productions, and BBC Midlands, which has extensive\u000a      holdings of hitherto unused broadcast and production materials. As the\u000a      Metadata Service Delivery Manager of BBC Information and Archives and the\u000a      Collection Curator at the Library of Birmingham, testify, Long has been\u000a      central to realising key institutional initiatives to increase public\u000a      awareness of local-held archives and the region's cultural heritage. Long\u000a      has been a keynote speaker at the annual Charles Parker Day. inaugurated\u000a      in 2004 in collaboration with the Charles Parker Trust, and he organised\u000a      the 2005 and 2007 events when they took place in Birmingham. As the\u000a      aforementioned make clear in their testimonials, both the knowledge and\u000a      skills Long developed in his work on Parker and Donnellan, and regional\u000a      BBC production in general, have had a significant impact on the way\u000a      important holdings in the Library of Birmingham and the BBC are organised\u000a      and deployed. This included work as part of projects funded by Screen West\u000a      Midlands (SWM). Long's leadership of the Home, Identity and\u000a        Citizenship &#8212; The Films of Philip Donnellan project led to the\u000a      employment of a specialist media archivist to secure and organise the\u000a      collection, developing professional skills amongst LofB staff, and a range\u000a      of events, media coverage and social media interaction. This approach was\u000a      manifest also in the establishment of an SWM-funded website (from 2006)\u000a      dedicated to Donnellan research and dissemination. This research\u000a      underwrote a further project funded under the UK Film Council `Digital\u000a      Film Archive Fund' (DFAF). In turn, a further aim was to use the project\u000a      as a lever to reach the kinds of audiences that Donnellan's work\u000a      incorporated &#8212; particularly those in migrant and marginalised communities.\u000a      Long introduced screenings of films that reached a total audience of more\u000a      than 500, and featured in the BBC early evening magazine programme `Inside\u000a      Out'. Audience figures for this feature are conservatively estimated at\u000a      350,000. Research and retrieval work on Parker and Donnellan's practice\u000a      and productions directly informed the creative work of artist Denis\u000a      Buckley and the articulation of migrant experiences for contemporary\u000a      audiences in the form of `The Bohola Men' (http:\/\/www.denisbuckley.com).\u000a      In 2010-11, this production appeared at the Tulca Season of Visual Art,\u000a      Galway, Ireland; Live Words, Whitechapel Gallery, London; Sprint\u000a        Festival, Camden People's Theatre, London; and at Rich Mix, London.\u000a    The team have also been centrally involved in the organisation of a\u000a      number of similar public engagement events. These include: It Came\u000a        From Pebble Mill (2010), organised in partnership with the BBC and 7\u000a      Inch Cinema, and featuring screenings and talks based upon research from\u000a      BCU about BBC regional productions; Film Heritage, Digital Future:\u000a        Practice and Sustainability for the Film Archive Sector (2011),\u000a      which brought film and television archivists together; Jazz and the\u000a        Media (2010 &amp; 2011), focusing on the production of media\u000a      histories of jazz and including contributions from the production team of\u000a      the BBC's Jazz Britannia; and The Tube (2012), which drew\u000a      on archival broadcast material and contributions from members of the\u000a      production team to examine the significance of the 1980s Channel 4 popular\u000a      music show.\u000a    We have also drawn on our skills as media producers and worked in\u000a      collaboration with other production companies to create and distribute\u000a      radio productions, films and websites which present the findings of\u000a      earlier research. These productions are also examples of practice-based\u000a      research, and often emerge from other initiatives, or collaborations with\u000a      individuals or institutions in our iterative process of research and KT.\u000a      This is manifest in Collins' co-production with swish of Made\u000a        in Birmingham (2010). This DFAF-funded film is built upon research\u000a      within the centre and dedicated to retrieving and celebrating cultures\u000a      centred on reggae, punk and bhangra and the migrant and marginalized\u000a      communities who produced this music and participated in associated scenes.\u000a      The film repurposed archival footage and music and has been screened\u000a      locally, nationally and internationally. Locally, the film featured as\u000a      part of the reopening in 2010 of the Midland Art Centre, which attracted\u000a      35,000 visitors (www.macarts.co.uk\/about-mac\/).\u000a      Across 21 festivals from 2010 onwards, it has been seen by audiences of\u000a      around 55,000 people. Our theoretical positions on historical narratives\u000a      and archiving practice have also had an impact through The Birmingham\u000a        Music Archive, which has cultivated a broad community of amateur\u000a      archivists involved in the co-curation of memories of popular music\u000a      practices. Users have generated 1395 uploads across 588 posts and there is\u000a      a subscriber list of 285 contributors. The site attracts on average 1000\u000a      visitors per week. Likewise, the Pebble Mill film and website,\u000a      funded by DFAF and developed by Jackson, makes available original oral\u000a      history material in the form of interviews and artefacts. This curatorial\u000a      activity is echoed in her management of social media, through which she\u000a      has gathered together a community of interest of former BBC employees. In\u000a      all, she has engaged over 1000 participants, who together have built a\u000a      digital archive in the absence of any formal material testimony to what\u000a      was once a major hub of cultural production.\u000a    Long's archival research led to his engagement as Chair of the British\u000a      Library Sound Archive User Panel (2008-9) and, along with Wall, ongoing\u000a      membership of the UK Radio Archive Advisory Committee (UKRAAC, est. 2011,\u000a      see: http:\/\/ukradioarchives.com), also hosted by the British Library. The\u000a      User Panel promoted access to sound resources amongst researchers and for\u000a      wider educational use with Long aiding in the organisation of a public\u000a      event at BL and a national competition for BL users. UKRAAC includes\u000a      representatives from academia and the radio production sector, and has set\u000a      itself the ambitious aim of establishing a British Radio Archive as well\u000a      as establishing processes to archive an ongoing sample of all British\u000a      radio broadcasts. UKRAAC has also been influential in policy terms. The\u000a      committee has most recently lobbied key DCMS officials on the issue of\u000a      radio archives, the results of which we hope will be apparent in the next\u000a      communication bill to go through Parliament.\u000a    Collins has taken on a role as a board member of the Community Archives\u000a      &amp; Heritage Group a National Advisory Board for the archives sector and\u000a      also sits on the Heritage Committee of Birmingham Civic Society, and his\u000a      work on music heritage informed a consultation by Birmingham City Council\u000a      on the value of popular music industries and culture for the local\u000a      economy. Research into broadcasting and music history has also informed\u000a      the practices of Vivid Projects as a result of the Participation\u000a      project, which reached 471 local visitors and was disseminated to partners\u000a      in Germany, Bulgaria and the Netherlands (http:\/\/www.vividprojects.org.uk\/programme\/participation\/).\u000a      Long sits on the board of Vivid and, along with Collins, has contributed\u000a      to a further three archiving, media and music events which draw upon\u000a      research and expertise and which have engaged over 200 visitors in person\u000a      and 62, 530 people through online sites such as Facebook, Vivid Projects\u000a      and the O2 Academy.\u000a    Collins and Long have employed music heritage research and insights into\u000a      online practices of curation and file sharing to inform their leadership\u000a      of a &#8364;25,000 European Commission-funded project under the Leonardo da\u000a      Vinci programme, involving partners from across the EU in educational,\u000a      private and public sectors. `Innovative Media and Music Heritage Impacting\u000a      Vocational Education' maintains an online resource that captures insights\u000a      from research visits and contributions to industry and policy-oriented\u000a      events, such as Berlin Music Week and Eurosonic at Groningen (http:\/\/www.immhive.org).\u000a    The cumulative impact of these projects is to aid in the retrieval of\u000a      neglected cultural histories, the engagement of substantial new audiences\u000a      in exploiting the possibilities of digital communities and, above all, an\u000a      insistence upon the value of such stories and the meaning of popular\u000a      culture.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    We have worked as media and cultural historians, archive experts and\u000a      media producers, and collaborated with a variety of public institutions\u000a      and communities of interest, to draw attention to neglected histories, to\u000a      respond to the opportunities afforded by new digital technologies, to\u000a      disseminate archived material, and to interpret it for wide audiences.\u000a      Through our work we have contributed to an improvement in the\u000a      understanding and practice of media history, in particular the exploration\u000a      and archiving of, and engagement with, the popular cultural artefacts\u000a      which index its lived experience.

Our underpinning knowledge comes\u000a      from a breadth of research and knowledge exchange activities undertaken by\u000a      members of the team, including media and cultural history research using\u000a      archives, analysis and theorisation of mediated histories, and work on\u000a      online communities of interest. The research activities themselves\u000a      established or deepened a series of important collaborations with\u000a      individual and institutional partners outside the university, or engaged\u000a      and interacted with wider communities of interest. It is therefore both\u000a      the outputs and processes of research which form the basis of our impact\u000a      in this area. The focus of this archive work has most often been on the\u000a      tension between popular and formal media practices, the attempts of\u000a      professional media workers to engage with popular forms of production, and\u000a      the democratic potential of creative work and its potential conflict with\u000a      `official' cultural institutions. This research pre-dates and runs through\u000a      the survey period, although some is awaiting publication.\u000a    Long's research on innovative if neglected BBC radio producer Charles\u000a      Parker (1), his monograph on the aesthetics of class (2), and his\u000a      retrieval and celebration of the work of filmmaker Philip Donnellan (3)\u000a      are key examples of the way we have employed written and broadcast\u000a      archives. Long's work in particular explores a variety of historical\u000a      projects designed to understand working-class and popular culture, to map\u000a      it and, in the face of a variety of perceived challenges, maintain its\u000a      integrity. This research comes from a tradition of postwar social history\u000a      and cultural studies and an allied interest in creative production\u000a      and popular practice beyond the academy. The retrieval activity of\u000a      Long's work on Donnellan is anchored in a research-based website (http:\/\/www.philipdonnellan.co.uk)\u000a      which continues to `expand upon and explore the neglected place of\u000a      Donnellan in the documentary tradition'.\u000a    Professor Tim Wall has also produced a number of studies which make\u000a      similar use of neglected primary material, including studies of jazz on US\u000a      and UK radio, and his collaborative studies with Dr Nick Webber on the\u000a      social use of the transistor radio and headphones. Like Long's 2011 study\u000a      of the popular music cultures and business of UK student unions, this work\u000a      often draws upon scattered material from informal sources, and highlights\u000a      the need for more systematic digitisation and archiving of popular media\u000a      products and of cultural activity. This work is, in turn, linked to\u000a      outputs investigating the nature of popular cultural heritage, on which\u000a      Long has collaborated with Jez Collins (4).\u000a    Long and Wall have also produced a number of studies of the mediation of\u000a      popular music history, including the BBC's Britannia series of\u000a      music documentaries (3), television histories of jazz, and their 2013\u000a      study of the work of Tony Palmer. In turn the key ideas of totalising\u000a      histories, narrative themes and rhetorical tropes have been the foundation\u000a      of practice-based work in video and online production. Examples here would\u000a      include work by Collins, which is realised in the film Made in\u000a        Birmingham (2010) and the online Birmingham Music Archive\u000a      (established 2008), as well as Vanessa Jackson's video and online What\u000a        Was Pebble Mill? project (launched 2010), which aims to document all\u000a      aspects of the historical production cultures of this important BBC studio\u000a      (http:\/\/www.pebblemill.org).\u000a    Engagement with archival research into neglected histories is also\u000a      apparent in Long's role with Vivid Projects' Participation\u000a      initiative, which sought to retrieve the story and forgotten work of the\u000a      Birmingham Film and Video Workshop (BFVW). Long contributed research to\u000a      the project catalogue, which in turn has informed a journal article\u000a      produced in conjunction with gallery director and BFVW founder (5). This\u000a      work suggests how the re-inscription in the wider account of the workshop\u000a      movement of the work of BFVW is important for understanding the structure\u000a      of the history of independent production in film and television, as well\u000a      as a wider democratic participation in cultural work.\u000a    Our impact in this area is also informed by a broader interest within the\u000a      Birmingham Centre for Media and Cultural Research in the way online\u000a      practices of sharing and modularisation build communities of interest,\u000a      often led by taste makers, around what the traditional media have come to\u000a      call user-generated content. Studies by Wall, extending on a collaboration\u000a      with Prof Andrew Dubber, have been particularly valuable here (6).\u000a    Much of the research and impact work has been possible because a number\u000a      of funded projects involving outreach and public engagement activities\u000a      which include:\u000a    2007-8: AHRC\/BBC KE Pilot: `Listener online engagement with BBC radio\u000a      programming'.\u000a    2008-10: AHRC KTF: `New Strategies for Radio and Music Organisations'.\u000a    2010: Digital Film Archive Fund &#8212; Screen West Midlands\/UK Film Council. 3\u000a      projects: `Philip Donnellan Archive'; `What Was Pebble Mill?'; `Made in\u000a      Birmingham'.\u000a    2011-13: EU Lifelong Learning Programme &#8212; Leonardo Partnership\u000a      `Innovative Media and Music Heritage Impacting Vocational Education'.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14826","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"3625428","Name":"Venezuela"},{"GeoNamesId":"226074","Name":"Uganda"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Impact in this area has been achieved through three principal activities:\u000a    \u000a      \u000adissemination, through 44 reports and other publications, a\u000a        variety of online social media activity including well-respected\u000a        industry blogs (for example, Dubber's contributions at\u000a        newmusicstrategies.org), and nearly 100 presentations at industry events\u000a        and symposia;\u000a      \u000aknowledge exchange and transfer activities, directly with 102\u000a        music and radio organisations, often as part of externally-funded\u000a        projects listed in section 2, and through our delivery of the\u000a        university's strategy for business engagement;\u000a      \u000ataking roles in significant organisations in the field,\u000a        including Wall's role on a British Council digital R&amp;D delegation to\u000a        China in 2013, Dubber's appointment in 2013 as expert advisor to the\u000a        European Commission's 'ICT &amp; Art' Horizon 2020 Initiative at the NEM\u000a        Summit (http:\/\/nem-summit.eu\/about\/),\u000a        and Dubber and Collins' position as board members for Un-convention from\u000a        2009.\u000a    \u000a    This impact has continued throughout the survey period, during which time\u000a      it has shown growth in both significance and reach. This growth, and the\u000a      scale and depth of the most recent impact of our research, can be seen in\u000a      specific examples.\u000a    Growing significance\u000a    The increase in significance of our impact can be demonstrated with\u000a      reference to a contrast of our work with two indicative organisations in\u000a      2008-9 and two in 2012-13. Here we have worked with small independent\u000a      labels, especially in niche markets where it has been traditionally\u000a      difficult to make a living, and with innovative companies taking a new\u000a      approach to retailing music online.\u000a    Fat Northerner, a Manchester-based social enterprise record\u000a      company with a global reach and Brownswood Recordings, a\u000a      London-based record company run by a BBC radio DJ, were typical of the 29\u000a      partners Wall, Dubber, Long and Coley worked with on the AHRC-funded\u000a      Knowledge Transfer Fellowship in New Strategies for Radio and Music\u000a      Organisations. We helped Fat Northerner build online communities\u000a      around their catalogue of locally-produced experimental and alternative\u000a      music. The label staff indicate that they learnt a lot about the\u000a      possibilities of online culture and the cultural value of music to their\u000a      audience, but there was only a small impact on the company's finances.\u000a      Following our iterative process, we refined our approach, and towards the\u000a      end of this 2-year project, we made a much more significant impact on Brownswood\u000a        Recordings. Here we used key ideas about tastemakers and collective\u000a      online activities to help the company mobilise its consumer base to engage\u000a      consumers online. As the co-owner of Brownswood, remarked in a\u000a      testimonial letter, `The work you undertook in this project was invaluable\u000a      to us in analysing and developing our audience interaction... these things\u000a      have played a major part in the growth of our business and the increase in\u000a      our audience, which has seen the numbers double since the start of the\u000a      project'.\u000a    Thus the significance, in terms of the explicit outcomes linked to our\u000a      work and, ultimately, the direct result of our research, has grown in\u000a      substantial terms through 2012-13. This can be seen clearly in our most\u000a      recent work with Edition Records, a jazz record company with a\u000a      Europe-wide consumer base, where we supported the label owner in shifting\u000a      his business model to one of online sales, and in developing new ways to\u000a      engage jazz fans as customers. This three-month AHRC-funded project,\u000a      delivered by Barber under Wall's guidance, produced substantial impact.\u000a      Since the project began in February 2013, there have been 20,000 new\u000a      streams of Edition recordings and 2,200 new followers on\u000a      Soundcloud, as well as 2,500 new followers on Twitter and 400 new likes on\u000a      Facebook. Drawing on our collective research into online culture, we\u000a      helped Stapleton focus on opportunities to sell music to a younger, more\u000a      digitally engaged audience by digitising and uploading the entire Edition\u000a      catalogue to the Bandcamp music service. This resulted in 15,000 new\u000a      streams, over &#163;1,500 in digital sales and over &#163;1,200 in physical sales,\u000a      at least doubling the label's business. We also collaborated with Edition\u000a      to create a weekly podcast that is published through iTunes. There have\u000a      been over 2,000 downloads of the podcast via iTunes, plus over 1,700\u000a      streams of episodes via Soundcloud. The show has already been featured\u000a      several times by Apple in the iTunes store and is receiving positive\u000a      reviews from the fan community. We helped the label to enhance its\u000a      presence on YouTube, developing `behind the scenes` content for their\u000a      channel to further engage listeners. We have observed over 20,000 new\u000a      plays on this channel, and over 200 new subscribers. Finally, we developed\u000a      plans for a new Edition website set within the principles for online\u000a      engagement we developed through research, aiming to articulate the label's\u000a      philosophy online and more effectively integrate social media services.\u000a      The site was completed and launched on 15 October 2013, attracting over\u000a      10,000 new visitors to the editionrecords.com website. Barber and Wall's\u000a      work with Edition is paralleled by Dubber's involvement with Bandcamp;\u000a      a successful online platform for independent music, featuring over a\u000a      million albums, and representing hundreds of thousands of artists. The\u000a      core architecture and strategy of the site was based on Dubber's popular\u000a      ebook 'The 20 Things You Must Know About Music Online', itself born from\u000a      Wall and Dubber's research into the digital music ecosystem. Today, Bandcamp\u000a      makes over $2m for independent musicians every month.\u000a    Increasing Reach\u000a    As well as working directly with SMEs we have had an equally significant\u000a      cultural impact through contributions to organisations engaged with an\u000a      increasingly international focus. Firstly, we have developed expertise\u000a      around specialist music markets and communities, especially those involved\u000a      in public broadcasting and live music and, secondly, we have worked with\u000a      communities around the world to develop support for public radio, the\u000a      independent music sector, and organisations involved in music for social\u000a      change.\u000a    At the start of the survey period, Wall and Dubber were already in\u000a      involved in a knowledge exchange project with the BBC, which\u000a      allowed us to study production practices within their specialist music\u000a      programming and interactive media departments, and to draw upon our\u000a      earlier research on online fan communities to make recommendations to\u000a      programme makers and managers. Our widely circulated BBC report\u000a      and presentation initially received a varied response across departments\u000a      but it is notable that the research-informed principles we espouse -\u000a      modularisation, tastemakers, communities - have since become prominent in\u000a      the BBC's approach to specialist music. Equally, our notion of\u000a      community lies at the heart of our work with the Scarborough Jazz\u000a        Festival in September 2009, where Barber, Collins, Dubber and Wall\u000a      worked with key festival staff and musicians to producer user-generated\u000a      content and multi-narrative texts, in order to extend the experience of\u000a      the festival to an international audience through the Just Like Jazz\u000a      website (justlikejazz.org) we established. These approaches also lay at\u000a      the heart of our work with the international online project Aftershock,\u000a      allowing audiences to engage with a community of musicians through\u000a      individualised documentary content as they used workshops to prepare for a\u000a      live event.\u000a    The most significant extension of the reach of our research impact can be\u000a      found in our work with the international independent music network\u000a      Un-convention from 2009 onwards, through the Music Basti project\u000a      in 2010, and most recently with Fora do Eixo in Brazil. The role\u000a      that Collins and Dubber have on the advisory board of Un-convention\u000a      addresses these notions of engagement with music, and the impact of our\u000a      research-based ideas around music as a tool for social change and music as\u000a      culture are articulated in that organisation's work. This is evidenced in\u000a      the initiation of cultural archiving projects in Venezuela with Proyecto\u000a      de Caracas Memorabilia\u000a      (http:\/\/proyectocaracasmemorabilia.wordpress.com),\u000a      and Uganda with The UG - Hiphop - Archivist\/Celebrate your History\u000a      (https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/TheUgHiphopArchivistCelebrateYourHistory\u000a      - also referenced in our\u000a      other case study) and the short film In the Streets of Medellin\u000a      (http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_uMDonRucMk).\u000a      Our insights into how people engage online\u000a      have also been instrumental in Un-Convention's recent 33RPM: Voices of\u000a        the Revolution\u000a      (http:\/\/33rpmvoices.wordpress.com),\u000a      a free digital-download album created, produced and\u000a      disseminated by Un-Convention's global network of tastemakers and their\u000a      respective communities\u000a      through multiple social media platforms. In the first week of its release\u000a      it attracted an audience of\u000a      6,110 people, who downloaded and streamed the album on Bandcamp\u000a      (http:\/\/33rpmvoices.bandcamp.com\/).\u000a      Monkey on the Roof was a project based on the research Dubber undertook\u000a      into digital media as vernacular forms and his collaborative,\u000a      practice-based work on music as a tool for social change. We recorded an\u000a      album of songs by children affected by extreme poverty in Delhi, and used\u000a      Flip video cameras to document the process and promote the album. This was\u000a      then put on sale online to raise money for the Music Basti\u000a      charity, which facilitated the workshops. The project raised awareness for\u000a      the charity, along with several hundred pounds in donations, and shared a\u000a      whole set of new approaches and thinking amongst the organisation's\u000a      members. Dubber's work with Music Basti continues through the 360 Deal\u000a      book project (http:\/\/the360deal.com).\u000a      Likewise, his recent research into the alternative economics of the global\u000a      independent music industries has centred on the Fora do Eixo\u000a      collectives in Brazil and he is currently making a documentary, 'Occupy\u000a      Music', with the film production company Blue Hippo. This is currently\u000a      being edited for broadcast and general release.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    We have worked with over 100 music and radio organisations to help them\u000a      meet the challenges which have arisen due to innovations in distribution\u000a      consumption and interaction technologies.

The team specialise in the study of popular music\u000a      and music radio, and the interactions between institutions, technologies\u000a      and culture, with a specific relationship to online communities. The\u000a      origins of this research pre-date the survey period, but our work has\u000a      entered the public domain within the period, or is awaiting publication.\u000a    Our research centre specialises in applied research and knowledge\u000a      exchange, and this drives a model of working which is iterative: each act\u000a      of KE generates new research data, which inform further acts of KE. Wall\u000a      was accorded professorial status in 2006 and promoted to Professor II in\u000a      2012 on the foundation of this work. Andrew Dubber started collaborative\u000a      work with Wall as a senior lecturer in 2004, and became a reader (2009),\u000a      and then professor (2012) in recognition of his significant external role\u000a      in music industries innovation. Simon Barber joined the group as a\u000a      post-doctoral researcher in 2009, Sam Coley and Jez Collins have made\u000a      important contributions as early career researchers with strong\u000a      professional backgrounds, and Paul Long, who became a reader based upon\u000a      his research and KT work during the survey period, has been central to our\u000a      wider digital R&amp;D agenda. The underpinning research can thus be found\u000a      in individual scholarship by each author, along with several significant\u000a      collaborative pieces. The sample of this work detailed in section 3\u000a      reflects Wall's originating interest in this area, work by Dubber and\u000a      Wall, and by Barber, on the relationships between audiences, music and\u000a      radio, and Dubber's work on music for social change. This foundational\u000a      research can also be found in wider scholarship on the history of the\u000a      mediation of music and its relationship to technological change, work to\u000a      which the whole team has contributed.\u000a    Our impact arises principally from the following insights: that the\u000a      changing relationship between music and cultural practice is a\u000a      manifestation of changing technologies, currently related to digital and\u000a      online platforms; that people's engagement with music online is a communal\u000a      one; and that successful music and radio industry organisations must\u000a      understanding the complex relationship between their audience\/customers\u000a      and music, and the way that communities balance understandings of music as\u000a      a cultural good and as a commodity. These insights can be articulated\u000a      through three activities: modularisation of content, in response to a\u000a      changing understanding of the basic unit of consumption; the engagement of\u000a      tastemakers, grounded in the idea that audiences find music through the\u000a      recommendations and testimonials of opinion leaders; and the mobilisation\u000a      of communities, grounded in the idea that all of these activities take\u000a      place in the context of processes of sharing and recommendation.\u000a    The research is also connected with a number of funded projects,\u000a      predominantly knowledge exchange\/transfer projects, including Online Music\u000a      Enterprise (&#163;95k LSC, 2004-5), BBC Listeners Online (&#163;90k AHRC\/BBC\u000a      Knowledge Exchange Pilot, 2007-8); New Strategies for Radio and Music\u000a      Organisations (&#163;420k AHRC Knowledge Transfer Fellowship, 2008-10) and New\u000a      Media Approaches to Jazz Marketing (&#163;19k AHRC Cultural Engagement Fund,\u000a      2013).

In 2007-8, he was awarded an\u000a      AHRC speculative research grant [Grant 1] to lead research into how story\u000a      telling in virtual environments could be used to increase participants'\u000a      sense of immersion and self-presence (1, 2). To create conditions\u000a      under which player participation could be evaluated an innovative approach\u000a      to the research was taken: to maximise the experiential engagement of\u000a      players, virtual environments within games were created and made publicly\u000a      available to the gaming community. The aim was to gain research insights\u000a      into the role of narrative in gaming environments through creation of\u000a      authentic experimental gaming processes. In contrast to a traditional,\u000a      lab-based academic project, this research project made an innovative\u000a      contribution to games research methodology by constructing a `field-based'\u000a      context for player interaction (3, 4).\u000a    Specifically, research focussed on three game `plug-ins' (or `mods'\u000a      applied to an existing commercial game engine) that were developed by the\u000a      researchers under the AHRC grant [Grant 1]. These were made\u000a      available as free download, with public engagement from the gaming\u000a      community providing key feedback throughout. The principal output at this\u000a      stage was the first version of a `mod' named Dear Esther. Dear\u000a        Esther broke new ground in presenting an innovative experimental\u000a      design to test the limits of `first-person' narrative environments in\u000a      traditional games design. By removing all usual game play elements from\u000a      predetermined `first person' positions, players were permitted to explore\u000a      the environment for themselves and, to an unprecedented extent, determine\u000a      their own personalised narrative from the multiple potentials of a\u000a      fragmented and randomised story.\u000a    This approach had previously been considered too `risky' by the games\u000a      industry since it challenges dominant use of `first person' in commercial\u000a      gaming protocols. The fundamental research described above focussed on\u000a      exploring game design spaces that were not being explored by the industry,\u000a      due to their perceived experimental and uncertain nature. Industry focus\u000a      at this time was largely on mainstream game development and on reissuing\u000a      existing games, e.g. using the same basic structure as previous hit\u000a      releases, game tie-ups with successful film franchises, and\/or developing\u000a      sequel releases to hit titles. In this context, the research team\u000a      identified an innovative research space in which an academic group could\u000a      use experimental techniques to evaluate technical and aesthetic innovation\u000a      within the framework of the community of `users'. Participant feedback was\u000a      used to create original `mod' prototypes that could be developed within\u000a      the commercial sector.\u000a    A fourth mod was develop under the project title Everybody's Gone to\u000a        the Rapture that, after production of a prototype [funded by Grants\u000a        2, 3], led to a successful industry collaboration and game\u000a      development contract with Frictional Games [Contract 1].\u000a    The research was published in the academic literature and key findings\u000a      and participant player feedback was disseminated at major games trade and\u000a      industry events. The use of practice-led research methodologies was\u000a      ideally suited to the encouragement of direct involvement with the gaming\u000a      industry as it resulted in applied knowledge readily applicable to\u000a      industry games development processes (5, 6).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"15739","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The EU FP7 framework of the KEEP project located research in a\u000a      European-wide range of partnerships with academic researchers, digital\u000a      preservation agencies, professional archivists and librarians. The early\u000a      research framework was developed by analysis of existing processes but\u000a      also through workshops and conferences designed to maximise `user'\u000a      perspectives. Workshops were held to involve professional communities\u000a      directly in the design, development and implementation of TOTEM at French\u000a      National Library, Paris (2011\/2012); Royal Dutch Library, the Hague\u000a      (2011); alongside the InFuture2011 conference, Zagreb (2011); Italian\u000a      Video Games Developer Conference, Rome (2011), Novotel Cardiff (2012);\u000a      German National Library, Frankfurt (2012) and the Computer Games Museum,\u000a      Berlin (2012). These events were used to disseminate research to show how\u000a      TOTEM contributed to preservation policy and strategy: structured\u000a      tutorials, using the live online TOTEM database, were used to trial\u000a      applications from which written feedback was used to improve the\u000a      functionality and performance of TOTEM. Conferences were also used to\u000a      advocate the use of this emulation registry, and to trial and test in\u000a      applied contexts of use: at GOPORTIS (Leibniz Library Network for Research\u000a      Information consisting three leading German Libraries) in 2011, iPRES 2011\u000a      and at Open Planets Foundation workshops. Those present included key\u000a      figures from Portico (JSTOR), Harvard Business School, and the Library of\u000a      Congress who saw for the first time that emulation was now a practical\u000a      proposition due to the presence of tools such as TOTEM, having succeeded\u000a      in designing suitable data for the KEEP Emulation Framework (http:\/\/emuframework.\u000a        sourceforge.net\/).\u000a    Utility and uptake\u000a    Delve and Anderson's collaboration with Chair of Digital\u000a      Humanities, Professor M.Thaller at the University of Cologne and Johanna\u000a      Puhl converted the created models into a form that could be used on the\u000a      Web. Potentially, all data that is already `linked' (http:\/\/linkeddata.org\/)\u000a      can be used to provide information about sharing and connecting in\u000a      computing environments.\u000a\u0009  To ensure wide compatibility with existing\u000a      initiatives, TOTEM includes a link in the file format data to the PRONOM\u000a      registry\u000a        http:\/\/www.nationalarchives.gov.uk\/PRONOM\/Default.aspx. At GOPORTIS,\u000a      TOTEM was presented as part of a global `eco&#8212;registry' initiative\u000a      alongside the UK National Archives PRONOM format registry. This practical\u000a      application of TOTEM's functionality was identified as an exemplar of best\u000a      practice by S. Knight, Program Director of the Preservation Research &amp;\u000a      Consultancy division of the National Library of New Zealand (http:\/\/www.digitalpreservation.gov\/series\/edge\/newzealand.html, http:\/\/natlib.govt.nz). Knight\u000a      recognised TOTEM as a significant tool upon which to build a future meta\u000a      registry for use in `memory' institutions worldwide. This led to global\u000a      strategic collaboration for its adoption with the National Library of New\u000a      Zealand (NLNZ), the National Library of Australia (NLA), their registry of\u000a      media (http:\/\/www.nla.gov.au\/mediapedia)\u000a      and the US National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) (http:\/\/www.archives.gov\/),\u000a      conducted under the auspices of the National and State Libraries\u000a      Australasia (NSLA) from 2011- present.

Working within the EU FP7-funded\u000a      Keeping Emulation Environments Portable (KEEP) project, EU Grant Agreement\u000a      ICT 231954 [&#163;4m], (2009 - 2012), Delve's research focussed on\u000a      developing the conceptual and technical framework for digital preservation\u000a      in specifications of format registries, tools for format characterisation,\u000a      recognition, validation and metadata extraction under the emulation\u000a      strategy.\u000a    TOTEM is the resulting migration\/emulation hybrid tool that matches older\u000a      versions of software with compatible versions of operating\u000a      systems\/hardware models. Its research innovation lies in the ways in which\u000a      it has modeled semantic operability protocols that can be implemented as a\u000a      relational database and as an RDF (Resource Definition Framework) for\u000a      linked data. It is this potential that was taken up by a global consortium\u000a      of libraries that were persuaded to meet the challenge of digital\u000a      preservation through the TOTEM strategy.\u000a    Research was conducted in three stages, with end-user involvement\u000a      throughout:\u000a\u0009  \u000a    The KEEP project examined the existing preservation systems of national\u000a      libraries in France, Germany and the Netherlands and the Computer Games\u000a      Museum in Berlin to determine the extent of current emulation practices,\u000a      future plans to use emulation and the type of metadata standards needed.\u000a      These standards are the foundation of digital archiving, providing\u000a      metadata to describe the information resource, support its identification,\u000a      location and retrieval thus facilitating content and access management.\u000a      Framed by the user-group needs, the results of analysis identified the\u000a      potential for emulation-based processes and were published in EC report (1).\u000a      This work analysed current metadata standards informing international\u000a      practice such as Preservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies\u000a      (PREMIS), Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standards (METS) and\u000a      Consortium of University Research Libraries Exemplars for Digital\u000a        Archives (CEDARS).\u000a    Using the findings, Delve carried out fundamental analysis of\u000a      the metadata (needed to describe the technical environments necessary to\u000a      render under emulation) by using five different digital objects (e.g. a\u000a      radar simulation for a racing boat training package) from the German\u000a      National Library. A suite of conceptual metadata models was created,\u000a      together with clear explanations of its utility for a variety of\u000a      stakeholders (cultural `memory' institutions &#8212; museums, libraries archives\u000a      - and computer games communities). EC Report (2).\u000a    With user-based research, Anderson &amp; Delve et al.\u000a      challenged the pervading dichotomy &#8212; either emulation or\u000a      migration (3). Delve reviewed the ontologies emanating from\u000a      the influential PLANETS project led by the British Library, indicating\u000a      where KEEP metadata work would significantly extend software and hardware\u000a      OWL ontologies for emulation. A logical relational data model was\u000a      developed by Delve and Konstantelos and implemented as a\u000a      MySQL online database &#8212; TOTEM. TOTEM was subjected to rigorous user\u000a      evaluation\/testing and metadata schema created a new environment entity (Konstantelos\u000a      &amp; Delve) (4 and 5). This was incorporated into\u000a      PREMIS 3.0, a metadata schema allowing environments with links to\u000a      technical registries like TOTEM to be described for many preservation\u000a      actions: migration, emulation, virtualization and normalization (6).\u000a\u0009  \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17138","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The overarching impact of Bailey's research has been to influence the\u000d\u000a      development and activities of the African\u000a        Women's Empowerment Forum (AWEF), a community organization with an\u000d\u000a      increasingly international mission (1). However, as we go on to\u000d\u000a      demonstrate, there were not only a series of more discrete impacts as part\u000d\u000a      of this process, but also Bailey's participative action research has begun\u000d\u000a      to contribute expert knowledge to shape the working practices of public\u000d\u000a      sector organizations.\u000d\u000a    The creation of an organization for female migrants, refugees and\u000d\u000a        asylum seekers.

By playing a key role in helping to\u000d\u000a      `strategically position AWEF as a grassroots organization', Bailey shaped\u000d\u000a      the development of AWEF from a charitable and community organization to\u000d\u000a      their registration as a community interest company in 2011 (2). AWEF has\u000d\u000a      had a significant influence on the lives of women in Nottingham from the\u000d\u000a      African diaspora: `They have worked very closely with destitute women\u000d\u000a      asylum seekers and refugees supporting them with law advice, shelter, food\u000d\u000a      and emotional support' (3).\u000d\u000a    Developing networks and communities for migrant and refugee women.\u000d\u000a      Bailey's research findings were central in helping to secure a grant of\u000d\u000a      &#163;10K for AWEF from Awards For All. This grant proved central to AWEF's\u000d\u000a      development as it enabled them to identify and forge links with other\u000d\u000a      refugee-led organizations and demonstrated the value of networking to the\u000d\u000a      future of the organization. Networking would become crucial in creating\u000d\u000a      AWEF UK which, since 2011, has championed the creation of an umbrella\u000d\u000a      organization of thirteen `Refugee Community Organizations' to help\u000d\u000a      charities with community building. AWEF has become increasingly\u000d\u000a      international: for example, AWEF UK has become a member of the Diaspora\u000d\u000a      Volunteering Alliance (4).\u000d\u000a    Supporting empowerment and developing Communication Strategies to give\u000d\u000a        female migrants, refugees and asylum seekers a voice. From\u000d\u000a      2007-2011, Bailey continued to work closely with the group. She used her\u000d\u000a      research findings to increase the political awareness of the women\u000d\u000a      involved and to support their process of self-empowerment. She was Chair\u000d\u000a      of the `Still Women: Voice of the Voiceless' programme. Through discussion\u000d\u000a      sessions and regular meetings, Bailey not only enabled the group to\u000d\u000a      analyze social policies which impacted negatively on female asylum\u000d\u000a      seekers, but also helped the group to find a means to address these issues\u000d\u000a      to a wider audiences, including local authorities, politicians and the\u000d\u000a      third sector. For example, Bailey played a key role in AWEF's community\u000d\u000a      engagement event `Thank You, Nottingham' (27 March 2010) which was\u000d\u000a      attended by (among others) the Lord Mayor of Nottingham Cllr Jeannie\u000d\u000a      Packers, MPs Alan Simpson and Lilian Greenwood and the venerable Arch\u000d\u000a      Deacon of Nottingham Peter Hill.\u000d\u000a    As the organization grew, Bailey developed strategies to help the women\u000d\u000a      involved use their voices:\u000d\u000a      `her knowledge of communication strategy was instrumental in the detailing\u000d\u000a      of the most effective ways of raising awareness for the organization and\u000d\u000a      structuring the operations' (2). As a result of these self-empowerment\u000d\u000a      processes, AWEF has extended its resistance beyond the local and into the\u000d\u000a      public sphere by actively engaging with policy-makers, NGOs, and local and\u000d\u000a      national governments to create awareness of the problems faced by asylum\u000d\u000a      seekers. For example, in 2009 the Executive Director Faith Gakanje was\u000d\u000a      invited to Downing Street. She met the Prime Minister and presented the\u000d\u000a      views of AWEF and other partner NGOs on the issue of institutional\u000d\u000a      discrimination against asylum seekers. Bailey's work with AWEF on\u000d\u000a      communication strategy has impacts beyond the organization. The group has\u000d\u000a      organized a series of events to disseminate its ideas about changing\u000d\u000a      British society's perception of asylum seekers and refugees, and the\u000d\u000a      self-perception of these groups.\u000d\u000a    Creating jobs for Refugee Women. Bailey's `skills were priceless\u000d\u000a      in the development of the business plan' (2). By helping to make AWEF\u000d\u000a      economically sustainable, Bailey has supported the organization's\u000d\u000a      entrepreneurial activities. For example, AWEF secured two Rayne\u000d\u000a      Fellowships to develop food and fashion business in order to create jobs\u000d\u000a      for African women refugees.\u000d\u000a    Shaping Professional Practices and Policy. As a form of\u000d\u000a      participative action research, Bailey's work with AWEF has generated\u000d\u000a      further research findings. These can be used to shape the work and\u000d\u000a      policies of public and voluntary sector professionals who work with female\u000d\u000a      asylum seekers and refugees. A first workshop on `Refugee Women,\u000d\u000a      Empowerment and the Challenges of Everyday Life' was held at NTU in May\u000d\u000a      2013. It was attended by professionals from refugee action groups in the\u000d\u000a      East Midlands and Faith Gakanje. This forms the blueprint for future\u000d\u000a      workshops designed to share ideas about best practice and focusing on the\u000d\u000a      themes of networking, communication and empowerment.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Dr Olga Bailey's research examines the importance of the media in\u000d\u000a      understanding processes of migration and the formation of diasporic\u000d\u000a      identities and cultural practices.

Bailey's research also explored the\u000d\u000a      political and cultural forms that migrants use as expressions of identity,\u000d\u000a      recognition and empowerment.

This research emphasized how the\u000d\u000a      creation of AWEF was a process of self-empowerment as the organization\u000d\u000a      became a communicative space to develop migrant women's abilities and\u000d\u000a      skills to deal with issues of destitution and exclusion and to make a\u000d\u000a      positive contribution to the community.

The BBVA (Banco\u000a      Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria) Foundation, Madrid invited Tomlinson as one of\u000a      `the finest researchers and creators worldwide' to write a chapter on\u000a      `Cultural Globalization Reconsidered' for a book The Multiple Faces of\u000a        Globalization (2009) as part of the Foundation's `Frontiers of\u000a      Knowledge Programme' (4). The BBVA Foundation is one of the world's\u000a      largest corporate sponsors of research as, `the most effective means to\u000a      address the challenges facing contemporary society'. The findings of\u000a      contributors to the book have been used by the Foundation to produce\u000a      strategies for responsible corporate action to meet the demands of a\u000a      globalized world.\u000a    Encouraging international cooperation in development.\u000a      Tomlinson was commissioned to write an article &#8212; \"Supermarkt der\u000a      Weltdeutungen: Der Austausch zwischen den Kulturen wirkt zugleich\u000a      befreiend und verunsichernd' (Supermarket of Interpretations about the\u000a      World: Cultural Exchange as Liberation and Uncertainty) &#8212; for the German\u000a      magazine Welt-Sichten (World View). This new magazine for global\u000a      development and ecumenical cooperation is published by a coalition of\u000a      church-based charities in Germany and Switzerland (5). A revised version\u000a      of the article was published in the 256 page Eine Welt Taschenkalender\u000a      (2012) published by Volker Harms Ltd, a diary-calender that aims to engage\u000a      the public and provoke discussion (6). These publications are further\u000a      evidence of Tomlinson's impact on public debate and understanding.\u000a    Promoting global artistic expression. The other\u000a      dimension of impact made during the review period is in relation to\u000a      cultural\/arts bodies. Tomlinson delivered a keynote lecture on\u000a      `Accelerated Living' at the Impakt Arts Festival Conference on Accelerated\u000a      Living in Utrecht (2009). The impact was in providing an analytical\u000a      framework within which artists from across Europe could reflect on their\u000a      practices in the context of the cultural condition of global immediacy. In\u000a      a paper on `Architecture, Globalization, Locality' to the Royal Institute\u000a      of British Architects Research Symposium 2011, Tomlinson offered a\u000a      cultural-analytical case study which provided opportunities for architects\u000a      to reflect on the cultural impact of their professional practice in the\u000a      context of the globalization process. A paper on Globalization and\u000a      Acceleration in Nottingham Contemporary Gallery's Uneven Geographies\u000a      Lecture Series (May 26 2010) provided members of the local community with\u000a      a cultural-analytical narrative within which to interpret the artworks in\u000a      a major international exhibition.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor John Tomlinson produces world-leading research on the cultural\u000a      dimensions of the globalization process.

The first major outcome was the\u000a      publication of the influential Globalization and Culture (Polity\u000a      Press, 1999). This was the first study to attempt to interpret the\u000a      cultural dimensions &#8212; as distinct from the economic, technological and\u000a      political dimensions &#8212; of the globalization process. Situating itself\u000a      theoretically at the interface between sociology and cultural analysis,\u000a      the book (and the body of work which followed) analyses and interprets\u000a      both the impact of globalization in the sphere of culture, and the role of\u000a      culture in the constitution of the dynamics of globalization itself.\u000a    The focus of this case study is on three main areas. In each of these\u000a      areas the research has broad relevance for a range of end users in the\u000a      cultural and political spheres.\u000a    \u000a      \u000aEmergence of globalized culture. Tomlinson's research\u000a        aims to understand the emergence and trajectory of globalized culture\u000a        which, whilst giving due weight to the specificity of the cultural,\u000a        nonetheless insists on its complex entanglement with economic,\u000a        technological and political factors. In particular, Tomlinson interprets\u000a        globalized cultural production and experience as outcomes of, on the one\u000a        hand, the time-space transformations of social and cultural modernity\u000a        and, on the other hand, of the dynamics of contemporary capitalism. His\u000a        work is informed by a focus on the intersection of cultural modernity\u000a        and the global capitalist economy. As a result, he interprets culture as\u000a        everyday practice and lived experience framed within an analysis of\u000a        global and national institutional processes. One significant implication\u000a        of this has been a re-interpretation of theories of cultural imperialism\u000a        in terms of a more complex process of the deterritorialization of\u000a        culture, significantly inflected by the commodification of cultural\u000a        experience deriving from capitalism.\u000a      \u000aNature &amp; prospects of cultural identities.\u000a        Tomlinson's research explores how cultural identities are constituted in\u000a        globalized societies. In particular, he explores this in relation to\u000a        debates over the agenda of cultural diversity, and the nature and\u000a        prospects for cultural cosmopolitanism. His analysis views cultural\u000a        identities as essentially plural subject positions that are generated,\u000a        rather than threatened, by the dynamics of global modernity so that\u000a        cosmopolitan forms of identity co-exist with national and ethnic ones.\u000a        These insights have been developed in consultation work for\u000a        international public sector institutions such as UNESCO.\u000a      \u000aCommunications &amp; Media. Tomlinson has examined the\u000a        key role of communications and media technologies in the\u000a        deterritorialization of cultural experience. This work has developed in\u000a        recent years in two directions. Firstly, it explores the role of\u000a        contemporary media and communication practices in the organization of\u000a        people's experience of their locality and its relation to distant events\u000a        and processes. Secondly, it analyzes the role of media technologies in\u000a        the constitution of cultural `immediacy'.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17493","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Many accounts of gay literature and film in Spanish now reference some of\u000a      Mira's works. The books and articles have great prominence in key gay\u000a      publications and, very unusually for Spain, they have crossed over to\u000a      non-gay publications (newspapers like El Pa&#237;s or El Mundo,\u000a      film magazines like Fotogramas or national TV). It is important to\u000a      note that such media tend to shy away from featuring items on gay activism\u000a      or gay culture, therefore Mira's work is unique in articulating theory and\u000a      presenting it to general audiences. It also constitutes authoritative,\u000a      historically and theoretically informed, discourse on gay issues. The\u000a      following is just an overview with some examples of how the impact of the\u000a      work has featured in different media.\u000a    At the time of its publication in 1999, Para entendernos was not\u000a      only ground-breaking but also controversial. It was praised in the press\u000a      by writers and intellectuals (i) a positive review by Vicente Molina-Foix\u000a      in El Pa&#237;s (a) who saw this as a great tool to construct\u000a      non-homophobic and authoritative discourse on homosexuality. Para\u000a        entendernos, which went through a revised edition in 2003, is still,\u000a      to date, a book that sells in gay bookshops, particularly to young gay\u000a      readers and those readers' parents, as the manager of Barcelona gay\u000a      bookshop Antinous will attest (ii) and it has gradually found its way in\u000a      Latin American gay cultures. This was the first book on gay issues to be\u000a      stocked in the reference section of the Biblioteca Nacional in Spain(c).\u000a    This was followed by a more academic history of homosexual cultures in\u000a      Spain published in 2004, De Sodoma a Chueca. Like its predecessor,\u000a      it was bought by libraries throughout Spain as an introduction to issues\u000a      on gay culture. It is widely accessible in library catalogues as the main\u000a      reference book for gay culture. When a gay activist became angered by\u000a      certain homophobic comments made by the Queen of Spain, she gave her a\u000a      copy of De Sodoma a Chueca (d). Between 2005 and 2011, Dr Mira was\u000a      invited as speaker to several gay associations (in Madrid, Barcelona,\u000a      Valencia and Gij&#243;n) to discuss aspects of the book. Talks were covered by\u000a      the local press. The main ideas of a talk given in Gij&#243;n, Asturias, are\u000a      summarized in this item from the local newspaper La voz de Asturias\u000a      (e).\u000a    The three main inputs by Mira (1999, 2004 and 2008a) are accessible\u000a      through public libraries. Para entendernos and De Sodoma a\u000a        Chueca were included in a leaflet published by the network of public\u000a      libraries of the Catalan government with recommendations on books on gay\u000a      and lesbian issues; they are both recommended in this bibliography (f).\u000a      Another example of Mira's work being promoted by public libraries when\u000a      selecting books on gay and lesbian issues can be found here (g). The\u000a      following article on the situation of Gay and Lesbian writing in public\u000a      libraries makes several references to Mira's work and gives an idea of its\u000a      centrality in articulating gay culture for wide audiences (h).\u000a    Among the key objectives of Mira's research was to construct a historical\u000a      discourse not based on homophobic premises, therefore talks at gay\u000a      associations and on the radio was addressing its target audience. Mira was\u000a      invited to award-winning novelist and essayist Luis Antonio de Villena's\u000a      radio show Las aceras de enfrente to discuss gay cinema and gay\u000a      icons (i). Las aceras de enfrente is the only National Radio\u000a      programme focusing on gay issues. The book was also the subject of a\u000a      section in a RTVE programme on gay issues. The title of the programme was\u000a      Miradas 2 and the clip includes mention of the innovative aspects\u000a      in Mira's work as linking the notion of gay cinema to spectatorship and\u000a      appropriation (j). This was complemented with a number of articles in gay\u000a      magazine Zero, and some contributions to a gay culture blog (k). De\u000a        Sodoma a Chueca is a key reference in historical discussions of\u000a      homosexuality in Spain (referenced in the Wikipedia article on\u000a      \"Homosexualidad en Espa&#241;a\" (l), \"Homosexuality in Spain\"), quoted in\u000a      newspaper articles and magazine pieces as an authoritative source. In\u000a      2008, Alberto Mira was invited to contribute to a bibliographical syllabus\u000a      to be used as reference in Catalonian libraries. De Sodoma a Chueca\u000a      is still selling and has gone through a second edition with publishers\u000a      Egales. The proprietor of Madrid gay bookshop Berkana has also\u000a      acknowledged the popularity of Mira's work among gay essays (m).\u000a    Publication of Miradas insumisas (2008) built on this pedagogical\u000a      task of providing journalists and the general public a repertoire of\u000a      perspectives into Film. Divided into two sections, the first was about how\u000a      homosexual perspective was presented on film, the other dealt with gay\u000a      appropriations and perception of film. This was covered in the press, film\u000a      magazines and on television and again has been quoted as a key reference\u000a      to discuss film and homosexuality. Leading newspaper El Pa&#237;s was\u000a      interested in Mira's ideas and requested a special article shortly after\u000a      publication (n). The article was based on one of Miradas insumisas\u000a      key ideas on how gay audiences actively read films in ways that match\u000a      their experience. The book was awarded \"Best Essay of 2008\" (o) by the\u000a      popular gay website dosmanzanas.com. This is still one of the main sources\u000a      for gay journalism and reviews in Spain.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Dr Alberto Mira's (Reader, Oxford Brookes University 1999-Present)\u000a      research bridges the gap between academic studies and ideas within the gay\u000a      movement and non-homophobic media needing concepts and evidence to\u000a      construct discourse.

The first theoretically informed\u000a      popularization of the ideas mentioned above came in 1999 with Para\u000a        entendernos, an encyclopaedia of gay and lesbian culture. It engaged\u000a      with theoretical interventions by Michel Foucault and Judith Butler among\u000a      others in a range of short entries on literature, film and history,\u000a      markedly different to gossipy and untheorized discussions that had taken\u000a      place in divulgative works. At last there was a general reference source\u000a      to discuss homosexuality in history and the arts without falling into\u000a      essentialist or homophobic traps. In 2004, De Sodoma a Chueca\u000a      focused on XX Century history. A wide range of cultural manifestations\u000a      (decadent poets, Republican, Francoist legislation to canonical authors\u000a      such as Lorca or Cernuda, repression and censorship and gay lib) were\u000a      interpreted in the light of theoretical contributions. Now the general\u000a      theoretical insights were applied more specifically to Spanish examples. De\u000a        Sodoma a Chueca became a key source to find a narrative in Spanish\u000a      experience of homosexuality and its interpretation. Finally, Miradas\u000a        insumisas (2008) is an even more specific work that still deals with\u000a      film theory and gender to suggest ways in which gay audiences read films\u000a      and gay filmmakers work their sources of inspiration into them. These\u000a      three main works have been supported and complemented in recent years with\u000a      a number of articles, interviews, interventions on TV and radio, and\u000a      features in gay magazines.\u000a    The main achievements of Dr Mira's research items discussed in this\u000a      impact case are:\u000a    a) Introduction of academic discussion of pre-1975 discussion of gay\u000a      identities (Mira 2004) through historical and archival research.\u000a    b) Academic discussion of articulation of gay identity in Spain against\u000a      the background of construction of Anglo American identities (Mira 2004,\u000a      Mira 2007a, Mira 2007b, Mira 2011a)\u000a    c) Introduction of theorization of gay spectatorship in public debates as\u000a      part of the history of gay experience in Spain (Mira 2004, 2007a, 2007b,\u000a      2008, 2011c).\u000a    Miradas insumisas underlines the way in which gay audiences\u000a      select, distort and produce certain meanings in certain film: gay\u000a      experience prepares certain spectators to read films in a certain way,\u000a      whether trying to find an experience of resistance towards sexual\u000a      orthodoxy, establishing a homoerotic gaze or contributing to the\u000a      cultivation of self-image. Extensive interviews with gay film spectators\u000a      were used for the writing of this volume, which were used to illustrate\u000a      and develop basic points. The second part of this volume combines\u000a      proposals by Janet Staiger (in Perverse Spectators, 2000) on \"real\u000a      audiences\" and Brett Farmer (in Spectacular Passions, 2000) more\u000a      psychoanalytically underpinned, together with personal research through\u000a      interviews to propose ways in which audiences have assimilated film. There\u000a      was a discussion on the ways notions such as \"gay identity\" might have\u000a      their limits when dealing with Spanish cinephilia (how gay identity and\u000a      watching films were perceived as separate or continuous experiences was a\u000a      key question in interviews carried out as preliminary research).\u000a    Among the notions put forward in previous works that elicited more\u000a      interest (and some confusion) in gay cultural associations and radio\u000a      interviews was the concept of \"camp\", adapted into Spanish culture from\u000a      work by Richard Dyer and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick. In public fora (public\u000a      talks, gay centers, internet discussions), it became clear that one of the\u000a      aspects of camp that Spanish audiences did not quite comprehend is that it\u000a      is a fluid concept. It is not that \"some texts are camp\" but the emphasis\u000a      should be on the way gay audiences read certain texts (musicals,\u000a      melodrama, Disney movies are specifically studied). This opened the way to\u000a      an article for a collection which was based on Mira's personal experience\u000a      on the Broadway musical as a tool to cultivate gay identity. The remit of\u000a      the collection where the article was included (Homoerotismos literarios,\u000a      edited by Rodrigo Andr&#233;s) was to discuss texts that were somehow important\u000a      to gay people in Spain. Mira 2011c develops some of the insights on camp\u000a      and appropriation in Mira 2008a applying them to the Broadway musical. The\u000a      article makes explicit reference to D.A. Miller's volume A Place for\u000a        Us (1998) as well as essays by Dyer (\"Judy Garland and Gay Men\"\u000a      1986, \"It's Being So Camp As Gets Us Going\" 1977) and proposes mechanisms\u000a      for appropriation of certain texts that are specifically linked to gay\u000a      identity.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17507","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The body of research has created impact in two main areas:\u000d\u000a    (1) Contributing to the preservation, conservation and presentation\u000d\u000a          of cultural heritage\u000d\u000a    The SEAS Photography project's digital archive, under the directorship of\u000d\u000a      Shepherdson, has been made publicly accessible and reached a\u000d\u000a      diverse range of audiences through a variety of strategies including its\u000d\u000a      website, curated exhibitions, archive open days, corresponding\u000d\u000a      publications and presentations. The significance of the impact of this\u000d\u000a      work is two-fold. Firstly, by conserving previously perishable and unique\u000d\u000a      photographs in a robust digital format the project has preserved part of\u000d\u000a      the cultural heritage of the South East of England. Secondly, through\u000d\u000a      various presentation strategies it has reached a cross section of the\u000d\u000a      population and enhanced public knowledge about this part of the UK's\u000d\u000a      cultural heritage. This significance is corroborated in the following\u000d\u000a      testimonial from the Head of Heritage Lottery Fund South East England:\u000d\u000a      [the SEAS Photography archive] \"means that many more people are able\u000d\u000a        to gain access to this historic collection of photographs, providing a\u000d\u000a        vivid and fascinating reminder of seaside days on the Isle of Thanet in\u000d\u000a        years gone by. The project also gives the local community a chance to\u000d\u000a        enhance and add to the collection by sharing their own Sunbeam pictures.\"\u000d\u000a      The SEAS Photography website currently includes content of some 3,000\u000d\u000a      images and provides ready access to a previously inaccessible resource.\u000d\u000a      The website received 131,000 hits by 31 July 2013. In addition, there have\u000d\u000a      been exhibitions and public talks curated and led by Shepherdson\u000d\u000a      that have provided opportunities for people to engage with the project\u000d\u000a      (for example, a public exhibition held at The Pie Factory, Margate, 11-17\u000d\u000a      July 2013; a public lecture given to Margate Museum Friends and\u000d\u000a      Volunteers, November 2012; and a public lecture for the Isle of Thanet\u000d\u000a      Photographic Society, November 2012). In total, more than a thousand\u000d\u000a      people attended these events between November 2012 and July 2013. The\u000d\u000a      project has also provided free short courses and workshops in Margate and\u000d\u000a      Broadstairs covering how to use digital tools to safeguard cultural\u000d\u000a      heritage and record everyday life of communities. Over 80 people attended\u000d\u000a      these by the end of July 2013, enabling members of the public to\u000d\u000a      contribute to the creation and preservation of their own cultural\u000d\u000a      heritage. The significance of the project and its reach are further\u000d\u000a      evidenced by the following testimonial from the Head of Collection,\u000d\u000a      National Media Museum, UK: \"SEAS Photography is contributing to our\u000d\u000a        knowledge and understanding of both twentieth century commercial\u000d\u000a        photography in Britain and the cultural practice of the population at\u000d\u000a        leisure. SEAS Photography is not only preserving images of the past, but\u000d\u000a        also increasing awareness and accessibility of this material for both\u000d\u000a        academics and the general public.\"\u000d\u000a    (2) Enhancing public and professional understanding of digital\u000d\u000a          transformations in communities\u000d\u000a    The body of work described in this case study has enhanced public\u000d\u000a      understanding of digital transformations in communities through a range of\u000d\u000a      strategies including creation and publication of new knowledge, workshops,\u000d\u000a      public talks, debates and expert advice. Gulyas' research provided\u000d\u000a      new evidence and initiated public debate on the impacts of digital\u000d\u000a      transformations on local media and communication. The findings of two\u000d\u000a      empirical research projects, Empirical study on current trends and\u000d\u000a        challenges in regional media in Kent and Neighbours Online\u000d\u000a      showed how local communication is changing and raised concerns about\u000d\u000a      implications for local democracies. The significance of this work is that\u000d\u000a      it provided data that had not been available before and raised public\u000d\u000a      knowledge of and awareness about the topic. The impact of this research is\u000d\u000a      evidenced by the different ways it has been followed up: a public debate\u000d\u000a      on `Crisis in Local Democracy?' (05\/2010, Canterbury attended by 90)\u000d\u000a      chaired by Gulyas with contributions from key local media and\u000d\u000a      local political figures; a public research seminar given by Gulyas\u000d\u000a      on `Regional Media in Crisis' (06\/12\/2009, Canterbury); and media\u000d\u000a      exposure, including an interview with Gulyas on BBC Radio Kent\u000d\u000a      (03\/2012), and coverage in the Media Guardian (09\/05\/2012) and Kent Online\u000d\u000a      (23\/03\/2012).\u000d\u000a    Gulyas' action research projects (Developing a Prototype Social\u000d\u000a        Media Toolkit for Community Groups and Organisations and Communities,\u000a        Third Sector Organisations and Social Media) worked with local and\u000d\u000a      regional public bodies and voluntary and community sector organisations.\u000d\u000a      The projects, led by Gulyas, aimed to support the latter in\u000d\u000a      developing their use of digital tools, in particular social media, in\u000d\u000a      order to enhance public engagement and augment their work in the\u000d\u000a      communities they serve. Through the collection, analysis and presentation\u000d\u000a      of primary data, the research has improved understanding of social media\u000d\u000a      use in the voluntary and community sector as well as identified\u000d\u000a      organisational barriers and needs. The projects involved supporting\u000d\u000a      voluntary and community sector organisations through workshops (free of\u000d\u000a      charge), one-to-one support, as well as stakeholder events which explored\u000d\u000a      the benefits of social media as well as issues with their use and\u000d\u000a      implementation. There have been three workshops (07\/2012 &#8212; `Social media\u000d\u000a      essentials'; 04\/2013 &#8212; `Social media strategy; 06\/2013 &#8212; `Community\u000d\u000a      building and fundraising with social media') led by Gulyas, which\u000d\u000a      were attended by 57 local third sector organisations demonstrating a wide\u000d\u000a      reach in the area. The sessions gave the organisations tools, tips and\u000d\u000a      templates to support the adoption of social media in their organisation's\u000d\u000a      practices. Impact of the workshops is evidenced by positive feedback\u000d\u000a      received from participants. The significance of this work is confirmed in\u000d\u000a      a testimonial from the Director of Canterbury District Voluntary Alliance\u000d\u000a      (which has about 300 member organisations):\"The Knowledge Exchange\u000d\u000a        project focusing on Social Media Skills and the third sector has been\u000d\u000a        extremely well received amongst the organisations who have taken part.\u000d\u000a        There is a real skills shortage in the sector regarding this area as\u000d\u000a        well as a realisation that social media needs to be increasingly at the\u000d\u000a        centre of what we do and, more importantly, will do in the future. I,\u000d\u000a        personally, have benefited greatly from this project and am adapting my\u000d\u000a        working methods as a result. It is heartening that there is such a\u000d\u000a        beneficial transfer of knowledge between the University and local\u000d\u000a        community organisations especially at a time when the sector is trying\u000d\u000a        to cope with the effects of the current economic situation\".\u000d\u000a    Gulyas' research on social media use and attitudes in journalistic\u000d\u000a      communities in different countries has created impact through the\u000d\u000a      generation of new data and insights into how these digital tools are\u000d\u000a      embedded in professional practices, and their impacts on the profession.\u000d\u000a      The research has reached beneficiaries through publications, online\u000d\u000a      resources and presentations as well as media coverage in different\u000d\u000a      countries with widest dissemination in Germany and the UK. Findings were\u000d\u000a      published online in non-academic professional reports available free of\u000d\u000a      charge.

Both have\u000d\u000a      researched the changing media and cultural practices of communities in the\u000d\u000a      digital age. The specific focus of their projects varied, but overall the\u000d\u000a      body of research analysed the impacts of digital transformations in\u000d\u000a      communities as well as the opportunities digital tools offer for enhancing\u000d\u000a      the lives of communities. A distinctive feature of the work is the\u000d\u000a      application of action research methods in some of the projects. This led\u000d\u000a      to impact taking place during the research process, as beneficiaries have\u000d\u000a      been part of the study.\u000d\u000a    The research has revealed that digital transformations can and do have\u000d\u000a      positive effects on communities, but these benefits can be fragmented and\u000d\u000a      divisive along the lines of digital divides. Action research projects have\u000d\u000a      focused on areas that are disadvantaged or left behind because they are\u000d\u000a      not easily or cheaply converted to digital. Shepherdson's South\u000a        East Archive of Seaside Photography (SEAS Photography) project (see\u000d\u000a      section 3: 1) has focused on the preservation, conservation and\u000d\u000a      presentation of the cultural heritage of communities by creating a digital\u000d\u000a      archive of perishable photographs of people's lives on the South East\u000d\u000a      coast taken during the heyday of the British coastal resort in the 20th\u000d\u000a      century. SEAS Photography provides a research environment for critically\u000d\u000a      and creatively engaging with visual interpretations of seaside culture and\u000d\u000a      is currently (2012-2014) collating over 40,000 images produced by the\u000d\u000a      Sunbeam Company. Another strand of the project has concentrated on\u000d\u000a      locating collecting commercial seaside photographs in local communities as\u000d\u000a      well as archiving them. SEAS Photography has created new knowledge through\u000d\u000a      the preservation, archiving, and interpretation of an overlooked area of\u000d\u000a      Britain's cultural heritage.\u000d\u000a    One strand of Gulyas' research (see section 3: 2 and 3), focusing\u000d\u000a      on changes in local communication and local media, has showed that while\u000d\u000a      digital tools are increasingly used in local communities, developments are\u000d\u000a      geographically patchy and stratified because of digital divides. Findings\u000d\u000a      also demonstrated that traditional local media are in decline partly\u000d\u000a      because of changing audience behaviour and partly because digital\u000d\u000a      transformations have led to the collapse of long- established business\u000d\u000a      models. To address the issue of the digital divide in local communication,\u000d\u000a      Gulyas' action research projects aimed to assist third sector\u000d\u000a      organisations (i.e. voluntary and non- profit) in the South East of\u000d\u000a      England to develop strategic and effective use of social media tools in\u000d\u000a      order to enhance public engagement and augment their work in the\u000d\u000a      communities they serve. These projects included: Developing a\u000d\u000a        Prototype Social Media Toolkit for Community Groups and Organisations\u000d\u000a      (in partnership with Canterbury District Voluntary Alliance; funded by\u000d\u000a      HEIF &#8212; &#163;5,352; November 2011 &#8212; July 2012); Communities, Third Sector\u000d\u000a        Organisations and Social Media (in partnership with Kent Can,\u000d\u000a      Canterbury District Voluntary Alliance and Canterbury City Council; funded\u000d\u000a      by HEIF &#8212; &#163;6,916; November 2012-July 2013); and Museums in the Digital\u000d\u000a        Age (in partnership with Museum Development Service for Kent &amp;\u000d\u000a      Medway; funded by Arts Council England &#8212; &#163;6,373; June 2013 &#8212; March 2014).\u000d\u000a      The studies revealed that voluntary and community sector organisations\u000d\u000a      lack strategic use of social media due to limited resources and digital\u000d\u000a      skills. Addressing this lack of skills was a major component of the action\u000d\u000a      research projects. Another strand of Gulyas' research (see section\u000d\u000a      3: 4) explored digital transformation in a professional community.\u000d\u000a      Specifically, the research has analysed patterns of social media use and\u000d\u000a      attitudes by journalists in different countries. It has also examined how\u000d\u000a      professional practices are changing as a result of social media use. The\u000d\u000a      research, which is carried out in partnership with multinational\u000d\u000a      communication company Cision, involved an annual survey as well as\u000d\u000a      interviews with journalists. It has provided country specific analysis of\u000d\u000a      journalistic communities in the UK and Germany as well as international\u000d\u000a      comparisons covering a larger number of states (four countries in 2011 and\u000d\u000a      eight countries in 2012 and in 2013). As well as co-leading on research\u000d\u000a      design and analysis, Gulyas developed the framework for the\u000d\u000a      international comparative analysis in the study.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17644","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    For news broadcasters accustomed to a policy landscape centred on\u000a      Westminster, the devolved landscape of contemporary UK politics represents\u000a      a major new challenge. If citizens are to understand where democratic\u000a      responsibility and accountability lie, as well as appreciate a range of\u000a      policy options, the news media need to cover political issues in a way\u000a      that makes policy differences and areas of responsibility clear. This is\u000a      especially true of broadcasting which remains the dominant and most\u000a      trusted source of information about political issues for most people. So,\u000a      for example, the four UK nations have all pursued different policies on\u000a      education, from free schools to university tuition fees. On a practical\u000a      level, citizens in each nation need to understand these differences. On a\u000a      broader political level, an appreciation of these differences allows\u000a      citizens to understand the range of possibilities, to judge their\u000a      governments accordingly and hold them to account.\u000a    Our research (2008; 2009a; 2009b - see section 3) revealed that news\u000a      coverage did not provide enough information for viewers\/listeners to\u000a      understand the policy differences and practicalities of a devolved UK, and\u000a      worse, coverage was often misleading about where power and responsibility\u000a      lay.\u000a    The research was one of two studies used to inform the King Report, as\u000a      well as being published by the BBC Trust as part of that report. The King\u000a      Report adopted our main findings and recommendations, urging the BBC to\u000a      improve coverage to more accurately reflect post-devolution politics in\u000a      the UK. The BBC accepted these findings and made a commitment &#8212; through\u000a      guidelines &#8212; to report political issues in ways that would allow citizens\u000a      to understand what their own governments were doing and the options\u000a      pursued elsewhere. The BBC also ran a training and awareness raising\u000a      programme for staff, including Senior Editors and Producers of major news\u000a      programmes. This included visits to the devolved nations outside England\u000a      to better understand differences in policy and delivery.\u000a    In order to see whether BBC coverage had changed as a result of this\u000a      intervention, the BBC Trust commissioned us to conduct follow up research\u000a      in 2009. This research suggested that a number of challenges remain &#8212;\u000a      notably the London-centric nature of much UK television news. However, it\u000a      also found that, through a range of different measures, this intervention\u000a      made a difference &#8212; reshaping the news agenda of BBC news and ensuring\u000a      that programming provided a more accurate and representative picture of\u000a      politics and policy in the UK and its devolved political institutions.\u000a    So, for example, our follow up study (2010) found that:\u000a    \u000a      all BBC outlets were more likely to let viewers\/listeners know when\u000a        policy areas applied only to England;\u000a      all BBC outlets significantly increased their reporting from Scotland,\u000a        Wales and Northern Ireland, both in general and with specific reference\u000a        to devolved areas;\u000a      a number of BBC news outlets have begun to use a `compare and\u000a        contrast' approach, reporting on some of the differences in policy\u000a        across the UK.\u000a    \u000a    Our findings indicate that other broadcasters &#8212; who were beyond the\u000a      report's jurisdiction, operating under a different regulatory\/governance\u000a      framework &#8212; have changed very little, and continue to replicate the same\u000a      forms of misleading and limited coverage we found in our 2008 report. In\u000a      short, our follow up research demonstrated the impact of the intervention\u000a      based on our initial research.\u000a    The immediate beneficiary, in terms of impact, was the BBC, who used the\u000a      research to significantly improve the quality and accuracy of their news\u000a      coverage across their many news outlets. However, the BBC's reach and\u000a      scope &#8212; as the principle news provider in the UK &#8212; means that there is a\u000a      much wider societal benefit, with citizens being provided with better\u000a      access to information about the nature, responsibility and outcomes of\u000a      democratic decision making.\u000a    Sir Michael Lyons, BBC Chairman in his farewell speech, 2011 highlighted\u000a      the impact of our research:\u000a    \"...one of the Trust achievements of which I am proud is our decision\u000a        to require BBC News to dramatically improve its performance in reporting\u000a        the devolved nations of the UK both to themselves and to one another. We\u000a        now take it for granted that when a new piece of legislation is\u000a        announced, BBC journalists will make clear which parts of the UK it\u000a        applies to, and which parts it does not. We now take it for granted that\u000a        the BBC will make regular comparisons in its reporting between the way\u000a        big social issues &#8212; university tuition fees, say, or prescription\u000a        charges &#8212; are dealt with in Scotland and Wales and Northern Ireland as\u000a        compared to England. We now take it for granted that BBC news adopts a\u000a        much less London-centred view of the UK.

This case study is therefore illustrative of a\u000a      larger body of work with the broadcast industry including: an AHRC\/BBC\u000a      funded project on user generated content (resulting in a new training\u000a      package delivered to over 5000 BBC journalists); a further BBC Trust\u000a      impartiality review (which led to the appointment of 'story champions' for\u000a      important news stories and the creation of a pan-BBC forum on religion and\u000a      ethics); and a Channel 4 funded study of coverage of British Muslims\u000a      (which informed subsequent documentaries on Channel 4 and BBC Radio 4). It\u000a      also sits within a body of policy work such as the Hargreaves Review of\u000a      Intellectual Property Law and our work on journalism safety (see Impact\u000a      Template).\u000a    In 2007, following a competitive tender, the BBC Trust commissioned JOMEC\u000a      to conduct research assessing the performance of BBC news &#8212; across all TV,\u000a      radio and online outlets &#8212; in reflecting the new realities of devolved UK\u000a      politics. JOMEC was chosen, in part, because of its record of applying\u000a      more qualitative and discursive forms of analysis to large, quantifiable\u000a      samples. The project was led by Professor Justin Lewis (joined\u000a      JOMEC 15th August, 2000) and Dr Stephen Cushion,\u000a      Lecturer, promoted to Senior Lecturer in 2012 (joined JOMEC 1st\u000a      January, 2006).\u000a    The UK policy arena, following the devolution settlement in 1999, is\u000a      complex. Since devolution, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland\u000a      are free to pursue different approaches in key areas like health and\u000a      education, while powers over a number of other areas (like planning and\u000a      the environment) are partially devolved. Evaluating the ability of\u000a      journalism to reflect this post-devolution world accurately was a\u000a      difficult challenge, one that obliged us to be more interpretive than a\u000a      conventional content analysis.\u000a    Our research (analysing over 4,500 news items) examined a range of BBC\u000a      television, radio and online news outlets and the other main UK\u000a      broadcasters (ITV, Channel 4 and Sky). We found a series of shortcomings\u000a      in both the quality and accuracy of broadcast and online journalism. In\u000a      particular:\u000a    \u000a      in defining nationhood, England was often represented as a stand-in\u000a        for the UK as a whole. So, for example, policies only applicable to\u000a        England were often (misleadingly) reported as if they applied to\u000a        Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland;\u000a      in a broader sense, the `centre' (especially London and the South East\u000a        of England) received a disproportionate level of coverage at the expense\u000a        of `the periphery' (Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland);\u000a      the distinct policies of devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and\u000a        Northern Ireland were rarely acknowledged or discussed;\u000a      although devolved policy areas like health and education received\u000a        significant coverage, opportunities to compare and contrast\u000a        policies across the four nations (and thereby inform the democratic\u000a        choices available) were routinely ignored.\u000a    \u000a    These findings were detailed in a 102 page report produced by the\u000a      researchers and published by the BBC Trust in June 2008 (see section 3\u000a      publication 1). This then informed a series of recommendations from BBC\u000a      management, in September 2008, designed to improve coverage.\u000a    We were then commissioned by the BBC Trust to do follow up research in\u000a      2009 to assess the impact of these recommendations. Our follow up study\u000a      (also conducted by Lewis and Cushion) showed that BBC coverage had, across\u000a      the board, become significantly more attuned to the new world of devolved\u000a      UK politics (see section 3 publication. 4).\u000a    Key researchers: the work was led by Lewis and Cushion (both\u000a      established members of staff at JOMEC) with Groves (for the 2007 study)\u000a      and Ramsay (for the 2009 study) as the research associates employed in\u000a      JOMEC for the duration of the projects. A team of PhD student coders were\u000a      also employed on the projects for a few weeks.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18324","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact of the research has been to inform and influence policy makers\u000d\u000a      and campaigners around media regulation and the \"death knock\" throughout\u000d\u000a      the census period. In 2009 the PCC held an independent review to answer\u000d\u000a      criticism of its ability to deal effectively with complaints about press\u000d\u000a      behaviour led by Vivienne Hepworth. Frost was one of three academics out\u000d\u000a      of 30 witnesses invited to give oral evidence &#8212; after submitting a\u000d\u000a      research-led report for the NUJ. No significant recommendations made by\u000d\u000a      the NUJ to the review were accepted. These recommendations included the\u000d\u000a      ability to investigate issues and the right to apply punishments such as\u000d\u000a      fines for breaches of the code of practice,. These recommendations were\u000d\u000a      included in the Leveson report.\u000d\u000a    Frost's research was influential in alerting other policy-making bodies,\u000d\u000a      journalism professionals and campaigners to matters of concern that formed\u000d\u000a      part of the Leveson Inquiry. MediaWise, a charity supporting the victims\u000d\u000a      of media abuse, for instance, used the research into the PCC and the PCC's\u000d\u000a      ineffectiveness in dealing with complaints to inform their policies and in\u000d\u000a      reports and blogs. The research papers (2004, 2011) and work based on them\u000d\u000a      were also taken in evidence by Select Committee on Culture, Media and\u000d\u000a      Sport in its Fifth\u000a        Report in (2003), the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport\u000d\u000a      in its Seventh\u000a        Report in (2007) and the select committee of Culture, Media and\u000d\u000a      Sport in its report on Press Standards, privacy and libel in 2009. This\u000d\u000a      was usually to provide background support to the views of the NUJ.\u000d\u000a      Specific points on the performance of the PCC with regard to complaints\u000d\u000a      were identified as significant by various select committees such as the\u000d\u000a      2009 DCMS hearing and 2011 Home Affairs hearing.\u000d\u000a    The NUJ used the research and additional reports that flowed from it in\u000d\u000a      its various committees and policy forums to inform its own concerns about\u000d\u000a      media regulation. The research and prior select committee evidence was\u000d\u000a      used to underpin the NUJ submission to the Leveson Inquiry. The NUJ had\u000d\u000a      already called for major reform of the PCC through the early part of this\u000d\u000a      century and finally in 2011 called for a campaign to abolish the PCC\u000d\u000a      shortly before Leveson and the PCC's announcement it was to close.\u000d\u000a    Frost also provided the direct evidence to the Leveson Inquiry with much\u000d\u000a      written evidence including the research papers and work based on them\u000d\u000a      (see: www.levesoninquiry.org.uk\/evidence\/).\u000a      He also gave oral evidence in module four on the future of regulation (http:\/\/www.levesoninquiry.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2012\/07\/Transcript-of-Morning-Hearing-10-July-2012.pdf).\u000a    The key and hight profile a recommendation made by Leveson of the need for\u000d\u000a      statutory underpinning for a press regulator to give it authority and to\u000d\u000a      bring it more closely in line with Ofcom, was directly supported by the\u000d\u000a      research (Frost 2012). This followed NUJ policy and was and the union's\u000d\u000a      experience with the formation of the Irish Press Council, again informed\u000d\u000a      by the research (2004). The final Leveson report identifies some of\u000d\u000a      evidence derived from the research as a matter of significance on pages\u000d\u000a      1701 1706-7, and 1986. Newton also provided research based written\u000d\u000a      evidence to the Leveson (see: www.levesoninquiry.org.uk\/evidence\/).\u000d\u000a    Following the launch of the Leveson Inquiry, other countries decided to\u000d\u000a      investigate their media regulation and Prof Frost was invited to South\u000d\u000a      Africa in 2011 by the South Africa Press Commission to advise the chief\u000d\u000a      justice Pius Langa investigation into press regulation. The Ghanaian Press\u000d\u000a      Commission later visited the UK to investigate press freedom and\u000d\u000a      regulation to recommend a suitable model for Ghana, consulting with with\u000d\u000a      Frost. The research is also cited in the Australian Finkelstein report on\u000d\u000a      media regulation (their version of Leveson). One of the key areas of the\u000d\u000a      Leveson Inquiry was how the press deal with sources. Newton worked on his\u000d\u000a      aspect the research, looking at the so-called \"death knock\" &#8212; reporters\u000d\u000a      dealing with the recently bereaved. The DART Centre Europe invited her to\u000d\u000a      give a seminar with her co-writer. The Dart Centre Europe is a regional\u000d\u000a      hub for journalists and filmmakers who believe in the importance of\u000d\u000a      effective reporting on violence and trauma. It was attended by journalists\u000d\u000a      (including BBC and CNN), NGO representatives (e.g. British Red Cross) and\u000d\u000a      members of the Disaster Action Committee. Ms Newton was part of a podcast\u000d\u000a      with Steven Abell, then Director of the PCC, and Sal lalji from the\u000d\u000a      Samaritans on the ethics of death reporting. Her research has been used to\u000d\u000a      to support the approach of reporters on the Belfast, in Australia, on the\u000d\u000a      UK Daily Express, and the main journalism website (Journalism.co.uk).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The last 10 years leading up to the Leveson Inquiry have been a\u000d\u000a      significant period for journalism.

This work has demonstrated the weaknesses in\u000d\u000a      press regulation that underpin poor standards of press journalism\u000d\u000a      (evidence given to Leveson). This research has directly influenced policy\u000d\u000a      makers, campaigners, and the regulators in their examination of how\u000d\u000a      reporters work.

Jackie Newton has led research examining\u000d\u000a      the relationship between reporters and sources in circumstances of\u000d\u000a      bereavement. The so-called `death knock' &#8212; intrusion into private grief &#8212;\u000d\u000a      is covered by all the major UK journalism codes of practice. The central\u000d\u000a      importance of journalism to UK and Irish democracy makes the study of\u000d\u000a      their regulators, and their ability to do the job expected of them,\u000d\u000a      crucial. The press in particular has come under considerable scrutiny this\u000d\u000a      century following the revelations of phone hacking. Long before these\u000d\u000a      revelations journalism research identified as key the issues of the\u000d\u000a      media's ability to carry out its role responsibly with regard to sources\u000d\u000a      and to be regulated appropriately. Frost's work being a key contribution\u000d\u000a      to the field both academically and professionally. The work was inherently\u000d\u000a      engaged with stakeholders and intended to impact on journalistic practice\u000d\u000a      and media regulation. Frost's work over the past ten years exposed the\u000d\u000a      weaknesses of the PCC as a regulator, provided evidence for its many\u000d\u000a      critics, informed the NUJ's policy of seeking reform and then abolition.\u000d\u000a      The PCC was set up as, and claims to be, a press regulator but the\u000d\u000a      research carried out showed it to be a complaints body rather than a\u000d\u000a      regulator, a finding finally accepted by Lord Hunt, recently appointed as\u000d\u000a      chair of the PCC. The research concentrated on examining complaints made\u000d\u000a      to the PCC in order to evaluate its effectiveness as a regulator.\u000d\u000a      Quantitative examination of complaints allowed the researcher to identify\u000d\u000a      the key performance elements of the PCC and how the PCC was able to\u000d\u000a      influence the industry. A similar process was introduced with Ofcom\u000d\u000a      following its inauguration and publication followed after five years. The\u000d\u000a      research on the PCC (see Frost 2004, 2010, 2011, 2012) demonstrated that\u000d\u000a      from the start it was unwilling to take on the role of regulating the\u000d\u000a      press, preferring to conciliate and deflect criticism. Qualitative\u000d\u000a      examination of the data published in key peer-reviewed international\u000d\u000a      journals identified how newspapers circumvented the regulatory processes\u000d\u000a      in order to avoid criticism. However, there were areas where the PCC was\u000d\u000a      effective. The research showed that it had been able to influence the\u000d\u000a      press's coverage of minors and discrimination against individuals. Despite\u000d\u000a      these improvements the research results with regard to its overall\u000d\u000a      performance indicated it to be unfit for purpose. The research on Ofcom\u000d\u000a      however, found it to be taking an entirely different approach that gave\u000d\u000a      clear guidance to the industry on regulatory matters generally viewed as\u000d\u000a      acceptable. The research on sources (Duncan and Newton 2010, Newton 2011)\u000d\u000a      examined the relationship between reporters and the bereaved by carrying\u000d\u000a      out a number of qualitative interviews with both reporters and families\u000d\u000a      who had suffered bereavement. This showed unequivocally that despite\u000d\u000a      concerns from reporters and a general feeling that contact was wrong, the\u000d\u000a      bereaved often welcomed the opportunity to talk about their loss.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"19040","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"732800","Name":"Bulgaria"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Published by Walker Books, the only book ever commissioned by the Reader\u000a      Organisation and\u000a      the third chosen for their shared read, The Unforgotten Coat has\u000a      been distributed throughout the\u000a      UK and across the world including Australia, Hong Kong, Bulgaria and\u000a      Denmark.

They work in mental health\u000a      settings, prisons, and with\u000a      looked-after children. The Unforgotten Coat was central to RO's Our\u000a        Read project in 2011, in\u000a      conjunction with the Bluecoat Arts Centre in Liverpool. On 3 March 2011,\u000a      50,000 free copies of\u000a      the book were given away on World Book Day. That day, Hunter and Heney\u000a      took 25 young people\u000a      from Merseyside, all members of Get Into Reading projects, to\u000a      London on the `Story Train' for the\u000a      book's premiere. They gave a presentation to schoolchildren in the British\u000a      Library, and with Cottrell\u000a      Boyce, they explained why and how the photography was important to the\u000a      creation of the narrative.\u000a      In the Bluecoat Arts Centre in Liverpool on the same day, schoolchildren\u000a      from the Get Into Reading\u000a      group, members of the public, and staff from the Bluecoat and the Reader\u000a      Organisation\u000a      participated in four readings throughout the day. Evidence supplied\u000a      underlines the book's benefit\u000a      and impact, e.g. a secondary teacher in Toxteth used the book with Year\u000a      7s, describing how the\u000a      pupils `had lots to say about the photographs and how they related to the\u000a      story'. It stimulated `a\u000a      successful debate' where the group, `who usually talk over each other and\u000a      rarely enter into proper\u000a      discussion, each started asking other group members their opinions and\u000a      listening to their\u000a      answers'. Project workers for children on the story train offered examples\u000a      of how the book\u000a      stimulated reading. One foster carer reported: `B. read the book. I'm\u000a      amazed. He's never read a\u000a      book before [...] but this one he took to show everyone at [an alternative\u000a      education programme]\u000a      and finished it by himself'.

The Haven Project,\u000a      AfCiC's UK programme,\u000a      worked specifically with young asylum seekers and refugees in selected\u000a      British schools, including\u000a      Liverpool. Some refugee children are at risk of developing mental health\u000a      difficulties due to their\u000a      experiences. They may have experienced bereavement, be coping with harsh\u000a      memories,\u000a      separation and loss, and have experienced traumatic events such as seeing\u000a      people killed or\u000a      injured.\u000a    Working with a Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service psychotherapist\u000a      (Alder Hey\u000a      Children's NHS Trust), Hunter and Heney ran a workshop on\u000a      photo-elicitation (using photographs\u000a      to stimulate stories) with 15 refugee children and those with mental\u000a      health problems in Toxteth.\u000a      Drawing on the same creative process as the book, the workshop focused on\u000a      the children taking\u000a      three Polaroids and weaving stories from them. The Alder Hey Children's\u000a      hospital's evaluation\u000a      report states: `All participants [in the workshop] said they would like to\u000a      do more photography in the\u000a      future. Scores on the 10-point likert scale asking how happy or sad each\u000a      child felt after the session\u000a      yielded an average of 9.5' (p. 8). In conclusion, it states: `[...] The\u000a      evidence here provided further\u000a      attests to the positive impact these activities have upon children and\u000a      young people who otherwise\u000a      face barriers to becoming involved in these types of communal activities.\u000a      As an essential\u000a      engagement and wellbeing activity the evidence indicates that the use of\u000a      group workshops\u000a      promoting positive physical and mental wellbeing should remain central to\u000a      the provision of\u000a      community-based services more broadly' (p.11).

Both\u000a      Hunter and Heney joined Edge Hill University in November 2008 and have\u000a      been employed\u000a      throughout the assessment period.\u000a    The research underpinning The Unforgotten Coat, which was\u000a      published in 2011 by Walker\u000a      Books, examines the performative and affective nature of photographs.\u000a      Based on prior\u000a      collaborative research with Cottrell Boyce on Accelerate, a 2009\u000a      film that investigated how\u000a      photography could be used as a methodological approach to explore time and\u000a      movement, this\u000a      project draws on theoretical writings by filmmaker Andrej Tarkovsky in Instant\u000a        Light. This was a\u000a      collection of Polaroids and reflections on their effects, in which he\u000a      stated: `Never try to convey your\u000a      idea to the audience, it is a thankless and senseless task. Show them\u000a      life, and they'll find within\u000a      themselves the means to assess and appreciate it.' Drawing on this\u000a      approach, Hunter and Heney\u000a      explored both the way in which Polaroids represent life to people, which\u000a      they compare to working\u000a      with actors searching for motivation for their characters, and how the\u000a      images created can be used\u000a      in various ways by creators or viewers. In the context of the story, two\u000a      boys use Polaroids to create\u000a      a spectacle of a home they cannot remember, reconstructing artificial\u000a      memories of Mongolia from\u000a      the sights of Bootle to combat the psychological effects of being\u000a      displaced persons, and create a\u000a      self-defence mechanism and a means to fit in with their new surroundings.\u000a      They show their school\u000a      peers an illusory life, a spectacle that these children, especially Julie,\u000a      the narrator, can assess and\u000a      appreciate. The choice of Polaroid photography, by its very nature a\u000a      fragile medium, underlines\u000a      the fragility of this survival strategy. The additional use of Photoshop\u000a      lends aesthetic emphasis to\u000a      the impossibility of inhabiting a world they do not remember, by\u000a      accentuating the illusory nature of\u000a      the photographs.\u000a    Importantly, this was a collaborative project between the writer and the\u000a      researchers. Unlike\u000a      traditional illustrative photographs, the original photographs were\u000a      integral to the development\u000a      process; the author often responded to the images in developing the\u000a      narrative: `The whole climax\u000a      [...] came from trying to make use of their pictures' (Factual Statement\u000a      1). Word and image thus\u000a      sit in a complex relationship of traditional and reverse ekphrasis,\u000a      stimulating and responding to\u000a      each other. Investigating Tarkovsky's theory of photographs as metaphors\u000a      rather than symbols,\u000a      the Polaroids provide a significant visual stimulus to complement the\u000a      verbal, thus creating a\u000a      narrative of greater accessibility for an audience not used to engaging\u000a      with verbal stories on this\u000a      topic, as well as for migrants whose experiences mirror those recounted in\u000a      the book. The research\u000a      process was underpinned by discussion with the Reader Organisation about\u000a      how to engage more\u000a      effectively with people with little or no experience in reading. Its\u000a      success in finding an audience,\u000a      being critically acclaimed and translated into several different\u000a      languages, suggests that the\u000a      creative interplay between text and photograph that underpins its content\u000a      is rich, and has driven\u000a      the impact, as testified by a series of workshops run in collaboration\u000a      with the Haven Project and\u000a      Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust.\u000a    The insights gained in the research are that:\u000a    \u000a      Stories developed from visual material allow for greater access to\u000a        verbal narratives for\u000a        groups with little experience of reading stories\u000a      The specific and unique texture of the narrative helped convey the\u000a        refugee experience\u000a        more accessibly to wide audiences\u000a      Such approaches to narrative help displaced individuals understand\u000a        their situation and\u000a        represent their problems to a wider audience, thus contributing to\u000a        public debates around\u000a        migration.\u000a    \u000a    These aspects explain the Reader Organisation's use of the book, and the\u000a      Haven Project\/Alder\u000a      Hey NHS Trust's deployment of photographs in therapeutic storytelling\u000a      workshops (see Factual\u000a      Statement 2).\u000a    The inspiration for the story was derived from the ongoing research\u000a      Hunter and Heney have\u000a      undertaken in giving voice to the disenfranchised since researching the\u000a      experience of refugees in\u000a      the UK for their fundraising film for the Family Refugee Support Project.\u000a      It led in turn to Channel 4\u000a      commissioning a documentary series entitled Putting Down Roots as\u000a      part of the 3-Minute Wonder\u000a      series, exploring the experiences of refugees on an allotment project in\u000a      Liverpool and Hunter's\u000a      involvement with the Merseyside community group \"Art in Action\". The\u000a      real-life stories were\u000a      adapted by Hunter and Cottrell Boyce into the full-length feature film Grow\u000a        Your Own (2007).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"19041","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Claim 1: Engaging new audiences with a previously lost\u000d\u000a          aspect of Birmingham's cultural\u000d\u000a          history from the 1970s and 80s (Corroboration: Factual Statements 1-2;\u000d\u000a          Other Sources 1)\u000d\u000a      Through his research into the BFVW and its engagement with socio-political\u000d\u000a      themes of the period,\u000d\u000a      Shannon stimulated wider interest and engagement in this largely\u000d\u000a      neglected aspect of UK film\u000d\u000a      history, but especially the overlooked role played by the Birmingham film\u000d\u000a      collective and their\u000d\u000a      influence (on Channel 4 and Independents such as Maverick TV, founded by\u000d\u000a      BFVW member\u000d\u000a      Jonnie Turpie MBE). Shannon's research thus led to an invitation\u000d\u000a      from the director of Vivid Gallery\u000d\u000a      in Birmingham to participate in a roundtable debate in 2008 about the Film\u000d\u000a      Workshop Movement,\u000d\u000a      including director Alan Lovell (Traces Left; 1983).\u000d\u000a    One key outcome of this discussion was the curation of a public\u000d\u000a      exhibition titled Participation\u000d\u000a      at the Vivid Gallery (2 July &#8212; 1 August 2009), comprising the five-week\u000d\u000a      exhibition, six screening\u000d\u000a      programmes and four talks. Shannon was the principal consultant\u000d\u000a      and adviser for this exhibition,\u000d\u000a      curated the discrete film programmes, which documented films from BFVW and\u000d\u000a      other workshops\u000d\u000a      across the UK as a whole, including films from Belfast, Bradford, Cardiff,\u000d\u000a      Gateshead, London,\u000d\u000a      Newcastle and Sheffield, and gave the opening address. At the exhibition's\u000d\u000a      core was the newly\u000d\u000a      digitised body of film and video work from the BFVW that had been\u000d\u000a      completely overlooked up to\u000d\u000a      that point (see Claim 2 below). The exhibition made the work of\u000d\u000a      the Birmingham Workshop far\u000d\u000a      more widely available publicly than before, showcasing for a whole new\u000d\u000a      audience the newly\u000d\u000a      available BVFW films, including the 1983 BFVW Helen Biggar documentary Traces\u000d\u000a        Left. 471\u000d\u000a      visitors were recorded at the gallery, with one remarking: `The visit was\u000d\u000a      great. I took my husband\u000d\u000a      to see it afterwards. It made me think about the tradition of film, in\u000d\u000a      aesthetic terms and in terms of\u000d\u000a      representation of a specific time' (Factual Statement 1). Another\u000d\u000a      said: `It was a perfect\u000d\u000a      introduction to learning about the artistic heritage of the region, and as\u000d\u000a      an aspiring curator it has\u000d\u000a      really inspired me to think about exhibitions that draw on the region's\u000d\u000a      past'. The attendees were\u000d\u000a      young and old, and their experiences were evaluated by Vivid (Factual\u000d\u000a        Statement 1). Selected\u000d\u000a      films from the exhibition were toured to the Foyle Film Festival (2010),\u000d\u000a      with Shannon attending a\u000d\u000a      discussion panel; screenings were held at the MAC (2012), which `brought\u000d\u000a      images of youth\u000d\u000a      cultures [...] to the attention of newer audiences, prompting a\u000d\u000a      wide-ranging discussion' (Factual\u000d\u000a        Statement 2); IPS, Bournville (2013); and Glasgow Film Theatre\u000d\u000a      (2013). 20 young people took\u000d\u000a      part in a workshop prior to Participation, which drew parallels\u000d\u000a      between the `do-it-yourself'\u000d\u000a      aesthetics evident in the 1980s underground and the 2000s.

The\u000d\u000a      exhibition programme, which included an essay commissioned from Shannon,\u000d\u000a      was published\u000d\u000a      online and had 9875 hits (Factual Statement 1; Other Source 1).\u000d\u000a      The Vivid director attests to\u000d\u000a      the impact of Shannon's research `in showing us the significance\u000d\u000a      of archives' and `public\u000d\u000a      engagement has demonstrated the ongoing hunger for events which tell the\u000d\u000a      story and history of\u000d\u000a      our city' (Factual Statement 1).\u000d\u000a    Claim 2: Rediscovery and digitisation of old BFVW film and\u000d\u000a          video material, now archived\u000d\u000a          at Vivid, for new audiences (Corroboration: Factual Statement 1)\u000d\u000a      Shannon played a role in Vivid's successful application for funding\u000d\u000a      to the UK Film Council's Digital\u000d\u000a      Archive Fund to digitise the BFVW materials, which had been recorded\u000d\u000a      either on 16mm film or\u000d\u000a      low-band UMATIC video, and thus inaccessible to a wider public audience\u000d\u000a      for a number of years\u000d\u000a      and vulnerable to degradation. The films now reside in Vivid's digital\u000d\u000a      archive, where they are\u000d\u000a      available for DVD copying and for future presentations, tours and\u000d\u000a      screenings at arts centres,\u000d\u000a      galleries and festivals (e.g. Hell Unltd screening\/tour package; Claim\u000d\u000a        3 below). A showreel DVD\u000d\u000a      was distributed to 30 schools, colleges, regional screens, museums and\u000d\u000a      galleries in the\u000d\u000a      Birmingham region.\u000d\u000a    Using this newly accessible material, a thematic package for\u000d\u000a      schools\/FE\/HE groups was\u000d\u000a      produced by Vivid with contextual material commissioned from the original\u000d\u000a      BFVW filmmakers and\u000d\u000a      producers, enhanced by social and historical commentaries commissioned\u000d\u000a      from academics,\u000d\u000a      including Shannon. In 2011, Vivid also developed a community\u000d\u000a      partnership scheme, `Home\u000d\u000a      Movies', on the theme of `home', drawing on films from the new archive.\u000d\u000a      This programme was\u000d\u000a      produced by Birmingham-based company Reel Access in collaboration with\u000d\u000a      residents from Hodge\u000d\u000a      Hill. Selections were screened at community venues in two areas of the\u000d\u000a      city (Jan-Mar 2011) as\u000d\u000a      part of a Birmingham Cultural Partnership initiative to support activity\u000d\u000a      in local sites, which led to a\u000d\u000a      group of people participating in a learning programme, developing basic\u000d\u000a      programming and\u000d\u000a      interpretation skills in order to produce a series of screenings in the\u000d\u000a      Pump Centre (Hodge Hill) and\u000d\u000a      Vivid (Digbeth). As part of this initiative, the group also facilitated a\u000d\u000a      discussion evening, attended\u000d\u000a      by 50 people, at which Shannon was a speaker. As one participant\u000d\u000a      remarked: `I liked the\u000d\u000a      democratic feel to [the project] and the opportunity to work with a wider\u000d\u000a      range of people from my\u000d\u000a      usual circle of acquaintances. I am interested in film and also the\u000d\u000a      culture of ordinary people'. Reel\u000d\u000a      Access commented that access to the Vivid archive inspired them to\u000d\u000a      `[build] on the ideas of using\u000d\u000a      archive footage to create exhibitions and new work [...] and it is\u000d\u000a      exciting to see how they shape\u000d\u000a      new work whether that be in the form of a new exhibition or a new piece of\u000d\u000a      filmmaking'.

A close\u000d\u000a      relative of Biggar's has\u000d\u000a      welcomed the impact of Shannon's research for `reactivat[ing]\u000d\u000a      interest' in her aunt's career,\u000d\u000a      especially in her hometown of Glasgow (Factual Statement 3). Head\u000d\u000a      film archivist at the Norman\u000d\u000a      McLaren archive (collection GB 0559 GAA \/ 31) concurred, adding that Shannon's\u000d\u000a      research has\u000d\u000a      `had the additional benefit for the University of Stirling of bringing to\u000d\u000a      light papers relating to the\u000d\u000a      making of Hell Unltd held in private hands.

In particular,\u000d\u000a      the two films in question\u000d\u000a      have inspired her to start a project around what has historically happened\u000d\u000a      to creative women.\u000d\u000a    Shannon introduced the screening and chaired a concluding question\u000d\u000a      and answer session.\u000d\u000a      As a consequence of the success of the event, a tour package has been\u000d\u000a      assembled for theatres\u000d\u000a      and arts centres, taking both films, Hell Unltd and Traces\u000d\u000a        Left, and composer\/musician Kim Moore\u000d\u000a      across the country. By virtue of Shannon's ongoing work on Biggar\u000d\u000a      and independent film of the\u000d\u000a      1930s, a Montreal-based writer and independent film researcher, who is\u000d\u000a      working on a book and\u000d\u000a      radio documentary on McLaren, `discovered the truth behind this creative\u000d\u000a      woman who was such\u000d\u000a      an overlooked force in McLaren's young life and the Glasgow\u000d\u000a      artistic-political scene of the period'\u000d\u000a      (Factual Statement 5).

This research, alongside Shannon's knowledge\u000d\u000a      exchange expertise on\u000d\u000a      film funding and policy (as former Head of Production at the UK Film\u000d\u000a      Council, BFI and Scottish\u000d\u000a      Screen), has had a significant impact on understanding the role of the UK\u000d\u000a      regions in film\u000d\u000a      production.

Channel 4 was, alongside the BFI, the principal source of funding\u000d\u000a      for independent film\u000d\u000a      workshops yet there has been little research hitherto examining the unique\u000d\u000a      contribution of the\u000d\u000a      Birmingham Workshop, with its regional nuance on themes of race, youth,\u000d\u000a      gender and politics\u000d\u000a      (and connections with Birmingham's Centre for Contemporary Cultural\u000d\u000a      Studies: CCCS).\u000d\u000a      Shannon's specific research into the BFVW, published in a special\u000d\u000a      dossier in the Historical\u000d\u000a        Journal of Film, Radio and Television, documents its engagement in\u000d\u000a      debates over the\u000d\u000a      development of Channel 4, wider media policy issues, screen education and\u000d\u000a      cultural politics, as\u000d\u000a      well as exploring the way in which the work both reacted to, and\u000d\u000a      documented, the rise of\u000d\u000a      Thatcherism, and social and cultural events from 1979 onwards: for\u000d\u000a      example, the inner-city\u000d\u000a      disturbances, the miners' strike, and increasing social disparity and\u000d\u000a      racial tensions. Its output in\u000d\u000a      the 1980s amounted to over 25 films, including documentaries, dramas,\u000d\u000a      series for television,\u000d\u000a      campaigning films as well as Out of Order (1986), the first\u000d\u000a      UK feature film shot entirely on video,\u000d\u000a      and the Grierson Award-winning The Miners' Tapes. Shannon's\u000d\u000a      research analyses why the films\u000d\u000a      produced have been almost entirely overlooked in the interim and yet were\u000d\u000a      critical to independent\u000d\u000a      filmmaking in the UK, especially in representing a diversity of culture\u000d\u000a      and politics.\u000d\u000a    In particular, Shannon has explored and championed the work of\u000d\u000a      Helen Biggar, the subject of\u000d\u000a      Traces Left (1983), a BFVW documentary produced and written by Shannon,\u000d\u000a      highlighting her role\u000d\u000a      as Norman McLaren's key, yet forgotten and neglected, collaborator in his\u000d\u000a      film work in the 1930s,\u000d\u000a      in films such as Hell Unltd (1936). In two articles published in Historical\u000d\u000a        Journal of Film, Television\u000d\u000a        and Radio (References 1, 2), Shannon argues that the BFVW\u000d\u000a      was drawn to the pioneering spirit\u000d\u000a      of visual art as socio-politically engaged, exemplified by artists such as\u000d\u000a      Biggar and McLaren (and\u000d\u000a      their engagement with the Spanish Civil War), and that this participatory\u000d\u000a      approach to art and\u000d\u000a      politics demands further exploration and recognition, including\u000d\u000a      contemporary work such as that of\u000d\u000a      filmmakers John Akomfrah (director of Handsworth Songs in 1986),\u000d\u000a      who is also a product of the\u000d\u000a      Workshop Movement with the film collective Black Audio Film. Thus,\u000d\u000a      Shannon's recent research\u000d\u000a      into the career of Helen Biggar, whose collaborative films have largely\u000d\u000a      been neglected, makes an\u000d\u000a      important contribution to a revisionist understanding of independent film\u000d\u000a      work produced from the\u000d\u000a      1930s. It contributes by enabling hitherto unavailable work to be made\u000d\u000a      viewable to the public\u000d\u000a      through a digital archive, brings to light the key role of pioneering\u000d\u000a      regional film movements, and\u000d\u000a      raises important questions about both the processes of collaborative film\u000d\u000a      authorship, and the\u000d\u000a      historically neglected contribution of women artists such as Biggar to the\u000d\u000a      protest movement.

In the mid-1990s, the narrative emphasised rapid\u000d\u000a      change in digital technologies and the rate of diffusion in the market. It\u000d\u000a      neglected citizen interests in trusted services, privacy and affordable\u000d\u000a      access. Drawing on Mansell's research, in 2005, UNESCO signalled a major\u000d\u000a      shift towards information, or knowledge, society policy with a focus on\u000d\u000a      people, fairness and equity in the digital world. Mansell's research had\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that when citizen interests are neglected, the chances of\u000d\u000a      achieving inclusive policy goals are much reduced. Her persistent advocacy\u000d\u000a      of citizen-centred policy in United Nations agency forums has influenced\u000d\u000a      subsequent policy; as a result, policies implemented by government and\u000d\u000a      third sector organisations more often reflect privacy, safety, online\u000d\u000a      freedoms and equitable access to networks. For example, Mansell's work for\u000d\u000a      UNESCO was reflected its 2008-13 Medium-Term Strategy [A]. She authored\u000d\u000a      UNESCO's World Report, Renewing the Knowledge Societies Vision in\u000d\u000a      2013 [B]. Many of her recommendations were repeated in UNESCO's\u000d\u000a      recommendations for the United Nations review of the Millennium Goals [C].\u000d\u000a      The report is approved for publication by UNESCO and world distribution in\u000d\u000a      Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Portuguese, Spanish and Russian in 2014,\u000d\u000a      in time to influence the final deliberations on the Millennium Goals that\u000d\u000a      bear on how policies concerned with digital technologies can contribute to\u000d\u000a      inclusive development.\u000d\u000a    The impact of Mansell's research on policies aimed at increasing investment\u000a          in broadband networks has extended to regions such as\u000d\u000a      Latin America and the Caribbean. Policies in this region increasingly are\u000d\u000a      incorporating the idea of `open development'. This gives much greater\u000d\u000a      attention to demand, diverse user needs, open (in contrast to proprietary)\u000d\u000a      digital services, and equitable access. Based on her research on regional\u000d\u000a      strategies aimed at developing network infrastructures in the US and\u000d\u000a      Europe, she was invited to present her recommendations on behalf of\u000d\u000a      regional civil society organisations, and the Canadian International\u000d\u000a      Development Research Centre, at the Fourth Ministerial Meeting on the\u000d\u000a      Information Society for Latin American and the Caribbean Region in Uruguay\u000d\u000a      in 2013.\u000d\u000a    Mansell's research has impacted on measures aimed at curtailing copyright\u000a          infringement resulting in moderation of ill-conceived measures to\u000d\u000a        combat online `piracy' and agreement to independently assess the impact\u000d\u000a        of the Digital Economy Act 2010 in the UK. The creative industry\u000d\u000a      argues that legislation is needed to reduce online `piracy' or copyright\u000d\u000a      infringement. The Act introduced measures to monitor the activities of\u000d\u000a      Internet users suspected of infringing copyright. This was challenged in\u000d\u000a      the Administrative High Court by Internet Service Providers (who are\u000d\u000a      obliged to provide data about their customers under the Act) because of\u000d\u000a      its implications for citizen privacy and their competitiveness. Mansell\u000d\u000a      served as expert witness on behalf of British Telecom and TalkTalk in the\u000d\u000a      Judicial Review. Her evidence was used to challenge claims by creative\u000d\u000a      industry about the costs of copyright infringement to their businesses and\u000d\u000a      to support the argument that copyright enforcement must be proportional,\u000d\u000a      taking into account changing online cultural norms [D]. Her evidence was\u000d\u000a      quoted and found to be very finely balanced with government and creative\u000d\u000a      industry counterarguments [E]. The court accepted the case for an initial\u000d\u000a      one year implementation of the Act so as to assess whether the measures\u000d\u000a      have the impacts on copyright infringement claimed by the industry. The\u000d\u000a      implementation of the Act by the regulator, Ofcom, has been delayed and is\u000d\u000a      not to be introduced until at least 2015. The impact here was to credibly\u000d\u000a      challenge the creative industry and government claims about the\u000d\u000a      proportionality of the Act.\u000d\u000a    In policy concerned with Internet security and privacy,\u000d\u000a      Mansell's research influenced policies concerning the use of intrusive\u000d\u000a        surveillance technologies. Post 9\/11, some police authorities and\u000d\u000a      politicians strongly advocated swift implementation of privacy invasive\u000d\u000a      uses of the Internet to combat serious online crime and terrorist threats.\u000d\u000a      Mansell's report on Cyber Trust and Crime Prevention for the Office of\u000d\u000a      Science and Technology Foresight concluded that strategies to improve the\u000d\u000a      security and trustworthiness of networks must minimise breaches of citizen\u000d\u000a      privacy if they are to be effective and consistent with democratic values\u000d\u000a      [F]. The social science input to a twelve-month deliberation process,\u000d\u000a      involving stakeholders from the Home Office, MI6 and technology and\u000d\u000a      digital service specialists, was led by Mansell as lead expert\u000d\u000a      representing all the social sciences, including economics. The result of\u000d\u000a      this work was that stakeholders started to see why technical fixes to\u000d\u000a      security risks are very partial answers to the development of online trust\u000d\u000a      and the protection of citizen rights to privacy. This work continues to\u000d\u000a      influence policy debates. For example, when the Communications Data Bill\u000d\u000a      2013 in the UK was proposed, it was seen by civil society groups as\u000d\u000a      increasing the risk to citizens' rights to privacy, resulting in\u000d\u000a      evidence-based objections which drew partly on Mansell's work for the\u000d\u000a      Foresight project.\u000d\u000a    Wider Implications: When citizen interests are neglected by those\u000d\u000a      who make policy around digital information, there is a high risk that\u000d\u000a      people will be excluded from the local and global benefits that come with\u000d\u000a      access to the Internet. The risk is also high that they will be subject to\u000d\u000a      intrusive surveillance and threats to their privacy. Mansell's emphasis on\u000d\u000a      a citizen-centred policy has influenced choices about how digital networks\u000d\u000a      and services are developed and used. This has material consequences for\u000d\u000a      whether citizens benefit from their information societies. With moves by\u000d\u000a      governments to suppress copyright infringement, to allow inspection of\u000d\u000a      emails and private communications, and to promote massive investment in\u000d\u000a      broadband networks, effective advocacy of citizen-centred policies based\u000d\u000a      on systematic empirical evidence is vital. It is one means of restraining\u000d\u000a      the excesses of state and business enthusiasm for digital technologies\u000d\u000a      that put citizens at risk. These impacts are important to foster consent\u000d\u000a      in democratic societies.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Robin Mansell's research has impacted on government policy and corporate\u000d\u000a      strategy in the areas of copyright and the Internet, investment in\u000d\u000a      broadband networks, and arrangements for achieving network security and\u000d\u000a      individual privacy protection.

Professor\u000d\u000a      Robin Mansell's research has challenged this one-dimensional view that\u000d\u000a      markets and technology will deliver these benefits. The research\u000d\u000a      underpinning the impact has three main strands: the development of\u000d\u000a      policies for digital technology; the dynamics of copyright infringement;\u000d\u000a      and network security and citizens' privacy.\u000d\u000a    With respect to policies for digital technology, the\u000d\u000a      proliferation of digital media and information applications is spawning\u000d\u000a      high hopes for economic prosperity and countless improvements in citizens'\u000d\u000a      lives. The dominant claim in policy forums is that the diffusion of\u000d\u000a      digital technologies in the market will address problems of uneven access\u000d\u000a      to networks and services, enabling everyone to participate in society.\u000d\u000a      Professor Mansell's research has demonstrated that these accounts are\u000d\u000a      informed by a one-dimensional model of technological change. Policies\u000d\u000a      developed from them lead to imbalances where citizens' interests in open\u000d\u000a      access to the Internet and trusted information services are neglected in\u000d\u000a      favour of corporate interests in the commercial value of digital\u000d\u000a      information, or state interests in monitoring citizens' online activities\u000d\u000a      to prevent crime and terrorist threats. For example, her research has\u000d\u000a      analysed information society policies aimed at creating incentives for\u000d\u000a      network infrastructure development, the expansion of creative output using\u000d\u000a      the Internet, and policies for data protection at the global, regional and\u000d\u000a      national levels. She has shown how they often privilege market-led\u000d\u000a      developments, the financial goals of companies, or the interests of the\u000d\u000a      state in security. There is far less concern in developing policies and\u000d\u000a      strategies for the design and use of digital technologies and services\u000d\u000a      that take account of the interests of citizens and of distinctive local\u000d\u000a      economic, political or social aspirations. This research has demonstrated\u000d\u000a      that innovations in the digital world are not the inevitable outcome of\u000d\u000a      technology or the market, but the result of the complex interaction of\u000d\u000a      cultural, social, political and economic choices [1, 2, 3]. Mansell also\u000d\u000a      has examined justifications for public and private investment in broadband\u000d\u000a      networks, in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, showing that policy\u000d\u000a      overemphasises supply side measures (the push for faster broadband\u000d\u000a      networks) and neglects the demand side (fostering skills and online\u000d\u000a      participation). She has shown that the result is continuing barriers to\u000d\u000a      inclusive digital services, creating challenges for citizens to\u000d\u000a      participate in the online world effectively [4].\u000d\u000a    Mansell's research on the economic and behavioural determinants of copyright\u000a        infringement has challenged assumptions underpinning claims about\u000d\u000a      the scale of the impact of digital `piracy' on the creative industry. Her\u000d\u000a      work has shown why the industry claims about citizen responses to the\u000d\u000a      criminalisation of online copyright infringement are flawed in the light\u000d\u000a      of evidence of actual online behaviour and the emergence of a strong\u000d\u000a      online sharing culture. Her analysis of evidence on the online culture and\u000d\u000a      the varied experiences of countries has shown that the impact of\u000d\u000a      legislation that targets illegal downloading of music, films and\u000d\u000a      television programmes by citizens is ambiguous at best. It neglects the\u000d\u000a      fact that the creative industry is changing its business models and\u000d\u000a      adapting to the online world in innovative ways that, in some cases, build\u000d\u000a      on the sharing culture. Legislation aimed at suppressing this culture can\u000d\u000a      be counterproductive for the industry and inhibit citizen use of the\u000d\u000a      Internet [5].\u000d\u000a    Her research on the technical and social factors that influence network\u000a        security and citizens' online privacy has shown decisively why there\u000d\u000a      is a risk that some of the technical capabilities of the Internet which\u000d\u000a      enable the monitoring of citizen online activities, or result in\u000d\u000a      inadvertent or intentional disclosure of their information, could be used\u000d\u000a      in ways that threaten privacy. The Internet provides the means to analyse\u000d\u000a      this information for targeted advertising and to monitor individuals. Her\u000d\u000a      research has revealed the differences between policy makers' assumptions\u000d\u000a      about how these technologies are being used to combat online crime and\u000d\u000a      terrorist threats, and how they actually are being used by companies,\u000d\u000a      states and individuals. She has shown that policy makers often place undue\u000d\u000a      trust in technology to protect citizens and assume that prevailing digital\u000d\u000a      technology uses are consistent with citizens' democratic rights to privacy\u000d\u000a      and freedom of expression, showing the real danger that the technology\u000d\u000a      could be used in ways that infringe on citizens' rights.

The quality of the\u000a      main output (No. 4 &#8212; the monograph listed above) has been widely\u000a      recognised by scholars in the field. For example, a review in a leading\u000a      international relations journal published by the Royal Institute of\u000a      International Affairs refers to the book as `an important book, which\u000a      should be read by all those with an interest in Chinese foreign affairs\u000a      and international security' including practitioners. (International\u000a        Affairs, Vol. 85, No. 4, July 2009, pp. 909-910). A top China\u000a      studies journal based in Australia also concludes that the book is\u000a      `particularly valuable' in providing `a bridge between Chinese experts\u000a      writing on their perception of the world and dominant Western theories on\u000a      international relations' (The China Journal, No. 63, January 2010,\u000a      pp. 232-234). An independent Russian international relations journal\u000a      sponsored by the MacArthur Foundation published a long review of the book\u000a      with the judgment that it is `a rich and well-crafted study' which `will\u000a      be useful to a wide range of readers, especially those who are interested\u000a      in the problems of the Asia-Pacific region and China's role in world\u000a      politics' (International Trends: Journal of International Relations\u000a        Theory and World Politics, Vol. 8, No. 2, 2010). Indeed, Times\u000a        Higher Education concurs that the book provides `a useful overview\u000a      of Chinese thinking about the world' (22 October 2009).\u000a    ","ResearchSubjectAreas":[{"Level1":"16","Level2":"6","Subject":"Political Science"},{"Level1":"21","Level2":"3","Subject":"Historical Studies"}],"Sources":"\u000a    [text removed for publication]\u000a    ","Title":"\u000a    Identity and Security Discourse: The Rise of China and Asia-Pacific\u000a      Security\u000a    ","UKLocation":[],"UKRegion":[],"UOA":"Communication, Cultural and Media Studies, Library and Information Management ","UnderpinningResearch":"\u000a    This research is undertaken and led by Dr Rex Li, Reader in International\u000a      Journalism and International Relations at Liverpool John Moores\u000a      University. It began in the mid-1990s as part of a wider project on\u000a      international relations in the Pacific Rim funded by the ESRC. The\u000a      research is part of an on-going process to analyse the changing security\u000a      environment in the Asia-Pacific region, focusing in particular on the rise\u000a      of China as a great power and its regional and global implications.\u000a      Specifically, the project has examined the security discourse of Chinese\u000a      policy elites on the major powers in East Asia in relation to China's\u000a      self-perception as a rising power. The central argument of the project is\u000a      that a country's security perceptions are shaped by the desire and efforts\u000a      of its policy elites to construct a distinct national identity. While\u000a      acknowledging the relevance of material forces such as power and\u000a      capability, the research has explored the significance of ideational\u000a      factors such as values, norms and identity. It draws upon the theoretical\u000a      insights of various academic disciplines, including International\u000a      Relations, Media Studies, Sociology and Social Psychology.\u000a    When this research started in the mid-1990s, China's power and influence\u000a      were relatively limited. Since then China has become much more powerful in\u000a      both economic and military terms. Moreover, China's political influence on\u000a      many regional and global issues has increased substantially. Meanwhile,\u000a      the scale and intensity of its interactions with the wider world have been\u000a      dramatically augmented. The project has tracked, dissected and analysed\u000a      the changing discourse of Chinese policy elites for over 15 years.\u000a    The discourse analysis in this project is based on extensive interviews\u000a      and a wide range of Chinese-language sources that are not readily\u000a      available in the West. Most of the documentary sources consulted are\u000a      produced mainly for domestic audiences. They are published by the\u000a      organisations that are considered to have substantial input into China's\u000a      foreign policy and\/or significant impact on the security debates among\u000a      Chinese elites. The value of the source materials lies in their authors'\u000a      unique positions in China's foreign policy-making process. In addition,\u000a      the project has utilised information that has been gathered through off\u000a      the record interviews and public discussions with many Chinese scholars\u000a      and think-tanks specialists.\u000a    The key research insights of this project indicate that Chinese elites\u000a      perceive the power, aspirations and security strategies of other major\u000a      countries or actors, such as America, Russia, Japan and the European\u000a      Union, primarily in terms of their implications for China's construction\u000a      of a great power identity. The findings published in various well-reviewed\u000a      books and prestigious journals demonstrate that China is deeply\u000a      apprehensive of the strategic intentions of the US and Japan, and that\u000a      Chinese suspicion of Russia is minimal, at least for the time being\u000a      (please see Section 3 for details of publications). The Chinese discourse\u000a      of the EU is much more positive, which is treated as a significant force\u000a      in an emerging multipolar world that China has been trying to promote\u000a      since the end of the Cold War. The research does not indicate that China\u000a      will seek to confront America and Japan in the near future. This is\u000a      because Chinese elites are well aware of the fact that China's military\u000a      capabilities are not as strong as those of the two East Asian powers. They\u000a      also understand that a confrontation with them would be detrimental to\u000a      Chinese economic interests, making it more difficult for China to fulfil\u000a      its great power aspirations. However, should Chinese leaders fail to\u000a      attain their national goals through existing strategies, there is no\u000a      guarantee that they will not pursue a belligerent policy towards the US\u000a      and Japan. After all, the Chinese writings examined in this project\u000a      clearly reveal a discursive construction of the two countries as\u000a      threatening `others', who seek to undermine China's efforts to achieve a\u000a      great power status. This partly explains why China has become more\u000a      assertive in dealing with its territorial disputes with Japan and South\u000a      East Asian countries in the past few years. It can also explain China's\u000a      strong reactions to the Obama administration's re-balancing strategy in\u000a      the Asia-Pacific region (ref 2, ref 4: chapters 2-6, refs 5 and 6).\u000a    An important question that is often raised in the rise of China debate is\u000a      whether and to what extent China will respect the rules and norms of\u000a      international society. The research findings indicate that China has\u000a      adopted a strategy of integrating itself into the existing system, while\u000a      seeking to exert influence on the agenda, rules and operation of various\u000a      international institutions and regimes wherever possible. The evidence\u000a      suggests that China is hoping to use its involvement in a wide range of\u000a      international bodies to enhance its great power status. It also suggests\u000a      that the long-term goal of Chinese elites is to gradually reshape the\u000a      norms and rules of the international society to reflect China's growing\u000a      power and its expanding global interests. Many Chinese elites support the\u000a      notion of China's `peaceful rise', but they also believe in the utility of\u000a      military force in achieving Chinese national goals. The internal debate\u000a      among Chinese elites on China's `peaceful rise' does not provide\u000a      conclusive evidence as to whether it is a reflection of short-term\u000a      considerations aiming to minimise potential obstruction to China's\u000a      ascendancy, or a long-term strategy that would renounce the use of force\u000a      in fulfilling its great power aspirations (ref 1, ref 4: Chapters 6\u000a        and 7).\u000a    Another significant research insight is related to the impact of China's\u000a      domestic development on its foreign policy. While most observers expect\u000a      China to grow continuously, there are numerous domestic problems that may\u000a      derail China's economic progress and cause instability in Chinese society.\u000a      This would have significant repercussions on China's external relations.\u000a      For example, China might opt for an assertive or adventurous foreign\u000a      policy as a result of internal factors such as serious economic crises,\u000a      social and political turmoil, rising nationalistic sentiments, and\u000a      pressure from some quarters of the military. A main conclusion derived\u000a      from the research is that the West must prepare for various scenarios of a\u000a      rising China, including the security implications of a strong but chaotic\u000a      China (ref 1, ref 4: Chapters 1 and 7).\u000a    Chinese security discourse is shaped by China's self-identity as an\u000a      ascending power, the regional and international security environment, and\u000a      external responses to its rise to a great power status. If perception is\u000a      socially constructed, it may be altered via the development of\u000a      intersubjective knowledge, ideas, norms and institutions. Indeed, the\u000a      research demonstrates that Chinese elites' security discourse has\u000a      undergone considerable changes over the past two decades due partly to\u000a      China's increasing interactions with Western and other Asian countries.\u000a      The research findings indicate that the internalisation of international\u000a      norms in Chinese identity formation, and cultivation of intersubjective\u000a      ideas of `other-help' and `collective identity' between China and its\u000a      Asian neighbours would help curtail the tendency of belligerent behaviour\u000a      as China grows stronger. China should therefore be persuaded that the\u000a      success of its emergence as a `responsible great power' will rest on its\u000a      willingness and ability to establish a stable and cooperative relationship\u000a      with other major actors in the world, particularly the great powers in\u000a      East Asia. One of the major conclusions arising from this work is that it\u000a      is important for Western analysts and policy-makers to monitor Chinese\u000a      security discourse closely, which has been changing considerably in the\u000a      past few years. This has had a significant impact on China's foreign\u000a      policy as its economic power and political influence are increasing (refs\u000a        1 and 3, ref 4: chapters 6 and 7, and ref 6).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"20537","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3686110","Name":"Colombia"},{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Colusso's practice as research &#8212; as exemplified across various formats\u000a      and outlets including TV\u000a      and documentary film, social media, academic publications and\u000a      participation in various public\u000a      forums &#8212; has led to enhanced audience awareness of the relationship\u000a      between politics, hierarchies\u000a      of power and resistance.

In 2007 ABC Colombia was\u000a      screened in France and\u000a      Germany on ARTE and More 4 in the UK. Since 2008, it has been broadcast on\u000a      Yle TV in Finland\u000a      in May 2008 and PBS World in July 2008 in the USA as part of the `Global\u000a      Voices' series. The film\u000a      has also been available online via amazon.com, Hulu, iTunes, and YouTube,\u000a      with a total of\u000a      200,744 streams on this platform alone. Home Sweet Home was\u000a      broadcast in France and\u000a      Germany on ARTE TV on the 18th and 31st October 2012\u000a      respectively, and is also available in\u000a      these countries as video on demand.\u000a    Significance:\u000a    In addition to high-profile broadcasts and online streaming, which has\u000a      broadened public awareness\u000a      of these issues, Colusso has screened ABC Colombia and Home\u000a        Sweet Home to community\u000a      audiences and to policy makers to influence change. This direct engagement\u000a      with the communities\u000a      affected and those who govern them has had a significant impact on both as\u000a      evidenced in the\u000a      following examples.\u000a    Shaping public discourses and enhancing understanding of issues\u000a        surrounding disenfranchised\u000a        and marginalized communities:\u000a    Organisations such as Children of the Andes and Justice for Colombia have\u000a      benefited from public\u000a      screenings of ABC Colombia which have increased awareness of the\u000a      situation for children in\u000a      Colombia, as well as by fundraising generated by the screenings of the\u000a      film (for example, 16\u000a      November 2008 Latin American Film Festival). As Heidi Araque, Events\u000a      Community Fundraiser for\u000a      Children of the Andres (COTA), explains, the film helped \"reach a number\u000a      of people who were\u000a      unaware of our work to support children at risk and to re-engage existing\u000a      supporters, making them\u000a      reflect on some of the obstacles that need to be overcome if Colombia is\u000a      to be a more peaceful\u000a      and secure country.\" Similarly, Eva Tarr-Kirkhope, Director of the London\u000a      Latin American Film\u000a      festival (LAFF), states that \"COTA &amp; LAFF see ABC Colombia as\u000a      a great instrument to raise\u000a      awareness about the situation of some of the most disadvantaged\u000a      Colombians. Part of the\u000a      proceeds of the night will go to the charity Children of the Andes.\"\u000a    Selections of Colusso's work-in-progress of Home Sweet Home were\u000a      screened for a series of\u000a      events exploring urban regeneration and the processes of social\u000a      transformation in one of the most\u000a      deprived areas of central London. These included her participation in The\u000a        Elephant in Time (18th\u000a      June 2009, organized by the British Film Institute). The event brought\u000a      together architects,\u000a      documentarists, historians and local residents to explore the past,\u000a      present and future of this part of\u000a      London, allowing for a multidisciplinary and lively debate on the reality\u000a      of the regeneration and the\u000a      role of media in documenting and critically representing change. Colusso\u000a      also participated in the\u000a      Open City\/Design for London City Visions Exhibition (May 2010) which\u000a      showcased her film-in-progress as part of the exhibition's closing event.\u000a    Since the film was completed in June 2012 it has been presented to\u000a      various audiences in London:\u000a      from the wider community at Open City Docs Film Festival to the local\u000a      community (Tate Film Club,\u000a      and Pembroke House screening organised by UrbanLab Films UCL and Open City\u000a      Docs), to more\u000a      specialized groups such as urbanists, architects and policy makers,\u000a      facilitating open debate and\u000a      discussion of the issues of urban regeneration. Audience feedback from Home\u000a        Sweet Home\u000a      screenings within local communities demonstrate that the film changed\u000a      perception and raised\u000a      awareness of the complexity of the issues affecting residents, as\u000a      illustrated by the following\u000a      examples:\u000a    \"I've realized there are many conflicting views coming from different\u000a        realities\"\u000a        \"I am more conscious than ever to hear about how the people removed are\u000a        coping in their\u000a        new homes. I am more keen than ever to see the situation resolved\"\u000a    Influencing and empowering local community action:\u000a    The various constituencies who are the subject of - and participants in - these films are the ultimate\u000a      beneficiaries of this practice-as-research, as the work enhances public\u000a      and political awareness,\u000a      which is forging new paths to social change.\u000a    For instance, after the filming of ABC Colombia a 17 year old\u000a      participant decided (with the\u000a      filmmaker's support) that he would not join the paramilitary after all. He\u000a      is now living in Bogota,\u000a      happily married and working. Similarly a local residents' participant and\u000a      social activist can attest to\u000a      Home Sweet Home's impact on local councils and decision makers, as\u000a      well as its value as a\u000a      `truthful' and detailed record of the process and a work which challenges\u000a      the clich&#233;s about people\u000a      living in council estates, and its impact on both individuals and the\u000a      community (source four).\u000a    As some of the viewers of both films have also stressed, one of the\u000a      strengths of Colusso's work is\u000a      the powerful voice they give to people who would otherwise not be heard.\u000a      This has a significant\u000a      impact on the people filmed, by fostering their sense of worth and\u000a      self-awareness, and on the\u000a      different constituencies and institutions responsible for addressing the\u000a      root causes of the violence,\u000a      as it provides invaluable access to the reality on the ground.\u000a    An indicator of the significance of this impact is evident from\u000a      personal testimony by Oscar Teran, in\u000a      a personal email to Colusso after watching ABC Colombia on 31\u000a      December 2010: \"Not only have\u000a        you created a beautiful film but you have given a powerful voice to your\u000a        subjects.\"\u000a    Informing &amp; influencing policy:\u000a    ABC Colombia was selected to be screened to members of the USA\u000a      Congress examining\u000a      Colombian paramilitary communities to inform votes on an aid bill (Hewlett\u000a      Foundation Report\u000a      2008).

The process is both a\u000a      way of relating to and a\u000a      negotiating with those involved: the maker, the people filmed and the\u000a      audience. This is practice-as-\u000a      research conceived as a cognitive and relational process, a way of\u000a      creating models of subjectivity\u000a      and fostering film's transformational power and social impact with an\u000a      end-goal that extends beyond\u000a      the finished artefact. Colusso's documentary practice puts at its centre\u000a      the process of engaging\u000a      and interacting with actuality, of mediating it through shooting, editing\u000a      and screening.\u000a    ABC Colombia (2007) follows children in a one-classroom elementary\u000a      school. It is an intimate\u000a      portrait of a small rural community in an area entirely controlled by\u000a      paramilitary forces, rendered\u000a      through the eyes of the children who grow up there, and who are often\u000a      forced into very difficult\u000a      choices between picking coca leaves or joining the paramilitaries. The\u000a      film follows the personal\u000a      growth of the young protagonists in this problematic environment through\u000a      an entire school year,\u000a      exploring some of the realities that nurture and perpetuate the violence\u000a      in Colombia from the cross\u000a      perspectives of the children and the author. The film is narrated as a\u000a      personal journey of discovery\u000a      and inquiry by the author who, together with her Colombian husband, is\u000a      building a home there. The\u000a      parallel processes of filming and building entwine, functioning as a way\u000a      of coming to terms with this\u000a      complex reality that is at the same time a part of the author's existence\u000a      and utterly \"other\".\u000a    Colusso's latest project Home Sweet Home (2012), explores a\u000a      different community, among the\u000a      most ethnically diverse and deprived areas in central London, The Elephant\u000a      and Castle. Fifty-four\u000a      months in the making (from conception to completion), Home Sweet Home\u000a      interrogates the social,\u000a      political, economic and aesthetic vision that informs a radical urban\u000a      regeneration scheme. The\u000a      documentary follows the people affected as well as the decision-makers\u000a      behind the scenes of the\u000a      massive regeneration scheme set to completely transform the borough. The\u000a      film offers a complex,\u000a      intimate narrative of urban and social change where conflicting visions\u000a      and interests are at stake.\u000a    Drawing on the extensive video archives (over 200 hours) created for Home\u000a        Sweet Home, with\u000a      other relevant data and archives, including content from the National\u000a      Archives and the local\u000a      Cuming Museum's catalogue, Ghost Town is in interactive\u000a      documentary that provides an\u000a      opportunity for users to critically engage with its traces, to develop\u000a      into active citizens capable of\u000a      connecting, understanding and engaging with the complex modern urban space\u000a      we inhabit, and\u000a      ultimately empowering them to promote change and play an active role in\u000a      society.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"20542","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1327865","Name":"Myanmar"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"1694008","Name":"Philippines"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"1643084","Name":"Indonesia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"174982","Name":"Armenia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This project sets out through a process of making and reflecting on\u000d\u000a      images to deepen our understanding of rights violations and to increase\u000d\u000a      our collective resources to promote and protect fundamental rights. The\u000d\u000a      release of The Act of Killing (2012) internationally and its\u000d\u000a      clandestine circulation in Indonesia has led to an intense and\u000d\u000a      unprecedented debate on the 1965-66 genocide, after 40 years of disavowal\u000d\u000a      and impunity for perpetrators.\u000d\u000a    Reach:\u000d\u000a    The film's high-profile screenings at festivals around the world, as well\u000d\u000a      as theatrical distribution in the UK and the US, attest to the reach of\u000d\u000a      this impact. The film has been screened at over 90 films festivals in 2012\u000d\u000a      and 2013. It is being distributed in over 12 countries and has been\u000d\u000a      screened in 88 cities (112 cinemas) across the US. The film was featured\u000d\u000a      on The Daily Show in the US (13\/8\/2013) and BBC's Newsnight\u000d\u000a      (25\/6\/2013). Furthermore, as part of an anonymously funded outreach\u000d\u000a      programme, 1,096 DVDs were distributed through the film's production\u000d\u000a      company to 118 cities in 29 of the 33 provinces in Indonesia. This form of\u000d\u000a      unofficial distribution enabled the film's dissemination to the widest\u000d\u000a      possible national audience in Indonesia, without necessitating an official\u000d\u000a      release which would have resulted in the film being banned. The reach of\u000d\u000a      this impact is indicated by over 500 clandestine screenings in over 95\u000d\u000a      cities across the country. Such community screenings varied in size from\u000d\u000a      30-700 people. The screenings have created a space in which the public\u000d\u000a      discourse on the genocide has been transformed, leading to demands for a\u000d\u000a      historical re-examination of the killings of 1965-66 that would have been\u000d\u000a      inconceivable before the film's release. The success of this distribution\u000d\u000a      plan has lead to the production company, along with Drafthouse Films,\u000d\u000a      Vice, and VHX, to develop a plan to make the film available for free in\u000d\u000a      Indonesia via download in Autumn 2013.\u000d\u000a    Significance\u000d\u000a    It has had a significant impact in the following areas:\u000d\u000a    Reframing critical understandings of the documentary genre:\u000d\u000a    One of the reasons for the film's profound impact is its innovative and\u000d\u000a      disturbing form, influencing creative documentary practice and criticism\u000d\u000a      by opening up critical expectations and understandings of the documentary\u000d\u000a      to a new structural form and format of political intervention. Renowned\u000d\u000a      filmmaker, Errol Morris, wrote of The Act of Killing, `Every now\u000d\u000a      and then a non-fiction film comes along that is unlike anything else I\u000d\u000a      have seen. [...] And it asks the central question: what is real? Gabriel\u000d\u000a      Garcia Marquez, in a Paris Review interview, wrote about reading Kafka's\u000d\u000a      \"Metamorphosis\" for the first time, \"I didn't know you were allowed to do\u000d\u000a      that.\" I have the same feeling with this extraordinary film.' Werner\u000d\u000a      Herzog claims simply, \"The Act of Killing invents a new form of\u000d\u000a      cinematic surrealism.\" Both Morris and Herzog were so impressed by the\u000d\u000a      film in its editing stage that they joined the production as Executive\u000d\u000a      Producers in order to help facilitate the film's theatrical distribution.\u000d\u000a    The significance of the impact is evident in the global critical\u000d\u000a      reception of the film. Major articles have featured in the New York\u000d\u000a        Times, Washington Post, Der Spiegel and the Guardian,\u000d\u000a      each praising the film for its experimental form, in particular the use of\u000d\u000a      re-enactment that not only allows for a glimpse into the minds of the\u000d\u000a      killers but forces them to confront the horror of their actions. As Mark\u000d\u000a      Kermode explains, the event becomes `real only when unreal' (The\u000d\u000a        Observer 29 June 2013). In an indicative response to the film, Ann\u000d\u000a      Hornaday writes in the Washington Post (25 July 2013), `This\u000d\u000a      audacious, horrifying, boldly experimental plunge into the mind-set of\u000d\u000a      murderers and the culture of impunity breaks so many rules of documentary\u000d\u000a      decorum that it virtually creates its own genre [...] The Act of\u000d\u000a        Killing is a brilliant, powerful reckoning with the wages of\u000d\u000a      history, mendacity and denial.' Furthermore, the film has repeatedly won\u000d\u000a      awards at internationally recognized documentary film festivals including\u000d\u000a      CPH: Dox 2012, Best Feature Documentary at the Danish Film Academy 2013,\u000d\u000a      First Prize of the Jury and Audience Award at the DocumentaMadrid 2013,\u000d\u000a      and the Grand Prize and Audience Award at the Sheffield Doc\/Fest 2013.\u000d\u000a    Enhancing public understanding and provoking unprecedented public\u000d\u000a        discourse on genocide:\u000d\u000a    Writing for Tempo &#8212; Indonesia's premier news magazine &#8212; Ariel\u000d\u000a      Heryanto, historian and cultural critic, claims, `The Act of Killing is\u000d\u000a      the most powerful, politically important film about Indonesia that I have\u000d\u000a      ever seen. The arrival of this film is itself a historical event almost\u000d\u000a      without parallel.' Following screenings for Indonesian press at the\u000d\u000a      National Commission on Human Rights, the editors of Tempo decided\u000d\u000a      to publish a double edition [7 October 2012] devoted to the film and the\u000d\u000a      events it engages with. Their aim was to repeat the experiment of the film\u000d\u000a      by sending their own journalists [47 journalists, 4 project managers, 12\u000d\u000a      editors, 3 researchers, 2 photo researchers, and 3 translators] around the\u000d\u000a      country in an attempt to identify and interview perpetrators of the\u000d\u000a      genocide, further unlocking this history of violence. They gathered over\u000d\u000a      1000 pages of testimony, edited down to 75 pages published alongside\u000d\u000a      reviews, interviews and essays about the film. The aim of the issue is\u000d\u000a      clearly explained in the opening editorial which states: `Readers, no\u000d\u000a      matter how tragic and painful, the mass murders of 1965-66 must, at one\u000d\u000a      time or the other, be re-examined. Remembering, in the long run, is better\u000d\u000a      than forgetting'.\u000d\u000a    In the space of this unprecedented debate and historical re-examination,\u000d\u000a      the National Human Rights Commission of Indonesia released the following\u000d\u000a      statement: `If we are to transform Indonesia into the democracy it claims\u000d\u000a      to be, citizens must recognize the terror and repression on which our\u000d\u000a      contemporary history has been built. No film, or any other work of art for\u000d\u000a      that matter, has done this more effectively than The Act of Killing. [It]\u000d\u000a      is essential viewing for us all.' Indicative of the significance\u000d\u000a      of this research to the process of historical re-examination now underway\u000d\u000a      in Indonesia is the fact that the findings of the North Sumatran section\u000d\u000a      of the National Commission on Human Rights' 12 July report on the\u000d\u000a      massacres are drawn from a review of the production company's archive and\u000d\u000a      transcripts of The Act of Killing. According to the Margareth S.\u000d\u000a      Aritonang of The Jakarta Post, this report resulted in the\u000d\u000a      Commission declaring that `the state sponsored purge that followed the\u000d\u000a      1965 aborted coup met all the criteria of a gross violation of human\u000d\u000a      rights' (24 July 2012).\u000d\u000a    Screenings of the film at International Human Rights Film Festivals,\u000d\u000a      including Prague, Geneva, Romania, and Myanmar have positioned the\u000d\u000a      Indonesian genocide within global discussions about human rights\u000d\u000a      violations. International screenings of the film have also been used to\u000d\u000a      initiate discussion and debate about similar, often hidden, histories of\u000d\u000a      political violence, corruption, impunity and genocide in countries such as\u000d\u000a      Spain, the Philippines, Turkey and Denmark. Organisers for the !F Istanbul\u000d\u000a      Independent International Film Festival toured the film through Turkish\u000d\u000a      Kurdistan, Armenia, Jenin, Ramallah and the West Bank, provoking debate\u000d\u000a      among Turkish audiences about the genocide in Armenia. In the Philippines\u000d\u000a      screenings of the film have been used to spark debate about the country's\u000d\u000a      own history of political corruption. Tapol the Indonesian human rights\u000d\u000a      NGO, co-sponsored a 10-day tour of the film and director around the UK,\u000d\u000a      launching a petition demanding an apology for the atrocities. The petition\u000d\u000a      has been taken up by human rights NGOs in the US in conjunction with the\u000d\u000a      film's American release.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Michael Uwemedimo's research on re-enactment in non-fiction filmmaking\u000d\u000a      has contributed to the development of innovative methods and approaches to\u000d\u000a      documentary practice as a means of precipitating critical national and\u000d\u000a      international reflections on histories of political violence.

The work has focused on the\u000d\u000a      role of re-enactment in critical explorations of image, memory and\u000d\u000a      historical representation in relation to human rights violations, in\u000d\u000a      particular the 1965-66 Indonesian genocide.\u000d\u000a    In part practice-based, research has taken the form of book chapters and\u000d\u000a      journal articles [including: 2005; 2007; 2012], conference presentations\u000d\u000a      [including: Experimental Repetitions, Contemporary Arts Centre,\u000d\u000a      Utrecht, 2008] and master classes [including: CPH:DOX New Trends Master\u000d\u000a      class, 2007]. Critically it has also taken the form of film production and\u000d\u000a      film exhibition. A pilot production in Indonesia, Show of Force,\u000d\u000a      [screened at the Centre for Contemporary Art, Sheffield, 2007 and analysed\u000d\u000a      in depth in Oppenheimer and Uwemedimo 2012] was key to the development of\u000d\u000a      The Act of Killing. Cinema programmes and exhibitions have been\u000d\u000a      staged in a wide range of venues from BFI Southbank, London [After the\u000d\u000a      Fact: Re-enactment and the moving image 2007] to the New School for Social\u000d\u000a      Research, New York [`Inhabiting Fictions' Cenethnography 2007].\u000d\u000a    As a founding member of the production collaboration, Vision Machine, and\u000d\u000a      producer of The Act of Killing, Uwemedimo's research findings and\u000d\u000a      their creative applications fed into an evolving filmmaking practice\u000d\u000a      developed by the collective and culminated in The Act of Killing.\u000d\u000a      As producer, he took a central role in translating his research findings\u000d\u000a      into a conceptual framework that informed the production and was involved\u000d\u000a      with planning shoots, reviewing and feeding back on footage, working on\u000d\u000a      and responding to edits, as well as engaging in the sustained debates\u000d\u000a      around documentary ethics that affected the film's production. In\u000d\u000a      particular his work contributed to the development of a performance-based\u000d\u000a      historiography of political violence that draws extensively on historical\u000d\u000a      re-enactment and genre re-stagings, which he terms `archaeological\u000d\u000a      performance'. This method progresses from primary interviews with\u000d\u000a      historical actors (both perpetrators and survivors) to re-enactments at\u000d\u000a      historical locations, and onwards to ever more elaborate genre\u000d\u000a      dramatisations. This material is then reworked according to the\u000d\u000a      conventions of film genres as it becomes increasingly `fictionalised' and\u000d\u000a      scenes are screened to the participants. The screenings and participants'\u000d\u000a      reactions are incorporated in the film and serve as points of departure\u000d\u000a      for subsequent stylized re-enactments. The process of strategically\u000d\u000a      staging screenings and folding the responses back into the film has been a\u000d\u000a      vital element of the practice and a significant vector of impact.\u000d\u000a    What The Act of Killing does is set up the apparatus of fiction\u000d\u000a      film production, situate a documentary practice within it, and record the\u000d\u000a      stories that a group of gangsters and ageing genocidaires tell to each\u000d\u000a      other and the camera. In so doing, the film intervenes in the country's\u000d\u000a      history of genocide by reframing these historical events through the lens\u000d\u000a      of genre and memory, challenging official versions of history and inviting\u000d\u000a      contemplation and debate over the performance of political violence.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"20943","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The Loughborough Communication Research Centre research has had an impact\u000d\u000a      both on the BBC's coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the\u000d\u000a      Arab Spring and the media debate about how these conflicts are reported by\u000d\u000a      media institutions.\u000d\u000a    Review of the Coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict\u000d\u000a    Impact 1: Improving the impartiality of the BBC's coverage\u000d\u000a    Sir Quentin Thomas (then President of the British Board of Film\u000d\u000a      Classification and previously Political Director in the Northern Ireland\u000d\u000a      Office and at one time civil servant in the Home Office responsible for\u000d\u000a      broadcasting policy) was chair of a 5 member panel conducting, on behalf\u000d\u000a      of the BBC Governors, the 2006 Impartiality Review of coverage of the\u000d\u000a      Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

The expertise of the LCRC\u000d\u000a      has been extended, both methodologically and empirically, since 2000 to\u000d\u000a      include comparative analysis of international news and current affairs\u000d\u000a      generally and MENA in particular (with the appointments of Professor John\u000d\u000a      Downey (2000-present), Dr John Richardson (2012- present) and Dr James\u000d\u000a      Stanyer (2005-present) [3.2, 3.3, 3.4].\u000d\u000a    Review of Coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict 2006\u000d\u000a    In 2005 the LCRC (Professor Peter Golding (1990-2010), Professor David\u000d\u000a      Deacon (1990-present), Downey, Richardson, Dr Dominic Wring\u000d\u000a      (1997-present)) was approached by the BBC's Board of Governors to tender\u000d\u000a      for a content analysis of the BBC's coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian\u000d\u000a      conflict, by distance the most controversial aspect of the BBC's output\u000d\u000a      both domestically and internationally. The LCRC's bid was judged to be\u000d\u000a      'outstandingly the best' by the BBC Governors' selection panel (4\u000d\u000a      universities submitted a tender).\u000d\u000a    The results of the content analysis were rigorously reviewed by a panel\u000d\u000a      of 5 experts (including eminent journalists and academics such as\u000d\u000a      Professor Stewart Purvis), by the BBC Board of Governors, and by the BBC\u000d\u000a      Executive (including Malcolm Balen, Senior Editorial Advisor to the\u000d\u000a      Director of BBC News). The report is published on the BBC Trust website\u000d\u000a      and was also subject to considerable media scrutiny and debate in the UK\u000d\u000a      and internationally [3.5].\u000d\u000a    Findings\u000d\u000a    The results confounded media industry and political elite perceptions\u000d\u000a      that the BBC is generally pro- Palestinian in its accounts of events. The\u000d\u000a      major conclusions of the 25,000 word report were that while there was an\u000d\u000a      ostensible balance in the representation of Israeli and Palestinian\u000d\u000a      political elites, coverage lacked historical context, was inconsistent in\u000d\u000a      the extent of coverage, and that there was imbalance in the reporting of\u000d\u000a      fatalities and casualties.\u000d\u000a    Review of Coverage of the Arab Spring 2012\u000d\u000a    In 2011 the LCRC (Deacon, Downey, Stanyer, Wring) was approached by the\u000d\u000a      BBC Trust to tender for a content analysis of coverage of the events known\u000d\u000a      as the Arab Spring. For the first time the analysis included BBC\u000d\u000a      international broadcasts (BBC World) and an international broadcaster, Al\u000d\u000a      Jazeera English, as well as domestic competitors to the BBC.\u000d\u000a    The report was rigorously reviewed by an independent expert (Edward\u000d\u000a      Mortimer, former Director of Communication for the UN General Secretary\u000d\u000a      Kofi Annan), a consultant employed by the BBC Trust (Kam Atwal), BBC\u000d\u000a      Trust's Head of Editorial Standards (Fran O'Brien), and the BBC Executive\u000d\u000a      (most notably Malcolm Balen, Senior Editorial Advisor to Helen Boaden,\u000d\u000a      formerly Director of BBC News).\u000d\u000a    Findings\u000d\u000a    The major conclusions, presented initially orally to the BBC Trust and\u000d\u000a      subsequently in a 20,000 word written report, were: there was a\u000d\u000a      considerable change in the character of reporting over time: initial\u000d\u000a      absence of coverage followed by inattention and incredulity by experts\u000d\u000a      interviewed by the BBC giving way to reporting of the exhilaration and\u000d\u000a      euphoria of Spring 'revolutions' to be in turn surpassed by an exploration\u000d\u000a      of the ambiguity and ambivalence of events in the Autumn and beyond; there\u000d\u000a      was substantial geographical variation in coverage of North African and\u000d\u000a      Gulf State conflicts; there was a predominance of reporting of Western\u000d\u000a      political actors in contrast to Russian and Chinese elites; that\u000d\u000a      user-generated content (UGC) tended to be used without caveats; and that\u000d\u000a      there was scant provision of historical context in broadcast output with\u000d\u000a      little reference made to more extensive coverage available on the BBC\u000d\u000a      website [3.6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"20944","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research cited in Sections 2-3 underpinned impacts corroborated in\u000d\u000a      Section 5.\u000d\u000a    Impact on communication skills training methodology\u000d\u000a    CARM's reach and significance (inter)nationally is evidenced by the\u000d\u000a      delivery of 130+ CARM workshops to 60+ organizations across UK\/Ireland and\u000d\u000a      USA, totalling 1000+ individual participants who are beneficiaries. Many\u000d\u000a      events were organized in response to repeat\/unsolicited requests [5.1-5.4].\u000d\u000a    CARM has been awarded Continuing Professional Development accreditation\u000d\u000a      status by the College of Mediators [5.7]. Stokoe was invited to\u000d\u000a      join the College's Board of Directors (October 2012), to provide expert\u000d\u000a      advice and influence policy. The Ministry of Justice uses her work in its\u000d\u000a      public information about mediation [5.10]\u000d\u000a    CARM has spread into other domains of communication training and is\u000d\u000a      generating not-for-profit income as a sustainable social enterprise\u000d\u000a      (www.carmtraining.org). CARM's reach has spread into the legal, medical\u000d\u000a      and commercial sectors [5.5] and is also in high demand from UK,\u000d\u000a      US and other overseas academics, beyond the submitting HEI, to use in\u000d\u000a      their own work [5.6].\u000d\u000a    Feedback from workshop participants often focused on CARM's use of\u000d\u000a      recordings of real mediators rather than traditional `role-play'\u000d\u000a      approaches. 1000+ items of feedback demonstrate CARM's impact on\u000d\u000a      awareness, thinking and understanding in training practice [5.8]:\u000d\u000a      \"The fact that it was `real', as opposed to role-play was a relief\" (Mediator,\u000a        Glasgow Community and Safety Services); \"Having the ability to\u000d\u000a      listen to actual calls ... was very innovative ... versus a typical role\u000d\u000a      play environment\" (Family Mediator, DC Superior Court, Washington, DC,\u000d\u000a        USA).\u000d\u000a    Capacity-building in mediation services\u000d\u000a    CARM has impacted the `syllabus' of mediation training because it\u000d\u000a      includes, uniquely in the sector, training for initial telephone inquiries\u000d\u000a      which involve critical points at which prospective clients are won or\u000d\u000a      lost. As one user said, \"it is so useful to see what subtle ways there are\u000d\u000a      to ... convert callers into clients\" (ESRC Case Study respondent) [5.8].\u000d\u000a    CARM's capacity-building with community mediators has spread into family\u000d\u000a      mediation services. Many of the workshops delivered in 2013 were in\u000d\u000a      response to invitations from national, regional and local family mediation\u000d\u000a      services [5.3]. Stokoe was invited to provide expert advice in the\u000d\u000a      launch, development and service delivery of a new family mediation\u000d\u000a      organization [5.4].\u000d\u000a    Culture and attitude change in mediation training\u000d\u000a    CARM has impacted on attitudes towards traditional training and the value\u000d\u000a      of academic research. One beneficiary said of CARM: \"(the fact that it is)\u000d\u000a      grounded in reality impresses people and they see the value of it ... it\u000d\u000a      is certainly not my experience with a typical academic\" [5.8].\u000d\u000a    CARM involves genuine knowledge exchange. It mattered to stakeholders\u000d\u000a      that workshops were grounded in research (\"The nature of the workshops is\u000d\u000a      very important; they are very much evidence-based; the evidence gives it\u000d\u000a      quite an impact\"). Users saw an inherent complementarity, with one\u000d\u000a      effectively defining `Knowledge Exchange': \"a full, rounded engagement of\u000d\u000a      what we have to bring, she takes that and gives from the academic side ...\u000d\u000a      We have benefited, as part of her wider family\" [5.8].\u000d\u000a    Sustainability and connectivity in mediation training\u000d\u000a    CARM is sustainable and has long-term impact, building capacity in\u000d\u000a      mediation services where personnel change regularly resulting in a\u000d\u000a      continuous demand for training evidenced by regular invitations to run\u000d\u000a      workshops from new and existing organizations [5.1-5.4].\u000d\u000a    The project has generated enduring connections with mediators across the\u000d\u000a      country, by organizing the first national training workshop for mediators\u000d\u000a      who currently have no such forum for meeting and training (June 2012) [5.8].\u000d\u000a    The project has also generated a 600+ member international online\u000d\u000a      mediation discussion forum [5.9]. As one user said, \"[Liz] has had\u000d\u000a      a big impact on mediation in UK and Ireland already, not only through\u000d\u000a      workshops but also through putting people together and creating networks\u000d\u000a      ... she has helped to fill a vacuum\" [5.8]. Another user said,\u000d\u000a      \"Liz has worked relentlessly hard, bringing mediators, services together,\u000d\u000a      establishing links online, raising awareness of CARM ... [and has made]\u000d\u000a      seamless connections linking services and mediators together. After\u000d\u000a      Mediation UK collapsed, we were all working in silos and suddenly we are\u000d\u000a      now talking to each other in a true mediation fashion!\"\u000d\u000a    The selection of CARM as an ESRC Impact Case Study\u000d\u000a    CARM was selected as a case study in an ESRC \"Research Impact on\u000d\u000a      Practice\" impact evaluation [5.8]. The report describes CARM's\u000d\u000a      impact and summarizes extensive user feedback.\u000d\u000a    Awards and external visibility\u000d\u000a    CARM won the Loughborough University Social Impact Enterprise Award\u000d\u000a      (April 2013). Stokoe was awarded a British Psychological Society\u000d\u000a      award (September 2011) for her applied work. Stokoe's CARM was the focus\u000d\u000a      of BBC Radio 4's `The Life Scientific' (June 2013).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The impact claimed is the international uptake and successful\u000d\u000a      commercialization (as www.carmtraining.org) across public, private and\u000d\u000a      third-sector organizations, of a pioneering method for communication\u000d\u000a      skills training called the `Conversation Analytic Role-play Method'\u000d\u000a      (CARM).

The project is an ESRC Impact\u000d\u000a      case study (Research Impact on Practice: Case Study Analysis). It\u000d\u000a      took findings from the above research to develop CARM: a radically\u000d\u000a      different approach to communication training. CARM works by identifying,\u000d\u000a      transcribing and anonymizing extracts from live recordings that\u000d\u000a      demonstrate the different ways mediators, or police, communicate.\u000d\u000a      Animation software is used to play the audio\/video and transcript\u000d\u000a      synchronously. This means that participants `live through' encounters `in\u000d\u000a      the moment', without knowing what is coming next. They `role-play' what\u000d\u000a      they might do to handle the situation. For example, if party A makes a\u000d\u000a      particular sort of comment, how might party B respond most appropriately?\u000d\u000a      Participants discuss their likely response in small groups. Finally, party\u000d\u000a      B's actual response is revealed. Participants evaluate what party B did,\u000d\u000a      and the workshop moves on.

The further potential reach of the research impact is extensive &#8212;\u000a      in addition to the\u000a      helplines the researchers have worked with directly, the 450 or so\u000a      helplines accredited by the\u000a      researchers' association with Helpline Partnership, each receive training\u000a      that will in future be\u000a      informed by the research, and collectively they receive 29 million calls\u000a      per year.\u000a    The impact of the work has been achieved through (a) engagement, (b)\u000a      research-based training,\u000a      and (c) consultancy and evaluation. These activities have changed\u000a      awareness, improved call-takers'\u000a      skills, and led to improvements in helpline policies and practices [5.1-5.7].\u000a    (a) Engagement has resulted in increased awareness and understanding\u000a    By sharing the research findings (as described in section 2) with\u000a      helplines the researchers have\u000a      increased awareness of the interactional patterns and practices of\u000a      helpline calls. Helpline\u000a      managers and call-takers have greater understanding about handling strong\u000a      emotions [3.4, 5.1,\u000a        5.2, 5.3], how advice can be given in non-directive ways [3.2,\u000a        3.3] [5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4], and how\u000a      ethically sensitive issues can be managed [5.4, 5.5].\u000a    In 2009, research on using questions in advice delivery [3.2]\u000a      were shared with Kids Helpline staff.\u000a      The presentation and discussion enhanced attendees' understanding about\u000a      how the organisation's\u000a      policy of non-directive advice was handled through questioning techniques\u000a      [5.8].\u000a    In June 2010, LUHRU's research was discussed at a Knowledge Exchange\u000a        Workshop on\u000a        Telephone Helplines at Edinburgh University. This led to the\u000a      delivery of a workshop for Parenting\u000a        Across Scotland (PAS - a partnership of organisations supporting\u000a      families, including Parentline\u000a      Scotland, Lone Parent Helpline, and Stepfamily Scotland) in May 2012 [5.2].\u000a      Participating call-takers\u000a      and helpline managers reported that the workshop increased their\u000a      understanding about\u000a      ways of handling strong emotion [3.4] and advice-giving [3.2,\u000a        3.3] [5.3, 5.4].\u000a    Between 2002 and 2004, Hepburn worked intensively with the Duty Manager\u000a      at NSPCC to discuss\u000a      the research findings, offering support and advice to individual\u000a      practitioners and reporting findings\u000a      to team meetings. Participants said that these activities had raised\u000a      awareness of call openings and\u000a      dealing with upset callers [5.1, 5.2].\u000a    A bespoke workshop delivered in November 2012 raised NSPCC call-takers'\u000a      awareness of how\u000a      callers display emotion, and how to handle advice resistance [5.1].\u000a      During 2012 and 2013,\u000a      individual meetings with call-takers from Compassion in Dying have\u000a      resulted in increased\u000a      understanding of advice giving [3.2, 3.3] in relation to complex\u000a      medical and legal issues. A formal\u000a      evaluation of the service has also increased awareness and understanding\u000a      of how call-takers can\u000a      best support callers [5.4, 5.5]\u000a    \u000a    \u000a    (b) Research-based training and guidance has enhanced the continuing\u000a        professional\u000a        development of helpline practitioners\u000a    Workshop participants listen to calls the researchers have analysed and\u000a      are taught how to\u000a      consider the consequences of different ways of handling various\u000a      interactional issues [5.1, 5.2, 5.3,\u000a        5.4, 5.5]. They have reported that as well as increasing awareness\u000a      of issues around emotion and\u000a      advice-giving, the workshops led to changes in their techniques [5.1,\u000a        5.2, 5.3, 5.4]. For instance,\u000a      participants at the Parenting Across Scotland workshop said that the\u000a      workshop improved their\u000a      practices by `Helping me consider my responses', `Thinking about how to\u000a      deal with calls more\u000a      effectively and efficiently' and `Considering how to conduct calls more\u000a      proactively'.\u000a    The significance of LUHRU for continuing professional development has\u000a      been recognised by the\u000a      national accrediting body for helplines &#8212; the Helplines Partnership\u000a      (formerly the Telephone\u000a      Helplines Association) who have entered into partnership with LUHRU [5.6,\u000a        5.7].\u000a    (c) Consultancy and expert advice has led to changes in helpline\u000a        policies and practices\u000a    The effectiveness of LUHRU's research and training has led to the group\u000a      being invited to offer\u000a      consultancy and expert advice, and to evaluate helpline services [5.1,\u000a        5.4]. Outcomes of these\u000a        activities include improved service documents and standardisation of\u000a        call-taking strategies.\u000a    In July 2012, NSPCC asked Hepburn and Potter to examine a `failed call'\u000a      which resulted in suicide.\u000a      The report was used to support quality control and feed into managerial\u000a      decisions about how to\u000a      handle similar calls in the future [5.1].\u000a    In 2012, Wilkinson was asked to evaluate Compassion in Dying's\u000a      End-of-Life Rights Information\u000a      Line. A report, based on analysis of 200+ calls, advised how the service\u000a      could improve.\u000a      Recommendations led to changes in service policy and practice, including\u000a      improvements to\u000a      documents used by call-takers, changes in the way call-takers discuss\u000a      issues with legal\u000a      implications, and improved call monitoring [5.4] The report also\u000a        provided an evidence base\u000a        which the charity has drawn on in its outreach and policy-making\u000a        activities [5.5].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Members of Loughborough University's Helpline Research Unit (LUHRU) have\u000a      been researching,\u000a      evaluating and advising on helpline services since 2000.

We have\u000a      identified when and how advice\u000a      causes problems, and the ways in which call-takers manage these\u000a      difficulties [3.2, 3.3]. For\u000a      example, callers to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to\u000a      Children's (NSPCC)\u000a      helpline sometimes resist appropriate advice.

The research found their call-takers use\u000a      questions that invite callers to\u000a      come up with their own solutions to problems, empowering callers to use\u000a      their own resources and\u000a      agency [3.2].\u000a    b) Research that identifies practices for managing emotion\u000a    Hepburn's [3.4] pioneering research on crying in calls to the\u000a      NSPCC developed new methods for\u000a      the study of emotion in helpline calls, and in social interaction more\u000a      generally. Detailed\u000a      transcription of crying identified call-takers' sensitivity to different\u000a      types of crying, and how they\u000a      shaped their responses accordingly. The research shows that emotions are\u000a      not simply a cause or\u000a      product of helpline interactions, but play an active part in the on-going\u000a      management of the call and\u000a      the relationship between caller and call-taker. These findings facilitated\u000a      further research on\u000a      empathy and emotional reciprocity, and have been developed through\u000a      research on displays of\u000a      anger and laughter.\u000a    c) Research that examines helpline policies and practices\u000a    LUHRU has carried out research on how call-takers manage helpline\u000a      policies, and core helpline\u000a      practices like handling the opening of a call. [3.5] They have\u000a      found that helpline policies can cause\u000a      interactional problems between callers and call-takers, and identified how\u000a      call-takers manage\u000a      these problems [3.2, 3.6]. For example, Wilkinson [3.6]\u000a      examined the practices by which call-\u000a      takers on a health-related charity collect information about caller\u000a      ethnicity and identified specific\u000a      problems with the organisation's ethnic monitoring process. This led to\u000a      concrete recommendations\u000a      to improve the accuracy of the organisation's monitoring and the\u000a      call-takers' practices for collecting\u000a      this information.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"20948","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    General Election coverage research.\u000d\u000a    Research carried out on UK election coverage by the Loughborough\u000d\u000a      University team had its impact through raising awareness (among working\u000d\u000a      journalists, politicians, pollsters and commentators) of (a) the extent to\u000d\u000a      which women politicians had been marginalised in news reports, and (b) the\u000d\u000a      extent to which there was a systematic absence of coverage of substantial\u000d\u000a      policy issues in health, economy and education.\u000d\u000a    Awareness.\u000d\u000a    The 2010 election research stimulated considerable, and immediate,\u000d\u000a      interest among the stakeholders listed above.

The newspaper commissioned further studies\u000d\u000a      during the three subsequent campaigns. The last of these, in 2005, was the\u000d\u000a      most expansive ever because sponsorship (following competitive tender) by\u000d\u000a      the UK Electoral Commission enabled inclusion of Scottish, Welsh and\u000d\u000a      regional English campaign reporting for the first time. The General\u000d\u000a      Election work promoted Loughborough University as a leading source of\u000d\u000a      expertise for decision makers and opinion-formers seeking quality media\u000d\u000a      information audits. This recognition led to the team being invited to\u000d\u000a      tender &#8212; successfully &#8212; for contracts from the BBC and the Electoral\u000d\u000a      Commission.

This display was then successively and\u000d\u000a      independently commissioned by regional governmental bodies in Caen, France\u000d\u000a      (2006), Maizuru, Japan (2008), and Duisburg, Germany (2010) &#8212; the latter\u000d\u000a      as part of the European Capitals of Culture programme of the Ruhr. On each\u000d\u000a      occasion the display was tailored to meet the particular cultural and\u000d\u000a      linguistic character of the nations involved. In total to date this\u000d\u000a      exhibition has been visited by well over 100,000 visitors in the UK and\u000d\u000a      overseas, and been reviewed in the national media of each of these\u000d\u000a      countries.\u000d\u000a    McCaw's second exhibition, A Study in Sherlock, has been\u000d\u000a      in situ in Portsmouth's City Museum from 2008 to the present, and been\u000d\u000a      updated on a regular basis as new Collection finds have been uncovered.\u000d\u000a      This award-winning exhibition has an interactive aspect designed to engage\u000d\u000a      with a wide range of visitors and audiences (users), exemplified by the\u000d\u000a      exhibition's narration by Stephen Fry (the Collection's patron).\u000d\u000a      Supporting materials written by McCaw include text\/display panels, the\u000d\u000a      audio narration which he recorded with Fry, a new Sherlock Holmes\u000d\u000a      educational script performed by local amateur actors and produced as a\u000d\u000a      film specifically for the exhibition, as well as an accompanying book: A\u000d\u000a        Study in Sherlock: Uncovering the Arthur Conan Doyle Collection. A Study\u000d\u000a        in Sherlock is a monument to the life of the collector of the\u000d\u000a      archival material featured in it, as well as to Conan Doyle's life in the\u000d\u000a      city of Portsmouth, Hampshire's literary heritage, and the phenomenon of\u000d\u000a      Sherlock Holmes in the UK and abroad. It has raised the profile of each of\u000d\u000a      these features on both the national and international stage and has been\u000d\u000a      visited by more than 250,000 visitors to date.\u000d\u000a    McCaw has acted as spokesperson for the Conan Doyle Collection overseas,\u000d\u000a      and been an invited public speaker in each of the countries the\u000d\u000a      exhibitions have visited, as well as at the University of Minnesota\u000d\u000a      (2010), where he participated in meetings with the curators of all the\u000d\u000a      other major world Conan Doyle\/Sherlock Holmes collections (Minnesota,\u000d\u000a      Chicago, and Toronto), to discuss how these cultural resources (alongisde\u000d\u000a      the Portsmouth Collection) could be integrated and made more accessible to\u000d\u000a      researchers (of all levels) globally.\u000d\u000a    The reach of McCaw's research impact is evidenced by visitor attendance\u000d\u000a      figures to his exhibitions. The Case of the Portsmouth Doctor: c.\u000d\u000a      856 visitors at the Hotel de Ville, Caen (France, 2008); c. 12,636,\u000d\u000a      Maizuru Museum (Japan, 2008); c. 1,503, Meridian Centre (Havant UK, 2009);\u000d\u000a      c. 96,542 Duisberg Central Library (Germany, 2010).

A Study in Sherlock was awarded a media prize for `Best\u000d\u000a      Exhibition' in 2009, a category voted for by the public, and was reviewed\u000d\u000a      in numerous media, notably The Independent (2008) and the Mail\u000d\u000a        Online (2009). McCaw's exhibitions also created a surge of interest\u000d\u000a      from television broadcasters. He was featured in The History Channel\/STV\u000d\u000a      TV documentary 'In Search of Sherlock' (2010) in which he discussed\u000d\u000a      aspects of the Sherlock Holmes phenomenon (reviewed in Pop Matters\u000d\u000a      in 2010), as well as in news items on BBC TV and ITV on four occasions,\u000d\u000a      and also in an episode of 'Flog It!', a popular TV programme syndicated\u000d\u000a      around the world and watched by millions of viewers, in which he was the\u000d\u000a      resident expert on Sherlock Holmes and Conan Doyle.\u000d\u000a    The significance of the research impact is also evident in a programme of\u000d\u000a      educational events and projects for schools in the southern region\u000d\u000a      (UK) linked to McCaw's work on Conan Doyle. He has delivered interactive\u000d\u000a      talks to children ranging from 5-16, and been part of an EU-funded Interreg\u000d\u000a      project wherein The Case of the Portsmouth Doctor exhibition\u000d\u000a      formed a central part of an exchange visit between pupils from the UK and\u000d\u000a      France within which they took part in detective-themed literacy and\u000d\u000a      numeracy tasks in both their own country and that of their `foreign'\u000d\u000a      partner school.\u000d\u000a    McCaw's research is also central to his close working with the Cultural\u000a        Services department of Portsmouth City Council in relation to the\u000d\u000a      strategic policy development of the Conan Doyle Collection, as well as\u000d\u000a      related cultural and educational policy developments in the region. This\u000d\u000a      has had manifest outcomes in terms of affecting the direction of local\u000d\u000a      cultural strategy and provision, as well as contributing to an influx of\u000d\u000a      visitors to the area (and Portsmouth specifically) from countries with a\u000d\u000a      major interest in Sherlock Holmes as far afield as the US, Japan,\u000d\u000a      Australia, numerous countries within Europe and, more recently, Israel.\u000d\u000a      This has had an unarguably positive impact on the local economy and\u000d\u000a      tourist industry.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Dr Neil McCaw's research has had a cultural, educational, and policy\u000d\u000a      impact on individuals, groups of individuals, and organisations in the UK\u000d\u000a      and countries overseas.

The collection is\u000d\u000a      the previously un-accessed life's work of Richard Lancelyn Green (who died\u000d\u000a      in 2004), the leading world authority on Conan Doyle and Sherlock Holmes.\u000d\u000a    This research initially involved assisting with the organisation and\u000d\u000a      cataloguing in excess of 60,000 unlisted, unarranged items in a way that\u000d\u000a      accessibly told the story of the material's collector, the life of Conan\u000d\u000a      Doyle, and the development of the popular fascination with detective and\u000d\u000a      crime fiction in the different countries of the world since the nineteenth\u000d\u000a      century. The new knowledge and awareness drawn from this emerging archive\u000d\u000a      (no academic scholar had previously seen any of the material) then became\u000d\u000a      a key part of the development of a series of linked research outputs\u000d\u000a      authored by McCaw.

However, it was people in higher\u000a      ACORN groups who had the highest attendance rates. One way of engaging\u000a      more diverse groups with museums and galleries is to bring the arts into\u000a      people's everyday lives, public spaces, local communities, and find new\u000a      ways to develop a greater sense of public ownership of the arts; to make\u000a      the arts more relevant to their lives. This case study is based on\u000a      research which was funded as part of the pilot for the Digital R &amp; D\u000a      fund for arts and culture.

The intention was to make\u000a      collections more relevant, accessible and democratic, helping more diverse\u000a      groups feel more engaged and offering a greater sense of ownership,\u000a      connection and participation.\u000a    The research was undertaken at both IWM London and IWM North, before and\u000a      after the installation of the SI technology. Bagnall et al employed a\u000a      range of research methods, including interviews, focus groups, a visitor\u000a      survey, in gallery observation, and textual and interface analysis.\u000a      Quantitative and qualitative data was collected and analysed at both\u000a      sites. Using a mixed method approach enabled visitors' stated views and\u000a      preferences to be captured, but also allowed the opportunity to observe\u000a      and gain insight into actual audience behaviour.\u000a    There were a total of 20,130 visitor contributions to or social\u000a      interactions with the chosen objects. Of these 12313 were in IWM London\u000a      (April-November 2012) and 7817 in IWM North (July-November). A further 373\u000a      comments were made on the website, supporting the IWM in developing a new\u000a      system to enable the interpretation, discussion, collection and sharing of\u000a      cultural experiences with, and between, museum visitors.\u000a    Analysis indicated that the technology was encouraging users to feel\u000a      more connected with the museum motivated by a desire to share one's\u000a      personal experiences or knowledge with other visitors. Social\u000a      interpretation formed a significant proportion of this interaction (43 per\u000a      cent), complementing rather than replacing the other types of social\u000a      interaction taking place around the exhibits. The SI kiosks facilitated\u000a      sharing and interpretation, and augmented museum experiences, for many of\u000a      those who used them.\u000a    Working with technology, cultural and artistic organisations was\u000a      beneficial as it enabled the testing and application of ideas and\u000a      theories, as well as providing new inspiration and direction for further\u000a      research and collaborations. Through such collaborations, research\u000a      propositions and models were tested in real world, `living lab',\u000a      scenarios, which have enabled the development of new ideas; built on real\u000a      world practice and needs, in the form of `grounded theory'. In particular,\u000a      limitations of many previous studies are their specific focus either on,\u000a      audiences or technology; rarely linking or understanding both. This\u000a      project facilitated a multidisciplinary approach, which understands\u000a      technology, technological and cultural providers, and users in a way that\u000a      was beneficial to industry.\u000a    Insights from the research both in terms of findings, and in relation to\u000a      the practices and process of this innovative collaborative research\u000a      project fed into, shaped, and led to the scaled up fund of &#163;7million which\u000a      Nesta, the Arts Council England, and the Arts and Humanities Research\u000a      Council have made available for projects from 2012-2014\/5.

They\u000a        allow visitors to connect to personal and cultural memories and\u000a        biographies, and to practise and perform forms of reminiscence. The\u000a        appeal of certain objects is the emotional impact they evoke and the\u000a        feelings they mobilise.\u000a      The aim of the project was to apply social media models, to provide\u000a        new frameworks for audience engagement and social interpretation, making\u000a        social objects out of museum objects. The aspiration was to create a\u000a        service that encouraged people to respond to IWM's themes and\u000a        collections through several forms of digital interaction and\u000a        participation, both in the gallery and via mobile and online platforms.\u000a      To enable this digital interaction and participation IWM and its\u000a        technical partners developed and installed `comment and information'\u000a        kiosks, placed QR codes next to exhibits and artworks, developed a\u000a        bespoke mobile application called `IWM Scan and Share' and added social\u000a        interpretation elements to its website. This allowed social\u000a        interpretation on and across all of the IWM digital platforms and\u000a        outputs, and facilitated and supported the type of social interaction\u000a        usually associated with social media, including the ability to like,\u000a        comment, discuss, collect, and share things.\u000a      The research team aimed to explore how new technologies can be used to\u000a        broaden, deepen and diversify audience reach, and whether social\u000a        moderation is an effective response to the challenges posed by\u000a        representing public comment and discussions in physical and digital\u000a        cultural spaces, identifying three broad areas of research inquiry:\u000a      \u000a        How and if social media models enable social interpretation and\u000a          encourage audience\/s to engage with the Imperial War Museum in\u000a          different ways\u000a        What are the challenges and risks of the use of social\u000a          interpretation and the representation of public discussions in\u000a          physical and digital cultural spaces?\u000a        Whether the use of social media models facilitates a re-balancing of\u000a          the audience\/authority relationship.\u000a      \u000a      Research was undertaken at both IWM London and IWM North, before and\u000a        after the installation of the SI technology, and both quantitative and\u000a        qualitative data was collected and analysed at both sites.

The research\u000a        investigated the potential for, and risks in applying social media\u000a        models to cultural collections, to facilitate social interpretation,\u000a        increase audience engagement and reach, and to re-balance the\u000a        audience\/authority relationship.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21239","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    A founder member of the Chinese Film\u000a        Forum UK and a member of the board of trustees of Cornerhouse,\u000a      Willis worked in partnership with Perks (Cornerhouse) to curate and tour\u000a      this UK-first season of new films.

The season offered a response to the under representation of\u000a        women in the film industry, as well as to the lack of films addressing\u000a        feminist issues and the fact that the representation of women on screen\u000a        in Hong Kong cinema is often narrow and stereotypical.\u000a      Following its residency at Cornerhouse during October and early\u000a        November 2009, the Visible Secrets UK tour launched at a gala\u000a        screening at the Curzon Cinema, Mayfair, London. Films from Visible\u000a          Secrets toured to eleven other UK venues facilitated by the\u000a        Independent Cinema Office. These included: Edinburgh Filmhouse,\u000a        Watershed Bristol, Broadway Nottingham, Dundee Contemporary Arts,\u000a        Chichester Cinema at New Park, Derby QUAD, Eden Court Inverness,\u000a        Northampton Forum Cinema, Sheffield Showroom and London Riverside\u000a        Studios. The inclusion of a tour in the project was important in\u000a        ensuring that audiences across the country had the opportunity to see\u000a        examples of the kinds of Hong Kong cinema that rarely reach regional UK\u000a        screens.\u000a      \u000aVisible Secrets was a successful partnership between various\u000a        interested organisations with a commitment to new curatorial approaches\u000a        to Hong Kong cinema and, as such, it provides a useful model for future\u000a        collaboration between academic and arts-based institutions operating\u000a        within the field of film exhibition. As both these sectors are\u000a        increasingly working within tightening financial constraints, other\u000a        collaborators for Visible Secrets were sought at an early stage\u000a        including the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office (HKETO), which\u000a        provided substantial financial support for the event through the\u000a        Cornerhouse, whilst crucially leaving control of the programmes' content\u000a        to the curators. Other enthusiastic supporters included the Confucius\u000a        Institute and the Chinese Arts Centre in Manchester.\u000a      The success of the collaboration suggests new ways in which academics\u000a        can have an impact on wider film culture. Mark Cosgrove, Head of\u000a        Programming at the Watershed Media Centre, Bristol, suggests that\u000a        academics can bring \"a deeper more historically and critically\u000a          engaged perspective' to such initiatives. There's a mutual benefit in\u000a          that such initiatives would result in the industry-facing side of the\u000a          partnership having more academic weight &#8212; and analysis &#8212; and the\u000a          academy having a better grounding in, and understanding of, the\u000a          immediate issues facing the industry. The business of film culture has\u000a          never fully maximized the impact that can result from a connection\u000a          between the study of cinema in both institutional and aesthetic terms\u000a          and film exhibition.\"\u000a      Three of the directors featured in the season (Angie Chen, Tsang Tsui\u000a        Shan and Ivy Ho) visited Manchester to discuss their work and women's\u000a        place in the Hong Kong film industry with Cornerhouse audiences. Further\u000a        supporting and contextualising materials for the season were made\u000a        available via the Cornerhouse website and included a series of podcasts,\u000a        including interviews with Chen, Tsang and Ho, online film reviews and a\u000a        special interview with Ann Hui.\u000a      Stephen Teo, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore and Author of\u000a        the landmark Hong Kong Cinema: The Extra Dimensions (BFI\u000a        Publishing) endorsed the season, stating that: \"The programme is an\u000a          excellent one and offers a good and rare opportunity for people in the\u000a          UK to see work by Hong Kong women filmmakers.

Visible Secrets\u000a      (2009) was a UK-first season of new films of Hong Kong's women filmmakers,\u000a      developed in partnership with Sarah Perks now Artistic Director, Visual\u000a      Art and Film at Cornerhouse,\u000a      Manchester. Visible Secrets is underpinned by the following\u000a      research:\u000a    \u000a      Research into Hong Kong films released in the UK over the decade prior\u000a        to the Visible Secrets programme revealed an emphasis on male\u000a        directors and action cinema. Very few works by women directors had been\u000a        released. In 2007 Willis and Perks curated a small season of films and\u000a        events entitled `Made in Hong Kong' (Cornerhouse &amp; Chinese Arts\u000a        Centre Manchester). A season of films and related events which\u000a        celebrated Hong Kong cinema and filmmaking since the 1997 reunification\u000a        with the People's Republic of China re-examined the boundaries of what\u000a        constitutes a `Chinese' cinema. The research undertaken for this event\u000a        provided evidence that female filmmakers were under-represented in\u000a        discourses about Hong Kong cinema. The research for this season and the\u000a        initial research for Visible Secrets resulted in Willis and Perks\u000a        editing a special edition of Film International (Number 40,\u000a        2009) devoted to Hong Kong Cinema since reunification. [2]\u000a\u000a      A research visit to Hong Kong in March 2009 included a meeting with\u000a        representatives from the Hong Kong Film Archive, the Hong Kong Arts\u000a        Centre, the Hong Kong Independent Film and Video Awards, producer and\u000a        curator Teresa Kwong and film director Yan Yan Mak. This visit made it\u000a        clear that `presence' in Hong Kong was vital in creating a working\u000a        relationship with industry professionals who would be able to assist in\u000a        moving the project forward and who could introduce the research team to\u000a        the film directors whose work they were interested in showcasing. The\u000a        visit included meetings with sales agents and government representatives\u000a        of the Hong Kong film industry which were arranged at Filmart, the film\u000a        industry market place and through attendance at the Asian Film Awards.\u000a        Overall, this visit provided key knowledge and understanding with regard\u000a        to new women filmmakers working in the Hong Kong film industry.\u000a      The research provided the catalyst for the development of the idea of\u000a        a season of films from Hong Kong's women filmmakers. Initially, Willis\u000a        et al had assumed that the season would offer a retrospective of the\u000a        work of some of the more established names from the Hong Kong industry,\u000a        such as Clara Law, Mabel Cheung and Ann Hui. However, the Hong Kong\u000a        research visit led to the research team's discovery of a number of other\u000a        women directors who offered a fresh take on the cinema of Hong Kong.\u000a      Upon tracking down and viewing their films, a new version of the\u000a        Visible Secrets project began to evolve, one that was much more\u000a        contemporary and exciting. Here really was a Hong Kong cinema that was\u000a        relatively unknown in the UK, and the aim became to make a small but\u000a        significant contribution to UK film culture by developing the profile of\u000a        the films and to grow further the audience for Hong Kong cinema in\u000a        Manchester, the North-west and the UK as a whole. This research in turn\u000a        prompted the research team's intention to challenge assumptions, both\u000a        popular and critical, regarding women and Hong Kong cinema; in\u000a        particular, the notion that there are very few women directors within\u000a        the Hong Kong film industry, an impression that has undoubtedly been\u000a        encouraged over recent years by the limited number of their films which\u000a        do make it onto the international film festival circuit, and the\u000a        substantially smaller amount that gain cinema distribution in the UK.

The impact\u000a      described here highlights some of the ways in which McKay's research\u000a      supports community participation and agency through offering an\u000a      understanding of its history and leading to the development of new forms:\u000a    2012-onwards: In September 2012, McKay was appointed as a\u000a      three-year AHRC Connected Communities Leadership Fellow to provide\u000a      intellectual leadership to the Connected Communities Programme, with\u000a      Professor Keri Facer, University of Bristol. The fellowship has two\u000a      equally funded facets: work on the programme and with AHRC, and a personal\u000a      research project. The two Fellows play a pivotal national role in\u000a      connecting research by identifying cross-cutting issues and supporting the\u000a      development of collaborations and partnerships. McKay's focus is\u000a      'Understanding changing community cultures and histories and patterns of\u000a      connectivity within and between communities', and his specific brief is\u000a      around the contribution of arts and humanities research:\u000a    \u000a       The vision for the Programme is `to mobilise the potential for\u000a          increasingly inter-connected, culturally diverse communities to\u000a          enhance participation, prosperity, sustainability, health and\u000a          well-being by better connecting research, stakeholders and communities.'\u000a        Effectively, Connected Communities is entirely about funding impactful\u000a        research, co-designed and co-produced between academics and community\u000a        partners, and the AHRC Fellowship (one of only six covering all AHRC\u000a        priority themes across the UK) places McKay at the forefront of such\u000a        initiatives.\u000a       Minister for Universities and Science David Willetts said: `Connected\u000a          Communities projects will lead to the development of new ways to\u000a          engage communities in creating, interpreting and using arts and\u000a          humanities research data. This will leave a sustainable resource and\u000a          legacy for future research and for communities.' Around 280 awards\u000a        have been made to date, working with over 400 community partners.\u000a       At the core of McKay's personal research project in the programme are\u000a        community arts practice and the temporary creative community of\u000a        festival. Each strand involves collaborating with community partners,\u000a        and is linked with much of McKay's other work:\u000a       One indicative activity took place in March 2013, `An Evening With\u000a        George McKay' in a marquee at Spitalfields City Farm, with a communal\u000a        meal, a lecture and discussion of the politics of community and of\u000a        gardening with local people.\u000a       This is a powerful continuity with McKay's earlier impactful work.\u000a        For instance, with Community Music: A Handbook&#8212;collections of\u000a        chapters by rather than simply about members of the\u000a        communities under discussion&#8212;McKay sought to enable the production of\u000a        texts of community voices, each of which became a valued&#8212;occasionally\u000a        contested, but necessarily referenced&#8212;resource for those communities.\u000a    \u000a    2010-2013: As the largest research project funded to date in\u000a      Europe for jazz, Rhythm Changes. drew on McKay's work and the team\u000a      have published on the value of jazz in national settings and developed\u000a      this research for festivals, venues and arts promoters, including\u000a      practice-based engagement with professional development schemes. The\u000a      project includes the Grow Your Own Festival resource, at which\u000a      McKay spoke, to provide arts organisations with practical tools to design\u000a      festivals. McKay's activities include future curatorial collaborations\u000a      with major events, including London (2013) and Cheltenham Jazz Festivals\u000a      (2014).\u000a    2011: The impact of Radical Gardening, (a Book of\u000a      the Year (Independent on Sunday), a gardening book of the year (Guardian))\u000a      is evident from discussions about it in both the gardener and activist\u000a      blogospheres.

It has also contributed both to More Music's status as a\u000a        leading community music organisation, as well as to the creative health\u000a        of community music nationally.\u000a       We toured nationwide with Community Music: A Handbook, and\u000a        people coming to workshops loved that book&#8212;I have since used the book as\u000a        a key text when running training workshops in Lisbon, Hong Kong,\u000a        Shanghai and in Belem (Brazil) and have found that the concepts that we\u000a        originated translate easily in an international context. It has been\u000a        refreshing to work with an academic like George outside\u000a        academia\".\u000a       Ben Higham, Community Music East: \"Over the past three or\u000a        four years I have been working with Professor McKay on engaging academic\u000a        expertise in the context of community music and media practice, to bring\u000a        a different, more historical, and objective perspective to our\u000a        understanding of the way we work as community artists. It began with\u000a        McKay's inspiring keynote to the Community Music East 2010 Conference,\u000a        Art 4 All, which provoked some fascinating and frank discussions around\u000a        practice and purpose.

Each of these interactions has challenged me to re-evaluate\u000a        what we do and what we can do as practitioners, and I really think that\u000a        McKay's observation and analysis of the nature and culture of community\u000a        music has helped to change the way community music thinks about itself.\u000a        For me it has been a very stimulating collaboration\".\u000a    \u000a    McKay was engaged as a consultant academic for the MSN\u000a        British festival-goers survey, and quoted in the extensive national\u000a      and international media coverage of the survey's findings.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study focuses on community cultures and social movement\u000a      activism, offering an understanding of participatory arts organisation and\u000a      practice, and the history of radicalisation for new generations of\u000a      activists, demonstrating the following impact:\u000a    \u000a       Understanding the changing nature of communities in their historical\u000a        and cultural contexts and the role of communities in sustaining and\u000a        enhancing our quality of life;\u000a       Connecting communities with research, developing community-engaged\u000a        research across a number of core themes, including:\u000a      \u000a         Community creativity and participation;\u000a         Countercultures and protest groups;\u000a         Community environments, places and spaces such as festivals, and\u000a          gardens;\u000a      \u000a       Informing policy development in the areas of community participation\u000a        and agency;\u000a       Informing social movement agendas and actions.\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    The University of Salford\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Salford (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Salford","PeerGroup":"C","Region":"North West","UKPRN":10007156}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"1819729","Name":"Hong Kong"},{"GeoNamesId":"1796231","Name":"Shanghai Shi"},{"GeoNamesId":"2267057","Name":"Lisbon"}],"References":"\u000a    Key outputs\u000a    \u000a1.

[5]\u000a\u000a       2006-2008: Society &amp; Lifestyles, an EUFP6 project\u000a        with 15 European partners, focused on understanding subcultural groups\u000a        and new religious movements in largely post-Soviet contexts, from\u000a        neo-Nazi skinheads to eco-villagers. Includes a public-facing subculture\u000a        event at a pagan festival in Lithuania.

Bajjaly) The\u000a        Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq. This has impacted on three\u000a      specific groupings: NGOs; national policy makers (including HM\u000a      Government); and the international military.\u000a    NGOs and civil society\u000a    The UK National Commission for UNESCO (UKNC), an independent, civil\u000a      society organisation providing policy advice to government in the fields\u000a      of UNESCO's competence, requested a copy of the hardback edition of Destruction.\u000a      With the British Institute for the Study of Iraq, it part-funded the\u000a      paperback edition in order that it be available to the widest possible\u000a      audience. Destruction was awarded the Archaeological Institute of\u000a      America's (AIA) 2011 James R Wiseman book award. The citation for the\u000a      award includes the following statement about the value of Destruction:\u000a      `The authors....respond to popular perception of events that gained\u000a      international attention and challenge the reader to fully comprehend the\u000a      context of each episode. As a result, this book has the ability to open a\u000a      wider dialogue between specialists and the general public about cultural\u000a      heritage issues that resonate on a global scale' (IMP1).\u000a    Destruction was highlighted as `Book of the Week' in the Times\u000a      Higher Education (31 July 2008), where it was described as: `an\u000a      extraordinary achievement that will stand as the definitive account of the\u000a      desperate, avoidable cultural tragedy of Iraq for many years to come' (IMP2).\u000a      Destruction was the subject of a three-page article in the Big\u000a        Issue (May 2009) and material from the book was used by journalist\u000a      Robert Fisk in his front-page story in the Independent (5 August\u000a      2012).\u000a    In 2009 the UKNC also sponsored the travelling version of the exhibition\u000a      Catastrophe! The Looting and Destruction of Iraq's Past - produced\u000a      by Stone in conjunction with the Oriental Institute in Chicago as the\u000a      result of links made during the writing of Destruction. Catastrophe!\u000a      has been shown at eight UK and European venues including Newcastle upon\u000a      Tyne, Durham, London, Dublin, and The Hague. Visitor feedback (IMP3)\u000a      on Catastrophe! has been extremely positive, including:\u000a      \"wonderfully informative\"; \"dreadful about the destruction: good to see\u000a      the issues are made public\"; \"both saddening and inspiring\"; \"An\u000a      excellent, shocking and truly important exhibition\"; \"Too grim for words;\u000a      but makes people think\". The last showing, at the Great North Museum,\u000a      Newcastle (July-August 2012) was accompanied by a series of four public\u000a      lectures (one by Stone) each of which attracted 40+ members of the general\u000a      public, which is a high number for such events at this venue. Overall the\u000a      exhibition reached an estimated public and specialist audience of\u000a      c.10,000.\u000a    In addition to this publication and exhibition activity Stone has also\u000a      brought the issue of cultural protection to the attention of wider popular\u000a      audiences via his contribution to BBC Radio, including on Radio Newcastle\u000a      (15 May 2008), Radio 5's `Up all night' programme (10 June 2008), and on\u000a      Radio 4's `World this Weekend (1 April 2012).\u000a    National Policy makers, HM Government\u000a    A copy of the Destruction book was requested by the Parliamentary\u000a      Select Committee scrutinising the Draft Cultural Property (Armed Conflict)\u000a      Bill in 2008. The Committee noted the value of the book in providing an\u000a      informed context for their deliberations and referred specifically to\u000a      information in the book in paragraph 9 of the report (IMP4). In\u000a      2009 the UKNC asked the author to draft written evidence to be submitted\u000a      to the Iraq (Chilcot) Inquiry. This evidence was submitted, with a copy of\u000a      Destruction, under the signature of 13 cultural heritage\u000a      organisations to the Inquiry in February 2010. In a letter dated 19 April\u000a      2010 the Inquiry Chairman noted that Destruction was `...very\u000a      useful to the Inquiry...\" and that he was \"...very grateful to [the\u000a      author] for sharing his expertise...' (IMP5). In 2012 Stone wrote\u000a      a Policy Brief for UKNC on `The value to the UK of ratifying the 1954\u000a      Hague Convention on the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of\u000a      Armed Conflict and its two Protocols of 1954 and 1999'. In 2012 Stone\u000a      worked with his local MP to table a written question on the likely timing\u000a      of ratification of the Hague Convention. As a result of this research\u000a      Stone has met with the relevant ministers for the previous and current\u000a      governments. These meetings and the above pressure from the UKNC and\u000a      others, all led by Stone, led directly to the Secretary of State at the\u000a      Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) (unsuccessfully) requesting\u000a      formally Parliamentary time during the 2012\/13 Session for passing\u000a      legislation to enable the UK to ratify the Hague Convention. DCMS staff\u000a      have confirmed they anticipate making a similar request for the next\u000a      Parliamentary session.\u000a    UK, NATO and international armed forces\u000a    The publication of Destruction has led to invitations to speak at\u000a      a number of military symposia dealing with cultural property protection\u000a      (CPP) including the Sustaining Military Readiness Conference, US\u000a      Department of Defence (2009); Cultural Property Protection in Times of\u000a        Conflict, Netherlands Ministry of Defence (2009); Cultural\u000a        Property Protection, Norwegian Ministries of Environment and Defence\u000a      (2011); Coping with Culture, German Bundeswehr (2011); Culture\u000a        in Conflict, UK Defence Academy (2012); Coping with Culture,\u000a      NATO Civilian\/Military Centre of Excellence (CIMIC-COE), The Netherlands\u000a      (2012). Impact has been incremental as Stone has gained the trust of the\u000a      military. For example he was: asked to chair the whole 2009 Dutch\u000a      Symposium mentioned above and to submit a report and recommendations to\u000a      the Netherlands MoD as a result of meeting military personnel at earlier\u000a      meetings; invited to the 2011 Coping with Culture meeting by the\u000a      Bundeswehr as the result of contacts made at the 2009 Dutch meeting;\u000a      invited to the 2012 meeting at CIMIC-COE at which he was asked to return\u000a      to work on the development of a training module for middle-ranking\u000a      officers on cultural property protection for NATO, for which a draft\u000a      syllabus has now been developed. Commenting on Stone's work in this area,\u000a      a senior CIMIC-COE staff member stated that: `were it not for the past\u000a      work, expertise and dedication of Prof. Stone, the project would have\u000a      never moved farther along than the concept....His impact on both sides of\u000a      the civil-military equation, in the area of joint education and training,\u000a      has been significant' (IMP6). Through this relationship-building\u000a      with the current and previous Directors of CIMIC Stone's research has been\u000a      able to influence military activity at an operational level. Cultural\u000a      property protection lists provided by Stone were used by NATO forces to\u000a      protect key sites from air strikes during the 2011 Libya conflict. The\u000a      current Director of the CIMIC- COE noted that `when Professor Stone\u000a      submitted lists of cultural property to be protected in Libya and Mali the\u000a      Centre was confident of their quality and reliability and passed them on\u000a      to the relevant strategic and operational units in NATO. These lists were\u000a      then used to ensure cultural property was not damaged by air-strikes' (IMP7).\u000a      For example, six mobile radar units that had been placed very close to the\u000a      Roman fort at Ras Almargeb by troops loyal to the Gaddafi regime were\u000a      carefully targeted and destroyed without damaging the fort because the\u000a      fort was on the list supplied to NATO (IMP8). The Director also\u000a      noted that: `A recent NATO report on our work in Libya recommended that\u000a      NATO develop a cultural property protection doctrine and I hope to\u000a      continue the Centre's relationship with Professor Stone' (IMP7).\u000a    More recently (2013) Stone has also been asked to prepare cultural\u000a      property protection training sessions and materials for the Lebanese Army,\u000a      the Nigerian Army and the Economic Community Of West African States\u000a      (ECOWAS). The three-day workshop with the Lebanese Army (June 2013) was\u000a      attended by 30 high level officers from the Lebanese Army, the United\u000a      Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) and the international police\u000a      organisation INTERPOL. Commenting on this workshop, the Head of the\u000a      International Humanitarian Law (IHL) Office, Lebanese Army wrote: `IHL in\u000a      general and the protection of cultural property in particular are becoming\u000a      increasingly important aspects of modern conflict. Because of this....I\u000a      created a team within the Lebanese Army to help develop doctrine and\u000a      practical approaches for the Army to use. The seminar we held last week\u000a      which was under the auspices of UNESCO was a crucial part of the training\u000a      of this team and a beginning of this process. It was very helpful that\u000a      Professor Stone was able to participate to share his knowledge and\u000a      experience with my staff and to introduce the concept of his 4-Tier\u000a      Approach that I am sure will be very useful in our future work' (IMP9).\u000a      Agreement on this need for new training provision on cultural property\u000a      protection for peacekeeping forces was also indicated by the attending\u000a      representative from UNIFIL who wrote: `In light of recent conflicts in\u000a      countries rich in cultural heritage where UN peacekeeping operations are\u000a      being planned, deployed and conducted, I am discussing...ways to ensure\u000a      that this aspect is taken into consideration. Most immediately, I am\u000a      seeking approval for CPP sensitivity seminars for UN troops in southern\u000a      Lebanon, and will try to expand these to other peacekeeping operations...'\u000a      (IMP10).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Since 2005 Professor Peter Stone's research has explored what we tolerate\u000a      as acceptable, and crucially, what we view as unacceptable, practice\u000a      during armed conflict in relation to the protection of cultural property.\u000a      It has investigated, within the context of jus in bello [the\u000a      morality of what is done during war], the way in which we wage war\u000a      and, by implication, the very nature of war itself.

Destruction\u000a      comprised 28 chapters mainly written by those Americans, Europeans and\u000a      Iraqis heavily involved in the protection of cultural property in Iraq\u000a      before, during, and after the 2003 invasion. These included Stone's (2005)\u000a      article `The identification and protection of cultural heritage during the\u000a      Iraq conflict: a peculiarly English tale' (2) which outlined his\u000a      work as archaeological advisor to the UK Ministry of Defence and\u000a      identified a series of 18 points for future action. Destruction\u000a      was part diary of events, part identification and analysis of issues, and\u000a      part draft strategy for future cooperation between cultural heritage\u000a      experts and the military. The research provided a baseline of knowledge\u000a      about what went wrong in Iraq, and about what the relationship between\u000a      cultural heritage experts and the military (in particular) could be. It\u000a      highlighted as a major issue the failure of the UK to ratify the `1954\u000a      Hague Convention on the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of\u000a      Armed Conflict and its two Protocols of 1954 and 1999' (Hague Convention).\u000a    One issue raised in Destruction was the belief that by working\u000a      with the military cultural heritage experts `provided academic and\u000a      cultural legitimacy to the invasion' and were part of a wider `ethical\u000a      crisis' in archaeology (Hamilakis, Y. 2003, Public Archaeology, 2:\u000a      107). This issue was addressed, and contextualised, in Stone's 2011 edited\u000a      book Cultural Heritage, Ethics and the Military (3). The 18\u000a      contributions to this book included: an historical overview; chapters\u000a      focusing on religious, medical, and indigenous relations with the\u000a      military; and chapters revolving around how any relationship might\u000a      develop. Taken together they underscored the complexity of the\u000a      relationship whilst emphasising its importance if cultural property is to\u000a      be better protected in future conflicts.\u000a    Stone's research has broadened to investigate the wider relationship\u000a      between cultural property protection and human rights (4) and on\u000a      the development of a four-tier approach to cultural property protection\u000a      and co-operation: long term; immediate pre-deployment; during conflict;\u000a      post conflict (5). This framework is intended to influence military\u000a      doctrine and practice and the development of a proactive and effective\u000a      response from the cultural heritage community. Future research is planned\u000a      to comprise an historic overview of cultural property protection and\u000a      iconoclasm and then focus on the interconnected areas of international\u000a      humanitarian law, trade in illicit antiquities, and the development of\u000a      good practice within the military and related organisations and agencies.\u000a      Stone is currently working with UK Blue Shield Committee to develop an\u000a      AHRC Research Networking Scheme to support this work.\u000a    Professor Peter Stone was appointed to the University in 1997, as\u000a      Director of the International Centre for Cultural and Heritage Studies\u000a      (ICCHS) in 2000, and as Head of the School of Arts and Cultures in 2006.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21735","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    This research has benefitted a diverse range of audiences including\u000a      artistic and museological communities of practice, local community groups\u000a      and Laing visitors. It made a significant impact upon Tyne and Wear\u000a      Archives and Museums (TWAM) by directly contributing to their gallery\u000a      redevelopment and leading to an enhanced public presentation of the visual\u000a      culture of North-East England.\u000a    Impact on cultural life: enhancing the presentation of cultural\u000a        heritage in North-East England\u000a    `Northern Spirit' is a permanent display created for the Laing Art\u000a      Gallery to replace its former `Art on Tyneside' exhibition, which was over\u000a      17 years old, with out-dated content and in urgent need of a redesign when\u000a      the research project began. The AHRC grant won by the Newcastle University\u000a      team brought a direct financial benefit of &#163;112,000 to the overall gallery\u000a      redevelopment project, enabling investment in new digital media content\u000a      and equipment. This input enabled TWAM to match this funding with money\u000a      from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) and the Woolfson Fund, resulting in\u000a      an overall project budget of &#163;1.1 million. The Director of TWAM stated\u000a      that \"The Art of Tyneside Research Project has had significant direct\u000a      benefits for TWAM venues, TWAM staff and TWAM audiences. The previous\u000a      display had reached the end of its life and the contribution of research\u000a      funding made a significant difference in helping secure other match\u000a      funding in order to set much-needed changes in motion. In particular it\u000a      provided support with the development of new media content, which is very\u000a      much enjoyed by visitors to the Gallery\" (IMP1).\u000a    In the new `Northern Spirit' gallery the significance of the Laing\u000a      collection was extended through the inclusion of new commissioned and\u000a      co-produced participatory content presented through a mix of digital media\u000a      based platforms, including a sound bench, touchscreen displays, an\u000a      interactive map and digital projection. Through these, 62 separate media\u000a      content elements were integrated into the new display, including audio\u000a      soundscapes, digital stories, short film interviews and crowd-sourced\u000a      digital photographs. A series of film interviews with regional and\u000a      national artworld figures (including artist Antony Gormley, Director of\u000a      Tate Nicolas Serota and Director of BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art\u000a      Godfrey Worsdale) offered new perspectives on the significance of North\u000a      East art and culture. The redesign also introduced a new platform for\u000a      showing iconic photographic images of the region. As the Laing does not\u000a      normally collect photography this was a new opportunity to introduce this\u000a      aspect of the region's heritage into the gallery (IMP1).\u000a    Impact on civil society and public discourse: coproduction of cultural\u000a        heritage\u000a    Over the two years of the project 67 individuals worked with the research\u000a      team to co-produce digital stories for the new gallery. Participants\u000a      included older people and under-represented groups e.g. people with\u000a      disabilities or learning or mobility difficulties, refugee and asylum\u000a      seekers and young people at risk of exclusion from school. A Flickr\u000a      competition also ran alongside the gallery redevelopment generating new\u000a      online participation in the project (84 members joined the Flickr Group,\u000a      contributing over 200 images). The project generated new ways of working\u000a      collaboratively by putting into practice theories about co-production and\u000a      participatory research through practical workshops and creative\u000a      activities. The films, photographs, sound pieces and digital stories\u000a      produced were then integrated into the final display and published on the\u000a      web. The research team worked with gallery designers, curators and\u000a      learning professionals to create platforms for showcasing these\u000a      co-produced audio-visual outputs, producing insight into the changes to\u000a      design processes necessitated by collaborative working (IMP1).\u000a    Impact on policy making: informing professional museum practice\u000a    The `Northern Spirit' project introduced innovative research relating to\u000a      new museology, co-production and use of digital media into the TWAM\u000a      gallery development process. Researchers ran workshops around theories of\u000a      interpretation and place-identity for staff and shared community and\u000a      public feedback on the gallery plans with the project team. The team also\u000a      collaborated with TWAM to create guidelines and training for\u000a      front-of-house gallery staff to help them respond to questions from the\u000a      public, such as why the perspectives of asylum seekers were included in\u000a      the gallery. TWAM's Director confirmed that: \"The benefits of the project\u000a      have been embedded within working practices and significantly contributed\u000a      to the way TWAM now approaches Gallery interpretation\" (IMP1).\u000a      Joint panel sessions by ICCHS and TWAM on collaborative partnerships\u000a      between HEIs and museums and galleries were presented at the 2010 Museums\u000a      Association Conference (Manchester). These were attended by 90 UK museum\u000a      and gallery professionals. The research team's partnership with TWAM was\u000a      further developed through participation in the Tate\/TWAM public engagement\u000a      initiative the Great British Art Debate (http:\/\/www2.tate.org.uk\/greatbritishartdebate\/index.html)\u000a      and the digital storytelling project Cultureshock (http:\/\/www.cultureshock.org.uk\/about.html).\u000a    In 2011 the `Northern Spirit' research developed into an AHRC follow-on\u000a      project `Partnership and Participation: Copyright and Informed Consent'.\u000a      This focused on questions of participation and intellectual property in\u000a      museum and gallery projects that had emerged as key issues in the\u000a      `Northern Spirit' study. Working with staff at TWAM and at Newport City\u000a      Museum and Heritage Service this project resulted in the production of a\u000a      PDF report directed at heritage sector professionals which offers\u000a      practical advice and guidelines on ethics and ownership when working\u000a      collaboratively with the public and digital media.

This is available from the project blog (878\u000a      views to date) (IMP2).\u000a    Impact on public services: increasing visitor numbers and satisfaction\u000a        for the Laing Art Gallery\u000a    Over 400 people attended the `Northern Spirit' launch event, many of whom\u000a      were project participants. In the first week of opening of the new display\u000a      the Laing received 9,000 visitors. As a free exhibition the gallery does\u000a      not provide separate visitor numbers for `Northern Spirit', but overall\u000a      Laing visitor figures have increased from 250,000 per annum prior to the\u000a      gallery redevelopment to over 270,000 in the year following the opening of\u000a      `Northern Spirit' (an 8% increase) (IMP3). Two separate\u000a      evaluations carried out by the Laing itself and by the project researchers\u000a      demonstrated that visitors overwhelmingly report increased satisfaction\u000a      with the improved quality of the new gallery, its new content, the\u000a      audio-visual resources, and the co-produced content. One recent visitor\u000a      liked the way the new display \"mirrors the history of the city\" noticing\u000a      in particular how the region had \"a big art history\"; another described\u000a      the exhibition as \"snapshots of lives....a sort of celebration\"; while a\u000a      third noted how the new media content \"expands the social context of the\u000a      gallery\" (IMP4).\u000a    `Northern Spirit' has created a valuable new education resource for TWAM.\u000a      Whereas the previous display was not regularly employed for educational\u000a      activity, the new `Northern Spirit' gallery is used extensively by the\u000a      Laing learning team, both for its on-going programme of targeted schools\u000a      workshops for different education keystages and for teacher training, e.g.\u000a      as part of its popular `Bigger Picture' series (IMP5). The display\u000a      is also the focus of a new `Identity Tour' aimed at older secondary school\u000a      students. Based on figures provided by the Laing around 40 separate school\u000a      and college groups from across North East England now engage with\u000a      `Northern Spirit' each year, some making multiple visits to the gallery (IMP6).\u000a      In addition the Laing also offers two family trails that include `Northern\u000a      Spirit'. In a follow-up interview (February 2013) learning team staff\u000a      spoke about the way in which the new display now offers clear themes which\u000a      schools and teachers find easy to relate to. They particularly noted the\u000a      popularity of the interactive map and suggested that they would like to\u000a      see the extension of AV material and projections into the adjacent caf&#233;\u000a      space. The `Northern spirit' gallery is the focus of curator-led tours and\u000a      is also used as a resource for more informal activities including creative\u000a      writing workshops managed by a local writing group and activities led by\u000a      the Laing Writer in Residence (IMP7).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The `Northern Spirit` research project entailed the co-production of a\u000a      new gallery about the visual culture, histories and identities of\u000a      North-East England at the Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle, the region's\u000a      foremost public historical art gallery. The project generated a range of\u000a      impacts across the local and national cultural, social and policy spheres:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aCultural life: It contributed to the production of a new\u000a        permanent display which challenged, changed and enhanced the ways that\u000a        the visual culture of North-East England is presented to, and understood\u000a        by, the local public and tourists.\u000a      \u000aCivil society and public discourse: It brought together diverse\u000a        members of the local community including marginalised and disadvantaged\u000a        groups, making their perspectives visible in the gallery for the first\u000a        time. It offered new precedents for combining art historical display\u000a        with issues of social history and regional identity using digital media\u000a        and participatory methods.\u000a      \u000aPolicy making: It explored and theorised the opportunities and\u000a        challenges of working collaboratively with diverse community groups on\u000a        the production of a public gallery display, resulting in the production\u000a        of new policy guidelines and feeding into the gallery working and wider\u000a        staff training.\u000a      \u000aPublic services: Through the production of a new permanent and\u000a        well-received gallery display it directly enhanced the provision of\u000a        cultural services, promoting the artistic heritage of the region and\u000a        increasing visitor figures for the Laing. Since its opening in October\u000a        2010 the `Northern Spirit' gallery has been visited by an estimated\u000a        audience of 800,000.\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    Newcastle University\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Newcastle upon Tyne (University of)","InstitutionName":"Newcastle University","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"North East","UKPRN":10007799}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

At the same\u000a      time, the research team investigated how a gallery-based representation\u000a      interacts with people's own understanding and lived experience of the\u000a      visual culture of North-East England. To understand this, the research\u000a      team carried out extensive consultation and collaboration with individuals\u000a      and groups drawn from the local community and from the wider arts sector\u000a      (regionally and nationally) to co-produce a range of digital media which\u000a      were integrated into the new `Northern Spirit' display. As part of the\u000a      gallery redesign, the researchers conceptualised and delivered the\u000a      audio-visual content of the new display, producing a photograph\u000a      projection, an interactive map, a sound-bench and six digital\u000a      touchscreens. Involvement in the overall gallery redesign enabled the team\u000a      to investigate their other research agenda: how to design exhibitions that\u000a      offer multiple points of entry and interpretive routes to a diversity of\u000a      audiences with a wide range of existing knowledge and specific cultural\u000a      capital relating either to art or place.\u000a    `Northern Spirit' is part of a long trajectory of research undertaken in\u000a      the International Centre for Cultural and Heritage Studies (ICCHS) at\u000a      Newcastle University, which focuses on the representations of identities\u000a      within the museum and within visitor and non-visitor groups. This research\u000a      led to the successful award of a two-year Arts and Humanities Research\u000a      Council (AHRC) funded project as part of the AHRC Museums and Galleries\u000a      Research Programme 2008-2010 and then to two AHRC funded follow-on\u000a      projects, all linked to the original research.\u000a    The Principal Investigator (PI), Rhiannon Mason, joined ICCHS in 2001 and\u000a      has researched and published extensively on issues of the representation\u000a      of identities and places within museums, most notably in relation to a\u000a      study of the National Museums of Wales and how they present Welsh\u000a      identities, histories and cultures (1). Mason's other strand of\u000a      research concerns new museological theory and issues such as polyvocality\u000a      and the ways that public histories come to be presented in museums\u000a      displays (2, 5, 6). In 2009 Mason also co-authored a literature\u000a      review commissioned by English Heritage about sense of place, heritage and\u000a      capital as part of a larger project with the Centre for Urban and Regional\u000a      Development Studies (CURDS) at Newcastle University. This research\u000a      expertise was brought to bear on the project at the Laing Art Gallery\u000a      which was about how the visual history of a region is presented and which\u000a      kinds of voices, histories, identities, and perspectives come to be\u000a      included in a gallery's representation.\u000a    Chris Whitehead, the Co-Investigator (CI), joined ICCHS in 2002 and has a\u000a      long track record of researching and publishing about art galleries and\u000a      issues of place-identity (6). Whitehead had previously published\u000a      extensively in the area of art museums and epistemology, problematizing\u000a      the conventional representational work of art museums (3); this\u000a      informed the `Art on Tyneside' project conceptually. He had also written a\u000a      number of papers on the relationships between art museums and place,\u000a      including three journal articles on the Victoria and Albert Museum\u000a      (V&amp;A) and one book chapter on the `Art on Tyneside' gallery at the\u000a      Laing which was the focus of the subsequent `Northern Spirit' development\u000a      (4). This paper analysed the gallery in relation to issues of\u000a      regional identities. Insights include understanding of place identity,\u000a      visitor studies and the role of place as an organising principle in the\u000a      museum context in terms of collections, displays and interpretation. This\u000a      is the first time that place identity has been mobilised in a display\u000a      context from a scholarly perspective.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"24883","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Arts and Humanities Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    IMPACT AT THE LEGO GROUP: The LEGO Group is one of the world's\u000a      leading toy and digital media producers, specialising in construction\u000a      products and digital services based around the LEGO System.

The reports have discussed the ways in which\u000a      creativity and learning can be fostered, and sought to identify the\u000a      combinations of human relationships, and physical \/ technological tools,\u000a      which can help to unlock the creative potential of children and adults.\u000a    In addition to building this knowledge within the company, there have\u000a      been more immediate impacts. The work on systematic creativity made\u000a      explicit the value of the interconnecting system which had always been\u000a      implicit at the heart of the LEGO System, and so this understanding was\u000a      included within a training pack given to all new employees at the LEGO\u000a      Group headquarters in Denmark, communicated via a LEGO Serious Play\u000a      building exercise devised by Gauntlett and Weckstr&#246;m. This pack has been\u000a      used by every new LEGO employee in Denmark since 2009.\u000a    The study `Systematic Creativity in the Digital Realm' argued that whilst\u000a      LEGO already had digital applications which could turn on-screen designs\u000a      into physical products, an innovative ambition would be to do it the other\u000a      way around, so that LEGO bricks could act as an interface for digital\u000a      devices &#8212; in other words, use LEGO bricks to make things happen on screen.\u000a      This contributed to inspiration for the team who developed LEGO Life\u000a        of George, a commercial product released in 2011 which brought\u000a      together physical bricks and an iPhone\/Android game in this way. The game\u000a      sets tasks, which has to be physically built and then scanned back into\u000a      the phone with its camera. The product was shortlisted for `e-Connected\u000a      Toy of the Year' in the Toy of the Year 2013 awards, the primary awards\u000a      event for toys and games in the USA (http:\/\/www.toyawards.org).\u000a      It has sold many thousands of copies (disaggregated sales figure not\u000a      released, but the LEGO Group is the third largest toy manufacturer in the\u000a      world in terms of sales, with 2012 profits being DKK 7,522 million (&#163;848\u000a      million UK) before tax [source: LEGO Group Annual Report 2012]).\u000a    In 2010, Gauntlett also worked with LEGO Education to turn the\u000a      consultancy process, LEGO Serious Play, into a set of principles and\u000a      materials that could be offered free as an `open source' package on the\u000a      LEGO website. This work was done collaboratively between Gauntlett and\u000a      Anna-Sophie Trolle Terkelsen, Concept Developer, LEGO Education, and led\u000a      to the materials being made available for download from September 2010.\u000a    Corroboration: \"Professor Gauntlett's research helped us to\u000a      develop new ideas for connecting the digital and physical realms with LEGO\u000a      tools. His work has been central to a number of LEGO reports exploring\u000a      creativity, play and learning in the 21st century. This thinking feeds\u000a      into strategy at the very top of our organization, and has made a\u000a      difference at several levels.\" &#8212; Cecilia Weckstr&#246;m, Head of LEGO.com, The\u000a      LEGO Group, Denmark\u000a    IMPACT AT THE BBC: The AHRC &amp; BBC Pilot Knowledge Exchange\u000a      Programme project, mentioned above, meant that University of Westminster\u000a      researchers could work alongside BBC producers and apply learnings from\u000a      our existing academic research in the context of the BBC's development of\u000a      a virtual world for children called Adventure Rock.\u000a    Amongst other findings, the researchers were able to identify eight\u000a      orientations to Adventure Rock &#8212; simplified archetypes\u000a      representing the different ways in which children engaged with this world\u000a      &#8212; such as `Self-stampers', who wanted to make their mark on the world\u000a      through self-expression; `Social climbers', who were interested in\u000a      ranking, and wanted to be visibly doing better than other players; and\u000a      `Nurturers', who wanted to care for characters in the environment.\u000a    The impact was that these archetypes were enthusiastically taken up by\u000a      executives in BBC Children's, 2008-10, who used them when discussing new\u000a      ideas for digital games, platforms and other commissions. They would\u000a      consider whether proposed new products would appeal to the different\u000a      archetypes, and how the emphasis could be changed so that the different\u000a      kinds of digital users could be appealed to equally.\u000a    \"The research... identified a set of useful `archetypes' of kinds of\u000a      child player... The research gave us this valuable tool for thinking about\u000a      potential projects [and] helped us to think more deeply about how and why\u000a      we should implement interactive experiences for children, and we would\u000a      welcome further opportunities for collaboration.\" &#8212; Rachel Bardill,\u000a      formerly Interactive Executive, BBC Children's; now Executive Producer,\u000a      CBeebies Interactive.\u000a    IMPACT AT S4C: S4C, the Welsh-language public service broadcaster\u000a      based in Cardiff, functions as a publisher-broadcaster, commissioning TV\u000a      programmes from small production companies across Wales. Its role in\u000a      maintaining the Welsh language gives it a distinctive cultural mission.\u000a    As a consequence of interest in his publication Making is Connecting,\u000a      Gauntlett was invited to have a sequence of meetings and interactions with\u000a      S4C's New Media Forum, a committee which had been charged with developing\u000a      S4C's digital future. Meeting the Forum and the acting Chief Executive at\u000a      S4C, Gauntlett made proposals about the role that everyday people in Wales\u000a      could play in building the range and diversity of Welsh-language media. He\u000a      argued that S4C's corporate aims were too narrow and outdated, being based\u000a      only on the transmission and reception of television programmes, and\u000a      proposed instead a three-part list of aims for S4C:\u000a    \u000a      To educate, inform, and entertain the Welsh people, in both\u000a        established and innovative ways;\u000a      To cultivate the creative capacity of Welsh-language producers and\u000a        makers of all ages and abilities;\u000a      To celebrate the culture, traditions and imagination of Wales.\u000a    \u000a    This text was adopted and proposed in the strategy report produced by the\u000a      New Media Forum over the summer, 2011, and delivered to S4C's governing\u000a      Authority and Management Team on 20 September 2011. The report\u000a      incorporated Gauntlett's further suggestions building on this theme: that\u000a      the company should do much more to support non-professional Welsh-language\u000a      media content wherever it was to be in found &#8212; primarily, video and audio\u000a      made by enthusiasts and shared on online platforms &#8212; so that the Welsh\u000a      language could be supported by communities of people making and sharing\u000a      their own media. The report was published in November 2011.\u000a    In October 2012, S4C published a new statement of corporate aims and\u000a      values, which was directly influenced by Gauntlett's research and the\u000a      subsequent dialogue. The new publication stated that the organisation's\u000a      role was to `nurture and celebrate creativity in the Welsh language' -\u000a      mirroring the specific vision and language proposed by Gauntlett (and in\u000a      sharp contrast to the previous aims, which only concerned making a certain\u000a      number of Welsh-language broadcasts).\u000a    Extract from letter of corroboration: \"I wish to acknowledge the\u000a      vital contribution that was made to the work of the New Media Forum by\u000a      Prof. Gauntlett. The work of the New Media Forum was one aspect a process\u000a      of renewal that has been taking place inside S4C over the past three\u000a      years, and I am personally very grateful to Prof. Gauntlett for his\u000a      extremely valuable contribution to this process\" - Dyfrig Jones, Chair,\u000a      S4C New Media Forum (2010-11).\u000a    CONTRIBUTION TO PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING: Gauntlett's talks about his\u000a      book Making is Connecting around the UK in 2011 were attended by\u000a      over 700 people, mostly non-academics. He also discussed the book on BBC\u000a      Radio 4's Thinking Allowed. The book was featured in the\u000a      high-street magazines Marie Claire, Making, and Psychologies.\u000a      Gauntlett's videos on YouTube about research on digital transformations,\u000a      produced since 2008, have been viewed over 150,000 times.\u000a    He has been a keynote speaker at industry and public events, such as Innovation\u000a        in Mind (Lund, Sweden, 2012) and the World Maker Faire, New York\u000a      (2013) as well as the headline speaker at the first European Maker Faire\u000a      in Rome (2013). The 2013 Italian translation of Making is Connecting\u000a      attracted coverage in Italian magazines and newspapers, with the research\u000a      said by commentators to speak to the craft traditions of Italy, and offer\u000a      a solution to economic problems.\u000a    Gauntlett's work on creative methods (2007, 2008) has been used to\u000a      facilitate public engagement events. Examples include the Lego Landscape\u000a      of Ideas at Reboot Britain, 2009, where 700 participants from business,\u000a      government, and the third sector, were invited to build metaphors of their\u000a      vision of a better society; and at the World Learning Environments\u000a      Conference, 2009, where 300 delegates built models representing the spirit\u000a      of an ideal learning environment.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Our research on the ways in which digital platforms enable people to make\u000a      and share creative material online, and thereby foster creativity in\u000a      individuals and groups, has had a number of particular direct impacts on\u000a      the media and cultural industries. At the LEGO Group, there have been\u000a      several impacts, on policy, on training, and on product development. At\u000a      BBC Children's, collaborative research about an online world for children\u000a      led to changes in commissioning processes. At S4C, the work had an impact\u000a      on digital media strategy, and led to a change in the company's statement\u000a      of overall corporate aims and values.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Westminster\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Westminster (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Westminster","PeerGroup":"D","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007165}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"3169070","Name":"Rome"}],"References":"\u000a    PUBLICATIONS: The research has been disseminated, and come to the\u000a      attention of companies, through a number of means including conference and\u000a      event presentations, and online video.

From 2013 the work\u000a      became part of CAMRI's new Centre for Social Media Research, collaborating\u000a      with newly appointed researchers (Fuchs, Meikle, Trottier), and between\u000a      centres.\u000a    The research concerns the value of digital platforms for fostering\u000a      creativity &#8212; primarily as a positive social value, but secondarily also as\u000a      valuable for businesses and organisations which seek to offer something of\u000a      value to users.

For \"The Ownership of News\" Inquiry,\u000d\u000a      chaired by Lord Fowler, Barnett ensured that the inquiry's remit was not\u000d\u000a      restricted to an examination of news output when examining the effect of\u000d\u000a      concentrated ownership; and that the inquiry's recommendations embraced\u000d\u000a      the news obligations of commercial terrestrial broadcasters and the\u000d\u000a      importance of maintaining impartiality requirements.\u000d\u000a    4.2 IMPACT AT THE BBC Drawing on her publications and expertise as\u000d\u000a      the BBC's Official Historian since 2003 Jean Seaton has provided advice on\u000d\u000a      many occasions to the BBC Trust, the Director General's Office and BBC\u000d\u000a      productions as a consultant, primarily on the history of policy issues in\u000d\u000a      order to enhance institutional memory and help guide decision-making: for\u000d\u000a      example on the historical role of women in broadcasting for the recent\u000d\u000a      Dame Janet Smith Review (2012-13) of the Jimmy Savile years. In 2009\u000d\u000a      Seaton intervened in the controversy about whether the BBC should\u000d\u000a      publicise a DEC (Disasters and Emergencies Committee) appeal for Gaza.\u000d\u000a      Neither the BBC nor the DEC understood the origins of the appeal\u000d\u000a      mechanisms and the accurate historical record provided by Seaton confirmed\u000d\u000a      and gave a basis to the BBC's final position that the Gaza appeal was\u000d\u000a      essentially political and therefore not permissible. The historical\u000d\u000a      documents to support this position were checked and posted on the BBC\u000d\u000a      website. Drawing on her expertise as a historian, the BBC has asked her\u000d\u000a      for evidence on licence fee and Charter negotiations, ceremonies, BBC\u000d\u000a      structural changes, the closing down of services, appointing a director\u000d\u000a      general, salaries and the history of political relationships with\u000d\u000a      governments. She has provided historical and institutional background for\u000d\u000a      many programmes including the creation of Broadcasting House, the role of\u000d\u000a      women for Radio 4's Women's Hour, the impact of Rough Justice,\u000d\u000a      the role of the female voice in broadcasting and the origins of Desert\u000d\u000a        Island Discs. As an expert on the BBC's past she has sat on working\u000d\u000a      parties for the World Service, BBC Radio, and the BBC's Northern Ireland\u000d\u000a      History Advisory Board. She has become a trusted `interlocutor' between\u000d\u000a      the BBC in Northern Ireland and the Centre on a range of issues. When the\u000d\u000a      abolition of a central post (The Head of Nations and Regions) exposed the\u000d\u000a      BBC in Northern Ireland, she wrote to the BBC Trust Chair, Chris Patten,\u000d\u000a      alerting him to the problem and he consulted with the region. She\u000d\u000a      contributed to an internal BBC seminar on the issue, and set up a round\u000d\u000a      table (funded by the Centre for British Politics and the Politics\u000d\u000a      Association) on Fragile Politics in the Age of Austerity that\u000d\u000a      enhanced public understanding of the issues.\u000d\u000a    4.3 IMPACT AT THE LEVESON INQUIRY Barnett's expertise in\u000d\u000a      journalism, regulation and media ethics led to a call to appear twice\u000d\u000a      before the Leveson Inquiry into the Culture, Practice and Ethics of the\u000d\u000a      Press in November 2011 and July 2012. In addition, on 12 October 2011 he\u000d\u000a      was one of only two academics invited to speak at one of the opening\u000d\u000a      Leveson seminars on `Supporting a free press and high standards &#8212;\u000d\u000a        approaches to regulation'. Through his oral evidence, and through\u000d\u000a      four separate written submissions, he provided evidence of his research on\u000d\u000a      attitudes towards the public interest, on the benefits of positive\u000d\u000a      regulatory structures, of the impact of media ownership on editorial\u000d\u000a      content, and of the policy implications of his research. At Barnett's\u000d\u000a      second appearance, he was asked by Lord Justice Leveson to draft some high\u000d\u000a      level principles and a draft statute on plurality. Leveson's final\u000d\u000a      proposals for independent self-regulation drew heavily on the model put\u000d\u000a      forward by the Media Standards Trust Report A Free and Accountable\u000d\u000a        Media: Reform of Press Self-regulation (July 2012). Barnett was a\u000d\u000a      key and active member of the Review Group, advising the MST on the report,\u000d\u000a      helping to develop its recommendations, drawing on his research on\u000d\u000a      journalism and regulation.\u000d\u000a    4.4 IMPACT AT OFCOM Through a commissioned research paper\u000d\u000a      (published by the Reuters Institute) and through a series of seminars\u000d\u000a      (referenced above), Barnett has informed the policy thinking and\u000d\u000a      recommendations of Ofcom, ensuring both that their approach to amending\u000d\u000a      local media ownership rules includes appropriate understanding of the\u000d\u000a      democratic and cultural role of local media, and that they take into\u000d\u000a      account new ideas and approaches to measuring plurality in their advice to\u000d\u000a      the Secretary of State.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case study focuses on impact by the Media Policy and Industries\u000d\u000a      Group within the Communications and Media Research Institute (CAMRI),\u000d\u000a      specifically the complementary expertise of Jean Seaton and Steven\u000d\u000a      Barnett.

The central question guiding this strand\u000d\u000a      is `Why does public service broadcasting matter and how can it be\u000d\u000a      sustained internally and maintained externally?' Key findings have drawn\u000d\u000a      on empirical and archival enquiry into broadcasting history and policy\u000d\u000a      which demonstrate the substantial cultural and economic contribution of\u000d\u000a      public service broadcasting in Britain, rooted in concepts of citizenship,\u000d\u000a      diversity, universality and innovation. Insights have focused on the vital\u000d\u000a      role of a positive regulatory framework and appropriate governance\u000d\u000a      frameworks for sustaining investment in original, high quality UK content,\u000d\u000a      particularly in key public interest areas such as news, current affairs,\u000d\u000a      drama, comedy and the arts as well as the BBC's institutional and cultural\u000d\u000a      contribution nationally and internationally. Barnett's research has\u000d\u000a      identified both long-term threats to how PSB contributes to Britain's\u000d\u000a      economic and cultural welfare, and policy initiatives to mitigate those\u000d\u000a      risks. Seaton's continuing historical approach (exemplified by her 1981\u000d\u000a      volume Power Without Responsibility, now in its 7th\u000d\u000a      substantially revised edition, various articles, and continuing with the\u000d\u000a      next volume of the official history of the BBC from 1974 to 1987)\u000d\u000a      establishes the relevance of historical precedents for the BBC's\u000d\u000a      continuing institutional stability in the UK, and in particular for those\u000d\u000a      charged with governance, management and editorial responsibilities during\u000d\u000a      a period of exceptional political and commercial challenge to the BBC.

Professor Sakr, formerly Middle East\u000d\u000a      Editor at the Economist Intelligence Unit, joined the University of\u000d\u000a      Westminster as a Visiting Lecturer in 2001, becoming Senior Lecturer in\u000d\u000a      2004, Reader in 2006 and Professor of Media Policy in 2009. In 2002 she\u000d\u000a      worked with the then CAMRI Director Prof. Colin Sparks (left UoW July\u000d\u000a      2011) and Dr Tarik Sabry to win ESRC funding for a two year (2003-05)\u000d\u000a      international seminar series on \"The Impact of New Media Technologies on\u000d\u000a      Public Life in the Arab World\". Launched in 2006, the CAMRI Arab Media\u000d\u000a      Centre, directed by Sakr, grew through HEIF grants for conferences\u000d\u000a      (2007-08), an RCUK Research Fellowship held by Dr Katharina N&#246;tzold\u000d\u000a      (2007-10), Open Society bursaries (2008, 2009, 2011, 2013), a Leverhulme\u000d\u000a      Fellowship (2013-) and AHRC funding for a 3-year project on Pan-Arab\u000d\u000a      Children's TV (2013-15).\u000d\u000a    The qualitative research underpinning Prof. Sakr's impact started in\u000d\u000a      1997-98, when she worked on Arab censorship for the NGO Article 19, and\u000d\u000a      continued after she joined UoW in 2004, building on her earlier\u000d\u000a      award-winning book, Satellite Realms (2002), and refereed journal\u000d\u000a      articles (1999-2003) on transnational television and the Middle East. Data\u000d\u000a      gathered from Arab media practitioners and human rights defenders, as well\u000d\u000a      as interviews in centres of Arab media production, led to publications\u000d\u000a      such as Arab Television Today (2007), which were accessed by\u000d\u000a      professionals involved in democratisation projects in Arab countries, who\u000d\u000a      were seeking to make sense of Arab media developments. They, in turn,\u000d\u000a      facilitated Sakr's further research access to key players in the rapidly\u000d\u000a      evolving Arab media scene, enabling her to produce work directly relevant\u000d\u000a      to the task of understanding the place of media in the uprisings that\u000d\u000a      started to bring down Arab dictators in 2011.\u000d\u000a    Sakr's work gauges the significance, in terms of political change and\u000d\u000a      human rights observance, of: the rise of Arab-owned satellite channels;\u000d\u000a      changes in media ownership and control; and the breadth and depth of media\u000d\u000a      liberalisation in Arab countries. Key findings include:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Adopting satellite television enabled Arab regimes to postpone\u000d\u000a        liberalising terrestrial television and avoid it altogether in some\u000d\u000a        cases.\u000d\u000a      Reciprocal intra-regional controls on satellite television content,\u000d\u000a        transmission and reception minimised the extent to which its spread\u000d\u000a        could herald a new era of free expression.\u000d\u000a      Contrary to widespread assumptions that satellite television\u000d\u000a        programmes, especially those on Al-Jazeera, were reflecting enhanced\u000d\u000a        forms of political participation in Arab countries, innovations in\u000d\u000a        content merely reflected change among ruling elites who faced acute\u000d\u000a        national policy dilemmas and were internally divided over how to handle\u000d\u000a        them. In the absence of overt political platforms, media outlets played\u000d\u000a        this role.\u000d\u000a      New forms of patronage emerging in Arab television and policy\u000d\u000a        differences between elites opened up space for a few prominent\u000d\u000a        journalists to move beyond the highly politicised journalism long\u000d\u000a        prevalent in Arab media and apply international norms.\u000d\u000a      Despite outward appearances of competition among television channels,\u000d\u000a        resource allocation remained the sole prerogative of a small,\u000d\u000a        interconnected group of owners with complete lack of transparency about\u000d\u000a        motives and trade-offs within the group.\u000d\u000a      Arab governments curb media freedom not only through media laws that\u000d\u000a        contravene their international obligations on civil and political rights\u000d\u000a        but also through laws that restrict freedom of assembly and association\u000d\u000a        and thereby inhibit media freedom advocacy.\u000d\u000a      Satellite television increased Arab women's visibility but\u000d\u000a        restrictions on women's media activism limited campaigning against\u000d\u000a        women's marginalisation in important areas of decision making in Arab\u000d\u000a        media.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"27101","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Friend's work has been used to inform and enhance the training of lawyers\u000a      and visitors working with detainees, and has contributed to activist\u000a      campaigns and to building public understanding of the lives and situations\u000a      of immigration detainees. This was through the impact of the Border\u000a        Country exhibition itself, as well as via extensive press and\u000a      curatorial coverage of the exhibition [see Section 5, C1].\u000a    Requests for the re-use of Border Country material were received\u000a      from filmmakers, campaigners and visitor groups working to help\u000a      asylum-seekers. Despite some restrictions imposed by the Home Office,\u000a      activist organisations (including Dover Detainee Visitor Group, Bail\u000a        for Immigration Detainees and the Testimony Project) were\u000a      able to use images from Border Country in their publications and\u000a      on their websites, and audio material from the project at conferences and\u000a      workshops [C2]. The Gatwick Detainee Visitors Group used the\u000a      project's images at its Annual General Meeting (2009), in training for\u000a      prospective new Visitors [C3]. Both Dover Detainee Visitor Group\u000a      and London Detainee Visitors Group raised funds through selling\u000a      copies of the Border Country book, the latter at the launch of the\u000a      research report Detained Lives at Amnesty Human Rights Action\u000a      Centre, 29 January 2009 [C4].\u000a    Friend was invited to talk about the project at public lectures and\u000a      exhibition openings. The Belfast Exposed public opening in 2007 included a\u000a      discussion of immigration detention between Friend and Northern Ireland\u000a      immigration lawyer Anna Morvern. As a result, Morvern then employed the\u000a      project's images and interviews when training lawyers for the Law Centre\u000a      (NI) in 2008, prior to the opening of the Larne detention centre, as well\u000a      as in professional talks on refugee rights. For Morvern, the presence of\u000a      detainees' voices in the training room provided an immediacy and\u000a      tangibility to discussion of theoretical issues about the practice of\u000a      human-rights law in the field of immigration, vital for legal\u000a      practitioners new to the field [C5].\u000a    The work has also had cultural impact. As a result of press coverage,\u000a      Friend was invited by writer Natasha Walter, director of the activist\u000a      group Women for Refugee Women (WRW), to participate in the staging of the\u000a      play Motherland on 14 January 2010 in Bedford, close to the Yarl's\u000a      Wood IRC, by using the Border Country images as stage backdrop.\u000a      The play, focusing on female and child asylum-seekers in Yarl's Wood, was\u000a      directed by Juliet Stevenson and performed by Stevenson, Harriet Walter\u000a      and others. Natasha Walter said: `We wanted to bring the play to a local\u000a      audience. There were MPs present &#8212; Patrick Hall and Alistair Burt, who\u000a      took part in a post-performance discussion of the work &#8212; and local\u000a      activists, as well as the management from Yarl's Wood and Serco [the\u000a      private company in charge of the centre], although they refused to engage\u000a      in discussions [C6]. The overwhelming response from the local people was:\u000a      \"Not in our name\"' (July 2010) [C7]. Hall and Burt went on to speak\u000a      against immigration detention practices [C6].\u000a    Direct audience responses (demonstrated through exhibition visitors'\u000a      books) similarly evidence the project's power to inform and challenge\u000a      public perceptions about immigration detention and the experiences of\u000a      asylum-seekers.\u000a    Examples of visitor comments are:\u000a    \u000a       `Absolutely chilling &#8212; absence of people in images and presence in\u000a        sound works so well &#8212; the images are somehow gorgeous too'\u000a        (University of the Arts, London);\u000a       `The sound installation gives that personal edge and impacts on the\u000a        highly evocative and haunting spaces.

Through\u000a      its focus on subjective experiences of immigration, Border Country\u000a      positions the disillusionment of the once-hopeful immigrant within the\u000a      context of the institutional framework that comprises the UK immigration\u000a      system. It shows how the very order and rule of UK law, for which the\u000a      aspiring asylum-seeker yearned whilst experiencing the anarchy of their\u000a      home country, now entraps them, both in the detention centre and in the\u000a      labyrinthine bureaucracy which processes asylum claims.\u000a    The project's research method involved, first, 43 hours of interviews\u000a      with 11 asylum-seekers in detention, recorded between 2003 and 2007. After\u000a      a two-year period of negotiation, Friend was also permitted to carry out\u000a      photographic research at all eight IRCs in England. The research\u000a      interviews focused on male detainees (who comprise 85-88 per cent of\u000a      immigration detainees), but also included material from two women\u000a      detainees in Yarl's Wood IRC. Interviews were designed to explore meanings\u000a      of home, memory and identity in the context of confinement. Individuals\u000a      were followed over an extended period, and also interviewed following\u000a      attempted deportations.\u000a    Using her highly unusual level of access, Friend explored the use of\u000a      indefinite detention and the ways in which the bleak, chilling\u000a      institutional structures affected detainees' states of mind. Interviewees\u000a      describe their earlier experiences of civil war and torture, and their\u000a      present debilitating experience of detention: two talked of suicide; one\u000a      described his suicide attempt. Detainees described what they felt to be\u000a      the inhumanity of the UK's immigration detention system. Through the use\u000a      of audio recordings of interview fragments from these first-person\u000a      narratives, Friend's research encourages its audiences\/users to reflect\u000a      critically on themselves rather than on the asylum-seeker.\u000a    The research also explored photographically the meaning and impact of\u000a      institutional space, through a series of landscapes of the external\u000a      security structures of the UK's IRCs, and a visual exploration of the\u000a      design and seating arrangements of Visits Rooms, several of which used a\u000a      rigid demarcation between asylum-seekers and visitors. The particularity\u000a      of immigration and detention was emphasised through aesthetic strategies\u000a      developed in the work &#8212; notably the juxtaposition of these clinical, bleak\u000a      images (devoid of people) and the first-person intimacy of the individual\u000a      voices of asylum-seekers in the recorded interviews.\u000a    The Border Country publication (2007) included images, interview\u000a      extracts, essays by three contributors (including Friend), biographical\u000a      details of detainees and a 75-minute audio CD of a linear fragmentary\u000a      soundtrack. The travelling exhibition (2007-2010) comprised 17 images,\u000a      made within the confines of the UK's immigration removal centres, and five\u000a      simultaneous soundtracks. Friend also published an academic article\u000a      discussing her project methodology (2010).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"27106","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    &#8226; The first impact of this very widely reviewed [see Section 5, C1]\u000a      research was to stimulate and\u000a      enrich public discussion and understanding of the importance of sound as\u000a      an aspect of history\u000a      and of contemporary social relations. The radio series brought the\u000a      research to a wide audience.\u000a      RAJAR figures for Q1 of 2013 indicate that, in a typical week, programmes\u000a      in this slot (i.e. 1.45-2\u000a      pm weekdays) got 2.4 million adult listeners (9.8 per cent of the\u000a      available national audience).\u000a      Programmes from the Noise series were listened to online at the\u000a      BBC website 312,000 times, and\u000a      downloaded as podcasts 41,000 times during the first two weeks alone. In\u000a      March, the series was\u000a      in the top 12 podcasts on iTunes in the UK. The series was a `featured'\u000a      item on BBC iPlayer and\u000a      trailed on BBC national television channels at peak time between 21 and 28\u000a      April. One episode\u000a      was re-broadcast on the New York radio station WNYC (the country's `most\u000a      listened to public\u000a      radio station' with a weekly reach of over 1 million listeners), and\u000a      extracts twice re-broadcast on\u000a      BBC Radio 4's Pick of the Week. From May 2013 it was made\u000a      available as a commercial\u000a      download via ITunes and AudioGo &#8212; becoming, in its first week of sales,\u000a      AudioGo's 4th most\u000a      popular download in the UK [C2, C6 &#8212; Hutchings, BBC]. The book was also\u000a      sold prominently in\u000a      high-street bookshops, through newspapers and via iTunes, selling\u000a      approximately 4,000 copies in\u000a      the first two months. It was selected by the national `Prison Reading\u000a      Group' in May 2013, with\u000a      copies distributed to inmates of HMP Bullingdon in Oxfordshire, as part of\u000a      a scheme to\u000a      `encourage links between formal and informal education' within prisons\u000a      [C3]. Hendy's research led\u000a      to interviews on the historical role of sound in BBC History Magazine\u000a      and The Wire (an online\u000a      music magazine with a large international reach). He was also commissioned\u000a      to write an article for\u000a      The Scotsman (on how his research suggests histories focused on\u000a      sound create a more\u000a      `decentred' narrative than those produced by traditional political\u000a      studies) and for the Independent\u000a      (20 March), in which he drew on fieldwork in Greece and Ghana to argue for\u000a      the potential\u000a      restorative effects of sound for travellers. Hendy also presented his\u000a      research at the Brighton\u000a      Science Festival, the Bath Literature Festival, Field Day in London, the\u000a      Bristol Festival of Ideas,\u000a      and the Dartington Ways With Words Festival, as well as on many local,\u000a      national and international\u000a      radio programmes (e.g. RTE's, Arena programme, the World Service's\u000a      Newshour, BBC Five Live,\u000a      BBC London, BBC Radio Scotland, BBC Radio Ulster, BBC Sussex, BBC\u000a      Newcastle, WNYC in\u000a      New York and News Talk Ireland) [C1, C4].\u000a    Radio interviews frequently acted as a stimulus for public comments and\u000a      interaction. For Newshour\u000a      on BBC World Service, Hendy drew on his research to discuss sound and\u000a      memories of place, while\u000a      listeners in Asia and Africa emailed\/tweeted on the role of sound in their\u000a      own memories. Hendy's\u000a      interview on BBC Radio Scotland's flagship arts show, The Culture\u000a        Studio, centred on his research\u000a      on the class-based soundscapes of Edinburgh in the 18th\u000a      century, with listeners invited to submit\u000a      sonic impressions of the city. His appearance on WNYC in New York framed a\u000a      week-long sequence\u000a      of items about urban sound pollution, with New Yorkers invited to describe\u000a      their own experiences\u000a      and the Mayor's Environment Committee invited to respond: the station\u000a      website noted that it had\u000a      `received an overwhelming response to our segment on the effects of urban\u000a      noise' [C4]. Influential\u000a      blogs from around the world reflected on the implications of Hendy's\u000a      research for their own special\u000a      interests. For example, the blog of the Council of Ex-Muslims discussed\u000a      Hendy's argument about\u000a      the role of rhythm in ecstatic religions; a cycling blog drew on Hendy's\u000a      explorations of Dutch urban\u000a      noise-reduction strategies to argue for a rebalancing of the rights of\u000a      cyclists and motorists within\u000a      British cities, concluding that `noise and danger go together' and\u000a      prompting one commentator to\u000a      claim `It gave me an entirely new way of thinking about cycle helmets'.\u000a      Phil Evans, a Music\u000a      Therapist blogging at the Huffington Post, wrote about how the\u000a      series had prompted his\u000a      reconsideration of the relationship between music and silence in music\u000a      therapy [C4]. A sample of\u000a      over 900 references to the series on Twitter includes a large number of\u000a      references to it being a\u000a      culturally enriching and, at times, personally inspiring experience [C3].\u000a    The main research theme amplified in public discussion was Hendy's\u000a      contention that the process\u000a      of defining what is `noise' and what is not has frequently represented the\u000a      play of unequal power\u000a      relations in society. This was the focus of an article commissioned by the\u000a      main BBC News Online\u000a      website (18 March 2013: `The Dark Side of Silence'), where Hendy presented\u000a      evidence in support\u000a      of his argument. This included a film on how sounds get amplified in city\u000a      environments, links to\u000a      articles about noise abatement and an invitation for public comments. The\u000a      article was the third\u000a      most `shared' BBC news item on social media that day, with 1.2k of\u000a      `shares'. It was also translated\u000a      for the BBC's Mundo website serving Latin America [C1]. The same research\u000a      theme was also\u000a      aired when the Big Issue published `Is Silence a Virtue?', a\u000a      centre-page spread in its 25-31 March\u000a      2013 issue, to discuss the relative merits of silence and of noise in\u000a      forging sociality, and in a\u000a      similar discussion for BBC Radio Ulster's Sunday morning religious\u000a      programme. The Daily\u000a        Telegraph devoted an editorial\/leading article to the subject of\u000a      `Sounds and silence', using\u000a      Hendy's work as a prompt, and posing the question `Is it noisier in our\u000a      lives than in past\u000a      centuries?' (Daily Telegraph, 6 April 2013). Several newspapers\u000a      suggested that Noise had\u000a      encouraged a subtle change in attitude towards sound. A reviewer in the Irish\u000a        Times said the\u000a      book was `opening our ears and our minds to the sound worlds of other\u000a      lives and times, and\u000a      perhaps encouraging us to listen to our own familiar soundscapes with\u000a      fresh ears' (6 April 2013);\u000a      a reviewer for the Daily Express concluded that: `[t]he aural\u000a      soundscape connects us to our\u000a      ancestors in much the same way as the physical landscape does. `Noise:\u000a        A Human History' made\u000a      me feel quite silly for not having thought about this much before. I\u000a      expect many other listeners felt\u000a      the same' (24 March 2013) [C1, C4].\u000a    &#8226; The second major impact of the research was the creation of new\u000a      artistic artefacts and national\u000a      cultural resources as a result of Hendy's work, stimulating further\u000a      creative commissions in sound\u000a      and in bequeathing to the British Library a new permanent collection of\u000a      field-recordings. This is\u000a      particularly evidenced in three instances:\u000a    &#8226; First, field-recordings and sound archives, featured in the programme\u000a      and selected under the\u000a      guidance of Hendy's research, were used in the creation of new musical\u000a      works. Jo Acheson of\u000a      the Hidden Orchestra received a &#163;2,000 commission to compose 30 different\u000a      signature tunes\u000a      for the series, each based directly on the content. The musician and Head\u000a      of the New\u000a      Radiophonic Workshop, Matthew Herbert, received a &#163;2,500 commission to\u000a      create a 14-minute\u000a      musical work, based on the Noise series and following the overall\u000a      narrative structure\u000a      and themes established by Hendy's research. Hendy's notes and\u000a      field-recordings in Edinburgh\u000a      were also used by American composer, Tod Machover, to assist in the\u000a      creation of a new `city\u000a      symphony' inspired by soundscapes of the city (premiered at the Edinburgh\u000a      International\u000a      Festival in August 2013, but composed April-June). Machover wrote to Hendy\u000a      on 5 May\u000a      saying, `If I manage to convey anything useful about Edinburgh through\u000a      this new piece, much\u000a      of that will be because of what I have learned from you and your work'\u000a      [C5, C6 &#8212; Machover].\u000a    &#8226; Second, in May 2013, by agreement made in 2012, the first of a series\u000a      of recordings for the\u000a      series was handed to the British Library, to be part of a new permanent\u000a      holding accessible to\u000a      the public and future researchers. Hendy's research on Noise has therefore\u000a      led to an\u000a      enhancement in the national corpus of sound archives [C6 &#8212; Thompson]\u000a    &#8226; Third, Noise has contributed towards the goal of two national\u000a      institutions &#8212; the BBC and the\u000a      British Library &#8212; to enhance, as the BBC puts it, `the art of listening'.\u000a      At the BL on 20 May, in a\u000a      joint event organised by the University of Sussex and the Library, `Sound\u000a      Archives and the\u000a      Listening Public', the Library's Chief Executive Roly Keating said the\u000a      series had been `one of\u000a      the most fruitful encounters between the Library and the BBC' in his time\u000a      at the BL. In noting its\u000a      creation of a strong narrative framework for archive recordings, he said,\u000a      one could `begin to\u000a      find new forms of broadcasting' [C6 &#8212; Keating, BL]. The Commissioning\u000a      Editor for Arts and\u000a      Documentaries, BBC Radio 4 and World Service, Tony Phillips, stated that,\u000a      in providing\u000a      listeners with a `sensorial and global experience that emerges organically\u000a      from the thesis of the\u000a      narrator', Noise provided `a big gauntlet that's been thrown down\u000a      to other producers in radio'.\u000a      Specifically, it helped to `reinforce and draw attention to the unstated\u000a      intention of the network\u000a      [Radio 4]: to encourage the art of listening' [C6 &#8212; Phillips, BBC]. The\u000a      BBC's Head of History,\u000a      Robert Seatter, said that Hendy's work offered `a model' for\u000a      academic-broadcast partnerships\u000a      and `a paradigm that can be replicated in other ways' [C5 &#8212; Seatter, BBC].\u000a    The BBC's website for the series also reflected this broader cultural\u000a      agenda, by linking to a range\u000a      of other sites related to listening &#8212; e.g. a permanent link on the series'\u000a      homepage to other major\u000a      BBC series, such as Open Air (a series of audio interventions by\u000a      five artists) and The Listening\u000a        Project (a series `to capture the nation in conversation' produced\u000a      in collaboration with the BL) and\u000a      a rotating menu of other programmes such as In Our Time. A section\u000a      of `Related Links' allowed\u000a      users to link directly to the BL's Sounds collections and its `Sounds'\u000a      blog. The BBC also\u000a      commissioned a series of 6 special blogs written by curators at the BL,\u000a      discussing the radio\u000a      programmes in the broader context of other archives of relevance (see, for\u000a      example:\u000a      http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/blogs\/radio4\/posts\/Noise-A-Human-History-Week-3-The-Bells).\u000a    Additionally, BBC webpages devoted to each individual episode included\u000a      links to archives and\u000a      resources of particular relevance to that day's broadcast. BBC data record\u000a      312,000 online\u000a      requests related to the series [C4]. The BL's curator, Janet Topp-Fargion,\u000a      states that during the\u000a      series the BL `clearly noticed some spikes in the use of our online sound\u000a      collections'. She argues\u000a      that the sheer scale and duration of the series was a factor in\u000a      stimulating public interest: `it\u000a      becomes part of the discourse' [C5 &#8212; Topp Fargion, BL].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    David Hendy's 30-part series for BBC Radio 4 (broadcast March-April 2013)\u000a      and the accompanying\u000a      book, Noise: A Human History of Sound and Listening, have had two\u000a      main impacts.

Hendy's research on the role of sound and\u000a      listening in social history over\u000a      the past 100,000 years took the model of cultural historians who have\u000a      studied the role of sound in\u000a      particular times and places, and developed it by linking relatively\u000a      atomised work into a significantly\u000a      broader account (geographically and chronologically), drawing on work in\u000a      archaeology, ethnography,\u000a      musicology and mainstream social history, as well as on primary written\u000a      sources and original field-recordings.\u000a      Its overarching theme was the way in which, across history, arguments over\u000a      sound &#8212; e.g.\u000a      what constitutes `noise' and should be silenced, or how some ways of\u000a      listening have more perceived\u000a      value than others &#8212; have been symbolic (and sometimes constitutive) of\u000a      broader power struggles\u000a      and desires for sociality. Using cross-disciplinary sources and original\u000a      field-recordings to `recreate'\u000a      past soundscapes, Hendy's work develops an immersive approach that\u000a      provides an understanding\u000a      of how past events and processes were experienced subjectively by\u000a      ordinary people, thus\u000a      demonstrating that hidden social tensions within particular eras can be\u000a      `unlocked' through study of\u000a      the `soundworlds' of past everyday life. Further, his research posits that\u000a      social `soundproofing'\u000a      between cultures and classes repeatedly leads to spirals of mutual\u000a      misunderstanding &#8212; a finding with\u000a      implications for contemporary urban life and debates over\u000a      multiculturalism.\u000a    Hendy was commissioned by BBC Radio 4 to research and present a series on\u000a      the role of sound in\u000a      the making of the modern mind, structured around 30 historical case\u000a      studies. The radio series places\u000a      rare archival recordings in the public domain.\u000a    Archival\/book research was conducted from April 2012 to January 2013.\u000a      Primary sources (e.g. early-18-century\u000a      accounts of slave culture) were read at the Bodleian Library, and suitable\u000a      sound archives\u000a      identified at the British Library (BL), Pitt Rivers Museum and elsewhere.\u000a      The BL collaborated with the\u000a      project, its curators assisting in identifying and clarifying the\u000a      provenance of recordings. Between\u000a      September 2012 and April 2013, Hendy conducted fieldwork in France,\u000a      Orkney, the USA, Ghana,\u000a      Italy, Turkey, Greece, Belgium, England and Scotland. This included\u000a      testing\/recording the acoustic\u000a      properties of sites (e.g. Neolithic monuments, ancient Greek theatre).\u000a      Book chapters and preliminary\u000a      radio scripts were completed by February 2013. Some further location\u000a      recording and research into\u000a      sound archives took place during March\/April as the series was\u000a      transmitted. In May 2013 the series\u000a      was made permanently available globally as a download on iTunes and the\u000a      process of depositing\u000a      field-recordings with the British Library was begun.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"27143","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Mowlabocus' research has informed and changed the approaches to the\u000d\u000a      health promotion of\u000d\u000a      beneficiaries, including the Terrence Higgins Trust (THT), the UK's\u000d\u000a      largest HIV prevention charity.\u000d\u000a      Through THT, the broader community of gay \/ bisexual \/ MSM service-users\u000d\u000a      have also benefited.\u000d\u000a      In particular, Mowlabocus' research has directly fed into the shaping of\u000d\u000a      THT Brighton's policy on\u000d\u000a      addressing bareback pornography &#8212; and bareback sex &#8212; during health\u000d\u000a      promotion outreach and\u000d\u000a      online intervention work, and has led to the creation of an information\u000d\u000a      website and intervention\u000d\u000a      toolkit (launched in April of this year), which is being used in the\u000d\u000a      charity's training of health\u000d\u000a      promotion workers across its 31 regional offices.

It's been invaluable, really' [see Section\u000d\u000a      5, C1].\u000d\u000a    The pathway to this research impact was as follows. In May 2010,\u000d\u000a      Mowlabocus organised a\u000d\u000a      dissemination and knowledge exchange workshop timed to coincide with the\u000d\u000a      publication of his\u000d\u000a      research monograph Gaydar Culture &#8212; which was already receiving\u000d\u000a      national notice and reviews.\u000d\u000a      This was attended by healthcare professionals, including individuals from\u000d\u000a      the NHS, the Terrence\u000d\u000a      Higgins Trust and UNISEX. Following this event, in December 2010 THT\u000d\u000a      invited Mowlabocus to\u000d\u000a      develop a new research project in partnership with them &#8212; Porn Laid Bare.\u000d\u000a      This built on the\u000d\u000a      approach to focus groups used in, as well as findings identified by, Gaydar\u000d\u000a        Culture. PLB was\u000d\u000a      funded via a Big Lottery Grant awarded to THT for its on-going Informed\u000d\u000a        Passions research project\u000d\u000a      (2010-2014). Empirical research was undertaken between April and October\u000d\u000a      2011.\u000d\u000a    Project findings were shared with health promotion experts and clinicians\u000d\u000a      from statutory and non-statutory\u000d\u000a      services at a workshop in Brighton on 31 July 2012, which provided an\u000d\u000a      opportunity to\u000d\u000a      respond to the research and develop a new set of approaches to new and\u000d\u000a      existing health\u000d\u000a      promotion work. Drawing on Mowlabocus' research findings that, despite\u000d\u000a      their difficulty in\u000d\u000a      articulating their feelings and attitudes towards (and desires for)\u000d\u000a      bareback pornography and\u000d\u000a      bareback sex, gay men\/MSMs are watching bareback pornography and report\u000d\u000a      both enjoying and\u000d\u000a      having concerns about it, the stakeholders recommended that:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      discussions of bareback pornography need to take place during health\u000d\u000a        interventions;\u000d\u000a      it needs to be acknowledged that all porn (but especially bareback\u000d\u000a        porn) is an ordinary part of\u000d\u000a        many gay men's lives;\u000d\u000a      the popularity of bareback pornography among gay men could be used to\u000d\u000a        open up valuable\u000d\u000a        space for discussions around motivations for having Unprotected Anal\u000d\u000a        Intercourse (UAI) and\u000d\u000a        safer sex, offering the potential to open up discussions and behavioural\u000d\u000a        change work around\u000d\u000a        UAI.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Some stakeholders began to put some of these findings into practice\u000d\u000a      immediately &#8212; notably to\u000d\u000a      open up informal, supportive and non-judgemental discursive spaces in\u000d\u000a      which service-users can\u000d\u000a      articulate their desires for, concerns about and questions regarding the\u000d\u000a      consumption of bareback\u000d\u000a      pornography in order to enable them to mitigate unsafe behaviours. For\u000d\u000a      example, Mike Jones,\u000d\u000a      Sexual Health Advisor at the Claude Nicol Centre (Sexual Health) and\u000d\u000a      Lawson Unit (HIV),\u000d\u000a      Outpatients, Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton, has testified that,\u000d\u000a      since his attendance at the\u000d\u000a      PLB stakeholders' workshop, a new clinic &#8212; Clinic M &#8212; had been set up at\u000d\u000a      his centre to enact\u000d\u000a      changes around non-judgmental questioning and the expectation that MSMs\u000d\u000a      are using bareback\u000d\u000a      pornography. His view is that interventions had been transformed by\u000d\u000a      involvement in PLB research\u000d\u000a      and he cited numbers of clients (10k through-put over 12 months) as well\u000d\u000a      as NHS professionals\u000d\u000a      (i.e. the entire Brighton clinic) for whom the service had potentially\u000d\u000a      been transformed over the last\u000d\u000a      12 months, as a result of the symposium, by using a style of intervention\u000d\u000a      concretised in the PLB\u000d\u000a      toolkit. His colleague at the clinic, Dr Daniel Richardson, Consultant in\u000d\u000a      HIV\/GUM, Brighton NHS\u000d\u000a      Trust, has also testified as to how his practice had concretely changed as\u000d\u000a      a result of engagement\u000d\u000a      with PLB (he cited interventions he had made in clinical settings\u000d\u000a      specifically around bareback porn &#8212; as\u000d\u000a      a result of attending the PLB stakeholders' workshop [C2]).\u000d\u000a    In addition, Mowlabocus' findings were cascaded into PLB's development of\u000d\u000a      a `bareback\u000d\u000a      intervention toolkit' &#8212; a set of questions and guidance notes to\u000d\u000a      facilitate discussions about porn\u000d\u000a      consumption and the viewing of bareback pornography, hosted on the PLB\u000d\u000a      project website, and\u000d\u000a      freely available to sexual health and LGBT community organisations, and\u000d\u000a      others. This toolbox,\u000d\u000a      which went live in April 2013, provides practical advice and\u000d\u000a      recommendations on how to engage\u000d\u000a      service-users in discussions and behaviour-change interventions that focus\u000d\u000a      on identifying and\u000d\u000a      addressing the challenges posed by pornography in the context of reducing\u000d\u000a      incidences of\u000d\u000a      unprotected sexual activity. The research is thus effecting changes in the\u000d\u000a      way health practitioners\u000d\u000a      approach their intervention methods and engagement with clients.

This finding suggests that\u000d\u000a      conventional health\u000d\u000a      education methods are either failing to address sections of the community\u000d\u000a      the most at risk of sero-converting\u000d\u000a      or are failing to have the desired result of effecting positive changes in\u000d\u000a      sexual\u000d\u000a      behaviour. Meanwhile, in its 2011 publication Making it Count 4,\u000d\u000a      HPE (formerly the CHAPS\u000d\u000a      partnership), the national HIV prevention programme for England,\u000d\u000a      identified a series of strategic\u000d\u000a      objectives, including pledges to a) investigate whose opinions gay and\u000d\u000a      bisexual men regard the\u000d\u000a      most highly, and b) act to encourage those people to express positive\u000d\u000a      attitudes towards not\u000d\u000a      transmitting HIV infection \/ remaining uninfected.\u000d\u000a    In this context, since 2006, Mowlabocus has researched the use of digital\u000d\u000a      media technologies by\u000d\u000a      gay and bisexual men in their negotiation of sexual identities and\u000d\u000a      practices. His key research\u000d\u000a      methodology is based on the textual analysis of a corpus of digital sexual\u000d\u000a      material (including\u000d\u000a      pornography and sexual social-media use), in order to identify common\u000d\u000a      themes, generic\u000d\u000a      conventions and sexual `markers'. These underpin the development of\u000d\u000a      interview questions about\u000d\u000a      sexual identities and practices, in relation to this material, that are\u000d\u000a      subsequently tested using pilot\u000d\u000a      groups with external moderators and, once refined, employed in focus\u000d\u000a      groups whose participants\u000d\u000a      are recruited using on- and offline methods.

In so\u000d\u000a        doing, it has articulated\u000d\u000a        the need for sexual health promotion both to acknowledge digital\u000d\u000a        subcultures and to incorporate\u000d\u000a        web-based and social media platforms within intervention strategies.\u000d\u000a      It has identified the challenges that gay and bisexual men and MSM\u000d\u000a        face in reporting unsafe\u000d\u000a        sexual preferences and desires within clinical and outreach settings.\u000d\u000a        The research points (i) to\u000d\u000a        the difficulties such men have in articulating desires that run counter\u000d\u000a        to their understandings of\u000d\u000a        how to have safe sex and the (self-)censoring that occurs within health\u000d\u000a        promotion and other\u000d\u000a        subcultural contexts, and (ii) to the consequences of those\u000d\u000a        difficulties.\u000d\u000a      It has identified the role that pornographic imagery plays within the\u000d\u000a        lives of gay and bisexual\u000d\u000a        men and MSM and the challenges that the recent rise of `bareback'\u000d\u000a        pornography (imagery that\u000d\u000a        does not include condom use) poses to men who are negotiating sexual\u000d\u000a        desires and healthy\u000d\u000a        sexual practices that may well be mutually exclusive.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"27161","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The `Sisterhood and After' research has succeeded in enriching public\u000a      appreciation and understanding of post-1968 feminism in the following\u000a      ways:\u000a    \u000a      It led directly to the production of a new, public, digital and\u000a        searchable archive of personal voices about the WLM held at the BL Sound\u000a        Archive, with two public, multi-media gateways, both of which drew on\u000a        the team's practice-based research: an extensive schools-facing website\u000a        (online at: http:\/\/bl.uk\/sisterhood),\u000a        permanently hosted by the BL's Learning Programme, which provides 10\u000a        detailed but accessible narratives to trace campaigns and debates; and\u000a        the online short films produced\/directed by Thynne.

Russell also shared the research at a\u000a        BL Teachers' Forum in London on 6 July 2013 for secondary-school English\u000a        teachers, after which attendee Anne Turvey wrote that `I know I speak\u000a        for so many people.

It is important to the Oral History\u000a        Society and public historians in general, to see these kinds of\u000a        academic-activist partnerships flourish. I can see the project impacting\u000a        on popular historical understandings of the period as well as the\u000a        history of gender relations, but also acting as an encouragement to\u000a        younger generations of feminists and activists who themselves want to\u000a        explore oral history.'\u000a      Feminist Archive South re-used materials from the SAA in their\u000a        Heritage Lottery-funded community history project to catalogue Bristol\u000a        WLM activist Ellen Malos' archives.\u000a      BL Curator Polly Russell has argued of Jolly's contribution to SAA\u000a        that it `complicate[s] the stereotypes around feminist history and\u000a        feminist stories. ...

Motivated by a sense of urgency (WLM activists are mostly now in\u000a      their 60s and 70s), SAA aimed to produce this history in the form of a\u000a      professionally sustained and accessible archive collection and subsequent\u000a      monograph in order to reveal, to as wide an audience as possible, the\u000a      conditions of gender relations in late twentieth- century Britain, and the\u000a      strategies women used to improve them.\u000a    Building on expertise developed at the University of Sussex's Centre for\u000a      Life History and Life Writing Research (CLHLWR, 1999-present), oral\u000a      history interviews with 60 activists were chosen as a practice-based\u000a      method for capturing and analysing memories of the WLM, and to cover a\u000a      wide range of campaigns and perspectives. In these (on average)\u000a      seven-hour-long interviews, participants were asked about their role in\u000a      campaigns and ideas, their own experiments with personal and political\u000a      relationships, their experiences of adolescence, bodily life and identity,\u000a      their views on the diversity of movements across and within the four\u000a      nations of the UK, and how their lives compared with those of their\u000a      mothers. Further biographical material was collected. Interviewees could\u000a      correct and amplify the transcripts and summaries produced of their audio\u000a      recordings.\u000a    As well as interviewee selection and documentation, Jolly &#8212; Director of\u000a      CLHLWR and a leading specialist in feminist history [Section 3, R4].&#8212;\u000a      undertook a third of the interviews. Research Fellow Cohen carried out\u000a      most of the rest. As PI, Jolly worked closely with Polly Russell, SAA's\u000a      curator at the BL (2005-present), to conceptualise the BL collection and\u000a      presentation of material, and planned outreach activities. SAA's archive\u000a      also includes 10 short films, dramatising particular campaigns based on\u000a      the audio interview research. These were produced and directed by Thynne.\u000a    Taken as individual recordings, the SAA interviews constitute deep\u000a      biographies that shed light on the circumstances and consequences of a\u000a      person's activism. Taken together as a history, the collection\u000a      documents the emergence, development and structure of the WLM, revealing a\u000a      greater range of networks, political positions and campaigns than\u000a      previously acknowledged. The researchers identified 10 core narratives,\u000a      evident across the interviews, about women's rights movements during the\u000a      1970s and 1980s and further sourced supporting archival and visual\u000a      materials that would help to illustrate these narratives for a public\u000a      audience. The project's research publications have further elucidated the\u000a      biographical consequences of activism, enabling greater understanding of\u000a      its impact on the many individuals who became life-long activists. SAA has\u000a      also made a contribution to cultural-memory research, showing how gender\u000a      relations can be different and better, and how oral history projects can\u000a      be part of a process of feminist influence that goes beyond the more\u000a      measurable aspects of campaigns. The team's analysis of methodologies and\u000a      findings, presented in public as well as in academic conferences and\u000a      publications, offers guidance to future scholars &#8212; including community\u000a      historians beyond academia &#8212; struggling with issues of representativeness\u000a      and oral history practice [R2].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"27271","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Much of the impact of O'Neill's research develops from the continuing,\u000d\u000a      but diffuse impact\u000d\u000a      concerning news values, in relation to both Journalism education and wider\u000d\u000a      public discourses\u000d\u000a      around news media diversity.

This has had secondary impacts on the charitable\u000d      organisations that Trinity Vision work with, in that the organisations\u000d      gained a higher quality promotional film or documentary. Roberts has also\u000d      engaged the general public in his research through his involvement in a\u000d      local film club (for young people) and a project with the University of\u000d      the Third Age (U3A). The full impact of Roberts' Malentendu pieces\u000d      has not yet been realised but through his development of more sympathetic\u000d      dubbing techniques, an opportunity is created to make international\u000d      culture available to monolingual audiences. Each of these impacts are now\u000d      described in turn.\u000d    Trinity Vision have made use of Roberts' research into production\u000d      practice through their work with numerous charities and community groups\u000d      producing various promotional films and documentaries. This service is\u000d      provided to such organisations for free and is funded by Trinity Vision's\u000d      work with for-profit companies. In the process of making such films,\u000d      Trinity Vision drew on Roberts' research on theorising and reflecting on\u000d      practice. This has resulted in a more rigorous and self-reflexive approach\u000d      to production, production management and relations with external clients.\u000d      The following examples are organisations that have benefited from this\u000d      different approach used by Trinity Vision. A substantial project was\u000d      undertaken with Washburn Heritage Centre, an organisation funded by the\u000d      Heritage Lottery Fund, which seeks to support and preserve the history of\u000d      the Washburn Valley (North Yorkshire). This project (begun in 2010 and\u000d      ongoing) recorded oral history from local residents, focusing on\u000d      agricultural history and World War II. Memories captured on film were used\u000d      by the heritage centre in subsequent exhibitions and archived for the\u000d      future. Trinity Vision provided training to residents in handling the\u000d      camera equipment. The final video was then edited and produced on a DVD by\u000d      Trinity Vision.\u000d    A further project involved working with the Positive Lifestyle Centre,\u000d      Bradford, producing two promotional videos for the organisation. The\u000d      Positive Lifestyle Centre are an educational service that provide personal\u000d      development sessions for schoolchildren, situated at the Bradford City\u000d      Football ground. School groups come to visit the ground and then\u000d      participate in sessions such as self-esteem, drug awareness, and healthy\u000d      eating. The centre is a charitable organisation that relies on community\u000d      funding to provide their services. Trinity Vision produced two promotional\u000d      films for the organisation that were then used to advertise their services\u000d      and attract funding (April-May 2013).\u000d    Trinity Vision have also worked with the Irish Arts Foundation, an\u000d      organisation based in Leeds that promotes the music and arts of Ireland\u000d      throughout Britain, providing access and participation in traditional\u000d      Irish culture. As part of their work, the Irish Arts Foundation held a\u000d      concert with four of Ireland's top musicians performing. Trinity Vision\u000d      filmed this concert and interviewed people involved, asking them about\u000d      their background and the importance of preserving Irish culture (Summer\u000d      2011).\u000d    Trinity Vision have had a more sustained involvement with the Leeds\u000d      Fashion Show (a not for profit organisation supporting people to bridge\u000d      the gap between education and the fashion industry) and the Leeds Chinese\u000d      Community Association. Trinity Vision have filmed annual events for each\u000d      organisation, a fashion show and Chinese new year celebrations\u000d      respectively, since 2010.\u000d    In line with the unit's approach to impact during the REF assessment\u000d      period, Roberts has engaged with particular groups of the public based on\u000d      his research into production processes and resulting production outputs.\u000d      He was instrumental in setting up and running a film-making club (October\u000d      2011 &#8212; July 2012) at Fulneck School, Leeds. This ran parallel to his\u000d      research at Leeds Trinity in production techniques. Though the number of\u000d      students involved varied, there were frequently around 30 involved. As a\u000d      consequence, different groups of students were inspired to shoot their own\u000d      short videos (including their views of the school, fund raising events and\u000d      an end of year all-day celebration event) and Sixth formers produced a\u000d      video about the attractions of post-16 study at the school which was used\u000d      as a marketing tool at an open evening for prospective students and their\u000d      parents. Roberts utilized his research via teacher and peer-led discussion\u000d      to inform and shape the production process and how it can be developed.\u000d    Roberts further engaged with the public through his involvement in the\u000d      University of the Third Age (U3A), where he acted as advisor on the `A\u000d      Planet in Crisis' project from January to July 2013. U3A is a registered\u000d      charity that provides educational, creative and leisure opportunities for\u000d      people no longer in full-time employment. The organisation is based on\u000d      reciprocal principles of `the teachers learn and the learners teach'. It\u000d      is entirely run by volunteers and so welcomes support and research\u000d      contributions. The `A Planet in Crisis' project sought to explore the\u000d      issue of climate change and opinion formation. As part of the project, 64\u000d      members of U3A were surveyed on their attitudes to climate change and\u000d      perceptions of opinion shaping. A further 20 members were then engaged in\u000d      one-to-one interviews which explored in more depth how attitudes are\u000d      formed and influenced. Roberts contributed advice regarding the structure\u000d      of the project, questionnaire and focus group design. In July 2013, the\u000d      culmination of Phase 1 of the project (which will continue in 2014)\u000d      Roberts was invited to provide the keynote speech and was the plenary\u000d      contributor to a one day seminar on climate change and opinion formation\u000d      hosted at U3A, Cambridge. Roberts' keynote was based on his research into\u000d      the use of the mass media to shape public opinion (in this case around the\u000d      issue of `climate change', with particular reference to how specific\u000d      production practices produce specific production results). It was\u000d      delivered in an accessible way to an interested but non-specialist\u000d      audience. The seminar was attended by 45 people (audience numbers were\u000d      limited by the room capacity, many more members applied to attend). The\u000d      project co-ordinator has received several positive e-mails and is now\u000d      planning a follow-up event: `Influence your family and neighbours to\u000d      forsake consumption and take on sustainability'. Roberts will be involved\u000d      as media\/production mentor (building on the research findings of outputs 1\u000d      and 2 above). In particular Roberts' continuing involvement centres on\u000d      mentoring the project team and engaging with participants to reflect on\u000d      how the nature of production shapes the product we consume. In addition\u000d      (to build on the filming of the workshop\/seminar) Roberts continues to\u000d      engage in strategies to involve previously excluded groups.\u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    Research produced within the Media, Film and Culture team at Leeds\u000d      Trinity University has led to an impact on production processes and film\u000d      education.

The Centre for Creative Media would build on\u000d      existing research within the Media, Film and Culture team into visual\u000d      culture and cultural practices and seek to particularly explore the\u000d      relationship between research, practice and practice-based research.\u000d    The key researcher involved in this case study is Professor Graham Roberts\u000d    (Visiting Lecturer, Jan 2011 &#8212; Sept 2011; Lecturer, Oct 2011 &#8212; Nov 2012;\u000d    Director of Media, Film and Culture, Nov 2012 &#8212; present). Roberts' research\u000d    focuses on the broad area of `production studies' particularly from the\u000d    position of participant\/observer. Roberts is currently involved in the\u000d    on-going research project `International Cinemas' with the Institute of\u000d    Communications Studies, University of Leeds. This project explores new forms\u000d    of practice linked to the opportunities presented by digital production,\u000d    with a particular focus on:\u000d    a) how we can write\/shoot and produce films more predisposed to\u000d      cross-national distribution;\u000d    b) new technological opportunities in independent distribution\/exhibition\u000d      as well as production.\u000d    This group have focused on the effective use of subtitling and dubbing,\u000d      and have recently started work on a long-term research\/teaching project\u000d      looking at the use of digital stills cameras for digital `film-making'.\u000d      This work will result in written and filmed outputs for the next REF.\u000d      Roberts is currently working (as co-lead and executive producer) with\u000d      colleagues in an international consortium consisting of the University of\u000d      Bologna; Department of Italian, University of Durham; and the Calandra\u000d      Institute in New York and Kent State University (USA). This is led by\u000d      Delia Chiaro, Professor of English Language and Translation (University of\u000d      Bologna). The aim of the project is to dub (as opposed to subtitle) an\u000d      Italian screen product and test the dubbed series on English speaking\u000d      audiences. Focus group work conducted by Roberts has shown that audiences\u000d      express an emotional rejection of any `dubbing', yet they are averse to\u000d      attending subtitled films. This project, directly inspired by the work of\u000d      the Leeds group (International Cinemas), has twin research aims:\u000d    a) increase the prospect of facilitating audience reception to dubbing;\u000d    b) create a more visual, less verbally driven, even more cinematic\u000d      medium.\u000d    This research has led to research output 1 listed in section 3.\u000d    Roberts' research has also taken a more technologically driven focus on\u000d      production, exploring the relationship between the human `producers' and\u000d      the technology (becoming) available for production and distribution. This\u000d      research has resulted in creative outputs (both fiction and documentary\u000d      productions) produced by Endgame Pictures (an independent film company\u000d      dedicated to making documentaries and features in a digital environment)\u000d      (e.g. output 1). As a result of his practice-based research, Roberts has\u000d      come to question the `black box' of film production. Reflecting on his own\u000d      experience in production and drawing on the theoretical perspectives of\u000d      several scholars, Roberts has argued for the formalisation of the\u000d      discipline `production studies' (see output 2 listed in section 3). This\u000d      would involve taking a perspective from within the production itself,\u000d      analysing and theorising cinema as a creative industry from within,\u000d      utilising the tools of the social sciences.\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"27423","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3489940","Name":"Jamaica"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"149590","Name":"Tanzania"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact in areas of civil society and cultural life is evident in\u000a      Bakari's input to: education and\u000a      training; cultural policy; archiving, and through engagement with a\u000a      variety of audiences.\u000a    Under Bakari's directorship ZIFF addressed the problems of networks and\u000a      co-operation as a\u000a      strategy for film-making and cultural development. African Tales\u000a      as a project offered a model for\u000a      professional film training, with related educational workshops having an\u000a      impact on the production\u000a      and distribution of films in Africa, and on the audio-visual culture and\u000a      social life of the region. There\u000a      has also been impact on European perception of the diversity of film\u000a      culture [ref. 5.1].\u000a    Furthermore, Bakari's research on the creative industries in Tanzania has\u000a      had an impact on\u000a      cultural policy in relation to sustainable development in Africa. It was\u000a      used as the basis of Erick\u000a      Kajiru's paper for the UNESCO National Commission, `The potential of the\u000a      Culture Sector to\u000a      contribute to National Economy and Development in Tanzania' (2010) [ref.\u000a      5.2], whilst Bakari's\u000a      Culture and Creative Industries in Tanzania: A Plan for Strategic Action\u000a      (2012) [ref. 5.3] was\u000a      commissioned by UNESCO in conjunction with the Tanzania Ministry of\u000a      Information, Youth,\u000a      Culture and Sport. The Plan for Strategic Action has been accepted by\u000a      UNESCO as a blueprint for\u000a      its ongoing work with the Tanzania government in the culture sector. These\u000a      studies formed the\u000a      basis for Bakari's subsequent intervention at the 2nd African Creative\u000a      Economy Conference (2012)\u000a      organised by the Arterial Network, a formally-constituted African network\u000a      of creative industry\u000a      companies, artists, institutions and non-government organisations\u000a      advocating the cultural\u000a      dimension of development [ref. 5.4].\u000a    As Bakari argues in his 2007 article `Colonialism and Modern Lives in\u000a      African Cinema', projects\u000a      such as African Tales and Big City Stories can aid the\u000a      process of social transformation as they\u000a      unite communities and encourage dialogue about cultural identities through\u000a      the medium of film.\u000a      Bakari increased public access to London's screen heritage through\u000a      screenings and linked training\u000a      and educational projects [ref. 5.5]. In the case of Big City Stories\u000a      the initiative was specifically\u000a      designed to identify curatorial talent amongst the Black community, and\u000a      included a\u000a      mentoring\/trainee component directed by the curators. Launched at the\u000a      Ritzy Picture House on 26\u000a      March 2011 as part of the cinema's 150th anniversary celebrations, Big\u000a        City Stories has\u000a      subsequently been screened at the British Film Institute (12 April 2011)\u000a      and the Bargehouse (23-25\u000a      September 2011) on London's South Bank, to a combined audience of 435\u000a      people. In October\u000a      2011 Big City Stories was selected as one of only two films to be\u000a      shown as part of The Gate\u000a      Cinema's Schools Education Screenings to celebrate Black History Month's\u000a      theme of Dreams and\u000a      Aspirations [ref. 5.6]. A total of 500 year five and six (Key Stage 2)\u000a      pupils from London attended\u000a      the screenings, which were supplemented with teaching resource packs and\u000a      pre-screening\u000a      discussions led by cine-literary educators and storytellers. Additional\u000a      screenings as part of Black\u000a      History Month included those at Bruce Castle Museum, Haringey (24 October\u000a      2011) and St\u000a      Mungo's homeless shelter, Hammersmith (28 October 2011), to a combined\u000a      audience of 65. Big\u000a      City Stories has also been shown at a number of prestigious international\u000a      film festivals, including\u000a      the Brighton Legacy Film Festival (30 October 2011) [ref. 5.7] and the\u000a      Hastings Festival (22\u000a      October 2011) to a combined audience of 80. The cinema chain Picture House\u000a      programmed the\u000a      title for two of its weekly Reminiscence Screenings and on 9 May 2011, 59\u000a      people saw Big City\u000a        Stories at Greenwich Picturehouse, with 42 in attendance at Brixton\u000a      Picturehouse on 17 May 2011.\u000a      Photographic documentation of the events' wide audience constituency can\u000a      be found at the\u000a      project's website: http:\/\/www.blacklondonfilmheritage.org\/gallery.php.\u000a    Comments on Big City Stories' Facebook page mention feelings of\u000a      pride and an increased sense\u000a      of community from having witnessed the film compilation [ref. 5.8]. This\u000a      is further supported by the\u000a      project's evaluation report which states that interest in regional and\u000a      local heritage and awareness\u000a      of other cultures and lifestyles had been enhanced as a result of\u000a      attending a Big City Stories\u000a      screening. The report also explains that a knock-on effect of the\u000a      screenings has been the increase\u000a      in interest in the use of museums, libraries and archival material and\u000a      that for 65% of attendees this\u000a      was their first experience of participating in such an event. 100% of\u000a      respondents indicated an\u000a      interest in seeking out a similar event in the future and also stated that\u000a      they would recommend\u000a      such an event to others. Of those questioned 78% said that attending the\u000a      screening had enhanced\u000a      their knowledge of the topic [ref. 5.9].\u000a    Featured in The South London Press (8 April 2011), Big City Stories\u000a      also attracted international\u000a      attention from Jamaican newspaper The Gleaner (22 May 2011) and television\u000a      channel VOX Africa\u000a      (7 April 2011) &#8212; the first pan-African TV channel - due to its important\u000a      role in re-appropriating and\u000a      celebrating lost Black histories. Airwave coverage was provided by\u000a      London-based licensed radio\u000a      stations Voice of Africa (30 November 2011) and Colourful Radio (23 April\u000a      2011) [refs 10-13].\u000a    An important aspect of the Big City Stories project is providing\u000a      a legacy for future research in the\u000a      field, thus encouraging the wider programming of similar films using this\u000a      under-resourced area of\u000a      London's film heritage. Big City Stories is currently held at the\u000a      London Screen Archives and\u000a      Birkbeck College Archives and has been made available for non-commercial\u000a      use by community\u000a      groups, film societies and for educational projects, reaching as wide an\u000a      audience as possible. Big\u000a        City Stories provided the basis for Bakari's invited contributions\u000a      to the Africa in the Picture film\u000a      festival (Amsterdam, 2012) and the Runnymede Trust's Generation 3.0\u000a      initiative (2012) to `end\u000a      racism within a generation.' The annual Africa in the Picture film\u000a      festival increases the social and\u000a      cultural visibility of African stories, whilst the Generation 3.0 project\u000a      provides a public forum for\u000a      debates about British identity and changing attitudes towards race\u000a      equality [ref. 5.14].\u000a    Bakari's research on the representation of African Caribbean people in\u000a      cinema has thus had\u000a      impact in the areas of civil society and cultural life (in Tanzania and\u000a      London in particular),\u000a      evidenced through his involvement in professional film training, curation\u000a      and educational\u000a      workshops; screenings and public discussions, and input to policy showing\u000a      how creative industries\u000a      can aid social cohesion by encouraging public debate and being part of a\u000a      productive creative\u000a      economy.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Imruh Bakari's film projects such as African Tales (2005\/2008)\u000a      and Big City Stories (2011) have\u000a      had impact in the areas of civil society and cultural life, specifically\u000a      in illuminating social and\u000a      cultural assumptions (of audiences of audio-visual culture in Africa and\u000a      the UK) about\u000a      contemporary Tanzania and Black London.\u000a    The impact of Bakari's research focusing on African and Caribbean\u000a      cinemas, and related subjects\u000a      in cultural studies, also extends into areas of policy making, education,\u000a      and training surrounding\u000a      film production and distribution in Africa and Europe. This is evident\u000a      through public engagement\u000a      (with film industry professionals, younger audiences, and the wider\u000a      public) and archiving, and\u000a      through engagement with policy initiatives for the creative industries\u000a      sector in Tanzania.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    University of Winchester\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Winchester (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Winchester","PeerGroup":"F","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10003614}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2759794","Name":"Amsterdam"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

His research into cinema and\u000a      development, in both\u000a      African and UK contexts, has contributed to a revaluation of the\u000a      production and distribution policies\u000a      around film in Africa (Tanzania in particular). At the same time, his\u000a      theoretical investigation and\u000a      contextual understanding of the filmic representation of African lives\u000a      (including diasporic\u000a      communities), has been translated into film projects which challenge\u000a      Eurocentric notions of African\u000a      cinema.\u000a    Bakari's research into the experience of film-making across Africa, and\u000a      collation of historical\u000a      documents and contemporary testimonies [ref. 3.1], has raised critical\u000a      awareness of the visibility of\u000a      African cinema (a 2007 interview with Bakari is cited by Jane Bryce in Viewing\u000a        African Cinema in\u000a        the Twenty-First Century, 2010). This insight &#8212; of the need for such\u000a      historical research into practice\u000a      &#8212; shaped Bakari's research into the issues surrounding the representation\u000a      of African cultures on\u000a      film [ref. 3.3].\u000a    From 1999-2004 Bakari held the position of Festival Director for the\u000a      Zanzibar International Film\u000a      Festival (ZIFF) which was established as the centrepiece of a wider annual\u000a      festival of the arts and\u000a      cultures of Africa and its Indian Ocean proximities: the Festival of the\u000a      Dhow Countries. With\u000a      cinema as the focus, part of Bakari's research into the creative\u000a      industries involved the\u000a      development, script editing and production of African Tales\u000a      (2005\/2008) as a showcase for new\u000a      directors and writers. This series of short films was awarded the ZIFF\u000a      Special Juror's Choice prize\u000a      in 2009. African Tales received funding from seven different\u000a      sources including G&#246;teborg\u000a      International Film Festival Fund; the British Council (Tanzania); Tanzania\u000a      Culture Trust Fund, and\u000a      Fonds Images Afrique. The Tales, or vignettes of contemporary\u000a      Tanzanian life, illustrate different\u000a      ways in which `headline' problems are lived out in everyday situations, as\u000a      well as providing a\u000a      benchmark for film industry training and professionalism. The project\u000a      exemplifies Bakari's research\u000a      into the function of the creative industries: in his article for Screen\u000a      [ref. 3.4] he concludes that `the\u000a      function of...African filmmakers may be contemplated in terms of their\u000a      relevance to the process of\u000a      much desired social transformation of the continent.' This conclusion has\u000a      underpinned research\u000a      work within the wider context of the creative industries, such as the\u000a      study Creative Industries: A\u000a        Tanzanian Future (2009), commissioned by UNESCO, the European\u000a      Commission Tanzania and\u000a      the British Council Tanzania [ref. 3.7].\u000a    The role of film in helping to achieve social cohesion (this time in the\u000a      context of London) is also\u000a      addressed by Big City Stories (2011). In 2011 Bakari received\u000a      &#163;17,000 from the Digital Film\u000a      Archive Fund to co-curate (with June Givanni) the Black London Film\u000a      Heritage Project. &#163;2,202 of\u000a      additional funding came from Film London. As the first product of\u000a      the project, Big City Stories is an\u000a      80 minute compilation film which uses archive material (early footage and\u000a      film by Black filmmakers\u000a      in England) to expose audiences to the untold Black histories of London,\u000a      focusing on the African\u000a      Caribbean experience from 1911-1990s. Promoting the diverse and\u000a      cosmopolitan history of areas\u000a      such as Brixton and Notting Hill, Big City Stories encourages\u000a      audiences to connect with lesser-known\u000a      aspects of London's history and includes inter-titles to provide viewers\u000a      with contextual\u000a      information. Big City Stories builds upon Bakari's chapter in Black\u000a        British Culture and Society [ref.\u000a      3.2], which `engages some of the thematic and political challenges of the\u000a      1980s' (7). Suggesting\u000a      the need for new approaches regarding the discussion of Black British\u000a      cinema, defined in the\u000a      1980s as `within the parameters of the institutionalized discourse on race\u000a      relations', Bakari\u000a      deconstructs the dominant concept of `diaspora' and outlines significant\u000a      traditions of\u000a      independence. Big City Stories applies his theory, challenging\u000a      existing perceptions and histories\u000a      whilst helping to counter inappropriate or forgotten narratives. It also\u000a      provides a basis for future\u000a      research and engagement with debates about cultural identities across a\u000a      changing Europe.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"27427","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Science and Technology Facilities Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Overview\u000d\u000a      Cheshire 3 has had high impact because its development has been guided by\u000d\u000a      rich 2-way interactions with different networks of potential\u000d\u000a      beneficiaries. The beneficiaries include the bodies that provide national\u000d\u000a      data infrastructures, data users, and equipment vendors. Our interactions\u000d\u000a      with them increase the reach and the significance of the impact in 3 ways:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The interactions have ensured that Cheshire 3 is useful. Its\u000d\u000a        development has been guided by the needs of potential users. It supports\u000d\u000a        the latest policies, methods and practices for the analysis and sharing\u000d\u000a        of data and its technologies are closely integrated with the latest data\u000d\u000a        management technologies.\u000d\u000a      The interactions ensure that public and private bodies that provide\u000d\u000a        data infrastructures are aware of and understand the advantages of\u000d\u000a        Cheshire 3.\u000d\u000a      The interactions ensure that data users know that Cheshire 3 provides\u000d\u000a        the kinds of enhanced capabilities that they need in order to archive\u000d\u000a        their data reliably and to extract value from it.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Interactions leading to Impact\u000d\u000a      Our interactions with providers of national data infrastructure\u000d\u000a      include long-term collaboration with teams internationally responding to\u000d\u000a      needs assessment and requirements analysis; integration with other\u000d\u000a      projects already involved with \"big data\" management and analytics areas;\u000d\u000a      and long-term involvement with standards working groups and\u000d\u000a      implementation of the software at STFC for the Virtual Engineering Centre\u000d\u000a      at Daresbury. In 2009 the software was demonstrated to 13 Federal Agencies\u000d\u000a      as a primary technology, which resulted in the formation of the DataNet\u000d\u000a      Federation Consortium (DFC). This demonstration also formed the basis of\u000d\u000a      the SHAMAN\u000d\u000a        Integrated Project prototype (2008-2012), which served to integrate\u000d\u000a      the Cheshire system with the iRODS adaptive middleware, thus supporting\u000d\u000a      long-term curation and analysis of archived data.\u000d\u000a    Our interactions with data users include participation in groups\u000d\u000a      working to develop social consensus for the analysis and sharing of data,\u000d\u000a      policies, methods, and practice; and the interoperability mechanisms to\u000d\u000a      support technology integration and data analysis. This has involved\u000d\u000a      sustained interaction with emerging networks of expertise across digital\u000d\u000a      curation projects.\u000d\u000a    Our interactions with equipment vendors include discussions with\u000d\u000a      NetApp about the possible adoption of the software for storage devices,\u000d\u000a      working with corporate developers in London; employment of software\u000d\u000a      developers across SME (Archive Analytics, SpaceApps) to provide services\u000d\u000a      and support throughout the EU; use of the software by value added\u000d\u000a      resellers.\u000d\u000a    1) Impact on National Data Infrastructures\u000d\u000a      The software was developed at Liverpool and partly\u000a        funded by the NARA US National Archives as a means of supporting\u000d\u000a      long-term curation and analysis of digital data.\u000d\u000a    a. The software has supported services across multiple agencies, in the\u000d\u000a      US, including NSF, NARA, NASA, NIH, DOD, NHPRC, IMLS, and Europe,\u000d\u000a      including DOE, JISC, EU, EPSRC.\u000d\u000a    b. The software forms a foundational component of the US National Science\u000d\u000a      Foundation data infrastructure based at DataNet\u000a        Federation Consortium, for national (US) e-Science research\u000d\u000a      applications.\u000d\u000a    c. The software contributed to all of these services the ability to index\u000d\u000a      material within a data grid (cloud) and the ability to provide data\u000d\u000a      analytics workflows across active collections, across all these\u000d\u000a      organizations. Cheshire3 has provided this functionality to the DFC and\u000d\u000a      other NSF research projects that support the national data\u000d\u000a      cyberinfrastructure for NSF research projects in the United States and\u000d\u000a      which rely heavily on the extensive set of metadata that allows for the\u000d\u000a      discovery, analysis, and preservation of studies. The expanded ability of\u000d\u000a      these initiatives to federate using iRODS and Cheshire discovery services\u000d\u000a      means that scientific research datasets can be analysed and managed with\u000d\u000a      policy based rules that protect the authenticity, privacy, provenance,\u000d\u000a      context, and integrity of datasets.\u000d\u000a    d. The software is widely used on a service-oriented basis\u000d\u000a      internationally, and forms the infrastructure of multiple national digital\u000d\u000a      library services in the UK, including the\u000a        Archives Hub (JISC) (1999-present), and the\u000a        Incunabula Short Title Catalogue (British Library) (2005-present).\u000d\u000a    2) Impact on Data Users\u000d\u000a    a. The integrated software forms the basis of commercial prototypes for\u000d\u000a    AstraZeneca, Drexel, and Virtual Engineering Centre, for managing data\u000d\u000a    driven collections; and in 2012 the Virtual Engineering Centre commissioned\u000d\u000a    a prototype for use in the automotive and aerospace sectors at the Science\u000d\u000a    and Technology Facilities Council.\u000d\u000a    b. The integrated system is currently being rolled out for research\u000d\u000a      organizations, such as Sanger Institute, Science and Technology Facilities\u000d\u000a      Council (STFC), University of Edinburgh (EPCC), University of Liverpool\u000d\u000a      (N8 grid).\u000d\u000a    c. The system has been prototyped for use in managing research data for\u000d\u000a      the pharmaceutical industry (AstraZeneca) (2008-2010).\u000d\u000a    d. The research advances in distributed data analytics applied to\u000d\u000a      petascale (millions of gigabytes) collections have resulted in measurable\u000d\u000a      impact improving the analysis and management of scientific research data,\u000d\u000a      including research collaborations across different communities of\u000d\u000a      practice.\u000d\u000a    3) Impact on Equipment Developers\u000d\u000a    a. NetApp, DataDirectNetworks, and Xerox are promoting use of the system and\u000d\u000a    software for cloud appliance and managing \"big data technologies\" for\u000d\u000a    research or predictive use cases. The Business Development Manager for Cloud\u000d\u000a    Services at NetApp UK Ltd will confirm that the Cheshire technology\u000d\u000a    developed by Professor Watry's group will be embedded in upcoming NetApp\u000d\u000a    enterprise products on a commercial basis from 2014.\u000d\u000a    b. The software is driving investment within the SME communities, both in\u000d\u000a      the US and EU. The Founder and Senior Science Advisor of Bellerophon\u000d\u000a      Mobile in the United States, for example, states that \"the use of\u000d\u000a      Cheshire3 workflows to aid discovery of distributed data could contribute\u000d\u000a      greatly to effectiveness of building mobile knowledge-based systems\".\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The research improves digital data archives by embedding computation into\u000d\u000a      the storage controllers that maintain the integrity of the data within the\u000d\u000a      archive.

The ephemeral\u000a      media workshop (July 2009) held at Nottingham was especially influential\u000a      in giving the BBC a new vocabulary for how it can use and repurpose\u000a      ephemeral items from its archives and give them value as assets. Victoria\u000a      Jaye (BBC Vision) confirms that the term ephemeral media `has really got\u000a      some traction in this organization thanks to the AHRC workshop at the\u000a      University of Nottingham' (Source C p.114). Jaye explains how the\u000a      BBC has looked anew at the value of audition tapes and artefacts from its\u000a      archive, and how these can be used within the online programme pages of\u000a      the BBC. As such, the ephemeral media workshop provided a stimulus to a\u000a      senior BBC executive for thinking about how broadcast ephemera might be\u000a      utilized to offer promotional and public service value for the BBC.\u000a      According to Jaye, the `BBC has benefited from the thinking and the\u000a      language I have brought back to the organisation in terms of how we\u000a      conceive the opportunity and describe our public service role in the\u000a      digital media landscape' (Source D).\u000a    For Charlie Mawer, the Executive Creative Director of Red Bee Media with\u000a      responsibility for all creative work in the Creative Division, the\u000a      workshop provided `new references and case studies that [he] could use to\u000a      stimulate new thinking' about promotional design (Source D).\u000a      Moreover, the event led to strategic networking opportunities between\u000a      Mawer and Jaye, deepening agency\/client relations between Red Bee and the\u000a      BBC that have underpinned subsequent projects such as the TV promotion of\u000a      the BBC iPlayer (2012). The workshop enabled Jaye and Mawer to `gain\u000a      kudos' and develop `thought leadership' in their sectors, something which\u000a      has practical currency and economic value in selling market expertise (Red\u000a      Bee's Creative department brought in revenues of &#163;35 million in 2012) (Source\u000a        D). Jaye was invited to MIT and has written `presentations and\u000a      strategic documents that draw on the insights and discussions we had as\u000a      part of the ephemeral media workshop' (Source D) and Mawer has been\u000a      cited by journalists based on videocasts and a prime-time television\u000a      feature on BBC East Midlands Today (22 November 2009) that stemmed\u000a      from his plenary. The workshop generated new ways of thinking about the\u000a      role of promotional short-forms for industry beneficiaries, and these new\u000a      ways of thinking have been furthered in presentations by Johnson on\u000a      branding and the television industry to Ofcom in 2010. This knowledge has\u000a      been shared at an institutional level at Red Bee and the BBC helping to develop\u000a        relationships that have enabled media companies and professionals to\u000a        refine and sell their expertise.\u000a    In industrial terms, sustained collaboration with Red Bee Media, central\u000a      to the AHRC Follow-on award, has informed strategic business planning\u000a        and helped professionals and organizations adapt to changing cultural\u000a        values, specifically, as mentioned, the challenges of `build[ing]\u000a      bridges between content and viewers' in a multiplatform environment.\u000a      Through engagement with strategic Red Bee projects\/personnel, including 32\u000a      practitioner interviews, the research facilitated self-reflection about\u000a      disciplinary practice in the promotional screen industries. Knowledge\u000a      exchange resulted in two internal reports to Red Bee's Creative division,\u000a      the chief beneficiary being Red Bee's senior management team. According to\u000a      Red Bee's Director of Creative, responsible for the overall management of\u000a      the Creative Division, the reports have `helped us to think more deeply\u000a      about the theories and disciplines of our work in TV promotion and design\u000a      .. . and have been influential in informing our strategic business\u000a      planning' (Source A). He continues: `a further benefit of this work\u000a      has been to widen our company's awareness of academic work currently\u000a      happening in the UK with a focus on our industry . . . enriching our\u000a      understanding of our craft and influencing our thinking on new areas of\u000a      research to guide and inform our future business models' (Source A).\u000a      In this last respect, the research has catalyzed industrial-academic\u000a      collaboration in the emerging area of social television, with a `hothouse'\u000a      on the subject hosted by the University of Nottingham in September 2012\u000a      bringing together industry practitioners with academics from the major\u000a      research hubs Horizon (see above) and Research and Enterprise in Arts and\u000a      Creative Technology (REACT), funded respectively through RCUK's Digital\u000a      Economy and Creative Economy themes (for more on collaborations with both\u000a      Horizon and REACT, see REF5). This event brokered the partnership\u000a      of Red Bee, Thinkbox (the trade body for television marketing), British\u000a      Telecom and Ofcom in audience research on the multi-screen household,\u000a      funded by Horizon. As a direct result of the hothouse, one Red Bee planner\u000a      `reached out to the Heads of Research at UKTV, Channel 4 and the BBC to\u000a      discuss the possibilities of collaborating with all of them and Horizon to\u000a      help shape academic research questions that might inform future business\u000a      strategy and audience understanding' (Source B). The research has\u000a      therefore helped stimulate and shape a key collaborative project around\u000a      social TV that will continue to inform business strategy in this area.\u000a    Finally, the research has had public impact raising the visibility of\u000a        the creative and professional discipline of promotional screen design.\u000a      Specifically, Grainge\/Johnson's engagement with key practitioners led to\u000a      the presentation of promotional work and heritage at the BFI Southbank in\u000a      two panel events funded by the AHRC Follow-on Fund (28 November 2012).\u000a      These panels focused on `The Contemporary Art of TV Promotion and Design'\u000a      and `Pioneers of TV Promotion and Design' and featured the Executive\u000a      Creative Directors of Red Bee and Crystal CG, major industry figures\u000a      including Martin Lambie-Nairn and David Liddiment, and continuity\u000a      announcers and trailer-makers from the 1960s including David Hamilton and\u000a      Maurice Kanareck. Curated by Grainge\/Johnson in collaboration with the\u000a      BFI, these panels offered public audiences the opportunity to learn about\u000a      the creative process of TV and digital promotion, now and in the past, and\u000a      were both sell-out events attended by 250 people (125x2). Of the 66\u000a      feedback cards collected, 99 per cent of respondents said `the event\u000a      increased their understanding of the art of TV promotion and design' and\u000a      that they had `learnt something new about the way TV promotion and design\u000a      is created' (Source E). Members of the public commented on the\u000a      events being `wonderful' and `highly informative' with the `archive promos\u000a      being extraordinary.' Some said it was `great to have an unexplored art\u000a      form given prominence,' and others encouraged `more BFI joint sessions\u000a      like this' (Source E). This impact has been broadened through\u000a      YouTube videos made by Grainge\/Johnson on `Interstitials' and `Idents'\u000a      which have received 3,500 views (2009 &#8212; present) and a range of user\u000a      comments (e.g. `that was surprisingly interesting. I haven't even thought\u000a      about those things that much before' (Source G)), further enhancing\u000a      the visibility of the promotional screen industries.\u000a    Curating these events had a wider impact on the BFI, enabling personnel\u000a      within its television archive to digitally restore examples of\u000a      historically valuable promotional texts for future public screenings, and\u000a      helping the BFI to develop educational content planning. According\u000a      to the TV Programmer at BFI Southbank, `working with the University of\u000a      Nottingham enabled us to identify an area we haven't addressed before and\u000a      to stage an event that attracted a new constituency of students studying\u000a      Media and Design at Art College' (Source H). Specifically, the\u000a      panel events were preceded by a BFI masterclass for 15-25 year olds on\u000a      ident and logo design, led by two creative directors from Red Bee. The\u000a      masterclass was part of a broader competition in which young adults across\u000a      the UK were invited to submit ideas for a logo\/ident for the BFI's `Future\u000a      Film' educational programme. The masterclass was attended by fifty\u000a      students from leading design colleges including Ravensbourne and Edinburgh\u000a      Napier, and provided insight into the creative practice of promotional\u000a      design. In the feedback questionnaires, 100 per cent of respondents said\u000a      they `agreed' or `strongly agreed' that the `masterclass taught them about\u000a      the creative process of making idents and logos' and were `more likely to\u000a      consider a job creating logos and idents' as a result (Source F).\u000a      More broadly, promotion was included as a dedicated panel session (led by\u000a      Grainge) at the BFI Media Conference (4-5 July 2013), an event\u000a      focusing on the professional development of teachers of screen media.\u000a      Through curation of the public events, the development of the masterclass\u000a      as an educational event, and the contribution made to the conference,\u000a      Grainge and Johnson worked with two divisions of the British Film Insitute\u000a      &#8212; BFI Southbank and BFI Education &#8212; illustrating just some of the ways in\u000a      which the Department of Culture, Film and Media is benefitting from\u000a      Nottingham's status as the BFI's HEI partner of choice (Source I\u000a      p.42; see also REF5).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Dr Paul Grainge (Associate Professor of Film and Television Studies,\u000a      Nottingham, 2001-present) and Dr Catherine Johnson (Associate Professor of\u000a      Film and Television Studies, Nottingham, 2010-present) have been\u000a      pioneering the study of the promotional screen industries, raising the\u000a      status of a vibrant sub-sector of the global creative industries.

For\u000a      Johnson this has involved sustained consideration of the emergence of\u000a      branding as a key strategy for Western television industries and the\u000a      shifting marketing strategies used by television broadcasters in the UK\u000a      and the U.S. since the 1980s (see References B and E). This\u000a      has included an on-going relationship with Victoria Jaye (Head of IPTV and\u000a      TV online content for BBC Vision) first initiated in the AHRC\/BBC\u000a      Knowledge Exchange workshops in 2006. Grainge's work on branding and the\u000a      U.S. film industry dates from 2002 and has provided key insights through\u000a      publications and research grants into the industrial and textual economy\u000a      of branding in Hollywood (Reference A). More broadly, it has opened\u000a      out debates on the function and status of `ephemeral media,' describing\u000a      promotional short-forms such as logos, promos, idents, and trailers (Reference\u000a        C, D and F). This research has been advanced in three grants\u000a      with a deliberate focus on industry-academic knowledge exchange. This\u000a      includes the Ephemeral Media workshop (2008-9), funded as part of\u000a      the AHRC's Beyond Text programme, which involved the BBC (Victoria\u000a      Jaye), the BFI and Red Bee Media as participants, the AHRC Follow-On Fund\u000a      award TV and Digital Promotion: Agile Strategies for a New Media\u000a        Ecology (2012-13) that deepened relations with Red Bee and the BFI,\u000a      and the EPSRC Cross-Disciplinary Feasibility account award Towards\u000a        Pervasive Media (2009-11) which laid the ground for\u000a      industry-academic research collaboration with the Horizon Digital Economy\u000a      Research hub based at the university (see REF5).\u000a    Key findings and insights stemming from the research of Grainge and\u000a      Johnson can be summarized as:\u000a    \u000a      the U.S. and UK film\/television industries adopted branding as a\u000a        systematic practice from the 1980s in response to increased competition\u000a        for viewers and revenue\u000a      the branding of television corporations, programmes, channels and\u000a        services has become a key strategy that aims to increase revenue\u000a        streams, capture audience attention, increase viewer loyalty and\u000a        communicate the values of television to viewers\u000a      identifying how branding strategies are enacted across multiple media\u000a        platforms as the film and television industries attempt to utilise the\u000a        potential of new platforms (the internet, mobiles etc) for marketing and\u000a        distribution.\u000a    \u000a    Critically, the underpinning research has engaged with a problem\u000a      identified by industry and summarized by Red Bee Media as how to `build\u000a      bridges between content and viewers' in the digital media ecology (www.redbeemedia.com\/about-us\/overview).\u000a      The research findings demonstrate the significance of promotional media in\u000a      contemporary screen culture, and the terms upon which such media is\u000a      required to be agile in a multiplatform and highly competitive media\u000a      landscape. This has been developed through two major book projects on\u000a      branding in the film and television industries (References A and B),\u000a      a workshop and edited collection on ephemeral media (Reference C),\u000a      and industry fieldwork with Red Bee Media, a world-leading digital and\u000a      communications company which employs 1,500 staff and has an annual\u000a      turnover of &#163;130million. Furthermore, the findings redress the sometimes\u000a      dismissive attitude towards marketing and promotion within academic and\u000a      industry discourse by highlighting the nature of promotion as a creative\u000a      and professional discipline. The research has produced new knowledge about\u000a      media promotion for industry practitioners, raised public awareness of the\u000a      creative work involved, and has facilitated knowledge exchange between\u000a      academics and industry practitioners in strategic areas of TV and digital\u000a      promotion such as `social television.'\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28922","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The value and importance placed against the published research of Evans\u000a      and Pearson was recognized when both researchers were commissioned by the\u000a      RNIB, PBQ and Fox Soccer to conduct three demand-led audience research\u000a      projects. Each project responded to specific concerns within these\u000a      organisations and led to changes in policy and practice towards strategies\u000a      that were focused on audience needs and desires.\u000a    i) Research Commissioned by the RNIB: Improving Television for\u000a        Visually Impaired Audiences\u000a    By raising awareness of the value placed by visually impaired audiences\u000a      on Audio Description (AD) for television dramas and factual programming,\u000a      research by Evans and Pearson prompted communications regulator Ofcom to\u000a      increase mandatory AD content from 10% to 20%, producing a material\u000a      improvement in the media engagement and experience of visually impaired\u000a      viewers. The RNIB was concerned that visually impaired people were\u000a      excluded from valuable viewer experiences by the lack of AD programming.\u000a      Via public relations firm Blue Rubicon, RNIB engaged Evans and Pearson as\u000a      consultants for its March 2008 campaign, with the aim of persuading Ofcom\u000a      to raise the mandatory percentage of AD content provided by television\u000a      broadcasters. RNIB described the research as providing `an excellent case\u000a      for increasing the number of programmes that are Audio Described' (Source\u000a        A). While the RNIB had intended to focus their campaign around the\u000a      need to increase AD for news and current affairs only, Evans and Pearson's\u000a      research persuaded Blue Rubicon and the RNIB to shift the emphasis towards\u000a      drama programming as not only requiring more explicit AD provision but\u000a      also as representing the most important genre for generating a sense of\u000a      audience community amongst the visually impaired (Source B). The\u000a      research played a central part in the extensive publicity campaign, acting\u000a      as the foundation for claims concerning the value of television in forming\u000a      a sense of community amongst visually impaired audiences. In a nationwide\u000a      press release (Source C), the RNIB noted how `TV plays a pivotal\u000a      role in the lives of people with sight problems' and acknowledged the\u000a      research of Evans and Pearson confirmed that `lack of TV viewing can leave\u000a      people isolated' and the importance of AD for how `an additional\u000a      commentary which describes body language, expressions and movements,\u000a      making the story clear through sound.... can transform the enjoyment of TV\u000a      for people who have difficulty seeing what's happening on the screen'. On\u000a      the research and campaign, the BBC reported (Source D): `Research\u000a      suggests that most of the 2m people with sight problems in Britain spend\u000a      time watching television for relaxation and entertainment. The RNIB is\u000a      encouraging people with sight problems to use the free AD service on\u000a      digital TV.... research, by the University of Nottingham, found that more\u000a      than half of those interviewed said they watched dramas and factual\u000a      programmes. And nearly three-quarters watched TV for five hours or more\u000a      each week, with 86% saying they would watch more if there were more of the\u000a      AD service available'.\u000a    ii) Research Commissioned by the PBQ Consortium: Improving Audience\u000a        Development Strategies for Independent Cinemas\u000a    Independent `specialised' cinemas face substantial competition for\u000a      audiences from commercial chains and home cinema technologies. In this\u000a      context, the PBQ consortium needed a better understanding of current and\u000a      potential audiences to develop their programming, promotional and audience\u000a      development strategies in ways that would help the venues address these\u000a      challenges and improve their economic and cultural standing. Aware of\u000a      research on cinemas in Nottingham conducted by Jancovich, PBQ commissioned\u000a      audience research from Evans and Pearson. This led to workshops with\u000a      audience development staff and two reports outlining recommendations for\u000a      audience development strategies. Broadway's Chief Executive and QUAD's\u000a      Director of Audience Engagement confirmed (Sources E and F)\u000a      that the research crucially assisted their organizations in three ways.\u000a      First, the research led Broadway and QUAD to revise their audience\u000a      development strategies to steer away from plans to broaden the demographic\u000a      scope of their respective customer bases and towards concentrating instead\u000a      on growing the existing base of older, more educated, cinema-goers who\u000a      have traditionally characterized audiences at the venues. Secondly, the\u000a      research influenced Broadway's decision to extend the employment of their\u000a      Audience Development Coordinator. The precise value of the research to the\u000a      organization is acknowledged in the Chief Executive's statement that `As a\u000a      result of a better understanding of its audience and its brand, Broadway\u000a      has been successful in increasing footfall and box office revenues year on\u000a      year. Compared to the period before the findings of the report were acted\u000a      upon in 2009\/10, cinema tickets sales have increased by 22.5% to more than\u000a      190,000 in 2012\/13. Whilst the impact of the research isn't the only\u000a      factor in this impressive increase, it has without a doubt been a major\u000a      contributory factor' (Source E). QUAD similarly reports that\u000a      `cinema revenues have increased by 20% and overall attendance by 9%' (Source\u000a        F). Finally, both organizations have become part of the British Film\u000a      Institute's UK Film Audience Network, an initiative launched as part of\u000a      the BFI's Film Forever plan. Broadway was recently successful in\u000a      becoming the Lead Organisation for the Film Hub Central East and QUAD is a\u000a      steering group member. A key objective of this initiative is to expand\u000a      audiences for specialised film, and in this context the Chief Executive\u000a      and Director of Audience Engagement cite the value of maintaining an\u000a      on-going relationship with the Department of Culture, Film and Media in\u000a      helping them to meet current and future goals (Sources E and F).\u000a    iii) Research Commissioned by Fox Soccer: Improving Local Strategies\u000a        in Global Television Sports Broadcasting\u000a    Research conducted for Fox Soccer informed a clearer understanding of\u000a      television audience taste that improves the sports channel's operational\u000a      decision-making by raising the profile of local conditions and preferences\u000a      in terms of content, distribution and marketing outside of the U.S. (Source\u000a        G). When the research was commissioned, the U.S.-based channel was\u000a      intending to expand its position within the global football television\u000a      market through a behind-the-scenes documentary series on Liverpool\u000a      Football Club, Being: Liverpool. Working at a significant cultural\u000a      and geographical distance from their documentary's subject and the\u000a      economically important European football market, Fox commissioned a team\u000a      at Nottingham to prepare a report evaluating whether they could\u000a      successfully apply the format to similar programming in the future. Evans\u000a      led the team (Grainge, Johnson, McDonald, Pearson, Sergi) in researching\u000a      this report, which reinforced the value of the Being: Liverpool\u000a      format and its potential for further development, while also revealing the\u000a      limitations of the format. As a result, the research informed Fox Soccer's\u000a      future global strategy in the following ways:\u000a    \u000a      recognising how the stylistic presentation of U.S. produced content,\u000a        especially documentary, influenced audience perceptions of\u000a        `Americanisation' in globally distributed programming\u000a      understanding specific characteristics of local television markets and\u000a        institutions in order to match their brand profile with national\u000a        audience tastes and the identity of local broadcasters.\u000a    \u000a    At Fox Soccer, the General Manager and Executive Vice President commented\u000a      that the research has `highlighted how we... needed to understand out\u000a      global markets in more detail... As a result of this report we have\u000a      implemented changes in the way we assess the nature of quality of\u000a      information that needs gathering prior to the release of a new product on\u000a      the international market' (Source G).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Prof. Roberta Pearson (Professor of Film and Television Studies,\u000a      Nottingham, 2004-present) and Dr Elizabeth Evans (Lecturer in Film and\u000a      Television Studies, Nottingham, 2007-present) have produced original\u000a      audience research to generate greater understanding of viewer engagements\u000a      with film and television programming in terms of taste, distinction and\u000a      community.

This first type of output is described in this section, the second\u000a      in section 4, and can be gathered under three thematic foci.\u000a    i) Television Audiences, Taste, Distinction and Community\u000a      Television audiences are the focus of published outputs by both Pearson (Reference\u000a        E) and Evans (Reference C). Reference E addresses\u000a      issues of taste and distinction through examining the responses of online\u000a      fandoms to the television drama Sherlock (BBC, 2010- ). Its\u000a      original insight lies in positing a distinction between affirmational\u000a      fandoms that engage in traditional practices of evaluation and\u000a      transformational fandoms that engage in established fannish practices of\u000a      textual reworking. Reference C addresses the tastes of television\u000a      audiences in terms of the values that viewers place upon television drama\u000a      and transmedia extensions. It offers original insight by focusing on the\u000a      specific narrative characteristics, such as fictional characters, that are\u000a      central to engagement with television and by demonstrating the importance\u000a      of established, familiar viewing practices to audiences in light of\u000a      potential changes to viewing contexts or the development of new texts. Reference\u000a        F (based on RNIB commissioned research) is one of only a handful of\u000a      scholarly works that addresses media consumption by the disabled; it has\u000a      original insights into the role that television plays in visually impaired\u000a      peoples' media engagement, their sense of inclusion in the community of\u000a      television viewers, and their viewing tastes. In particular, the research\u000a      demonstrates the importance of drama programming and its centrality to\u000a      television's ability to construct a community, something that was a key\u000a      part of visually impaired audiences' daily lives. It demonstrates the\u000a      importance of distinction in examining genre and audience tastes by\u000a      considering individual genres of programming as having distinctive textual\u000a      characteristics and values.\u000a    ii) Cinema Audiences, Taste, Distinction and Community\u000a      Research on cinema audiences and specific venues such as those in the\u000a      independent sector has been published in References A and B.\u000a      Focused on the example of Nottingham, Reference A (lead author\u000a      Jancovich was Reader in Film Studies at Nottingham, 1996-2004) is the only\u000a      extensive cultural history of cinema venues in an English city. The book\u000a      includes data on contemporary audiences that offer evidence of an\u000a      association between cinema audiences and community &#8212; cinemas as places in\u000a      which `people not only knew one another but also looked after one\u000a      another', and unique evidence of the operation of taste and distinction\u000a      amongst the Broadway Cinema's audiences. Reference B examines high\u000a      culture fandoms, communities almost entirely neglected by fan studies. Its\u000a      original insight consists of breaking down the distinctions between high\u000a      and popular culture fandoms: consumers of high culture resist the fan\u000a      label, but engage in practices similar to those of popular culture\u000a      fandoms. This provides a framework for hypothesizing the similarities and\u000a      differences between the Broadway's audiences and those of the commercial\u000a      cinema. The article builds on Pearson's previous work on taste and\u000a      distinction amongst cinema and television audiences undertaken prior to\u000a      her Nottingham appointment. Reference G is based on research\u000a      commissioned by the PBQ consortium, a network of nineteen East\u000a      Midlands-based independent cinemas led by the Broadway Cinema in\u000a      Nottingham. This research investigated audiences at Broadway, along with\u000a      two other PBQ venues: QUAD in Derby and Phoenix in Leicester. It is\u000a      distinctive in that it is one of the few scholarly works that investigates\u000a      contemporary cinema audiences as opposed to contemporary television or\u000a      historical cinema audiences. It is also original in its focus on the\u000a      cinema as a social and cultural space, rather than only on the act of film\u000a      watching or interpretation. It gives original insights into PBQ audiences'\u000a      tastes and their sense of distinction and of indirect community with\u000a      like-minded viewers. It revealed new information about the demographic\u000a      profile of the existing audience; in comparison to the general UK\u000a      population, PBQ audiences are older and more highly educated. It showed\u000a      that audiences were very loyal both to the cinema medium and to PBQ\u000a      venues, preferring them to commercial venues. It revealed that audiences\u000a      valued the venues for their distinctive programming of content that the\u000a      cinema sector refers to as `specialised', i.e. non-mainstream niches for\u000a      British, U.S. independent and foreign- language films. They also declared\u000a      their sense of cultural distinction, valuing the venues because of how\u000a      they perceived themselves as belonging to a community of viewers with\u000a      shared tastes and appropriate behaviour patterns contrasting with the\u000a      tastes and behaviour of patrons attending major cinema chains.\u000a    iii) Television Audiences, Taste, Content and Studying Global Audience\u000a        Communities\u000a\u0009Reference D examines the continuing importance of U.S.\u000a      television programming to UK audiences; it demonstrates this by\u000a      documenting viewers' desire to gain access to this content. This book also\u000a      explores issues of global distribution and the need for U.S. content\u000a      producers and broadcasters to acknowledge the specific characteristics of\u000a      local markets, particularly in terms of how local broadcasters position\u000a      their content within television schedules. It is original in its\u000a      consideration of how emerging technologies shape the ways in which\u000a      audiences engage with globally distributed content. Reference E\u000a      examines the value of emerging digital methodologies for audience research\u000a      versus more established methods such as focus groups and questionnaires.\u000a      It argues that the potentially infinite data available on the internet\u000a      means it is not possible to gather exhaustive and comprehensive audience\u000a      reception data about even one television programme, but that it is\u000a      nevertheless possible both to identify key online sites of audience\u000a      engagement and to generalise about the modes of responses found there. It\u000a      offers original insights into methodological approaches to study diverse,\u000a      global television audiences.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28923","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1562822","Name":"Vietnam"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Contemporary Chinese art has become a major focus of interest for public\u000d\u000a      museums and art galleries world-wide.

The close\u000d\u000a      attention given by the exhibition to indigenous Chinese thought and\u000d\u000a      practice, as well as the ambiguous critical positioning of contemporary\u000d\u000a      Chinese art (References A, D, E, F and G) (all elements of\u000d\u000a      the exhibition to which Gladston contributed research data and critical\u000d\u000a      insight) was acknowledged in positive media reviews including 4 and 5 star\u000d\u000a      reviews in The Times (Nancy Durrant), The Sunday Times\u000d\u000a      (Waldemar Januszczak), The Telegraph (Andrew Graham-Dixon) and BBC\u000d\u000a      Radio 4's Front Row (Charlotte Mullins) (Source D).\u000d\u000a      Gladston's advice helped the curator to develop and present new critical\u000d\u000a      perspectives on the relationship between contemporary art and the wider\u000d\u000a      conditions of its making and showing both within and outside the PRC with\u000d\u000a      particular insights on; the problematic effects of cultural translation,\u000d\u000a      helping them to look beyond Westernized cultural perspectives on the\u000d\u000a      significance of contemporary Chinese art (References D, E and, F);\u000d\u000a      the relationship between contemporary Chinese art and aspects of\u000d\u000a      traditional Chinese cultural thought and practice; and the persistently\u000d\u000a      uncertain positioning of artists in relation to centralised authority\u000d\u000a      within the PRC (References A, B, C, F and G). This advice\u000d\u000a      helped the curator to `focus and give confirmation of [my] existing\u000d\u000a      vision' (Source A). Through the provision of research insight, fact\u000d\u000a      checking and critical analysis, Gladston helped to shape the\u000d\u000a      specially-created interactive digital archive, which formed the backbone\u000d\u000a      of the exhibition. The archive combined video materials, a timeline and\u000d\u000a      detailed discussions of works included in the exhibition. Drawing on his\u000d\u000a      published research (References A, B, C, D, E and F)\u000d\u000a      Gladston was able to contribute a selection of key events and an\u000d\u000a      individual perspective in the section of the exhibition entitled\u000d\u000a      `Arguments' which focused on China's complex relationship with modernity\u000d\u000a      and tradition (Source C). This contribution provided insights into\u000d\u000a      the problematic and often contested historical\/cultural significance of\u000d\u000a      the artworks on display in the exhibition. Gladston was also able to offer\u000d\u000a      advice on the factual accuracy of materials used to contextualise the\u000d\u000a      exhibition and to peer review an introductory essay written by the Chief\u000d\u000a      Curator for the exhibition's accompanying catalogue (Source B). The\u000d\u000a      article cited Gladston's previous work (Reference G), confirming\u000d\u000a      the contribution of his research to the development of her curatorial\u000d\u000a      approach. Gladston contributed an essay to the catalogue on the\u000d\u000a      relationship between contemporary Chinese art and traditional Chinese\u000d\u000a      cultural thought and practice (Source B). The catalogue reached a\u000d\u000a      wide readership amongst visitors, with gallery sales reaching 720 copies.\u000d\u000a      A key indicator of the interest in contemporary Chinese art that the\u000d\u000a      exhibition stimulated is the fact that this figure was 220 in excess of\u000d\u000a      the Hayward's target (appealing to 1 in 31 visitors, rather than the\u000d\u000a      target of 1 in 73 originally forecast). A further 351 copies were\u000d\u000a      subsequently bought through direct sales (including at other galleries,\u000d\u000a      through Amazon, and by standing orders) (Source C) suggesting wider\u000d\u000a      cultural penetration of the ideas and content of the exhibition beyond\u000d\u000a      visitors to the exhibition itself.\u000d\u000a    Problematizing dominant cultural perspectives on contemporary Chinese\u000d\u000a        Art and ArtistsWhen the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei wrote a challenging\u000d\u000a      review of Art of Change which appeared in The Guardian (Source\u000d\u000a        E), Gladston countered online with a critical response published on\u000d\u000a      Randian (a project seeking to promote independent cultural debate\u000d\u000a      in China and to foster intellectual exchange between China and the rest of\u000d\u000a      the world by publishing independent commentary on art, artists,\u000d\u000a      exhibitions and galleries, as well as video, architecture and design) (Source\u000d\u000a        E). Ai's review of Art of Change criticized Art of\u000d\u000a        Change for its failure to show art that engaged directly and openly\u000d\u000a      with political authority within the PRC. In response, Gladston's article\u000d\u000a      drew attention to the exhibition's more subtle and varied engagement with\u000d\u000a      the relationship between contemporary Chinese art and political authority.\u000d\u000a      It also discussed the problematic status of Ai's standing as a media\u000d\u000a      celebrity which has, arguably, obscured in-depth discussion and debate\u000d\u000a      about the wider context of artistic criticality in the PRC. Circulation of\u000d\u000a      Randian's e-newsletter reaches approx. 40,000 addressees, while the\u000d\u000a      site attracts approximately 20,000-30,000 page views per month. By 29\u000d\u000a      April 2013, Gladston's article had attracted 2,474 unique page views with\u000d\u000a      an average reading time of 3mins 45secs, and as the article had attracted\u000d\u000a      2,994 views as of 9 September 2013, this indicates that it has continued\u000d\u000a      to attract approximately 100+ views per month (Source F). The\u000d\u000a      article stimulated interest from members of the art world internationally,\u000d\u000a      being subsequently published in the art magazine\/journal Broadsheet\u000d\u000a      (circulation 4,500 print copies per issue and 30,000-40,000 web downloads\u000d\u000a      per annum) (Sources E and G). Ai Weiwei's critique and\u000d\u000a      Gladston's response were translated in full and discussed on the blog of\u000d\u000a      Vietnamese art writer Nh01b0 Huy, who commented `This is a very useful\u000d\u000a      discussion, since it refers to the same situation that exists for\u000d\u000a      contemporary art in Vietnam - for example: the relationship between art\u000d\u000a      and politics and the difference between Western and local perspectives on\u000d\u000a      contemporary art' (Source E). Also Shanghailist, a major online\u000d\u000a      filter of China related news stories for the international media, ran a\u000d\u000a      feature on Gladston's Randian article, quoting substantially from\u000d\u000a      the original text (Source E). International interest in this debate\u000d\u000a      resulted in the Director of the New York-based organization and exhibition\u000d\u000a      space AW Asia contacting Gladston to say `I really enjoyed reading your\u000d\u000a      \"Getting Over AWW\" piece. Bravo [...] a well-written \"reality check\" such\u000d\u000a      as yours is needed [...] your critique adds a necessary dimension to the\u000d\u000a      overall conversation about the field of contemporary Chinese art' (Source\u000d\u000a        H). The extent of engaged response to Gladston's article attests to\u000d\u000a      its contribution in problematizing existing cultural narratives about\u000d\u000a      contemporary Chinese art, and the specific mythologization of Ai Weiwei\u000d\u000a      within that narrative.\u000d\u000a    Gladston's advisory role with the Hayward has lead to further invitations\u000d\u000a      to critically inform the work of other public museums and galleries,\u000d\u000a      including a major exhibition of contemporary Chinese art at Michigan State\u000d\u000a      University curated by Wang Chunchen, organizer of the China Pavilion at\u000d\u000a      the Venice Biennale in 2013, and a forthcoming exhibition of contemporary\u000d\u000a      Chinese art in the PRC curated jointly by Dr. Marko Daniel of Tate and\u000d\u000a      Carol Lu (an internationally active curator and critic).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Dr Paul Gladston's (Associate Professor of Critical Theory and Visual\u000d\u000a      Culture, Nottingham, 2005- present) research has served to problematize\u000d\u000a      and add complexity to the public understanding of the relationship between\u000d\u000a      contemporary Chinese art and the wider conditions of its making and\u000d\u000a      showing both within and outside the Peoples' Republic of China (PRC).

Both investigations were conducted with the\u000d\u000a      support of local Chinese-speaking research assistants and involved\u000d\u000a      first-hand analysis of cultural artefacts, sites of display and\u000d\u000a      documentary sources inaccessible outside China, as well as an extended\u000d\u000a      series of semi-structured interviews with Chinese artists, curators,\u000d\u000a      academics and critics.

In this context, it\u000d\u000a      is important to note Gladston's experiential familiarity with the place of\u000d\u000a      art practice in modern China, where he was seconded between 2005 and 2010\u000d\u000a      as the inaugural head of the Department of International Communications\u000d\u000a      and director of the Institute of Comparative Cultural Studies at the\u000d\u000a      University of Nottingham Ningbo.\u000d\u000a    i) `Avant-garde' Art Groups in China, 1979-89\u000d\u000a    Supported by a University of Nottingham Small Research Grant (&#163;1,000) and\u000d\u000a      a University of Nottingham Early Research Grant (&#163;7,500), this\u000d\u000a      investigation not only provided accurate historical information about the\u000d\u000a      activities of four of the groups concerned, but also furnished new\u000d\u000a      insights into the socio-cultural significance of works made individually\u000d\u000a      and collectively by their members.

Outside the PRC\u000d\u000a      much of that writing has tended towards established forms of Westernized\u000d\u000a      critical discourse at the expense of any detailed consideration of\u000d\u000a      localised Chinese cultural\/theoretical perspectives. By contrast, within\u000d\u000a      the PRC academic writing on contemporary Chinese art has often tended\u000d\u000a      towards the use of partisan and uncritical interpretations of traditional\u000d\u000a      Chinese thought and practice as well as uninformed readings of Westernized\u000d\u000a      theory as a basis for assertions of national-cultural exceptionalism.\u000d\u000a      Gladston is the first academic writer to have addressed this problematic\u000d\u000a      discursive opposition not only by exploring in-depth the relationship\u000d\u000a      between contemporary Chinese art and established Chinese cultural thought\u000d\u000a      and practice (References D and F), but also by developing\u000d\u000a      novel deconstructive interpretative\/critical methods. The latter has\u000d\u000a      involved the use of polylogues derived from the writings of, among others,\u000d\u000a      Jacques Derrida (Reference E) that bring Chinese and Westernized\u000d\u000a      interpretative perspectives together while opening each up critically to\u000d\u000a      the other.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"30211","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"99237","Name":"Iraq"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Berghahn's collaborative and individual research in the field of migrant\u000d\u000a      and diasporic cinema has benefited filmmakers and other media\u000d\u000a      professionals as well as the cinema-going public. In order to build a\u000d\u000a      solid basis for knowledge exchange between academics and stakeholders in\u000d\u000a      the media industry,Berghahn invited the Co-founder and Director of\u000d\u000a      Studies, a filmmaker\/scriptwriter\/producer and MD of Scenario Films Ltd.\u000d\u000a      to join the Migrant and Diasporic Cinema Research Network. He has\u000d\u000a      described his participation in the Research Network as `the single most\u000d\u000a      important impetus behind the conception and foundation of BABYLON' (see\u000d\u000a      testimonial under 5). The Network's research findings demonstrated that,\u000d\u000a      despite various diversity initiatives within the European film industries,\u000d\u000a      ethnic minority filmmakers encounter particular problems and barriers when\u000d\u000a      trying to get their films into production. the Co-founder and Director of\u000d\u000a      Studies (ibid) explains that `this significant research finding encouraged\u000d\u000a      me to found BABYLON, a cultural forum and development programme designed\u000d\u000a      to support the creative ambitions of migrant and diasporic filmmakers from\u000d\u000a      Europe's varied minorities. BABYLON is committed to challenging existing\u000d\u000a      perceptions that have hardened into prejudice and to stimulating an\u000d\u000a      industrial environment in which producers, distributors and audiences are\u000d\u000a      attracted to culturally diverse films. The first step in this direction\u000d\u000a      was to increase the visibility and profile of minority filmmakers across\u000d\u000a      the European film industry and to liberate new voices that had been\u000d\u000a      hitherto marginalised and excluded'.\u000d\u000a    BABYLON is an audiovisual development programme that helps filmmakers to\u000d\u000a      overcome these obstacles and to establish important contacts, thereby\u000d\u000a      enabling competitively selected workshop participants to develop their\u000d\u000a      screenplays and get them into production. The case of Turkish German\u000d\u000a      filmmaker S&#252;lbiye G&#252;nar is particularly instructive: on account of her\u000d\u000a      name and earlier work, she was expected to make films about her own ethnic\u000d\u000a      constituency. Television producers invited her to make a film about `her\u000d\u000a      compatriots at the hypermarket' and `a beautiful Turkish woman'. To escape\u000d\u000a      from this kind of ethnic pigeonholing, she changed her name to Verena S.\u000d\u000a      Freytag while working on the project `Alpenhof', the working title of her\u000d\u000a      film Abgebrannt (2011). With the support of BABYLON, she also\u000d\u000a      managed to get back the rights for her screenplay `Alpenhof' from Colonia\u000d\u000a      Media Film\/Bavaria, which the production company initially contested.\u000d\u000a      `Without BABYLON, I would probably have given up fighting for [the rights]\u000d\u000a      of the screenplay. Furthermore, at the BABYLON workshop in Rotterdam I met\u000d\u000a      Burkhard Althoff from the ZDF\/KF [television]. He asked me about my\u000d\u000a      project, which I had originally sent to the ZDF in 2004 and he encouraged\u000d\u000a      me to re-submit it to one of his colleagues. ... BABYLON was a crucial\u000d\u000a      experience for my career as a scriptwriter and director and for my film',\u000d\u000a      which was eventually co-funded by the ZDF (see email correspondence\u000d\u000a      between Berghahn and Freytag referenced in section 5).\u000d\u000a    Between 2007 and 2013, BABYLON provided training and support to over one\u000d\u000a      hundred competitively selected filmmakers through targeted film\u000d\u000a      development workshops at film festivals in Berlin, Rotterdam, Locarno,\u000d\u000a      Cannes and elsewhere. BABYLON has received funding and support from the\u000d\u000a      British Council, Skillset, Film Fonds Wien and the EU Media Mundus\u000d\u000a      Programme. To date eight films by BABYLON alumni have been completed. They\u000d\u000a      have also won a number of prestigious awards at international film\u000d\u000a      festivals including Sundance, the Berlin International Film Festival,\u000d\u000a      Raindance, Karlovy Vary, Toronto, Moscow and Mumbai. So far eight films\u000d\u000a      have been released in cinemas and have received extensive press coverage\u000d\u000a      in leading newspapers such as The Guardian, Le Monde, Frankfurter\u000d\u000a        Allgemeine Zeitung, Die Zeit and the trade press (Variety,\u000d\u000a        Hollywood Reporter, Sight and Sound etc.). In particular\u000d\u000a      films about (diasporic) families, including My Brother the Devil\u000d\u000a      (2012), Kuma (2012) and Son of Babylon (2009) have been\u000d\u000a      able to cross over into the mainstream, arguably because, as Berghahn has\u000d\u000a      demonstrated in Outputs (referenced 1 and 6), family narratives elicit a\u000d\u000a      sense of recognition and identification with the `other' and, therefore,\u000d\u000a      have possessed the capacity to build bridges across cultures. Son of\u000d\u000a        Babylon was Iraq's nomination for the Academy Awards in 2010 and was\u000d\u000a      distributed in nine territories. Kuma premiered at the\u000d\u000a      International Berlin Film Festival in 2012 and has since been released in\u000d\u000a      cinemas in eight countries including Austria, Germany, Spain, the UK and\u000d\u000a      France, where it was distributed with 60 prints under the title Une\u000d\u000a        seconde femme, attracting 36,710 viewers.\u000d\u000a    In addition to providing the initial stimulus for the foundation of\u000d\u000a      BABYLON, Berghahn has created numerous opportunities for knowledge\u000d\u000a      exchange, consultancy and collaboration with high-profile minority\u000d\u000a      filmmakers including John Akomfrah, Abdelkrim Bahloul, Feo Alada&#287;,\u000d\u000a      diversity consultant Parminder Vir, OBE, Eve Gabereau (Soda Pictures),\u000d\u000a      producers Leslee Udwin (East is East and West is West) and\u000d\u000a      Ralph Schwingel (Fatih Ak&#305;n's Head-On) and Thierry Lenouvel (Cin&#233;\u000d\u000a      Sud Promotion). These have generated a more comprehensive understanding of\u000d\u000a      diversity and equality issues amongst stakeholders in the media industry.\u000d\u000a      Furthermore, at the International BFI London Film Festivals in 2011 and\u000d\u000a      2012, Jones convened industry panels entitled `BABYLON Burning &#8212; a public\u000d\u000a      debate on film diversity' and `BABYLON Breakthrough'. A productive\u000d\u000a      dialogue between Nadine Marsh-Edwards (producer, board member Film\u000d\u000a      London), Nadia Denton (Black Film Magazine), Leslee Udwin, David Thomson\u000d\u000a      (former Head of BBC Films, now Origin Pictures) amongst others ensued at\u000d\u000a      these important forums. Berghahn participated in the industry panel\u000d\u000a      `BABYLON Burning' in 2011, which received press coverage in BritFlicks\u000d\u000a      (see under 5).\u000d\u000a    Berghahn designed public-facing interactive websites with archives of\u000d\u000a      podcasts with filmmakers and other media professionals, blogs and\u000d\u000a      searchable databases and other features for her research projects. Since\u000d\u000a      the website www.migrantcinema.net\u000d\u000a      went live in March 2007, it has had 41,127 unique visitors. The total\u000d\u000a      number of page views (until 31 July 2013) was 134,992. The website www.farflungfamilies.net\u000d\u000a      has attracted 11,433 unique visitors with a total number of 30,706 page\u000d\u000a      views between December 2010 and 31 July 2013. The websites have raised the\u000d\u000a      public visibility of Berghahn's research and, as a result, she was invited\u000d\u000a      in October 2009 to contribute to an international symposium and a German\u000d\u000a      television programme entitled `Suddenly so much Heimat: Changing Identity\u000d\u000a      in Film, Culture and Society'. The public symposium was organised by the\u000d\u000a      WDR (West German Broadcasting Corporation) and held at the Museum Ludwig\u000d\u000a      in Cologne. Berghahn was also interviewed for a documentary on the topic,\u000d\u000a      broadcast by the WDR on 31 October 2009, watched by 90,000 viewers. The\u000d\u000a      event, which was accompanied by a film season (Heimat Feelings)\u000d\u000a      broadcast by the WDR between October and November 2009, was initiated by\u000d\u000a      the WDR's Commissioner for Integration and Cultural Diversity and the Head\u000d\u000a      of Television Drama and Film. It brought together filmmakers, journalists,\u000d\u000a      film critics, policy makers and international film scholars and promoted a\u000d\u000a      new concept of Heimat, identity and belonging, thereby supporting\u000d\u000a      the WDR's mission to promote cultural diversity and integration. As\u000d\u000a      Berghahn's research demonstrates (esp. Output 2), Heimat may be a\u000d\u000a      German word but in the age of transnational migration, it has gained new\u000d\u000a      meanings for the transnationally mobile citizens of plural worlds.\u000d\u000a    Berghahn created further impact through her research on the diasporic\u000d\u000a      family in film through public film screenings and Q&amp;A sessions with\u000d\u000a      filmmakers at the Cin&#233; Lumi&#232;re in London. These screenings brought\u000d\u000a      contested socio-political issues such as the practice of honour killings (When\u000a        We Leave, 2010) and the integration of diasporic families into\u000d\u000a      majority culture (Almanya &#8212; Welcome to Germany, 2011) to public\u000d\u000a      attention. Despite being critically acclaimed, these films have not had a\u000d\u000a      theatrical release in Britain. When We Leave, which was Germany's\u000d\u000a      nomination for the Academy Awards in 2011, had only been shown once at the\u000d\u000a      Human Rights Film Festival in London before Berghahn made it accessible to\u000d\u000a      the general public at the Cin&#233; Lumi&#232;re on 21 May 2011. In a lively Q&amp;A\u000d\u000a      session with writer-director Feo Alada&#287;, the audience had the opportunity\u000d\u000a      to discuss issues of cultural diversity and, in particular, the\u000d\u000a      controversial issue of honour killings in Turkish Muslim families.\u000d\u000a      Although Almanya &#8212; Welcome to Germany attracted over 1.4 million\u000d\u000a      viewers in Germany alone and has been released in cinemas in ten European\u000d\u000a      countries, it has not found a distributor in the UK. Berghahn premiered\u000d\u000a      this feel-good integration comedy at the Cin&#233; Lumi&#232;re to a full house on\u000d\u000a      18 January 2012 (and subsequently at the Goethe Institute on 15 May 2013).\u000d\u000a      In a Q&amp;A session with the writer-director siblings Nesrin and Yasemin\u000d\u000a      Samdereli, members of the public, and school classes who attended the\u000d\u000a      screening, discussed how this film engages with and debunks ethnic\u000d\u000a      stereotypes and interacts with public debates about immigration,\u000d\u000a      integration and cultural diversity. A podcast of the Q&amp;A session is\u000d\u000a      available on Berghahn's research project website (source 7).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Over the past eight years, Professor Daniela Berghahn has undertaken\u000d\u000a      extensive research into the (self-)representation of migrant and diasporic\u000d\u000a      communities in European cinema as Principal Investigator of a\u000d\u000a      collaborative Research Network and through her individual research.\u000d\u000a      Through the creation of various platforms of knowledge exchange,\u000d\u000a      Berghahn's research has enhanced awareness of diasporic filmmaking amongst\u000d\u000a      industry stakeholders and the cinema-going public and shaped cultural\u000d\u000a      life.

The AHRC Peer Review Panel assessed the\u000d\u000a      work undertaken by the Migrant and Diasporic Cinema Network as\u000d\u000a      `Outstanding'.

In\u000d\u000a      consultation with filmmakers, producers, distributors, policy makers and\u000d\u000a      festival organisers, the Network explored the evolution of migrant and\u000d\u000a      diasporic cinemas in contemporary Europe over the past thirty years. It\u000d\u000a      investigated how films made by migrant and diasporic filmmakers changed\u000d\u000a      our understanding of European identity\/ies and complicated how they had\u000d\u000a      previously been constructed and narrated within distinct national cinema\u000d\u000a      traditions. The Network's key research findings were:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Migrant, diasporic and ethnic minority filmmakers have reshaped\u000d\u000a        European (including British) filmmaking through innovative stylistic and\u000d\u000a        generic templates.\u000d\u000a      They encounter greater obstacles than majority culture filmmakers,\u000d\u000a        finding it harder to attract funding and, when they do, they are usually\u000d\u000a        expected to carry `the burden of representation' for their ethnic\u000d\u000a        constituencies. In terms of subject matter and production opportunities,\u000d\u000a        their artistic freedom is restricted compared with that of majority\u000d\u000a        culture filmmakers.\u000d\u000a      Films about migration and cultural diversity constitute important\u000d\u000a        discursive interventions in debates about the co-existence of hegemonic\u000d\u000a        and minority cultures in European societies. By addressing controversial\u000d\u000a        issues such as racism and other forms of social marginalisation and by\u000d\u000a        rejecting (but frequently also reinforcing) ethnic stereotypes, migrant\u000d\u000a        and diasporic films challenge images and reports that dominate the mass\u000d\u000a        media in the West.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    For her next project on `The Diasporic Family in Cinema', Berghahn\u000d\u000a      succeeded in winning an AHRC Research Fellowship (October 2010-June 2011).\u000d\u000a      Focusing once again on contemporary European (including British) cinema,\u000d\u000a      Berghahn was able to demonstrate that:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The diasporic family on screen crystallises the emotionally ambivalent\u000d\u000a        response to immigration and growing cultural diversity in western\u000d\u000a        societies. Constructed as `other' on account of its ethnicity, language\u000d\u000a        and religion, it is perceived as a threat to the social cohesion of\u000d\u000a        Western host societies. Conversely, the diasporic family is also\u000d\u000a        nostalgically imagined as a traditional family, characterised by\u000d\u000a        extended nurturing kinship networks and superior family values that\u000d\u000a        contrast with the fragmentation and alleged crisis of the hegemonic\u000d\u000a        family.\u000d\u000a      Thanks to the crossover appeal of family stories, a number of\u000d\u000a        diasporic family films, in particular comedies, were able to break out\u000d\u000a        of the ethnic niche and cross over into the mainstream.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"30212","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"798549","Name":"Romania"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Royal Holloway's team have been central to bringing about the first\u000d\u000a      successful co-operation between European TV archives to open up their\u000d\u000a      holdings to the general public, represented in the successful launch of\u000d\u000a      EUscreen in 2010. The research has shaped the new co-operative culture\u000d\u000a        amongst European broadcaster archives, enabling substantial public\u000d\u000a      access and defining the terms of engagement with audio-visual content for\u000d\u000a      the European digital library, Europeana. VideoActive paved the way and\u000d\u000a      made possible the far larger www.euscreen.eu\u000d\u000a      project which now encompasses 22 broadcaster archives. Ellis and Turnock\u000d\u000a      continue to guide this project. EUscreen provides universal public access\u000d\u000a      to already-digitised historic television material. It enabled many\u000d\u000a      archives to develop an access policy for the first time; and some (like\u000d\u000a      RTBF in Belgium) to develop their first systematic digitisation. The\u000d\u000a      project is unique in its comparative aspect, promoting searches across\u000d\u000a      output from different European broadcasters.\u000d\u000a    The EUscreen website is universally accessible and averaged\u000d\u000a      41,550 unique visitors per month in 2013 (up from 9000 per month in 2012)\u000d\u000a      with almost 120,000 page views per month. EUscreen has been referred to in\u000d\u000a      108 print and online publications, as well as 1684 mentions on Twitter,\u000d\u000a      where EUscreen has 445 followers. There have also been 101,000 web\u000d\u000a      references via Google, 1,080 on Bing and 7,290 through Yahoo. It is\u000d\u000a      currently included as an integral part of courses at 36 educational\u000d\u000a      institutions across Europe, and has reached target stakeholders in 196\u000d\u000a      Higher and Further Education institutions. The EUscreen collection will\u000d\u000a      contain more than 45,000 items by 2016. The design of a straightforward\u000d\u000a      interface involved the Royal Holloway team who articulated the needs of\u000d\u000a      different potential users based on the underpinning research into\u000d\u000a      judgements of cultural value. The software developers also substantially\u000d\u000a      altered their `advanced search' design to accommodate the requirements of\u000d\u000a      scholarly as well as generalist research at the urging of the Royal\u000d\u000a      Holloway team.\u000d\u000a    Europeana (the EC-funded digital library and museum) appointed EUscreen\u000a        as its sole aggregator for audiovisual content, despite the\u000d\u000a      existence of other sites such as the European Film Gateway. EUscreen will\u000d\u000a      provide one million metadata items to Europeana by 2016. VideoActive's\u000d\u000a      metadata model was adopted by EUscreen with only minor changes, and is now\u000d\u000a      the standard for participating broadcasters from most of the new accession\u000d\u000a      states of Eastern Europe. EUscreen has become a unique forum for archives\u000d\u000a      across Europe, ranging from the INA in France, with its advanced access\u000d\u000a      programmes, to Romania, Poland and Denmark with no other sustained public\u000d\u000a      access programmes. Royal Holloway's research reputation in this area led\u000d\u000a      to its selection, along with co-ordinators Utrecht University, as the sole\u000d\u000a      research institution partners in these projects. The majority partners are\u000d\u000a      broadcaster archives (now almost 30 are involved) and two technology\u000d\u000a      providers.\u000d\u000a    EUscreen developed and expanded the VideoActive prototype by adding\u000d\u000a      research-informed commentary on its holdings through the creation of\u000d\u000a      `virtual collections'. Royal Holloway took responsibility for the\u000d\u000a      development of a series of themed `virtual exhibitions' of EUscreen\u000d\u000a        material, applying in practice the findings of the underpinning\u000d\u000a      research to develop curated collections drawing on a wide range of\u000d\u000a      academic research and the work of archivists. This co-operative working\u000d\u000a      has been further developed by the creation of VIEW: Journal of\u000d\u000a        European Television History and Culture, an online peer-reviewed\u000d\u000a      journal with both Johnson and Ellis on the editorial board\u000d\u000a      (http:\/\/journal.euscreen.eu\/index.php\/view). In both cases, archivists are\u000d\u000a      central contributors, using and developing the overall perspectives on TV\u000d\u000a      history developed by the Royal Holloway group. VideoActive and EUscreen\u000d\u000a      have therefore enabled a direct dialogue between Royal Holloway's research\u000d\u000a      in the field and the preservation and cataloguing practices of the\u000d\u000a      archives of public and commercial broadcasters across Europe.\u000d\u000a    As previously indicated, the underpinning research emphasised the\u000d\u000a      enduring cultural value of archival television, arguing for the preservation\u000d\u000a        of television flow rather than just isolated programmes. As a\u000d\u000a      conference paper, Ellis (2006) (Output 2) led directly to a change in the\u000d\u000a      preservation practice of the UK National Film and TV Archive (NFTVA). The\u000d\u000a      NFTVA now includes examples of interstitial material (trails, idents,\u000d\u000a      adverts and so on) as well as sampled nights to demonstrate the nature of\u000d\u000a      broadcast flow.\u000d\u000a    Ellis has also led the team developing a consolidated search\u000d\u000a        interface for the nine separate databases of more than 13 million\u000d\u000a      records of audio-visual content (particularly news content) held by BUFVC.\u000d\u000a      The search interface has many novel features (e.g. indication of how easy\u000d\u000a      it is obtain the footage) and at launch in April 2012 showed a marked\u000d\u000a      increase on the first three months of the year: 81,635 page views compared\u000d\u000a      with the previous high of 5,035 in February; 82, 953 total searches\u000d\u000a      against 12,163 in March; and 17,891 unique visitors compared with 284 in\u000d\u000a      January 2012. Extensive user testing demonstrated the utility of the\u000d\u000a      concepts developed in the underpinning research to the development of\u000d\u000a      search criteria.\u000d\u000a    In 2001 it was possible for one commentator to write: `It is doubtful...\u000d\u000a      that the publication of TV archives on the Internet will soon become a\u000d\u000a      general practice: copyright issues, not to speak of the technical costs,\u000d\u000a      will still be the major obstacle for on-line transmission of such\u000d\u000a      material... it is not difficult to bet that the access to archives will\u000d\u000a      remain for a long time the privilege of a small number of researchers.'\u000d\u000a      (Andr&#233; Lange, The Historian, Television and Television History,\u000d\u000a      2001, p. 43).

Ellis's contribution to the Wheatley collection\u000d\u000a      (Output 1) is also singled out in a review in Screen (50: 2, 2009,\u000d\u000a      pp. 257-9) for the way it identifies how television research is\u000d\u000a      complicated by the `endless and everyday' character of the medium. `His\u000d\u000a      list of questions that television historians may need to ask', the review\u000d\u000a      goes on, `does not just \"create a clear means of discriminating between\u000d\u000a      the vast swathes of material that exist\" but, more importantly, helps us\u000d\u000a      to reexamine the ways in which \"the idea of the canon concentrates on\u000d\u000a      specific texts (rather than structures or history)\"'.\u000d\u000a    ","ResearchSubjectAreas":[{"Level1":"20","Level2":"2","Subject":"Cultural Studies"}],"Sources":"\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The importance of EUscreen to the overall Europeana project can be\u000d\u000a        corroborated by the Executive Director, Europeana\u000d\u000a      EU user statistics and Royal Holloway's involvement with EUscreen and\u000d\u000a        VideoActive can be corroborated by the Manager of Research and\u000d\u000a        Development of Nederlands Instituut voor Beeld en Geluid\u000d\u000a      Royal Holloway's involvement in VideoActive\/EUscreencan be\u000d\u000a        corroborated by Cinecitta Luce, Fondazione Rinascimento Digitale\u000d\u000a      Improved search statistics and performance for BUFVC can be\u000d\u000a        corroborated by the Chief Executive of BUFVC\u000d\u000a      Changes in archiving practice as a result of the research: National\u000d\u000a        Film &amp; TV Archive can be corroborated by the Head of Television,\u000d\u000a        British Film Institute\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    ","Title":"\u000d\u000a    Broadcast Television Archives: Access and Contextualisation\u000d\u000a    ","UKLocation":[],"UKRegion":[],"UOA":"Communication, Cultural and Media Studies, Library and Information Management ","UnderpinningResearch":"\u000d\u000a    Research by Ellis (Professor and co-PI VideoActive and EUscreen projects,\u000d\u000a      Royal Holloway, 2001-present), Johnson (Lecturer\/Senior Lecturer and co-PI\u000d\u000a      VideoActive and EUscreen projects, Royal Holloway, 2002-10) and Turnock\u000d\u000a      (Senior Research Fellow, VideoActive and EUscreen projects, Royal\u000d\u000a      Holloway, 2001-12 and 2013-16) has established the importance of all\u000d\u000a      television output as a resource for the future, demonstrating the\u000d\u000a      partiality of existing models of classification and cultural valuation of\u000d\u000a      television material. Ellis (2007) and Johnson (2007), as well as Ellis in\u000d\u000a      Johnson and Turnock (2005), exposed the foundations of predominant\u000d\u000a      judgements of value around television programming. Ellis (2006 and\u000d\u000a      elsewhere) argued for the importance of the most undervalued of output,\u000d\u000a      interstitial material (such as adverts, announcements, trailers and so\u000d\u000a      on), as valuable historical data as well as for the preservation of\u000d\u000a      television flow rather than just isolated programmes. Ellis (in Johnson\u000d\u000a      and Turnock 2005, pp. 36-56) and Johnson (2007) both reject the idea of\u000d\u000a      `best programme lists' in favour of everyday programming with great\u000d\u000a      personal importance for large numbers of contemporary viewers. This\u000d\u000a      research explored the difficult relationship between cultural values and\u000d\u000a      the practice of archival preservation and classification. It argued\u000d\u000a      consistently for the embedded nature of historical evidence in audiovisual\u000d\u000a      material, which is often not obvious at the time of production or of\u000d\u000a      archival selection and cataloguing. The research established the need for\u000d\u000a      context and curation of everyday televison, particularly if the material\u000d\u000a      is to be reused in ways that differ from its original broadcast use by\u000d\u000a      those with no particular knowledge of broadcasting history.\u000d\u000a    This work led directly to the involvement of Ellis, Johnson and Turnock\u000d\u000a      in the VideoActive project from 2006-9, a research project that made the\u000d\u000a      first attempt to create an online, universally accessible collection of\u000d\u000a      material from the archives of broadcasters across Europe. The project\u000d\u000a        established both selection criteria and cataloguing protocols,\u000d\u000a      created an initial collection and was important in refining and developing\u000d\u000a      the work of the Royal Holloway group. Johnson (2008) and Turnock (2008)\u000d\u000a      offer a pioneering approach to the comparative study of popular television\u000d\u000a      forms across Europe, presenting ideas of national specificity and\u000d\u000a      transnational comparison that have informed the group's perspective and\u000d\u000a      method. The VideoActive research project itself enabled the testing and\u000d\u000a      dissemination of the group's ideas to the TV archive community across\u000d\u000a      Europe. The project consisted of an innovative combination of three\u000d\u000a      university groups (Royal Holloway; Utrecht; Greek National Technical\u000d\u000a      University) and 13 broadcaster archives involving the integration of\u000d\u000a      television research and audio-visual material. A general description can\u000d\u000a      be found at http:\/\/videoactive.wordpress.com\/workplan-2\/.\u000d\u000a      At the outset, Turnock developed the project criteria for content\u000d\u000a      selection based on the group's approach (http:\/\/videoactive.files.wordpress.com\/2007\/10\/23_content_selection_strategy_report.pdf).\u000d\u000a    This involved detailed decisions about the commonalities amongst very\u000d\u000a      different local practices in areas as diverse as genre definition, series\u000d\u000a      and magazine formats, and titles in multiple languages and Turnock oversaw\u000d\u000a      the implementation of this schema for VideoActive. In this way, the\u000d\u000a      VideoActive research project developed the first common cataloguing\u000d\u000a        criteria for TV archives across Europe, and established the\u000d\u000a      prototype for a universally-accessible website of European archival TV.\u000d\u000a      This has been successfully applied to the EUScreen online archive (see www.euscreen.eu). Turnock (2010)\u000d\u000a      reports on the experience of the VideoActive action research. VideoActive\u000d\u000a      established both a prototype and a viable form of co-operation amongst\u000d\u000a      disparate broadcaster archives which has been much extended for EUscreen.\u000d\u000a      VideoActive brought these archives together to create a common platform\u000d\u000a      for the display of material from their collections. This project was based\u000d\u000a      on a consensus among the archive partners (which developed during the\u000d\u000a      project on the basis of the selection criteria developed by Turnock) about\u000d\u000a      both the cultural and political value of everyday TV, and the role played\u000d\u000a      by television in the formation and development of a shared European\u000d\u000a      identity. VideoActive also established, again based on the selection\u000d\u000a      criteria, the first common metadata schema for archival material held by\u000d\u000a      European broadcasters.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"30365","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    A new approach to understanding and evidencing the value of museum\u000d\u000a          experiences The GLOs provided the museums sector with a robust\u000d\u000a      and rigorously tested means of evaluating and reporting on the impact of\u000d\u000a      museum experiences on visitors' learning, a methodology that has meant\u000d\u000a      `continued high levels of both awareness and use across the sector' (10)\u000d\u000a      amongst museum professionals, policy makers and funders across the UK. The\u000d\u000a      focus on outcomes is significant for the museums sector: prior to the\u000d\u000a      GLOs, museums demonstrated their value primarily through outputs (e.g.\u000d\u000a      visitor numbers, number of exhibitions), an approach that failed to\u000d\u000a      capture their social, educational and cultural impact. The GLOs provided a\u000d\u000a      much more sophisticated and nuanced way for museum practitioners to\u000d\u000a      understand (and ultimately to enhance) the learning experiences they\u000d\u000a      provided for visitors as well as a rigorous way to collect and present\u000d\u000a      credible and compelling evidence of the outcomes of their activities to\u000d\u000a      funders and governing bodies.\u000d\u000a    By 2008, as Sue Wilkinson (then Director of Policy and Sustainability at\u000d\u000a      the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council) confirmed, the GLOs shaped\u000d\u000a      the approach to museum education evaluation in 77% of museums in England (19).\u000d\u000a      A report by the Culture and Learning Consortium in 2009 - Get It: The\u000d\u000a        Power of Cultural Learning &#8212; (9) asserted that the GLOs were\u000d\u000a      `now used widely in the sector to plan and evaluate learning'. Since then,\u000d\u000a      the GLOs have become increasingly embedded in the thinking and practice of\u000d\u000a      museums across the UK. All museums in England in receipt of government\u000d\u000a      funding (through Renaissance in the Regions and subsequent\u000d\u000a      schemes, now administered by Arts Council England) were aware of the GLOs\u000d\u000a      and the vast majority reported that awareness extended beyond their\u000d\u000a      learning teams and had been used more widely in partnership programmes\u000d\u000a      with other (non-Renaissance funded) organisations (10). Most\u000d\u000a      reported using the GLOs to help shape their thinking about learning.\u000d\u000a      `Three quarters of Heads of Learning from Renaissance-funded museums\u000d\u000a      consider that the GLOs have helped the sector to take on board a wider\u000d\u000a      definition of learning, with almost as many feeling that the GLOs have\u000d\u000a      given the sector a shared language to talk about museum learning' (10).\u000d\u000a    CyMAL, part of the Welsh Assembly government, endorses the GLOs framework\u000d\u000a      as part of its grant programme and museums are encouraged to use it in\u000d\u000a      developing evaluation for their projects (11). The Northern\u000d\u000a      Ireland Museums Council (2009) (12) recommended that the GLOs be\u000d\u000a      adopted as a standard quality and assurance mechanism across its museums.\u000d\u000a      Museums and Galleries Scotland promotes the GLOs for evaluation by its\u000d\u000a      members (13) and the Royal Commission on the Ancient and\u000d\u000a      Historical Monuments of Scotland used the GLOs in their 2009 project, Treasured\u000a        Places (14). A growing number of UK Science and Discovery\u000d\u000a      Centres have adopted the GLOs to measure the impact of their programmes (15),\u000d\u000a      including Techniquest in Wales.\u000d\u000a    A tool to enhance visitor experiences\u000d\u000a      Although intended primarily for use by learning professionals in the\u000d\u000a      museum sector to evaluate the impact of learning programmes with a range\u000d\u000a      of visitors, the GLOs have gone on to impact the sector in unanticipated\u000d\u000a      ways, most notably through their use to underpin the planning of major new\u000d\u000a      capital developments in museums. For example, the GLOs underpinned the\u000d\u000a      &#163;47million redevelopment of the National Museum of Scotland in 2008-2011 (10).\u000d\u000a      Indeed, many national museums have adopted the GLOs to inform their\u000d\u000a      approach to a wide range of initiatives. The Imperial War Museum, for\u000d\u000a      example, has embedded the GLOs into working practices across the museum.\u000d\u000a      Since 2008 the Museum's use of the GLOs has become increasingly extensive\u000d\u000a      and sophisticated across the organisation. The museum's staff use the\u000d\u000a      framework to evaluate all their programmes, and to inform the ongoing\u000d\u000a      development of their learning provision. The GLOs underpin the\u000d\u000a      interpretive approach to all major gallery and exhibition developments,\u000d\u000a      including the new First World War gallery which will open in 2014 (10).\u000d\u000a    Influencing cultural policy\u000d\u000a      Although developed specifically for use by museums, the GLO framework &#8212; by\u000d\u000a      offering a flexible, rigorous and credible means of capturing the impact\u000d\u000a      of cultural engagement on the individual &#8212; has significantly impacted the\u000d\u000a      work of policy makers, funders and related agencies in the cultural\u000d\u000a      sector. For example, the Heritage Lottery Fund, the largest dedicated\u000d\u000a      funder of the UK's heritage with around &#163;375 million per annum to invest\u000d\u000a      in new projects, continues to encourage use by all funding recipients of\u000d\u000a      the GLOs for evaluating the impact of their work (16). HLF's\u000d\u000a      recently published 2013-18 Strategic Framework now includes a single aim\u000d\u000a      and set of outcomes for people that have been informed by the GLOs. GLOs\u000d\u000a      will also form part of the evaluation framework for the new Museums and\u000d\u000a      Schools Programme, a &#163;3.6 million targeted investment by the Department\u000d\u000a      for Education in response to the Henley Review (10).\u000d\u000a    The influence of the GLOs has spread across the cultural sector beyond\u000d\u000a      museums to organisations as diverse as the BBC, National Trust and the UK\u000d\u000a      Association for Science and Discovery Centres. The latter looked to the\u000d\u000a      GLOs as a methodology `used extensively by most government-funded museums\u000d\u000a      in England,' to develop a set of indicators to measure the collective\u000d\u000a      impact of science and discovery centres (15).\u000d\u000a    The GLOs beyond the UK\u000d\u000a      The interest in the GLOs is not confined to the UK. Internationally, an\u000d\u000a      increasing number of museums are looking at adopting and adapting the GLOs\u000d\u000a      framework for their own contexts. For example, in Sweden, Malmo Museums\u000d\u000a      used the GLOs to evaluate the experiences of children and teachers during\u000d\u000a      a pilot project in 2008. Several other Swedish museums have followed,\u000d\u000a      supported by training sessions on the use of the framework. The Swedish\u000d\u000a      Exhibition Agency, Riksutst&#228;llningar, is using the GLOs in 2013 as a\u000d\u000a      creative development tool for the museum\/art\/science\/heritage sector, with\u000d\u000a      seminars and training courses. In 2011 a study carried out at the\u000d\u000a      University of Lund explored the relevance of the GLOs for the Swedish\u000d\u000a      cultural sector concluding that they `can help balance the economics-based\u000d\u000a      discourse and put more focus on the qualitative aspects and values of\u000d\u000a      museums and culture.' (17, 20) In Austria, the Exhibition\u000d\u000a      Evaluation Manager of KIMUS Kindermuseum in Graz has used the Generic\u000d\u000a      Learning Outcomes to evaluate their programmes since 2010 (18). In\u000d\u000a      the US, the GLOs have been used to determine educational programme impact\u000d\u000a      at the St Louis Zoo since 2012 (21).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    For decades, museums tended to describe and present their social and\u000d\u000a      cultural value through simplistic measures such as visitor numbers;\u000d\u000a      understanding the impact of museums on their visitors was elusive and\u000d\u000a      there was no means of collecting this evidence and presenting it in a\u000d\u000a      rigorous, coherent and useful way.

The Research Centre for Museums and\u000d\u000a      Galleries (RCMG) - established in 1999 with the explicit goal of pursuing\u000d\u000a      research that would directly engage with cultural institutions and policy\u000d\u000a      makers and funders; shape museum practice; and benefit audiences - was\u000d\u000a      commissioned by the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (the MLA,\u000d\u000a      formerly Re:source) to undertake LIRP as part of a broader initiative, Inspiring\u000d\u000a        Learning for All, an improvement framework for museums, libraries\u000d\u000a      and archives to develop more effective learning environments for their\u000d\u000a      users. The research objectives of LIRP were:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      To develop an understanding of `learning' and `learning outcomes' in\u000d\u000a        museums, archives and libraries informed by both current theoretical\u000d\u000a        approaches to lifelong learning and contemporary practice in the sector.\u000d\u000a      To develop a limited number of generic methods\/tools of collecting,\u000d\u000a        collating, analysing and demonstrating evidence of these learning\u000d\u000a        outcomes.\u000d\u000a      To develop an Evaluation Plan and Toolkit that shows how to use the\u000d\u000a        tools in organisations across the sector on a regular basis, and how to\u000d\u000a        collect, analyse and present the evidence of learning across the sector\u000d\u000a        as a whole.\u000d\u000a      To add value to the Evaluation Toolkit through providing additional\u000d\u000a        methods\/tools of demonstrating learning outcomes that may be used to\u000d\u000a        provide supplementary evidence specific to individual organisations.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    LIRP ran from 2001-2003. The research team was led by Professor Eilean\u000d\u000a      Hooper-Greenhill (PI), former Director of RCMG, and Jocelyn Dodd (CoI),\u000d\u000a      Research Manager. Over 700 cultural professionals were involved in\u000d\u000a      consultation and piloting of the GLOs. The GLOs were founded on the\u000d\u000a      premise that learning outcomes are experienced by individuals but can be\u000d\u000a      classified into five broad categories of learning impact (6, 7):\u000d\u000a      Knowledge and Understanding; Skills; Attitudes and Values; Enjoyment,\u000d\u000a      Inspiration, Creativity; and Activity, Behaviour, Progression.\u000d\u000a    The GLOs draw on socio-cultural and constructivist notions of learning as\u000d\u000a      a process of active meaning-making where learning is lifelong, involving\u000d\u000a      the emotions and the intellect. The GLOs are designed to be open-ended and\u000d\u000a      flexible in order to respond to a broad range of learning experiences that\u000d\u000a      take place in museums, libraries and archives, and to take into account\u000d\u000a      that the informal learning environment of cultural organisations makes it\u000d\u000a      especially difficult to determine the outcomes of informal learning\u000d\u000a      experiences where learners establish their own agendas (7, 8).\u000d\u000a      Immediately following LIRP, RCMG was commissioned by Museums, Libraries\u000d\u000a      and Archives Council (MLA) and the Department of Culture, Media and Sport\u000d\u000a      (DCMS) to pioneer the GLOs methodology on a large-scale. Four national\u000d\u000a      studies from 2003-2007 (2, 3, 4, 5) collected evidence of learning\u000d\u000a      impact from schools and community groups using museums, involving\u000d\u000a      approximately 70,000 participants. The research provided rich evidence of\u000d\u000a      the significance and value of museum learning experiences, and\u000d\u000a      demonstrated the robustness of the GLOs as a method. The results of this\u000d\u000a      research, when presented as part of MLA's submission to the Comprehensive\u000d\u000a      Spending Review (2004), was described by the Treasury as the `most\u000d\u000a      compelling evidence'. It played a significant part in securing an extra\u000d\u000a      &#163;15 million of public funding for the museum sector. Keith Nicol, then\u000d\u000a      Deputy Director, Museums, Libraries and Cultural Property Division,\u000d\u000a      Department for Culture, Media and Sport wrote: `The innovative and well\u000d\u000a      designed research of RCMG has provided valuable evidence and insight which\u000d\u000a      has been used to inform Government policy in museum education'.\u000d\u000a    The use of the GLOs by professional researchers to carry out research and\u000d\u000a      impact studies might have been an end in itself; however it was only the\u000d\u000a      beginning of the take-up of the GLOs by the museum profession in the UK\u000d\u000a      and beyond.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"30501","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1835841","Name":"South Korea"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1668284","Name":"Taiwan"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research has impacted policy and practice in museums and heritage\u000d\u000a      bodies internationally and\u000d\u000a      produced projects in UK museums that have been visited by more than half a\u000d\u000a      million visitors.\u000d\u000a      Impact can be categorised in four main areas:\u000d\u000a    (1) Stimulating experimentation and shaping UK and international\u000d\u000a          museum practice\u000d\u000a      The research projects emerged out of recognition that, despite a\u000d\u000a      pronounced international trend in\u000d\u000a      museum practice towards more inclusive approaches to representation\u000d\u000a      (evidenced in numerous\u000d\u000a      museum projects that explicitly sought to redress the underrepresentation\u000d\u000a      of women, minority\u000d\u000a      ethnic and indigenous communities, faith groups and sexual minorities),\u000d\u000a      the lives and histories of\u000d\u000a      disabled people had been almost entirely overlooked.

Bridget\u000d\u000a      Telfer (Audience\u000d\u000a      Development Coordinator) stated: `All the thinking embedded in the\u000d\u000a      Leicester research was applied\u000d\u000a      to our exhibition, enabling us to break new ground and tackle a topic that\u000d\u000a      was entirely new for the\u000d\u000a      RCP'.

Rachel Hasted comments; 'I\u000d\u000a      had not known where\u000d\u000a      to start and I considered myself a progressive museum professional who had\u000d\u000a      been working on\u000d\u000a      inclusive representation for some time. Rethinking Disability\u000d\u000a      Representation was ground breaking,\u000d\u000a      showing this was a subject that can be researched to a high level of\u000d\u000a      scholarship as a serious\u000d\u000a      historical topic. It opened up a whole world, it represented a new model,\u000d\u000a      empowering and giving\u000d\u000a      voice to disabled people' (9).\u000d\u000a    - Participation in the research by the Imperial War Museum has\u000d\u000a      impacted the organisation's\u000d\u000a      ongoing practice. Sam Heywood, Director of Public Programmes states:\u000d\u000a      `Disability representation\u000d\u000a      is now a cross departmental responsibility with curators, historians, a\u000d\u000a      learning officer and designer\u000d\u000a      discussing the issues.

A mixed methods evaluation of\u000d\u000a      visitors' responses to\u000d\u000a      these nine projects (capturing and analysing more than 1,700 individual\u000d\u000a      visitors' responses)\u000d\u000a      revealed that the project had had a significant positive impact on\u000d\u000a      visitors' attitudes to disability,\u000d\u000a      challenging stereotypes and prompting more empathetic ways of thinking and\u000d\u000a      talking about\u000d\u000a      disability (3, 5).\u000d\u000a    (3) Informing cultural policy\u000d\u000a      The research has generated considerable interest amongst practitioners and\u000d\u000a      policy makers\u000d\u000a      internationally. Rachel Hasted, former Head of Social Inclusion and\u000d\u000a      Diversity at English Heritage\u000d\u000a      (2013) states that the research, `has impacted on the development of\u000d\u000a      policy, consultation, archive\u000d\u000a      and record management and online interpretation at English Heritage' (9)\u000d\u000a      and informed the\u000d\u000a      approach taken in their major project launched in 2012, Disability in\u000d\u000a        Time and Place, that reveals\u000d\u000a      how disabled peoples' lives are integral to the heritage all around us.\u000d\u000a      Heather Smith, Equality\u000d\u000a      Specialist at the National Trust (2013), comments; `The research\u000d\u000a      has informed us of how we can\u000d\u000a      tell stories of disabled people in an appropriate manner. We are now\u000d\u000a      developing strategy and\u000d\u000a      practice in this area' (11).\u000d\u000a    Since 2008, we have accepted invitations to share the research findings\u000d\u000a      with non-HEI groups\u000d\u000a      (museum professionals, arts agencies, government bodies concerned with\u000d\u000a      culture and education)\u000d\u000a      in Taiwan, Korea, the US, Sweden, Holland, Canada, Australia and Japan.

The projects were conceived and carried out\u000d\u000a      by Jocelyn Dodd (Senior\u000d\u000a      Research Fellow and Director, RCMG) and Richard Sandell (Professor of\u000d\u000a      Museum Studies):\u000d\u000a    - (i) In 2004, a project funded through the AHRB's Innovation Awards\u000d\u000a      Scheme, entitled\u000d\u000a      Buried in the Footnotes, set out to explore why museums &#8212; that were\u000d\u000a      increasingly concerned to\u000d\u000a      represent diverse communities through their collections, exhibitions and\u000d\u000a      public programmes &#8212; had\u000d\u000a      almost entirely overlooked the lives and experiences of disabled people. A\u000d\u000a      survey of more than\u000d\u000a      200 museum and gallery institutions across the UK found an unexpected and\u000d\u000a      extraordinarily rich\u000d\u000a      (in scale and scope) body of material culture and artworks held within\u000d\u000a      collections that linked in\u000d\u000a      different ways to disability history and culture (1). However,\u000d\u000a      this vast body of material was very\u000d\u000a      rarely displayed to the public and, where it had been included in\u000d\u000a      exhibitions, the object\/artwork's\u000d\u000a      connection to disability was usually omitted from accompanying\u000d\u000a      interpretation. Interviews with\u000d\u000a      curators revealed a suite of anxieties and concerns about publicly\u000d\u000a      presenting this material. These\u000d\u000a      anxieties contributed to the collective absence of the UK's largest\u000d\u000a      minority, people with physical\u000d\u000a      and mental differences, across the narratives presented in UK museums (1,\u000d\u000a        2, 3, 4).\u000d\u000a    - (ii) A second project, (2006-2009) funded by the National Endowment for\u000d\u000a      Science,\u000d\u000a      Technology and the Arts and the Heritage Lottery Fund with contributions\u000d\u000a      from participating\u000d\u000a      museums (totalling &#163;.5m) &#8212; entitled Rethinking Disability\u000d\u000a        Representation in Museums and Galleries\u000d\u000a      &#8212; used collaborative action research, bringing together disability\u000d\u000a      activists, researchers and\u000d\u000a      museum professionals to shape nine new narratives (embodied in\u000d\u000a      exhibitions, displays and\u000d\u000a      educational resources for secondary school children) that were\u000d\u000a      subsequently exhibited and utilised\u000d\u000a      in programmes with schools and general visitors in museums across the UK\u000d\u000a      ranging from major\u000d\u000a      national institutions (the Imperial War Museum) to small volunteer run\u000d\u000a      museums (such as Whitby\u000d\u000a      Museum).

But they would be well advised to read the Gray-Bell book'\u000d\u000a      (TD 10.7.13); Steve\u000d\u000a      Humphries (Testimony Films) added: `For me it is the best analysis of\u000d\u000a        history programme making\u000d\u000a        in Britain that has ever been produced. On this basis I have recommended\u000d\u000a        it to friends and\u000d\u000a        colleagues'. (SH 17.6.13). This reception shows that our research\u000d\u000a      has permeated the professional\u000d\u000a      community causing them to reflect on their practices, and that the impact\u000d\u000a      of the research is\u000d\u000a      continuing to grow amongst the professional community.\u000d\u000a    European Context\u000d\u000a    Whilst the project focused on UK television productions, our preliminary\u000d\u000a      research attracted interest\u000d\u000a      from scholars in other parts of Europe who were pursuing similar but\u000d\u000a      isolated forms of research.\u000d\u000a      This was reflected in participants in a symposium organized at Lincoln,\u000d\u000a      `Televising the History: the\u000d\u000a      past(s) on the small screen' (Lincoln 2005), which resulted in a journal\u000d\u000a      special issue and an edited\u000d\u000a      collection.\u000d\u000a    Our research was picked up by Professor Pierre Sorlin's project for\u000d\u000a      Assemblea Legislativa della\u000d\u000a      Regione Emilia-Romagna `For a European TV History'. We produced two\u000d\u000a      reports on UK television\u000d\u000a      history programmes for their symposia `Audio Visual Media and European\u000d\u000a      Community Culture' and\u000d\u000a      `For a European TV History', Bologna, 2008 and 2009. We challenged the\u000d\u000a      conservative tendency\u000d\u000a      of their project to emphasise traditional forms of documentary. Our final\u000d\u000a      research report, which\u000d\u000a      argued for the value and importance of popular forms of history\u000d\u000a      programming, was included in the\u000d\u000a      Tanti passati per un futuro comune?

The key research\u000d\u000a      question for the Televising\u000d\u000a      History project was to discover ` how we get the kinds of television\u000d\u000a      histories we do, and why'. The\u000d\u000a      research drew on theoretical and conceptual frameworks from historical\u000d\u000a      studies (historiography),\u000d\u000a      cultural studies (semiotics, memory studies, theories of identity) and\u000d\u000a      media studies (media theory,\u000d\u000a      production studies).\u000d\u000a    The research had three strands:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000ahistory programmes, their genres, sub and hybrid genres and\u000d\u000a        specific aesthetics and\u000d\u000a        styles related to different types of programmes;\u000d\u000a      \u000aprofessional and public historians, as knowledge producers,\u000d\u000a        disseminators and\u000d\u000a        consumers;\u000d\u000a      \u000aproduction environment, including terrestrial and satellite\u000d\u000a        broadcasters and independent\u000d\u000a        producers.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Our methodology involved conducting interviews and discussion groups\u000d\u000a      (with historians, authors\u000d\u000a      and media professionals, including commissioning editors); analysing trade\u000d\u000a      journals; and analysing\u000d\u000a      a variety of television history programmes including documentary,\u000d\u000a      commemorative, `reality history'\u000d\u000a      and hybrid genres.\u000d\u000a    The research charted important developments in programme styles, genres,\u000d\u000a      transmission times\u000d\u000a      and channel location and identified the main production units and\u000d\u000a      personnel involved. It also\u000d\u000a      explored the processes through which academic historical knowledge came to\u000d\u000a      the screen, the\u000d\u000a      ways that academic historians were incorporated into the `business of\u000d\u000a      television' and their\u000d\u000a      perceptions of their treatment within this process. Our exploration of\u000d\u000a      television history as an\u000d\u000a      important, and highly-visible form of public history was a key theme in\u000d\u000a      these discussions. We\u000d\u000a      explored views of key media professionals on the place of history\u000d\u000a      programming within television\u000d\u000a      and the commissioning and production practices. We also examined how\u000d\u000a      independent producers\u000d\u000a      developed and pitched successful commissions.\u000d\u000a    Key findings relevant to impact:\u000d\u000a    Television history programming is an important form of `public history',\u000d\u000a      in that it is the principal\u000d\u000a      means by which most people learn about history today.\u000d\u000a    Personal and professional networks within the media community exert a key\u000d\u000a      influence on the\u000d\u000a      production and working practices of TV history, which in turn shapes the\u000d\u000a      resulting television output.\u000d\u000a      The research thus encouraged this central constituency of practitioners to\u000d\u000a      reflect on its practice.\u000d\u000a    There were significant gaps within the overall content and presentation\u000d\u000a      of history programmes, and\u000d\u000a      in particular those of gender, class and ethnicity.\u000d\u000a    The production process was `commissioner led' meaning that themes and\u000d\u000a      topics of interest to\u000d\u000a      commissioners and broadcasters defined the resulting offer of programmes.\u000d\u000a      Consequently only a\u000d\u000a      relatively narrow range of perspectives on the past is offered to viewers.\u000d\u000a    Genres of history programming aimed at broader audiences, eg celebrity\u000d\u000a      family histories and\u000d\u000a      reality history could be, and often were, innovative in their approach to\u000d\u000a      the presentation of the past.\u000d\u000a    The research was undertaken between 2006 and 2010 by Professor Ann Gray,\u000d\u000a      Professor of\u000d\u000a      Cultural Studies and Dr Erin Bell, Research Fellow, University of Lincoln.\u000d\u000a      Dr Bell is now a Senior\u000d\u000a      Lecturer in History at the University of Lincoln.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"31863","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The exhibition, `India &#8212; Past, Present and Abroad' was mounted at\u000a      Macquarie University Art Gallery; 24 January &#8212; 4 March 2011, and curated\u000a      by Jane Chapman, Rhonda Davis and Leonard Janiszewski.

A Q &amp; A session sparked many questions and comments\u000a        creating space for an open-ended dialogue to occur. It was interesting\u000a        to witness this level of engagement and I believe this was largely due\u000a        to the quality of the research undertaken' (Rhonda Davis 31.10.12).\u000a    Ms Davis commented on how the exhibition illuminated the ways in which\u000a      disempowered women tried to get coverage of their campaigning by using\u000a      newspapers as a vehicle for communication. This revealed a hidden aspect\u000a      of history, but also suggested new methodological approaches to analysis\u000a      of the press:\u000a    `The way of working with newspapers that enquires into their effect\u000a        and the way they were used by disempowered people was also new to\u000a        audiences, who were able to better appreciate historical method for\u000a        `hidden' history from below' (Davis op cit).\u000a    The Guest Speaker at the opening event was the then Indian Consul, Amit\u000a      Das Gupta, who spoke about the research indicating its significance to\u000a      contemporary issues of identity and belonging. He said `The spate of\u000a        attacks on Indian students and members of the Indian community in\u000a        Australia in 2009-10 triggered outrage in Australia, India and among the\u000a        global community. Institutions of higher education emerged as the ideal\u000a        platform to nourish this dialogue and to trigger a debate. The Indian\u000a        community has sought to not only draw on its 'Indianness' but also to\u000a        embrace its new- found identity. The unique exhibition 'India: Past,\u000a      Present and Abroad' explores precisely this theme, and the talk by Jane\u000a        Chapman drew the audience into looking at the role the media played in\u000a        India's struggle for freedom from British colonial occupation.\u000a        Discovering identity or even revisiting ones roots is not an easy\u000a        process. Such projects can only help build the foundations for a\u000a        discovery by a continent of a sub continent and by a subcontinent of a\u000a        continent (Amit Das Gupta (29.10.12).\u000a    Non-Indian Australian visitors were introduced to aspects of Indian\u000a      culture and history, knowledge of which is overshadowed by larger and\u000a      longer standing immigrant communities such as those from China. A member\u000a      of the general public said: I was first drawn to the lecture because\u000a        at that time, a number of distressing issues had occurred against\u000a        immigrants from India in both Sydney and Melbourne. ...Little did I know\u000a        India is a Nation of plurality, or sub-cultures within culture. Jane\u000a        Chapman's work, helped dispel many of these initial thoughts or\u000a        misconceptions that I had developed in my early life. The public lecture\u000a        unearthed several confronting issues from a humanist perspective and the\u000a        frailty of the human condition. In some ways the aftermath when cultures\u000a        collide formed the symbolism I found by attending this public lecture,\u000a        delivered a form of serendipity I least expected. This exhibition in\u000a        many ways captured the essence of the numerous moments in time, in an\u000a        artful way. The lecture altered my way of thinking and knowledge about\u000a        India. I left the lecture and exhibition charged with the thought that\u000a        unearthing and presenting these hidden histories are important'\u000a      (Michael Bolton, 30.10.2012).\u000a    The event also attracted attention from Indian media in Australia, as\u000a      follows: Following his attendance at the opening of the exhibition,\u000a      Chandra Devudu, Executive Producer,of the Kannada Language Program for SBS\u000a      Radio conducted an interview with Jane Chapman for his weekly network\u000a      programme aimed at the Kannada Indian community in Australia. He said: `It\u000a        was educating and illuminating. Hope we will meet again to discuss about\u000a        Indian history, again.' (Chandra Devudu, 23.2.11)\u000a    In addition, two feature articles were published in India Link,\u000a      the weekly magazine for Indian immigrants in Australia. The Editor,\u000a      Shivangi Ambani, noted; `It's great to know the exhibition is getting\u000a        such a good response'. Shivangi Ambani, Editor, Indian Link\u000a      (8 Feb. 2011);'\u000a    The exhibition also provoked suggestions from community leaders for\u000a      future involvement with Indian artists in Australia: Great exhibition\u000a        and audience development. You might like to invite Barry Keldoulis as he\u000a        represents some Indian artists and he might like to network at that\u000a        level'(Edwina Marks, Manager Community Services, City of Wagga\u000a      Wagga, NSW, 27 January 2011).\u000a    In addition to the impact noted above, the Senior Curator of the\u000a      Macquarie University Art Gallery noted how working with Jane Chapman had\u000a      introduced her to new methods of presentation: From a curatorial\u000a        perspective, having the opportunity to work with Professor Jane Chapman\u000a        on the exhibition introduced new methodologies and ways of thinking in\u000a        contextualising the material to make those connections between the\u000a        visual frameworks and text analysis. Working within an interdisciplinary\u000a        curatorial team affords a unique transition between the research and\u000a        images in creating entry points for visitors to engage at a much deeper\u000a        level' (Rhonda Davis, op.cit.).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Broadly the impact of the research discussed is that of the provision of\u000a      knowledge of `hidden histories' that illuminate the contribution of\u000a      specific groups towards `cultural citizenship'.

UEFA had identified\u000a      Boyle through his international sports research profile as a possible\u000a      candidate to develop a module\u000a      for the first-ever Diploma in Football Management (DFM) programme (to be\u000a      delivered March-May\u000a      2012). Boyle was invited to a formal interview in Switzerland, and was\u000a      selected to help shape,\u000a      create and deliver the content for the Public Relations and Media\u000a      Operations module of the DFM\u000a      programme. Building on his previous research, Boyle was asked to address\u000a      the gaps in strategic\u000a      thinking around public relations and use of social media identified by\u000a      UEFA in many of their\u000a      member national organisations. Boyle led the content generation of the\u000a      module and worked with\u000a      the senior UEFA Media Officer to deliver the content via an online\u000a      e-learning programme and\u000a      seminars.\u000a    Improving access to professional development for organisations of all\u000a        sizes\u000a    The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), is one of 6\u000a      continental confederations of\u000a      world football's governing body, F&#233;d&#233;ration Internationale de Football\u000a      Association.

The first DFM was launched in 2011-2012 and comprised 36\u000a      participants, middle and\u000a      senior managers working across 30 national football associations varying\u000a      in size from large\u000a      (English, German and Spanish leagues) through to medium-sized (Dutch,\u000a      Turkish and Ukrainian)\u000a      and smaller associations (Welsh, Icelandic and Latvian). 2012 graduates\u000a      included; the Head of the\u000a      Legal Department at the Football Federation of Ukraine (FFU); Events\u000a      Manager at the German\u000a      Football Association (DFL); Head of Finance at the Football Association of\u000a      Wales; Club Licencing\u000a      Manager at the Football Association of Norway (NFF); Coordinator of\u000a      Strategy, Research and\u000a      Education at the Royal Dutch Football Association (KNVB); Coach Education\u000a      Manager at the\u000a      Football Association of Ireland (FAI) and four deputy-general secretaries\u000a      from the Bulgarian,\u000a      Latvian, Lithuanian and Polish football associations.\u000a    The National Co-ordinator of Coach Education of the Football Association\u000a      of Ireland said:\u000a    Having been a student on the UEFA Diploma in Football Management\u000a        Course, and\u000a        participated in Raymond Boyle's classes, I now have a more thorough,\u000a        detailed\u000a        understanding and strategic knowledge of PR, media relations and social\u000a        media within my\u000a        own National Association and beyond... Furthermore, having experienced\u000a        the module, it has\u000a        now enabled my staff and I within the Coach Education Dept to become\u000a        more proactive\u000a        when dealing with the press, rather than having to be reactionary as we\u000a        were in the past.\u000a    Updating vocational skills and strategic knowledge\u000a    The Public Relations and Media Operations module created by Boyle\u000a      directly helped shape the\u000a      strategic thinking of DFM participants with regards to i) the role and\u000a      position of public relations in\u000a      their organisation and the need for organisational change to engage more\u000a      fully with stakeholders;\u000a      ii) the tactical use of social media as part of their communication\u000a      strategy and iii) the need to\u000a      develop and change their strategic thinking and evaluation of corporate\u000a      social responsibility\u000a      programmes. At the Royal Netherlands Football Association (KNVB), for\u000a      example, communication\u000a      strategies were well-developed, but managed by separate departments with\u000a      independent\u000a      strategies concerning website management, social media, media relations,\u000a      corporate\u000a      communication and communication with fans and sponsors. Boyle's DFM module\u000a      highlighted the\u000a      need to fully integrate these separate policies and consequently, the\u000a      strength of the KNVB's\u000a      communication strategy has improved significantly.\u000a    The module PR and Media Operations helped the KNVB to strengthen\u000a        relationships with\u000a        important stakeholders. Especially in maintaining strong communication\u000a        with professional\u000a        clubs in The Netherlands, the content of the course helped to take\u000a        concrete action on\u000a        improving the PR strategy.\u000a    (Coordinator of Strategy, Research and Education, Royal Netherlands\u000a      Football Association).\u000a    Enhancing understanding of public and media relations\u000a    Boyle's significant research expertise shapes and informs the original\u000a      content he has created for\u000a      this core, mandatory Public Relations and Media Operations DFM module. It\u000a      focuses on the key\u000a      role that social media is playing in re-shaping football associations'\u000a      communication strategies as\u000a      well as providing a framework for modernising the communication thinking\u000a      within football\u000a      associations around the world. The Special Projects Assistant Manager for\u000a      the FA (English\u000a      Football Association), said;\u000a    This module has highlighted the importance of structures and\u000a        methodologies to set out an\u000a        organisation's media strategy. [The] content on social media and\u000a        journalism is shaping our\u000a        strategic thinking as we embrace new technology as well as recognising\u000a        the importance of\u000a        `new journalists'...

The research has involved sit down interviews\u000a      with a wide range of\u000a      professional practitioners working across journalism, public relations and\u000a      the sports industry.\u000a      These have included senior managers responsible for sport and\u000a      communications at media\u000a      organisations such as the BBC, Channel 4 and The Times and\u000a      football clubs such as Manchester\u000a      United and Celtic. It has also involved the development of original case\u000a      studies involving PR\u000a      activity and sports organisations.\u000a    Key research findings include:\u000a    1) Communication managers recognising aspects of continuity in the\u000a      sports-media\u000a      relationship, as well as documenting elements of these relationships as\u000a      they change (for\u000a      example, the strategic importance television still plays in shaping media\u000a      sports policy);\u000a    2) Providing a detailed account of the developing strategic thinking\u000a      required by media\u000a      managers working within sporting national associations as they attempt to\u000a      integrate social\u000a      media into their existing communication strategies and organisational\u000a      structures;\u000a    3) Identifying the key risks and challenges faced by public relations\u000a      managers of new patterns\u000a      of media consumption and distribution among their key stakeholders and the\u000a      media;\u000a    4) Analysing and documenting the impact that the changing professional\u000a      practice of sports\u000a      journalists has on their role as cultural intermediaries between national\u000a      organisations and\u000a      stakeholders, and how this shapes communication strategies of governing\u000a      bodies of sport\u000a      (and football in particular).\u000a    The specific work discussed here has emerged since 2010, with its focus\u000a      on social media and\u000a      organisational change. In 2013 Boyle was invited to create additional\u000a      content based on his\u000a      research for the Communications and Public Relations module, which will\u000a      form part of the UEFA\u000a      Certificate in Football Management, and rolled out across national\u000a      associations from 2014.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"33106","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The communications industries regulated by Ofcom cover all broadcast\u000d\u000a      media, telephony, including broadband, wireless and mobile, and postal\u000d\u000a      services in the UK. Ofcom was established by statute in 2003 to address\u000d\u000a      transforming relations between broadcasting, telecommunications and radio\u000d\u000a      communications. While devolved governments were established in Scotland\u000d\u000a      and Wales in 1999, powers over broadcasting and overall communications\u000d\u000a      regulation remain `reserved' to the UK Parliament. Since the election of\u000d\u000a      the Scottish National Party in 2007, and the setting of a date for a\u000d\u000a      referendum on Scottish independence in 2014, the future of communications\u000d\u000a      in Scotland has become increasingly politically contentious. Key policy\u000d\u000a      choices &#8212; such as control over media regulation and public service\u000d\u000a      broadcasting &#8212; divide unionists and nationalists. Against this background,\u000d\u000a      research by Philip Schlesinger at Glasgow has shaped advice to the\u000d\u000a      regulator and contributed to the wider public debate.\u000d\u000a    Provided expert advice on the implications of regulation\u000d\u000a    As an established and well-respected academic in Scotland, Philip's views\u000d\u000a      on communications issues and `the politics' are sought, valued and\u000d\u000a      respected by Ofcom at many levels, including the Ofcom Board, the Nations\u000d\u000a      Committee and teams within Ofcom's executive structure involved in\u000d\u000a      developing regulatory policy across the communications sector....\u000d\u000a      &#8212;Director, Scotland, Ofcom\u000d\u000a    Schlesinger is a founding member of Ofcom's Advisory Committee for\u000d\u000a      Scotland (ACS, 2004-present) and became chairman in 2009. As chair,\u000d\u000a      Schlesinger leads an expert group which advises on UK policy developments\u000d\u000a      in public service broadcasting, telecommunications, radio communications\u000d\u000a      and post, which are all assessed for their potential impact on Scotland.\u000d\u000a      Schlesinger develops the ACS's agendas with Ofcom's Director Scotland and\u000d\u000a      shapes its written policy responses to Ofcom. He approves all final\u000d\u000a      submissions to Ofcom and other bodies, of which there have been 27 since\u000d\u000a      2009: of the 14 external submissions 7 went to the DCMS, 3 to the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Government and the remainder (4) to bodies such as the BBC Trust and the\u000d\u000a      Royal Society of Edinburgh. Thirteen internal submissions were sent to\u000d\u000a      Ofcom, accompanied by meetings with London-based officers, influencing the\u000d\u000a      Ofcom executive agenda across the entire regulatory field by identifying\u000d\u000a      Scotland's specific communications needs within the UK. Issues addressed\u000d\u000a      included the Digital Britain and Digital Scotland initiatives, media\u000d\u000a      ownership and plurality, mobile quality, spectrum (broader bandwidth\u000d\u000a      transmission), postal services, TV and radio licensing.\u000d\u000a    These interventions have generated clear outcomes. In February 2010\u000d\u000a      Schlesinger wrote a submission, dissenting from Ofcom's own views, which\u000d\u000a      transformed the way that Scottish broadcaster STV operated. Schlesinger\u000d\u000a      argued the proposal to reclassify STV as an independent producer would\u000d\u000a      have dominated the Scottish market, being the incumbent commercial TV\u000d\u000a      broadcaster as well as the largest producer apart from the BBC.\u000d\u000a      Schlesinger criticised the DCMS impact assessment because it focused\u000d\u000a      solely on the UK &#8212; where STV is relatively small &#8212; and ignored the local\u000d\u000a      effects of reclassification on the Scottish independent TV sector. Taking\u000d\u000a      this evidence into account, the DCMS decided not to reclassify STV.\u000d\u000a    Also in January 2013 Schlesinger's authority and reputation prompted\u000d\u000a      Ofcom to reference `discussions about the communications sector and its\u000d\u000a      regulation' occurring in Scotland prior to the 2014 referendum in their Annual\u000a        Plan 2013\/14 (p49:6.5) for the first time ever. This occurred as a\u000d\u000a      result of Schlesinger's ACS submission requesting that Ofcom explicitly\u000d\u000a      factor the Scottish policy debate into its strategic calculations.\u000d\u000a    In 2009 Schlesinger led a lobby of the committee chairs of the four\u000d\u000a      nations for more effective advisory input to Ofcom's Board. This pressure\u000d\u000a      supported the Ofcom Chairman's key initiative to create the Nations\u000d\u000a      Committee (2009-present), a major shift in internal governance as\u000d\u000a      territorial representation was regarded as of marginal importance when\u000d\u000a      Ofcom was founded. The Nations Committee, on which Schlesinger sits ex\u000d\u000a      officio, advises Ofcom's Board on how national questions affect UK-wide\u000d\u000a      regulation, thus influencing overall strategy.\u000d\u000a    Directly influenced UK policy and planning\u000d\u000a    Philip has been able to give measured advice to Ofcom and has ensured\u000d\u000a      through the ACS that Ofcom continues to gain a nuanced perspective on the\u000d\u000a      issues, a real sense of the political dimensions, and a greater awareness\u000d\u000a      for all Ofcom staff and Board members of the way in which the debate and\u000d\u000a      public opinion is developing [...]. His ability to ensure that Ofcom can\u000d\u000a      engage with appropriate Scottish stakeholders, including Ministerial and\u000d\u000a      Parliamentary representatives, is invaluable.\u000d\u000a      &#8212;Non Executive Ofcom Board Member and Chair of Ofcom Nations Committee\u000d\u000a    As a Nations Committee member, Schlesinger advises the Ofcom Board on\u000d\u000a      Scottish developments and privately briefs the Chairman and Nations\u000d\u000a      Committee Chair on Scottish matters. To demonstrate the attention now\u000d\u000a      focused on the possible challenge of independence, Schlesinger was invited\u000d\u000a      (in March 2013) to a special Board meeting with the Permanent Secretary to\u000d\u000a      the Scottish Government, which centred on the Scottish Government\u000d\u000a      communications agenda and relations with Ofcom. Following this meeting in\u000d\u000a      April 2013 Schlesinger was invited by the Permanent Secretary to discuss\u000d\u000a      the Scottish Government's proposed new regulatory model for\u000d\u000a      communications, which challenges Ofcom's monopoly. Schlesinger then\u000d\u000a      invited Scottish Government officials to discuss its regulatory plans with\u000d\u000a      the Advisory Committee, to inform further advice to Ofcom in July 2013.\u000d\u000a      Schlesinger was also invited privately to discuss policy options with the\u000d\u000a      First Minister's broadcasting adviser, with follow-up contact (August\u000d\u000a      2013). The key outcome of this activity has been to establish a new,\u000d\u000a      arms-length, focus for dialogue between Ofcom and the Scottish Government\u000d\u000a      in a highly delicate field. Ofcom has developed guidelines for dealing\u000d\u000a      with government during the run-up to the referendum. The ACS, which has an\u000d\u000a      independent advisory status, has been given leeway to engage in following\u000d\u000a      the debate &#8212; for instance by attending meetings &#8212; in ways that Ofcom\u000d\u000a      itself shies away from. Schlesinger drew up the guidelines for this\u000d\u000a      process (July 2013).\u000d\u000a    Schlesinger has been asked by Ofcom to continue as ACS chair until August\u000d\u000a      2015, well beyond the referendum. The Chairman of Ofcom (UK) states:\u000d\u000a      [Schlesinger's] rigour, his commitment to evidence-based policy making and\u000d\u000a      his networks in the social policy fields relevant to communications have\u000d\u000a      all combined to add great depth to Ofcom's work in this area.\u000d\u000a    His public role, however, extends beyond Ofcom. In autumn 2011\u000d\u000a      Schlesinger was appointed expert adviser on broadcasting to the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Parliament's Scotland Bill Committee (preparatory to passage of the\u000d\u000a      Scotland Act 2012). He advised the clerks on key issues, liaised with the\u000d\u000a      parliamentary research team, and drafted the Committee's Private Paper,\u000d\u000a      which set the agenda for MSPs' questioning of witnesses. He also advised\u000d\u000a      on communication with the DCMS regarding regional TV production quotas.\u000d\u000a      The Committee's Report on the Scotland Bill (15 December 2011) cited him\u000d\u000a      as an `eminent adviser'.\u000d\u000a    Contributed to public engagement and the wider debate\u000d\u000a    Schlesinger has helped make the issue of Scottish communications\u000d\u000a      accessible to a general audience through his contributions to the advicetoofcom.org\u000d\u000a      website and the London School of Economics' Media\u000a        Policy Project website.

In this context, he has had a\u000d\u000a      particular interest in nations without states (such as Scotland and\u000d\u000a      Catalonia) that present challenges to state power. Since 2007\u000d\u000a      Schlesinger's research at the University of Glasgow's Centre for Cultural\u000d\u000a      Policy Research has focused on developments in public policy and current\u000d\u000a      transformations in the UK's media and cultural industries. This\u000d\u000a      two-pronged agenda has shaped both Schlesinger's regular advice to Ofcom\u000d\u000a      and his contributions to public debate.\u000d\u000a    Within the EU, European institutions have challenged the exercise of\u000d\u000a      state power from above, while in some states devolutionary and separatist\u000d\u000a      tendencies have challenged it from below. The UK is an example of a state\u000d\u000a      with contrary forces at work. Political challenges at Westminster to\u000d\u000a      Britain's existing relationship with the EU are presently coupled with the\u000d\u000a      Scottish National Party Government's pursuit of independence for Scotland\u000d\u000a      from the United Kingdom. Schlesinger has researched how this tension plays\u000d\u000a      out in the fields of media and communications policies. His work has shown\u000d\u000a      how devolution in Scotland has reinforced a distinct sub-state\u000d\u000a      communicative space in the UK.\u000d\u000a    His recent work on the `creative economy' has shown how small groups of\u000d\u000a      insiders and privileged ideas have fundamentally shaped policy-making at\u000d\u000a      the UK level. This model-building and evidence-producing dominance\u000d\u000a      explains much of the Scottish Government's policy dependency on UK\u000d\u000a      approaches to the creative economy, now central to cultural policy\u000d\u000a      thinking in Scotland. The Scottish Government conforms to the views of the\u000d\u000a      UK Department of Culture, Media &amp; Sport (DCMS) of relations between\u000d\u000a      culture and the economy. However, his research shows how in its quest for\u000d\u000a      control over public service broadcasting, the nationalist government in\u000d\u000a      Scotland has constituted an increasingly explicit political challenge to\u000d\u000a      Westminster's `reserved' powers over communications. More fundamentally,\u000d\u000a      the Scottish Government is also now developing an alternative approach to\u000d\u000a      the UK Government with regard to communications regulation. Schlesinger's\u000d\u000a      advice to Ofcom and other public bodies, and his public interventions,\u000d\u000a      have made direct use of these findings.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"33611","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Pantomime has a long history in Scottish communities, with nearly a third\u000a      of all people in Scotland\u000a      in 2008-9 either attending a pantomime or taking part in an amateur or\u000a      professional production.\u000a      Pantomime is notable for its family and community spirit, with local\u000a      in-jokes and scripts, inclusive\u000a      spirit, and enduring popularity throughout the rise of digital and global\u000a      entertainments. Scullion and\u000a      Maloney's research project Pantomime in Scotland formed the basis\u000a      of a nationally touring\u000a      exhibition which ran over the winters of 2008-9 and 2009-10. Curated by\u000a      Scullion, the exhibition\u000a      was accompanied by a series of community events for schoolchildren,\u000a      families, elderly people and\u000a      the general public. This reflected the project's central aim of promoting\u000a      a wider public appreciation\u000a      of pantomime's contribution to Scottish culture. In addition to the\u000a      interactive multimedia touring\u000a      exhibition, materials collected over the course of the research, including\u000a      the newly discovered\u000a      archive of pantomime musical scores from the 1920s-40s, were produced on\u000a      DVD with a\u000a      companion booklet. The cultural archive was extended and developed with\u000a      the recollections of\u000a      members of the public gathered from those attending the exhibition or\u000a      related events. The\u000a      exhibition and related work attracted Scotland-wide media interest and\u000a      tapped into the community\u000a      spirit at the heart of pantomime, creating and interpreting cultural\u000a      capital and enriching the lives of\u000a      individuals and groups.\u000a    National touring exhibition\u000a    The Pantomime in Scotland exhibition covered pantomime's Victorian\u000a      origins up to the present\u000a      day, with memorabilia, audio recordings from the research survey of folk\u000a      memories of particular\u000a      shows, and archive film footage from the National Library of Scotland and\u000a      Scottish Screen of\u000a      shows from the 1930s-50s. The exhibition toured major theatres across\u000a      Scotland in pantomime\u000a      seasons 2008-9 and 2009-10, and was attended by over 63,000 members of the\u000a      public at venues\u000a      in the east and north of Scotland in 2008-9 (the King's Theatre Edinburgh,\u000a      Perth Theatre, Byre\u000a      Theatre St Andrews, His Majesty's Theatre Aberdeen and Eden Court Theatre\u000a      Inverness) and at\u000a      venues in the west of Scotland in 2009-10 (Motherwell Theatre, King's\u000a      Theatre Glasgow and the\u000a      MacRobert Centre Stirling).

The aim of\u000a      this unique project was\u000a      to explore, document and celebrate one of Scotland's great popular art\u000a      forms.

With reference to key critical\u000a      tropes of popular culture\u000a      and theatre, gender, local\/regional appeal, diaspora and national profile,\u000a      the project examined\u000a      pantomime images, representations and identities; memories, recollections\u000a      and histories;\u000a      economics, industry and infrastructure.\u000a    A major discovery for the project was a previously unknown private\u000a      collection of musical scores\u000a      and band parts written for pantomimes in Glasgow between the 1920s and\u000a      1940s.

The researchers\u000a      established the economic significance of pantomime, showing that 9% of the\u000a      population in\u000a      Scotland attended a professional pantomime in 2008-9 and 31% saw or were\u000a      involved in making a\u000a      non-professional pantomime. The 21 professional pantomimes that formed the\u000a      survey generated\u000a      total receipts of &#163;5.7 million, supported 291 jobs (132 directly, 291\u000a      indirectly), and generated a total\u000a      of &#163;3.46 million wages in Scotland.

The beneficiaries of her\u000d\u000a      work have been both professional voice-users and the general public (her\u000d\u000a      book was discussed by a wide range of websites, phone-in callers and\u000d\u000a      reviewers). The impact of her research is indicated in four ways:\u000d\u000a    Firstly, the four foreign editions of The Human Voice and its\u000d\u000a      recent publication as an ebook demonstrate the international interest\u000d\u000a      generated by her study. She drew on extensive scholarly research and made\u000d\u000a      it accessible, reaching wide and varied readerships and stimulating lively\u000d\u000a      online debate from a diversity of bodies, including the European Institute\u000d\u000a      of Brand Management (www.eurib.org\/fileadmin\/user_upload\/Documenten\/PDF\/Personal_branding_ENGELS\/w_-_The_human_voice__EN_.pdf),\u000a      the British Voice Association (www.britishvoiceassociation.org.uk\/books_TheHumanVoice_AnneKarpf.htm),\u000a      a Huffington Post blog (www.huffingtonpost.com\/jane-g-goldberg-phd\/importance-of-mothers-voice_b_899514.html)\u000d\u000a      and Polish television.\u000d\u000a    Secondly, the book was serialised in the Guardian, and was\u000d\u000a      reviewed in the Independent, the Sunday Telegraph, the Guardian,\u000d\u000a      and the Sunday Times, as well as many foreign newspapers and\u000d\u000a      magazines, including The New Yorker.\u000d\u000a    Thirdly, Karpf's many broadcasts dealing with her research generated\u000d\u000a      discussion about the role and importance of the human voice among many\u000d\u000a      different constituent groups. She appeared on `BBC Breakfast' on BBC1 (http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/1\/hi\/programmes\/breakfast\/5359618.stm),\u000a      and in 'The Voice', a BBC Four documentary (broadcast four times in 2008)\u000d\u000a      on why the synthesised voice sounds unnatural, as well as in an Australian\u000d\u000a      documentary on the human voice broadcast on the European arts and culture\u000d\u000a      channel, Arte, in 2013. On radio she discussed her research on BBC Radio\u000d\u000a      4's 'Start The Week', Radio 3's `Night Waves' and over a dozen phone-in\u000d\u000a      programmes in the USA, Australia and New Zealand. In 2012 a half-hour\u000d\u000a      interview with her about the voice was broadcast on the Australian network\u000d\u000a      ABC's national radio programme `Lingua Franca', and she discussed\u000d\u000a      intonation with Stephen Fry on his BBC Radio 4 programme 'Fry's English\u000d\u000a      Delight' (www.bbc.co.uk\/programmes\/b01m182n).\u000a      In 2013 she talked about women and radio on the South African radio\u000d\u000a      network SA FM, while she also wrote and presented an the hour-long BBC\u000d\u000a      Radio 4 programme on the history of women's voices on radio and television\u000d\u000a      &#8212; 'Archive on 4: Spoken Like a Woman' &#8212; which was listed in the Radio\u000d\u000a        Times' `Top Tip of the Week' and its `Critics' Choice' (www.radiotimes.com\/episode\/twhbv\/spoken-like-a-woman).\u000a      The Controller of BBC Radio 4 chose it as `Documentary of the Week' for a\u000d\u000a      Radio 4 podcast and it was also selected for permanent presence on\u000d\u000a      iPlayer.\u000d\u000a    Finally, Karpf developed her ideas about the voice in many different\u000d\u000a      symposia and events. These included 'La Voca Humana', a seminar held at\u000d\u000a      Roma 3 University, Rome (October 2006); the seminar series 'Our Speaking\u000d\u000a      Selves' held at the ICA (2009) (www.ica.org.uk\/19587.twl);\u000a      a lecture (now a podcast), `Bellowed Endearments and Echoes of Resistance:\u000d\u000a      How the Voice Bonds and Unbinds in Smadar Dreyfus's \"Mother's Day\"',\u000d\u000a      delivered at Magasin 3 Gallery, Stockholm (2009); and `The Right to\u000d\u000a      Silence' symposium (chaired by Karpf) organised by Electra (a London-based\u000d\u000a      art organisation) at The Showroom gallery (2012)\u000d\u000a      (www.electraproductions.com\/email\/RightToSilence_II.html).\u000d\u000a    Testimonials from the Artistic Director of the Norwegian organisation\u000d\u000a      nyMusikk and from a well known writer, broadcaster and Professor have\u000d\u000a      corroborated the impact of Karpf's research on the gendered voice on radio\u000d\u000a      professionals, arts practitioners and broadcasting policy; her work\u000d\u000a      prompting a redress of discrimination against the female voice. The\u000d\u000a      Artistic Director of nyMusikk reported that Karpf's `Her Noise' symposium\u000d\u000a      in Oslo `gathered much attention and Anne's talk was especially well\u000d\u000a      received' and, following the event, `a number of organisations approached\u000d\u000a      the Norwegian Arts Council and the Cultural Department to highlight the\u000d\u000a      discrepancy of female to male composers and songwriters. After many\u000d\u000a      meetings, funding was awarded for projects aimed at redressing the\u000d\u000a      imbalance' (Testimonial from Artistic Director of nyMusikk, 2013).\u000d\u000a    According to the writer, broadcaster and Professor, `Anne's work\u000d\u000a      certainly had a sociological impact (it is now difficult, if not\u000d\u000a      impossible, to debate the voice as a communicative medium without hearing\u000d\u000a      her work invoked), but [it also had considerable impact] in awakening\u000d\u000a      radio professionals to the relationship between gender and voice ... In\u000d\u000a      recent years the debate about the role of women in the media has come, in\u000d\u000a      one form or another, to dominate the headlines. Anne's work not only\u000d\u000a      informs this important debate, but has directly influenced the behaviour\u000d\u000a      of media decision-makers. It has had a very real and very productive\u000d\u000a      impact upon the nature of radio talk' (Testimonial from writer,\u000d\u000a      broadcaster and Professor, 2013).\u000d\u000a    Karpf's research on the human voice led to a &#163;7,000 grant by the\u000d\u000a      Winnicott Trust to research Donald Winnicott's BBC broadcasts, 1943-62.\u000d\u000a      This resulted in an Institute of Historical Research seminar (2013), and a\u000d\u000a      BBC Radio 4 'Archive on 4' programme &#8212; 'From Donald Winnicott to the\u000d\u000a      Naughty Step' &#8212; which Karpf researched and presented.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Anne Karpf's book, The Human Voice (Bloomsbury, 2006), has\u000d\u000a      prompted wide-ranging, national and international public discussion on the\u000d\u000a      role of the human voice today.

It argues, instead, that\u000d\u000a      the human voice remains at the centre of interpersonal and cultural\u000d\u000a      communication, even if we lack a shared public language through which to\u000d\u000a      articulate this. Based on 50 interviews conducted in the UK and USA\u000d\u000a      (between 2003 and 20006), Karpf's study develops an accessible public\u000d\u000a      language through which the important role of the human voice can be\u000d\u000a      discussed, and it raises awareness of the many ways in which what appears\u000d\u000a      to be a `natural', genetically-determined instrument is, in fact,\u000d\u000a      culturally and historically constituted. Karpf's work also challenges a\u000d\u000a      counter-trend &#8212; the `idealisation' of the human voice, characterised by\u000d\u000a      the widely-disseminated research of Albert Mehrabian, who attempted to\u000d\u000a      quantify the percentage (38%) of verbal message communicated by the voice,\u000d\u000a      and whose findings have become an oft-repeated part of popular discourse.\u000d\u000a      Karpf highlights the shortcomings of Mehrabian's methodology, along with\u000d\u000a      that used by other researchers who filtered out individual differences\u000d\u000a      between voices and voice-listening skills.\u000d\u000a    Karpf proposes that the voice is a medium through which we perform gender\u000d\u000a      and that, as women's social roles have altered, so too have their voices.\u000d\u000a      In the paper titled 'Spoken Like a Woman?: From Prejudice to Androgyny in\u000d\u000a      the Public Voice' (delivered, at Universite Paris-Diderot in 2012 and\u000d\u000a      subsequently published in an anthology), Karpf suggests that while\u000d\u000a      research shows that women's voices have deepened over the past 40 years,\u000d\u000a      and the voices of public men are expected to be more expressive, the voice\u000d\u000a      has not become `ungendered'. Rather, what is required of the voice has\u000d\u000a      become more complex. In her 2013 paper, 'Speaking Sex to Power?: The\u000d\u000a      Female Voice as a Dangerous Instrument' (delivered at the 'Vocal Folds'\u000d\u000a      symposium organised by Her Noise in Oslo), Karpf traces the historic\u000d\u000a      tendency to equate women's voices with an erotic power that needs to be\u000d\u000a      policed. Karpf developed this theme in her 2013 BBC Radio 4 programme on\u000d\u000a      the broadcast female voice &#8212; 'Archive on 4: Spoken Like a Woman' &#8212; which\u000d\u000a      chronicled the historical exclusion of women from the airwaves.\u000d\u000a    Alongside this work, Karpf also developed a critique of oral historians'\u000d\u000a      nervousness around the disembodied voice. This theme was central to a\u000d\u000a      keynote address, 'The Human Voice and the Texture of Experience',\u000d\u000a      delivered at the 2009 Oral History Society conference held in Strathclyde.\u000d\u000a      Here, Karpf argued that the rush to transcribe recorded testimony was\u000d\u000a      indicative of a longstanding tendency to devalue the instrument through\u000d\u000a      which oral historians gather their material. In 2011, in a seminar\u000d\u000a      organised by 'Media and the Inner World', Karpf applied psychoanalytic\u000d\u000a      theory &#8212; specifically Donald Winnicott's concepts of holding and\u000d\u000a      transitional space, and Esther Bick's theories of containment &#8212; to\u000d\u000a      listeners' relationships with the voices of regular radio presenters.

During the 1970s the Council of Europe had\u000a      an interest in\u000a      community media, as did AMARC-Europe during the 1990s, but this had no\u000a      discernible effect on\u000a      policy. It was left to the Community Media Forum for Europe (CMFE), formed\u000a      in 2004, to take up\u000a      the campaign. The sequence of events leading to the publication of the two\u000a      documents cited in\u000a      Section 1 (above) began at a joint meeting in July 2006 of the CMFE and\u000a      AMARC-Europe in\u000a      Brussels attended by community media practitioners from 15 European\u000a      countries, to which Lewis\u000a      was invited. The meeting presented the case for community media to\u000a      representatives from the\u000a      European Commission, the Council of Europe (CoE) and the European\u000a      Parliament (EP). In May\u000a      2007 Lewis spoke at a meeting in Budapest about the growing importance of\u000a      community media at\u000a      both national and European levels.

Key to\u000a      the claim for impact\u000a      made in this case study was the recommendation in the Conclusions (p.32)\u000a      for CMFE and AMARC\u000a      representatives to have observer status at MC-S-MD meetings. As a result,\u000a      the CMFE was invited\u000a      to assist Council of Europe staff in drafting the Declaration which was\u000a      adopted by the Committee of\u000a      Ministers on 11 February 2009 (accessible at https:\/\/wcd.coe.int\/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1409919).\u000a      Other\u000a      recommendations of Lewis's report are reproduced in the final section\u000a      (numbered i-v) of the\u000a      Declaration.\u000a    These two official statements have become important markers for community\u000a      media campaigns\u000a      across Europe and further afield. The CMFE says of Lewis's Council of\u000a      Europe report: `the study\u000a      was very important for us and our members to show to European and national\u000a      policymakers a\u000a      piece of independent study and concrete examples of the everyday work of\u000a      our sector' (Source:\u000a      Testimonial from Chair of CMFE)\u000a    Of UNESCO's work in South Asia, the Director (2003-2011) of the\u000a      Communication Development\u000a      Division, UNESCO testifies that the `convincing arguments we were able to\u000a      provide to state and\u000a      non-state actors [were] based on some of the key research-based\u000a      recommendations' of the report\u000a      and Lewis's other publications (Source: Testimonial from Director\u000a      (2003-2011) of Communication\u000a      Development Division, UNESCO).\u000a    Academic comment in Telematics and Informatics (Vol. 27, No. 2,\u000a      May 2010, accessible at\u000a      http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/journal\/07365853\/27\/2)\u000a      discusses community media policy\u000a      and refers to the Resolution and Declaration, together with Lewis's report\u000a      (see articles by Hallett\u000a      and Hintz, Jakubowitz, Kupfer, Reguero Jimenez and Scifo, and Santana and\u000a      Carpentier).

Lewis\u000a      subsequently wrote five reports dealing with aspects of community media\u000a      for the Council of\u000a      Europe and four for UNESCO. This was in a period when a small but growing\u000a      community of\u000a      European academics and activists strove to open a discursive space in\u000a      which the claims of\u000a      community media to be recognised as part of the media landscape could be\u000a      debated with\u000a      mainstream media, funding agencies and policy-makers. Research was\u000a      directed towards the\u000a      identification of best practice in the delivery of what is now called\u000a      `social gain' at the level of local\u000a      projects and, at national level, of supportive funding and regulatory\u000a      environments within which\u000a      community, alternative or third sector media could contribute to diversity\u000a      and pluralism. Much of the\u000a      work originated in the IAMCR's Community Communications Section, of which\u000a      Lewis was a\u000a      founding member in 1982.\u000a    After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, it was the IAMCR which\u000a      first made efforts to discuss\u000a      Western experience of community media with the new democracies. In\u000a      relation to this, Lewis\u000a      contributed to international colloquia in Belarus (1991) and Kiev (1993).\u000a      AMARC-Europe (the\u000a      European division of the World Association of Community Radio\u000a      Broadcasters) was also active in\u000a      Eastern Europe. Its Ljubljana conference in 1994, to which Lewis\u000a      contributed, adopted the\u000a      Community Radio Charter for Europe. For AMARC-Europe Lewis also undertook\u000a      a survey of\u000a      employment trends and training needs in the third sectors of five European\u000a      countries (Lewis, 1994)\u000a      and in 1995 organised a series of seminars in Estonia, Russia, Poland and\u000a      Slovenia on media law\u000a      and regulation, training and democratic practice in radio journalism. In\u000a      1995 Lewis's contribution to\u000a      the University of Leicester's MA in Mass Communications &#8212; a unit he\u000a      authored that dealt with\u000a      `Alternative Media' &#8212; achieved global reach through the course's Distance\u000a      Learning mode. In the\u000a      same year The Invisible Medium (Lewis and Booth, 1989; translated\u000a      into Spanish in 1992), one of\u000a      the first books to discuss community media and its various forms across\u000a      the world, was reprinted\u000a      and continues to be widely cited.\u000a    `Ethnographic Monitoring and Evaluation of Community Multimedia Centres'\u000a      (Slater, Tacchi and\u000a      Lewis, 2002) was the outcome of research funded by DFID, which tested an\u000a      evaluation\u000a      methodology &#8212; `ethnographic action research' &#8212; for UNESCO in Sri Lanka.\u000a      The recommendations\u000a      made were `very influential' (Source: Testimonial from Director\u000a      (2003-2011) of Communication\u000a      Development Division, UNESCO) and enabled UNESCO to assess the impact of\u000a      new\u000a      communication technologies in rural communities in South Asia.\u000a    In 2004-06, Lewis was the Scientific Coordinator of the IREN project,\u000a      funded under the EU's FP6\u000a      programme, which brought together European academics specialising in radio\u000a      and radio\u000a      broadcasters. His paper at the final conference underlined the importance\u000a      of the work the project\u000a      had identified in the field of community media (Lewis 2006).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"34809","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Research at DIS gives the public and museum visitors new ways to make\u000a      sense of their heritage and engage in dialogue and partnerships with\u000a      academics and curators. While other museums had previously used\u000a      interactive displays, QRator is the first project in the world to allow\u000a      visitors to enter into a conversation with museum professionals and other\u000a      visitors, rather than simply absorbing what the labels tell them.\u000a      Transcribe Bentham gives members of the public unprecedented access to\u000a      primary historical material and the ability to take part in a project that\u000a      adds to public understanding of history, philosophy and culture in Jeremy\u000a      Bentham's time. Our research therefore benefits the public, whether they\u000a      are museum visitors using interactive labels, or internet users employing\u000a      crowd-sourcing, social media technologies or the internet of things. It\u000a      has also had a profound impact on the work of cultural heritage\u000a      professionals, museum curators, archivists, and special collections\u000a      librarians.\u000a    Engaging the public with historical records\u000a    Transcribe Bentham enables the public to become part of the research\u000a      process of interpreting historical documents &#8212; here untranscribed\u000a      manuscripts by the 19th century philosopher Jeremy Bentham &#8212; in a way that\u000a      was previously only possible for professional archivists and\u000a      historians.[1] Since its public launch in September 2010, Transcribe\u000a      Bentham has enabled 3,051 people from 21 countries to contribute to the\u000a      transcription of over 5,862 documents (an estimated 2.9 million words),\u000a      demonstrating a genuine public desire to contribute time and effort to\u000a      preserving and making this archive accessible. Several users returned\u000a      repeatedly and transcribed several different manuscripts.[2] The project\u000a      has attracted widespread press and blog coverage as a new model for public\u000a      participation and the unprecedented access it gives users, who have no\u000a      previous training in palaeography, to unique historical materials: 31% of\u000a      users enjoyed being part of the project because of an interest in history\u000a      or philosophy [2,3].\u000a    In 2011, Transcribe Bentham's innovative approach was recognised with the\u000a      \"Award of Distinction\" in the \"Prix Ars Electronica\" &#8212; the world's\u000a      foremost digital arts competition &#8212; in the Digital Communities category.\u000a      The jury commented that: `this is likely the first initiative to open up\u000a      such scholarly social research to the masses'. It was runner-up in the\u000a      DISH Digital Heritage Award 2011 and the `Platforms for Networked\u000a      Innovation' competition, run by the EU-funded Knetworks project and was\u000a      nominated for EngageU Award (European Competition for best Innovations in\u000a      University Outreach and Public Engagement) 2012.[4] The value of this\u000a      approach was recognised through subsequent funding to develop and expand\u000a      it: in 2012, the Mellon Foundation awarded Transcribe Bentham a grant\u000a      [text removed for publication] to modify and improve the interface, and\u000a      provide ongoing support to the user community, and it became part of an EU\u000a      FP7 project on manuscript transcription: TranScriptorium, worth &#163;220,838.\u000a    Further evidence of its success is the re-use of its open-source code by\u000a      the Public Record Office of Victoria's for its transcription initiative.\u000a      This will enable PROV to make historical records available to the public\u000a      for the first time.\u000a    Changing practices and improving visitor experience in museums\u000a    Since its launch in March 2011, QRator has demonstrated the feasibility\u000a      of social media as an outreach mechanism for the museum sector: it showed\u000a      that given \"radical trust\", users behave responsibly. It has proven\u000a      immensely successful at UCL's Grant Museum with 83% of over 4,300 comments\u000a      between launch and July 2013 being on topic or about the museum as a whole\u000a      (41% and 42% respectively) [8]. Assuming visitors leave one comment per\u000a      visit, an estimated 1\/3 of visitors to the museum have contributed, as\u000a      opposed to the tiny number who previously wrote in the visitors book or\u000a      spoke to staff. The comments have provided curators with insight into the\u000a      needs and opinions of visitors, allowing them to better shape the visitor\u000a      experience, and plan and present future exhibitions.\u000a    Contributing to sector debate on museums and the public\u000a    QRator attracted significant interest from the museums and scientific\u000a      community during the impact period [5]. It was nominated for a Museums and\u000a      the Web Best of the Web Award 2012 and won a UK Museums and Heritage Award\u000a      for Excellence 2012 in the Innovation category: `The judges can see clear\u000a      potential for use of this technology to be applicable to many different\u000a      organisations and their collections. It is impressive in the way it\u000a      encourages participation within museums but also, importantly, in\u000a      maintaining that participation beyond the walls of the museum when\u000a      visitors have returned home.' [6] Where many museums have `over-modernized\u000a      with too much emphasis on interactive displays', QRator, described as\u000a      `unobtrusive social media', blended easily with the classic exhibition\u000a      style of the Grant Museum of Zoology [7]. QRator also featured in the\u000a      highly prestigious NMC Horizon Report: Museum Edition 2011, which\u000a      identified our work as a model for the rest of the sector: `Incorporates\u000a      QR codes into exhibits that link to a rich database of curated content and\u000a      allow users to document and share their own interpretations of the\u000a      collections with each other.' [9] This is a highly selective publication\u000a      about new technologies in museums: decisions about inclusion are made by\u000a      an international committee of museum professionals and it is widely read\u000a      and respected.\u000a    Influencing practice in other museums\u000a    The Horizon Report discusses the future of museums: two museum\u000a      partnerships subsequently put this into practice. As a result of QRator's\u000a      success, in 2011 the Imperial War Museums (IWM) invited us to collaborate\u000a      on a bid to NESTA's Digital Research and Development Fund for Arts and\u000a      Culture. It was ranked first of 495 applications [10]. This led to the\u000a      Social Interpretation Project installed at IWM North and IWM Lambeth's A\u000a        Family in Wartime exhibition. Its interactive methods, inspired by\u000a      QRator, allowed visitors to enter into a digital conversation with\u000a      curators and other visitors using social media, interactive touch screens,\u000a      and the IWM website. Between July and December 2012, visitors to IWM North\u000a      made 8,791 comments, 42% of which were on topic and 26% about the museum;\u000a      between April and December 2012 visitors to IWM Lambeth made 18,115\u000a      comments, 19% on topic and 33% about the museum. [11] Methods of digital\u000a      interaction developed on QRator were thus applied successfully to a large\u000a      national museum, allowing visitors to interact with exhibits and each\u000a      other.\u000a    QRator was also been deployed in the Museum of Brands as part of an Arts\u000a      Council funded collaboration between UCL, The University of the Arts and\u000a      various London museums (&#163;100,000 total funding: &#163;10,000 to QRator). As in\u000a      the Grant Museum, about 1\/3 of visitors made comments, and most found the\u000a      experience enjoyable.

Often working in\u000a      interdisciplinary teams, DIS researchers contribute to new knowledge by\u000a      studying user\/visitor expectations, behaviour and motivations, the\u000a      adoption of digital applications and devices, analysing user behaviour and\u000a      institutional response. The results enable the design of digital resources\u000a      that are most suitable for their users. For example, recommendations of\u000a      the LAIRAH project, that user studies should be incorporated into the\u000a      design of new digital cultural heritage projects (AHRC funded 2005-6) [a]\u000a      were used by JISC and AHRC to inform their funding decisions.\u000a    QRator and our contribution to Transcribe Bentham grow out of this work:\u000a      they involve research on user needs and behaviours, using methods we\u000a      developed for the cultural heritage sector during the LAIRAH project, and\u000a      make it possible for users to interact with their heritage using social\u000a      media in ways that would have been impossible without digital methods. The\u000a      research also investigates the range and efficacy of digital methods for\u000a      broadening community engagement with cultural heritage.\u000a    Transcribe Bentham (http:\/\/www.ucl.ac.uk\/transcribe-bentham)\u000a      seeks to understand how difficult a task users interested in culture and\u000a      heritage can reasonably be asked to contribute to. Can an online audience\u000a      transcribe historical handwritten documents in an academically rigorous\u000a      fashion? Will crowd-sourcing document transcription be more effective, in\u000a      terms of speed, accuracy, or user engagement, than directly employing a\u000a      transcriber? Our project developed a unique online tool which allows users\u000a      to participate in online transcription of heritage material in an entirely\u000a      unprecedented fashion: users transcribe manuscript images, the\u000a      transcription is moderated and added to an institutional repository [b].\u000a    QRator (http:\/\/www.qrator.org)\u000a      investigates these questions: can visitors to a museum be trusted to\u000a      engage and answer challenging questions posed by a curator? Is it possible\u000a      to elicit a dialogue between visitors and curators that encourages\u000a      interpretation and analysis of objects, using digital methods such as\u000a      iPads placed in the gallery? QRator allows visitors to interact both with\u000a      each other and museum staff, rather than simply reading museum labels, via\u000a      ten iPads mounted in the museum, or through QR codes and the Internet of\u000a      Things enabled website [c, d]. We demonstrated that visitors are\u000a      interested in engaging in complex dialogues regarding provenance and moral\u000a      issues surrounding acquisition, retention and display [e].\u000a    Both projects involved interdisciplinary teams from several departments.\u000a      For Transcribe Bentham Professor Melissa Terras (DIS, Director: UCL Centre\u000a      for Digital Humanities), the Co-Investigator, steered the project towards\u000a      crowd-sourcing, advised on best practice in Digital Humanities and\u000a      Digitisation, encouraged the uptake of the project via social media, and\u000a      advised on the study of use and users in crowd-sourcing, whilst working\u000a      closely with the University of London Computing Centre and the Bentham\u000a      Project, led by the PI, Professor Philip Schofield (UCL Laws), in the\u000a      development and publicity of the crowd-sourcing system. The QRator team\u000a      consisted of Professor Claire Warwick (PI), Professor Melissa Terras (CI)\u000a      and Claire Ross (named researcher) (all DIS).

Most existing\u000a      classification systems originate before the computer age, employ pragmatic\u000a      ideas of knowledge organisation, and lack a sound theoretical basis. Facet\u000a      analysis on the BC2 model offers solutions to some of these issues and\u000a      enables more accurate representation of subject content, especially\u000a      important for online searching and discovery. Of particular importance is\u000a      the research into classification in the humanities, and the special\u000a      challenges of culture-specific concepts and terminology which they\u000a      present; effective ways of managing these difficulties allow for the\u000a      elimination of cultural bias which is evident in many older systems, and\u000a      the creation of schemes which are more acceptable to minority users.\u000a    Impact on the design of UDC library classification\u000a    The UDC is an international classification, available in 40 languages,\u000a      and used in more than 150,000 bibliographic databases, documentation\u000a      centres and libraries in around 130 countries, notably in central and\u000a      eastern Europe, where it is the dominant scheme [1]. UDC has to exhibit a\u000a      consistent and logical structure &#8212; such as that offered by facet analysis\u000a      &#8212; because of its use in scientific and technical research establishments,\u000a      as well as general academic collections, and its application to\u000a      documentation as well as books. Collections include VINITI &#8212; All-Russian\u000a      Scientific and Technical Information Institute of Russian Academy of\u000a      Sciences (28 million records), NEBIS &#8212; The Network of Libraries and\u000a      Information Centres in Switzerland (3m), Romanian Science and Technology\u000a      Portal (3m), the national libraries and bibliographies of Slovakia (4m),\u000a      Slovenia (3.5m), Hungary, Czech Republic, Croatia, Poland, Finland,\u000a      Serbia, Spain and Portugal [1]. Facet analysis also provides for a data\u000a      structure that is compatible with the maintenance of the classification in\u000a      a database format, and for its machine management. As Ines Cordeiro (UDC\u000a      Editor-in-Chief 2007-2011, Deputy Director of the National Library of\u000a      Portugal and former doctoral student in DIS) reported in 2007, BC2\u000a      provided a model for UDC to achieve its organisational goal of developing\u000a      a classification suitable for online environments, not just one designed\u000a      for better shelf arrangement [4].\u000a    In the 1990s UDC agreed to make BC2 the basis of all new revisions of the\u000a      UDC, using its terminologies and adopting its faceted structure within the\u000a      UDC format. In 1997, DIS researcher Broughton joined the Editorial Team to\u000a      help achieve this goal, presenting the principles of facet analysis to\u000a      editorial workshops, helping to establish editorial policy and practice,\u000a      and working on the conversion of BC2 classes to UDC format. Her\u000a      identification of the Genesis Problem [d] demonstrates the difficulty of\u000a      representing, in a relational database, subject content and terminology\u000a      that is specific to particular cultures and traditions. She also developed\u000a      several new auxiliary schedules, which assign common facets across classes\u000a      [2].\u000a    In 2000, Broughton created an entirely new Religion classification, based\u000a      on her work on BC2 [3]. This was incorporated into the 2005 edition of UDC\u000a      and applied to all accessions in religion since. Between 2008 and 2013,\u000a      books in 130 countries were classified using this system.\u000a    Broughton`s work on Religion [3] provided precedent for editors\u000a      developing other UDC classes. In 2009, a working group led by Claudio\u000a      Gnoli began updating Philosophy, explicitly `trying to follow the pattern\u000a      of facet presentation introduced in the Class 2 Religion by Vanda\u000a      Broughton' [5], and using her expertise in humanities classification [f].\u000a    Revision of the important Class 61 Medicine was announced in 1995. In\u000a      2009, its editors, including Ia McIlwaine, outlined the process of\u000a      adapting BC2 [6] and how auxiliary schedules created by Broughton were a\u000a      major factor in rationalising its structure: `In phase 1, a framework for\u000a      the new class was established ... Bliss terminology was used in the\u000a      captions together with UDC notation and formatting as needed. Concepts and\u000a      terms, the common auxiliaries, and classes related to medicine were used\u000a      insofar as they were appropriate. There was heavy use of common auxiliary\u000a      tables of general characteristics (Table 1k) -02 Properties, -04 Relations\u000a      and Processes, and -05 Persons' [7].\u000a    In 2011, Broughton was invited to explain the BC2 structure of physical\u000a      sciences at the UDC Editorial Workshop, and the following year BC2\u000a      principles were also considered in the revision of the mathematics class,\u000a      with work beginning in 2013 [8].\u000a    Impact on the design of the Dewey library classification system\u000a    The Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) has been translated into more than\u000a      30 languages and serves library users in over 200,000 libraries in 135\u000a      countries, making it the world`s most widely used library classification\u000a      system.\u000a    Dewey was consistently criticised for its Class 200, Religion, in which\u000a      Christianity and the Bible occupied numbers 220-289, with all other\u000a      religions sharing 290-299. A 2005 user survey confirmed this general\u000a      discontent with the Religion Class, and with its far greater weighting of\u000a      Christianity compared with other religions [9]. In 2006, following the\u000a      publication of the new UDC Class 2 Religion, the then-Editor of the DDC\u000a      Joan Mitchell proposed collaboration with McIlwaine for a revision\u000a      incorporating many features of Broughton`s UDC schedule into the 22nd\u000a      edition of Dewey [10].\u000a    When released in 2011, the top structure of the new DDC class mirrored\u000a      almost exactly the UDC structure as designed by Broughton. A separate\u000a      publication, `developed for libraries with extensive religion collections'\u000a      appeared in 2012 [11]. This featured `an optional arrangement for the\u000a      Bible and specific religions based on a chronological\/regional view, in\u000a      order to help reduce Christian bias in the standard notational sequence\u000a      for the Bible and specific religions, based on a similar development\u000a      introduced in the UDC in 2000' [10].

It was originally devised by a UCL graduate, S. R.\u000a      Ranganathan, in the 1930s, and taken up in the 1950s by the UK\u000a      Classification Research Group (CRG), who greatly refined and elaborated\u000a      the methodology, and developed a body of theoretical research which forms\u000a      a significant part of the overall corpus of research literature in the\u000a      fields of indexing and information retrieval. UCL research in this field\u000a      is now led by Professor Vanda Broughton (UCL Information Studies, or DIS,\u000a      since 1997 and a member of CRG from the early 1970s).\u000a    Facet analysis builds classification from `the bottom up' on the basis of\u000a      a detailed examination of the concepts in a given discipline or subject\u000a      field [b]. Concepts are assigned to a series of categories (or facets)\u000a      which are largely functional, or linguistic in nature (entities, parts,\u000a      materials, processes, operations, products, agents). Relationships between\u000a      concepts in a facet, and between the facets themselves, are established,\u000a      and the rules for combination (the system syntax) are derived from the\u000a      structure, within the conventions and needs of the particular discipline.\u000a      Although there is an established body of theory, different disciplines\u000a      present particular difficulties in the work of intellectual analysis.\u000a      Research in DIS also involves the investigation of potential new\u000a      fundamental categories, and the encoding of data to represent the\u000a      structural properties of concepts and their interrelationships. This has\u000a      applications not only in libraries, but in machine management, and today\u000a      there are many examples of faceted applications in e-commerce, online\u000a      searching, etc. Much DIS research has focused on the management and\u000a      representation of faceted systems in digital formats which support such\u000a      implementations [c].\u000a    DIS is the institutional base for development of the second edition of\u000a      the Bliss Bibliographic Classification (BC2). The original Bibliographic\u000a      Classification (BC1) was a well-regarded classification system widely used\u000a      in UK academic and research libraries until the 1990s, when, for financial\u000a      reasons, it was largely replaced by the Dewey Decimal and Library of\u000a      Congress Classifications. The development of BC2, which started in 1977,\u000a      resulted in a series of highly structured classifications for different\u000a      disciplines, which provide a model of a faceted system built on\u000a      theoretical principles. DIS researchers have developed new terminologies\u000a      for specific subject fields including religion, the fine arts and\u000a      chemistry [a].\u000a    The AHRC-funded FATKS project (2002-2003, PI V. Broughton) in DIS\u000a      examined the viability of applying a faceted approach to humanities\u000a      vocabulary, and developed an indexing and search tool for two humanities\u000a      disciplines, religion and the arts; outputs included the creation of a\u000a      relational database, and software for the automatic building of classmarks\u000a      [f]. The project documentation and the demonstrator are published on the\u000a      FATKS website, http:\/\/www.ucl.ac.uk\/fatks\/about.htm.\u000a      DIS researchers working on faceted classification included Professor Ia\u000a      McIlwaine (Head of DIS 1993-2001, Editor-in-Chief of the Universal Decimal\u000a      Classification (UDC) from 1993-2007), who was responsible for the\u000a      implementation of a faceted structure into UDC; Dr Aida Slavic (research\u000a      associate on the FATKS project 2002-2003, former DIS doctoral student, and\u000a      Editor-in-Chief of UDC from 2011) developed the relational database and\u000a      search interface for the faceted humanities vocabulary.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"34816","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"4796775","Name":"U.S. Virgin Islands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    A major contribution of UCL DIS research has been in raising the\u000a        profile of community-based\u000a        heritage activity and recognition of its significance in the UK and\u000a        internationally. This impact has\u000a      been strongest in terms of perceptions of community archives, and is\u000a      demonstrated by the\u000a      increased funding and formal acknowledgement for community-based archive\u000a      projects. Between\u000a      2008 and 2013 research findings were disseminated to professional\u000a      archivists through articles in\u000a      practitioners' journals (e.g. [a], [b], [c], [d] and [f] in section 3), in\u000a      other publications aimed at largely\u000a      professional audiences [e], at workshops and conferences organised by\u000a      professional bodies in the\u000a      UK (London, Manchester, Oxford, Liverpool, Brighton, Preston, Aberystwyth,\u000a      Llandrindod Wells,\u000a      Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow), internationally (Ireland, Sweden, United\u000a      States, Canada and\u000a      Australia) and at the International Council on Archives congresses in\u000a      Kuala Lumpur (2008) and\u000a      Brisbane (2012) [1]. With audiences ranging from 20 to 200, a total of\u000a      about 2,000 archive and\u000a      heritage professionals, members of funding bodies and policymakers heard\u000a      discussion of our\u000a      research and its findings during this period.\u000a    This widespread dissemination of the research has been instrumental in\u000a      creating awareness of the\u000a      significance of community-based archives and community-based heritage\u000a      activity in the\u000a      professional sector. Although no one would claim that this is exclusively\u000a      due to DIS research, it has\u000a      certainly been an important contributor, as explicitly recognised in both\u000a      the UK and internationally.\u000a      In 2008, for example, the President of the Society of Archivists urged\u000a      fellow professionals to read\u000a      article [a] which `far more effectively than I could do here, [makes] the\u000a      case for seeing community\u000a      archives as an important part of the overall archival attempt to capture\u000a      the history of society in all\u000a      its diversity' [2]. A former senior manager at the National Archives of\u000a      Canada, referring to [e],\u000a      emphasised the significance of the research for contemporary archival\u000a      thinking and practice and\u000a      credited Flinn with being `an early and prominent voice in bringing the\u000a      community archives\u000a      perspective to the attention of the profession' [3]. The former national\u000a      archivist and librarian of the\u000a      United States Virgin Islands and a leading North American commentator on\u000a      archival issues\u000a      reflected on the influence of Flinn on a new generation of North American\u000a      archive professionals,\u000a      `Community archives is his area, I don't think there is anyone else...I\u000a      would say his work has been\u000a      foundational' [4].\u000a    This new awareness has contributed to broader and more inclusive\u000a      perspectives on professional\u000a      practice for archivists and other heritage workers. A tangible result of\u000a      this may be seen in the fact\u000a      that in 2011 the Archives and Records Association (ARA, formerly the\u000a      Society of Archivists)\u000a      acknowledged the significance of community archives by the Chair and Chief\u000a      Executive of the new\u000a      association addressing the annual UCL community archives conference and\u000a      inviting the\u000a      Community Archives and Heritage Group (CAHG) and its approximately 400\u000a      members to become\u000a      a special interest group within ARA. When ARA looked for someone to give\u000a      an overview of the\u000a      developments in the last ten years for community archives in their\u000a      professional magazine ARC, the\u000a      editors asked Flinn [5]. This has also affected funding policy: the\u000a      Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) sees\u000a      the funding of community heritage even in a time of austerity as a\u000a      priority, introducing in its\u000a      strategic framework for 2013-2018 a new fund, `Sharing Heritage',\u000a      specifically targeting community\u000a      heritage activity and extending the scope of existing community-focussed\u000a      programmes such as\u000a      `Our Heritage' from &#163;50,000 to &#163;100,000 [6]. The AHRC included `community\u000a      heritage' as a strand\u000a      in its Connected Communities research theme, for which Flinn was invited\u000a      to participate in an\u000a      Expert Consultation Event in 2009.\u000a    Much of the DIS research has focused on better understanding the\u000a      motivations and significance of\u000a      community-based heritage and archive activity, and has changed practices\u000a      in a number of areas.\u000a      Flinn has been closely associated with the development of the advocacy\u000a      body CAHG since 2005,\u000a      and that body and its members had a mutual interest in the research,\u000a      informing it and benefiting\u000a      from it, and were thus close participants in the research process. The\u000a      knowledge of the variety,\u000a      significance and challenges faced by community archives acquired through\u000a      the research [a, b, c]\u000a      directly impacted Flinn's drafting of the community archives movement\u000a      vision statement, which\u000a      `informed and continues to inform the essence of what [CAHG] do'. The CAHG\u000a      chair notes: `There\u000a      is a two-way relationship that then evolves; Andrew's work in raising the\u000a      profile and scoping and\u000a      defining the field, impacts and benefits CAHG members and the work of CAHG\u000a      members benefits\u000a      and informs Andrew's understandings of what community archives are and can\u000a      be' [7].\u000a    DIS research on community-based heritage has influenced debates and\u000a      policy on archives and\u000a      heritage in London and beyond. For instance, Flinn was an invited member\u000a      on the Mayor of\u000a      London's Heritage Diversity Task Force (HDTF) Archives Diversification\u000a      Sub-committee (2007-\u000a      2009), drafting the sub-committee's final report and jointly authoring a\u000a      section in the HDTF report\u000a      which was sent to all London arts, heritage and archival institutions and\u000a      policymakers stressing the\u000a      vital role of independent community-based archive activity in the context\u000a      of London's diverse\u000a      populations [8]. He also spoke on an expert panel at the cross-domain\u000a      Cultural Equalities Now\u000a      conference at the British Museum (2011), and was consulted by the HLF in\u000a      its discussions on the\u000a      evaluation of `success' of its funding of community-based heritage and\u000a      oral history work (2013).\u000a      Stevens contributed reflections from the findings of the Community\u000a        Archives and Identities\u000a      research and community-based heritage activity into publications for the\u000a      think tank IPPR, notably\u000a      `Stories Old and New, Migration and Identity in the UK heritage sector: A\u000a      report for the Migration\u000a      Museum Working Group' (2009) has been crucial to the direction and ongoing\u000a      work of the\u000a      Migration Museum Project to create the UK's first major museum of\u000a      migration [9].\u000a    Having identified the challenges and opportunities faced by\u000a      community-based archives [b, c, e],\u000a      researchers worked collaboratively with individual archives and led\u000a        workshops to provide training\u000a        and develop skills. For instance, between 2009 and 2013, researchers\u000a      advised the Black Cultural\u000a      Archives, South Asian Diaspora Literature and Arts Archive (SALIDAA), the\u000a      National Centre for\u000a      Carnival Arts Carnival Archive, Eastside Community Heritage, ALDATERRA,\u000a      Hoxton Hall and most\u000a      recently the proposed UK Disabled People's Movement Archive (UKDPMA),\u000a      among others, on\u000a      different aspects of community-based archival and heritage practice. In\u000a      some cases this has taken\u000a      the form of a one-off advisory session, in others it has been a more\u000a      sustained and long-term\u000a      collaboration and engagement. Research on community-based heritage\u000a      practice and ethics led to\u000a      guidance to Hoxton Hall which, according to their Heritage and Education\u000a      Officer, `supported us to\u000a      shape and deliver a project (Shoreditch Storybank) that is of real\u000a      relevance to the community of\u000a      Shoreditch and our organisation', and the advice was then built into a\u000a      large on-going HLF-funded\u000a      project to develop the Hall and explore its community heritage [10].\u000a      According to ALDATERRA\u000a      Projects, research-based advice enabled them to identify new streams of\u000a      relevant HLF and AHRC\u000a      funding which supported the development of the organisation, and on\u000a      projects such as the Living\u000a      Archaeology of the Place `enabled a specialist competence to be brought\u000a      into our work' [11].\u000a    Drawing on the collaborative approaches discussed in [c], researchers\u000a      delivered ten workshops\u000a      between 2009 and 2013 on archival skills, ethical research practice,\u000a      digital preservation,\u000a      dissemination and intellectual property and models for community-based\u000a      heritage collaborations to\u000a      community groups. Research findings were presented formally and informally\u000a      at seven successive\u000a      UCL-hosted Community Archives conferences. These conferences are attended\u000a      by 150 delegates\u000a      annually, including community groups, heritage professionals and\u000a      policymakers. As a member of\u000a      the organising group Flinn guided and directed the themes and messages\u000a      conveyed to the wider\u000a      membership, providing an unrivalled opportunity to discuss and disseminate\u000a      the outcomes of\u000a      research to the audience it most directly related to. For example, a\u000a      finding of Community Archives\u000a        and Identities research was the extent to which the survival of\u000a      materials collected and created by\u000a      community archives and heritage groups was endangered by digital\u000a      instability [c, d]. Once this\u000a      need was identified, researchers led by Stevens organised a digital\u000a      curation workshop in 2009, as\u000a      well as talks at community archive conferences on digital preservation.\u000a      Eveleigh was asked by the\u000a      City Archives of Amsterdam to advise and collaborate on the motivations\u000a      underpinning successful\u000a      participatory archive and heritage projects, while Sexton has been invited\u000a      to address professional\u000a      audiences in Italy about her research on collaborative heritage practice\u000a      as part of the Dig Where\u000a        We Stand team. In addition, Eveleigh was commissioned, with Flinn,\u000a      to produce guidance on\u000a      digital preservation guidance for community groups, which was disseminated\u000a      to community\u000a      archives via the Community Archives and Heritage Group. According to the\u000a      CAHG Chair, this was\u000a      an important model of `turning academic research into something very\u000a      practical and very usable\u000a      which is very important to a sector where the whole point is to engage in\u000a      a practical process and\u000a      produce meaningful and lasting end products ... it was a perfect way in\u000a      which that [research]\u000a      expertise can be made accessible to community archives to fulfil a\u000a      knowledge gap' [7].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research in UCL Information Studies on participatory and community-based\u000a      approaches to\u000a      archival and heritage activity has improved understanding of the\u000a      motivations, impacts and\u000a      challenges of these endeavours. This has led to the following impacts: (1)\u000a      a higher public and\u000a      professional profile for participatory and community-based archiving and\u000a      heritage activities,\u000a      including a better understanding of the motivations for such activities\u000a      and of the significance of the\u000a      engagement with such materials and activities, notably for the diversity\u000a      and democratisation of\u000a      cultural and knowledge production and for individual and collective senses\u000a      of identity, and (2) the\u000a      challenges and hurdles such approaches face, and some of the tools and\u000a      collaborative approaches\u000a      that can be used to overcome challenges.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    University College London\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"University College London","InstitutionName":"University College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007784}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2759794","Name":"Amsterdam"},{"GeoNamesId":"1735161","Name":"Kuala Lumpur"},{"GeoNamesId":"2174003","Name":"Brisbane"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a[a] Flinn, A.

For\u000a      the last 15 years public policy and professional discourse has stressed\u000a      the contribution that\u000a      participating in archival and other heritage activities can make to\u000a      individual well-being and\u000a      community cohesion by encouraging a sense of belonging, identity and\u000a      social capital. Yet, much of\u000a      the evidence for these impacts has been anecdotal and superficial [a, b\u000a      and d]. The research\u000a      activity carried out by ICARUS, examines the complex relationship between\u000a      community-based\u000a      archiving and heritage work, personal and collective identity, the impact\u000a      of participatory\u000a      approaches for professional and non-professional practice and thinking,\u000a      and the challenges that\u000a      such approaches face. This research seeks to understand the motivations\u000a      and impacts of\u000a      community-based archive and heritage activity, investigate the problems\u000a      and suggest solutions\u000a      including the role of heritage professions in supporting such activities\u000a      [c, e]. Research was led by\u000a      Dr Andrew Flinn (2004-), with Professor Elizabeth Shepherd, Dr Mary\u000a      Stevens (Community\u000a        Archives and Identities 2008-2009), collaborative doctoral award\u000a      researchers Alexandra Eveleigh\u000a      (2010-) and Anna Sexton (2011-), and UCL's AHRC-funded multi-disciplinary\u000a      research for\u000a      community heritage team Dig Where We Stand (2012-).\u000a    The Community Archives and Identities project identified the\u000a      significance of some of the collections\u000a      held by community-based archives and established the varied motivations\u000a      for engaging in such\u000a      activities (e.g. articulation of identity and right to representation,\u000a      assertion of civil rights, community\u000a      education, social production and dissemination of knowledge). It\u000a      demonstrated the complex yet\u000a      generally positive individual and collective benefits that engaging with\u000a      community-based archives\u000a      and heritage can bring, such as a contribution to a personal and\u000a      collective sense of belonging and\u000a      shared identity; a range of practical skills; the creation, preservation\u000a      and dissemination to young\u000a      people, among others, of histories and historical materials frequently\u000a      overlooked or ignored [b]. It\u000a      also provided compelling evidence of the significant challenges to\u000a      sustaining mainly volunteer-run\u000a      community-based heritage activities (restricted financial and physical\u000a      resources, moving from\u000a      project-based to more permanent models of existence, surviving\u000a      generational change, and the\u000a      challenge of successfully preserving fragile digital materials) and made\u000a      suggestions as to how\u000a      archivists, other heritage professionals, funding bodies and academics\u000a      might better support\u000a      community-based heritage groups to meet and overcome these challenges [c,\u000a      e]. The Dig Where\u000a        We Stand and Continuing to Dig research for community\u000a      heritage projects examined how\u000a      university research expertise can be utilised to support, enhance and\u000a      ultimately co-develop\u000a      community-based heritage activities. An exploration of the creative\u000a      collaborative possibilities of\u000a      technology in supporting community engagement with heritage institutions\u000a      has been the basis of\u000a      joint research projects with The National Archives and the Wellcome\u000a      Library [d]. Finally this\u000a      research is placed within a strong international context by studies\u000a      focusing on the use of archives\u000a      and heritage in pursuit of social justice, e.g. in [f], published in\u000a      collaboration with Professor Wendy\u000a      Duff and Karen Suurtamm, University of Toronto and Dr David Wallace,\u000a      University of Michigan.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35120","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    As described in section 2, the research team has applied information\u000a      theory to several contexts in\u000a      order to further understanding of issues and develop solutions for\u000a      industry, government, NGOs and\u000a      beyond. They have therefore created multiple impacts in every strand of\u000a      the research series (with a\u000a      notable example being impact arising from the study of the Library of the\u000a      European Parliament\u000a      (UR2), where a series of published papers written by practitioners\u000a      within the European Parliament\u000a      Library (e.g. Car, 2008; De Feo &amp; Finer, 2013) indicate that this\u000a      research has had a significant\u000a      impact upon the Library's marketing and service strategies). It is beyond\u000a      the scope of this case\u000a      study to describe the entire body of research and relevant impacts within\u000a      the assessment period,\u000a      therefore, recent examples from the newest strand of research concerning\u000a      IB and information\u000a      needs in the energy sector are outlined below. This focus on the energy\u000a      sector as a case\u000a      demonstrates the impact of the team's IB research most directly on\u000a      industry practice, the\u000a      establishment of standards and the improvement of management tools, and\u000a      the shaping of\u000a      government policy.\u000a    Research was presented at OPITO's International Conference in each year\u000a      of report publication\u000a      (RP1, 2010; RP3, 2011; RP4, 2012), where Marcella\u000a      attended in 2010 and 2011 with the\u000a      conferences attracting 177 and 233 registrations respectively. The\u000a      research results were presented\u000a      by OPITO Group Chief Executive David Doig in 2012 which attracted over 300\u000a      people. The\u000a      delegates at each conference represented senior decision makers from\u000a      training providers, oilfield\u000a      services companies and oil and gas operators from over 23 countries,\u000a      therefore providing wide\u000a      dissemination of the research findings and contributing to continuing\u000a      personal and professional\u000a      development by influencing methods and behaviours of professionals with\u000a      regards to the\u000a      management of safety and competence.\u000a    The three commissioned reports supported OPITO's drive for common\u000a      standards across the globe,\u000a      and eventually led to the development of pan-industry approaches to\u000a      measuring competency\u000a      (CE1), with the research findings informing and influencing the\u000a      standards and initiatives developed.\u000a      OPITO have subsequently been called upon by both government and industry\u000a      internationally to\u000a      assist in the development of workforce competence strategies. The\u000a      identification of best practice\u000a      provided OPITO with not only valuable insight to assist in their work with\u000a      industry and government\u000a      globally (CE2), but also to assist the organisations they work with\u000a      to adapt and enhance their\u000a      approach to operating in multiple, diverse regions. The research reports\u000a      generated news articles in\u000a      multiple local and international publications and the work conducted\u000a      surrounding competency\u000a      management led to an invitation to conduct seminar presentations at\u000a      Offshore Europe 2013 in\u000a      Aberdeen for Draeger Safety UK, focusing on competency management\u000a      practices, theories and\u000a      challenges.\u000a    The AVEVA report (RP2) was launched at an event in RGU on 1st\u000a      September 2011 with panel\u000a      members from: AVEVA, Subsea 7, AMEC, KCA DEUTAG; and Oil &amp; Gas UK\u000a      discussing the\u000a      implications of the findings for health and safety information management\u000a      in the industry (CE3).\u000a      Jeremy Cresswell, Editor of the Press and Journal Energy Supplement,\u000a      chaired the session, and\u000a      has published articles (CE4; CE5) on the research and its\u000a      implications. In addition, the report\u000a      received extensive trade press coverage, for example: Cambridge\u000a        Network; Digital Energy\u000a        Journal; Finding Petroleum; OE Digital; Oil\u000a        Information Technology Journal; and Ship and\u000a        Offshore. Furthermore, the research continues to be cited and\u000a      discussed in relation to information\u000a      solutions in subsequent AVEVA projects (CE6). The findings were\u000a      also taken to Offshore Europe in\u000a      2011.\u000a    Collaboration between AVEVA and RGU allowed AVEVA to be seen as a\u000a      `thought leader' in the oil\u000a      and gas industry, contributing to innovation, which is a considerable\u000a      accolade from a company who\u000a      invest substantially in research and development. The research confirmed\u000a      the criticality of safety\u000a      related issues to their customers, and the wider industry, allowing AVEVA\u000a      to prioritise the\u000a      development of information management software capabilities to such\u000a      issues. The research output\u000a      also identified areas for subsequent follow up research by AVEVA which is\u000a      currently underway\u000a      (CE7).\u000a    The projects described have led to the research team being asked to\u000a      provide advice to\u000a      governments and companies on aspects of information management,\u000a      communications and\u000a      skills\/competency management, both in the UK and internationally including\u000a      invitations to present\u000a      at a conference for HR directors on skill development and a seminar in\u000a      Houston hosted by the\u000a      Grampian Houston Association with a high level audience (CE10).\u000a      Recently Marcella and\u000a      Rowlands were invited by the International Centre for Oil and the\u000a      Environment (established in\u000a      1978) to submit a book chapter on health, safety and competence management\u000a      (CE8) for the\u000a      latest edition of the `Offshore Oil and Gas Operations, Environment,\u000a        Health and Safety\u000a        Management Handbook', the role and purpose of which is to provide\u000a      the industry with a\u000a      comprehensive distillation and synthesis of the operational context and\u000a      the lessons learned in the\u000a      last decade of operations.

In a transformed Information Society, information\u000a      access, provision and use\u000a      can impact on an individual's or an organisation's capacity to succeed.\u000a      This research stream has\u000a      sought to bridge gaps in knowledge relating to IB in order to better\u000a      understand the role of\u000a      information, to aid understanding of its effective exploitation, and to\u000a      enable the application of such\u000a      knowledge. The team have published extensively in the field of IB, having\u000a      applied their expertise to\u000a      a wide range of occupational and everyday life contexts and groups.\u000a      Strands in the series include\u000a      research into IB in the following contexts: small business (e.g. Marcella\u000a      et al., 1996; UR4, 2012);\u000a      voters and citizens (e.g. Marcella &amp; Baxter, 1997; Marcella &amp;\u000a      Baxter, 1999; UR1, 2003; UR5,\u000a      2013); parliaments (UR2, 2007); NGOs (UR3, 2010); and most\u000a      recently in information provision\u000a      and management of health, safety and competency systems in the oil and gas\u000a      industry (UR6,\u000a      2013).\u000a    The current research stream concerns IB in the energy sector, a domain\u000a      which has until recently\u000a      received little attention from the information science field, largely due\u000a      to issues with access to\u000a      research participants, the industry's lack of appreciation of the\u000a      transferability of theoretical\u000a      concepts and expertise, and a more widespread challenge in seeking to\u000a      bridge the gap between\u000a      academia and industry in collaborative research. The research team brought\u000a      years of experience\u000a      of IB research into this relatively unexplored context, successfully\u000a      winning industry funding for\u000a      projects focused on critical industry priorities such as safety and\u000a      competency management which\u000a      had a significant information management dimension. Three projects (RP1,\u000a      2010; RP3, 2011; RP4,\u000a      2012) funded by OPITO (the Offshore Petroleum Industry Training\u000a      Organisation) examined the\u000a      management of health, safety and competence throughout the safety chain,\u000a      encompassing the\u000a      associated systems, processes and behaviours. OPITO are the oil and gas\u000a      industry's focal point\u000a      for skills, learning and workforce development and have international\u000a      reach with offices in\u000a      Aberdeen, Dubai, Kuala Lumpur and Houston, and industry members from\u000a      across the globe.\u000a    As a result of the high visibility and impact of the OPITO funded\u000a      research, in 2011, AVEVA, a world\u000a      leading engineering software provider to the plant, power and marine\u000a      industries, approached the\u000a      team and commissioned research (RP2) into the \"information gap\" in\u000a      health and safety information\u000a      systems. AVEVA operate globally and 100% of the top 10 energy companies\u000a      are AVEVA\u000a      customers (PFC Energy 50 &#8212; the definitive ranking of the world's leading\u000a      publicly traded energy\u000a      companies by market capitalization).\u000a    Following publication of their report for AVEVA, the research team\u000a      published an article (UR6)\u000a      which demonstrated the value of models of IB beyond the usual disciplinary\u000a      boundaries in order to\u000a      further understanding of the behaviour of oil and gas industry workers in\u000a      the context of health,\u000a      safety and emergency response. The methodological approach taken in the\u000a      commissioned\u000a      research was subsequently critically evaluated and further disseminated to\u000a      an international\u000a      academic audience at The European Conference on Research Methodology for\u000a      Business and\u000a      Management Studies, Portugal in July 2013.\u000a    The research projects described above and their associated outputs have\u000a      spun off into other\u000a      research activities, and the team continue to be commissioned by industry\u000a      in order to apply\u000a      information theory to industry problems. Examples include projects which\u000a      focus on business\u000a      resilience during economic downturn, leaders' opinions on the future of\u000a      the global oil and gas\u000a      industry, and the leadership qualities of Offshore Installation Managers.\u000a      Most recently, a short\u000a      paper was presented at the Information: Interaction and Impact (i3)\u000a      conference held at Robert\u000a      Gordon University in July 2013 which discussed the information needs and\u000a      behaviour of Offshore\u000a      Installation Managers.

It is an\u000d\u000a      increasingly significant cult and fantasy festival on the international\u000d\u000a      circuit and is currently the only festival of its kind in Wales and one of\u000d\u000a      only three UK festivals (along with Leeds and Frightfest) to be members of\u000d\u000a      the European Fantastic Film Festivals Federation. There has also been\u000d\u000a      impact in relation to the annual Offscreen Festival based in Brussels, a\u000d\u000a      similarly themed cult and fantasy festival that commenced in 2008.\u000d\u000a      European cult film festivals of this kind tend to operate in a similar\u000d\u000a      manner, offering screening of new films and revivals alongside\u000d\u000a      opportunities for fans to meet directors and actors associated with this\u000d\u000a      area of culture. The appearance of academics in these festivals is not\u000d\u000a      unheard of and occasionally separate symposia or conferences will be run\u000d\u000a      alongside the festivals proper (with the London-based Cine-Excess, in\u000d\u000a      which all the researchers associated with this case study are involved, a\u000d\u000a      key example). However, the integration of research-based input from a\u000d\u000a      group of researchers into the main festival programme, such as was the\u000d\u000a      case especially with Abertoir in 2012 but also at Offscreen in 2012, is\u000d\u000a      unusual and innovative.\u000d\u000a    In both cases, the aim of the engagement between Northumbria researchers\u000d\u000a      and festival organisers has been to enhance the educational context of the\u000d\u000a      festivals. This has been most evident for Abertoir, where the organisers\u000d\u000a      have bid for additional funding as a result of input from Northumbria\u000d\u000a      staff based on their research. The most obvious product of the developing\u000d\u000a      relationship with Offscreen during the census period has been an\u000d\u000a      AHRC-funded international research network (awarded in December 2012),\u000d\u000a      which includes Offscreen as a participant and which has fostered\u000d\u000a      research-led engagement led by PI Sexton along with Hunter and Hutchings\u000d\u000a      with non-academic users of research, including festival programmers and\u000d\u000a      other producers and distributors of cult material.\u000d\u000a    Staff involved in the case study were initially approached by the\u000d\u000a      festival directors of Abertoir and Offscreen respectively. A series of\u000d\u000a      meetings and communications commenced early in 2012 and built on\u000d\u000a      pre-existing informal contacts. As a result of these, Hunter, Hutchings\u000d\u000a      and Sexton were all involved in providing research-derived material for\u000d\u000a      the week-long Abertoir event that took place in November 2012; this\u000d\u000a      included written material for festival brochures, public lectures and\u000d\u000a      presentations to the festival audiences. This material connected directly\u000d\u000a      with published research outputs thus:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a       Hunter: hour-long public lecture `The Horrible History of Italian\u000d\u000a        horror' and brochure entry `Italian Horror Cinema' &#8212; which placed\u000d\u000a        Italian horror in a broader European context and which in this drew upon\u000d\u000a        research into Italian and Belgian horror in Hunter 2012 and 2013.\u000d\u000a       Hutchings: 20-minute introduction to British Science Fiction and\u000d\u000a        short brochure entry on Italian horror. The first drew upon Hutchings'\u000d\u000a        1999 research into the British SF invasion film, and especially his work\u000d\u000a        there on the historical context of the Quatermass stories. The second\u000d\u000a        drew on the exploration of Italianate cinematic excess in Hutchings 2003\u000d\u000a        and 2012.\u000d\u000a       Sexton: 20-minute introductory talk on 3D cult movies and brochure\u000d\u000a        entry on `Rocky Horror Picture Show' &#8212; all drawing directly upon\u000d\u000a        explorations of cult cultures in Sexton 2011.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The 2012 festival had its highest ever attendance figures, with 3,300\u000d\u000a      admissions. As a result of Northumbria-led input, the festival organisers\u000d\u000a      were able to report to the principal funder a significant enhancement in\u000d\u000a      the educational content of the festival in comparison with previous years:\u000d\u000a      \"This year, we made a strong push to provide a much wider educational\u000d\u000a        aspect than in previous years and teamed up with the University of\u000d\u000a        Northumbria in a series of activities and elements that have taken our\u000d\u000a        engagement with education to new levels\" (Source: Evaluation Report\u000d\u000a      for Film Agency of Wales). Consequently they were able to bid for\u000d\u000a      additional funding from the Film Agency for Wales for the 2013 festival.\u000d\u000a    Input into Offscreen included a presentation by Sexton on cult cinema and\u000d\u000a      a presentation by Hunter on Italian cult cinema. Both of these served to\u000d\u000a      demonstrate to festival funding agencies an educational profile for the\u000d\u000a      event, and supported the festival director's aspiration that Offscreen be\u000d\u000a      \"more than just a festival\". Key to this relationship has been Sexton's\u000d\u000a      Cult Cinema network. The Offscreen Director confirms that the contribution\u000d\u000a      of Sexton and Hunter has enhanced: \"the internationalisation of the\u000d\u000a        festival and the reinforcement of its educational part. Collaborating\u000d\u000a        with your Cult Network has also helped in profiling the festival even\u000d\u000a        more deliberately and consciously into the cult territory and brought\u000d\u000a        the ambition of mixing an academic with a festival approach and audience\u000d\u000a        a step closer.\" (Email, 24 September 2013).\u000d\u000a    Impact activity for both festivals will continue to evolve after the\u000d\u000a      census period, with staff invited to contribute to Abertoir in 2013 and\u000d\u000a      Offscreen in 2014.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The Case Study illustrates how research into cult, fantasy and horror\u000d\u000a      films has been used to engage organisers of film festivals &#8212; most notably\u000d\u000a      the `Abertoir' festival based in Wales and the `Offscreen' festival in\u000d\u000a      Brussels &#8212; contributing to enhanced educational content which provided new\u000d\u000a      audience experiences at both festivals.

The festival has significant\u000a      international reach. In 2012 it had 75 major speakers participating,\u000a      including visitors from France, Spain, Brazil, Canada, the USA, Japan and\u000a      China, as well as an additional 200 creators selling their comics and\u000a      running workshops. Sponsors include the Arts Council, the University of\u000a      Chichester and major international comic distributor Diamond.\u000a    Gibson's research has contributed to the development of Thought Bubble's\u000a      distinctive approach, most evidently in the foregrounding of\u000a      gender-related elements in the programming of its yearly festival. The\u000a      festival started in 2007 as a one-day event attracting around 500 people.\u000a      Gibson's body of research on the roles of women and girls in the world of\u000a      comics was presented to festival staff, including the festival director in\u000a      2008. The research indicated that a female audience existed for comics to\u000a      a much greater extent than previously supposed and that it could be\u000a      fostered by changing the tone and marketing of the festival and also by\u000a      emphasising women creators in the programming.\u000a    The presentation of research led directly to Gibson's organising and\u000a      chairing a regular \"Women in Comics\" panel for the festival from 2009 to\u000a      2012 that debated issues of gender and diversity. This has become an\u000a      increasingly important aspect of the festival, attracting major women\u000a      comic creators such as Alison Bechdel, Robin Furth and Mary Talbot and\u000a      with its audience rising from 60 in its first year to a current 250. It\u000a      has been consistently shaped by Gibson's research findings, which have\u000a      been used to form the agendas that are addressed by each of the panels.\u000a      Examples of this include a panel on generation and comics, influenced by\u000a      Gibson, 2010 (an article which addressed the influences on women creators)\u000a      and a panel on the supposed lack of female creators and readers, which\u000a      drew upon Gibson 2003a, 2003b, 2010. The Director of the Thought Bubble\u000a      Festival from its inception, confirms that: \"Mel's research gave me\u000a        considerable impetus to shape the form of the festival by changing the\u000a        tone of the marketing and forefronting women creators in the\u000a        programming...This led to the start of the Women in Comics panel,\u000a        chaired by Mel and to our annual banner used on the website and all\u000a        publicity for the festival always featuring\/being created by a woman.\"\u000a    Elsewhere the Thought Bubble Director has noted that the \"Women in\u000a      Comics\" panel: \"has been a distinctive feature of Thought Bubble\"\u000a      and that \"the celebration of female creators has acted as a\u000a        `shop-front' for the festival, showing visitors and guests that this is\u000a        a female friendly event\" (source: personal correspondence between\u000a      the Director of Thought Bubble and Gibson).\u000a    Furthermore, Thought Bubble's Assistant Director has confirmed that\u000a      Gibson's contributions to the festival programme were: \"instrumental in\u000a        allowing us to successfully attain (and retain) the necessary (Arts\u000a        Council) funding to allow us to both succeed in our initial core aims,\u000a        and also to expand and grow as an organisation.\"\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Dr Mel Gibson's research on comics and gender has influenced Thought\u000a      Bubble &#8212; an organisation that runs the UK's largest and most high-profile\u000a      comic and graphic novel festival &#8212; to re-focus its marketing and festival\u000a      content to appeal to female audiences.

Her expertise in her subject field has\u000a      underpinned the impact described in this case study. Gibson's research is\u000a      ongoing and there are significant outputs in the current REF census\u000a      period. This work has predominantly focused on gender, comics and\u000a      childhood, with a significant emphasis on addressing myths and prejudices\u000a      about the comic form and its audiences, for example, Gibson, 2003b.\u000a    The most important focus of Gibson's research regarding the impact\u000a      described in this case study has been around comics and female audiences.\u000a      A dominant discourse about comics within the industry and within much\u000a      comic-based criticism is that girls and women do not read comics to any\u000a      great extent. As a female reader of comics Gibson wanted to investigate\u000a      this assumption through her research. This involved uncovering via\u000a      archival research a \"lost\" history of comics for the female reader\u000a      (Gibson, 2000a, 2000b, 20003a). This research has also involved working\u000a      with female readers of all genres of comic as well as engaging with female\u000a      creators of comics (Gibson, 2010).\u000a    Her research findings have established that there was, and is, a\u000a      significant female comics readership in Britain and also identified and\u000a      analysed the kind of narratives which were and are popular with female\u000a      readers, revealing a diverse range of engagement with many genres\u000a      including superhero titles and autobiography. The overall effect of\u000a      Gibson's research has been to challenge those discourses and approaches to\u000a      comics that have excluded or marginalised women as both readers and\u000a      creative figures nationally and internationally.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35182","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    There are two main impacts arising from this body of research. Firstly,\u000a      it has influenced the training of LIS practitioners internationally in\u000a      relation to how to engage in user research within LIS. Secondly, it has\u000a      helped learners and pupils in secondary schools dealing with complex\u000a      information environments to change how they access, assess and interact\u000a      with web-based information. It has also assisted educators in UK secondary\u000a      school to understand better these behaviours and thus to be better\u000a      informed about how to support users.\u000a    Impact on training LIS practitioners: The book \"\u000a        Research methods in information\" by Pickard was a major output from\u000a      the work on research methodology explained in Section 2. It was the first\u000a      \"handbook\" of research methods developed specifically for LIS and was a\u000a      Facet best-seller in 2008, with two print runs totalling over 10,000\u000a      copies sold. Now in its second edition (2013) it has also been translated\u000a      into Italian (Source 1). The book is being used as a core LIS text in over\u000a      24 countries by educators and their students who are studying to be\u000a      practitioners, and as a tool by established LIS practitioners\u000a      internationally who engage in user\/LIS research, and has been adopted in\u000a      other disciplines such as computing, journalism and communication. \"Pickard's\u000a        even-handed approach provides a safe haven for exploration and thinking.\u000a        Regardless of a student's orientation, the text tours diverse approaches\u000a        and promotes thinking about research. The handbook also emboldens\u000a        faculty who wish to provide creative options for students, in lieu of\u000a        steering them toward a predetermined path\" (Source 2). LIS students\u000a      have identified specific impact of the book on their work: \"particularly\u000a        for students on University College Dublin's MLIS programme undertaking\u000a        Assignment 1 (Evaluation of published LIS research).

The EIS [Electronic Information Systems]\u000a        maturity tool-kit offers a valuable tool for HE managers\" (Source\u000a      4). School Learning Resource centres responded swiftly to the findings of\u000a      the AHRC PhD study (Pickard) and CPD training on the introduction and\u000a      delivery of online information services was developed and delivered to\u000a      school librarians across the country. The findings of the CETL-funded\u000a      research have produced a model for information literacy mentoring which\u000a      continues to be used and is being developed in secondary schools\u000a      nationally.\u000a    The iTrust research (2010) received a similarly favourable review: \"The\u000a        results were extremely interesting... The report deserves wider\u000a        dissemination than normal LIS channels as there are implications for all\u000a        stages of education\" (Source 5). The iTrust model developed from the\u000a      research has been used as the basis for developing a new approach to\u000a      digital awareness involving personal models of information evaluation\u000a      which has application within the education sector and more generally to\u000a      all citizens. The model, and the understanding it brings of user\u000a      behaviour, has been used by Pickard to deliver CPD training to Public\u000a      Library staff in the region (15 Senior Library and Information Officers\u000a      (LIO) and over 40 LIO's, 2008-09) in preparation for the national Go ON UK\u000a      Project. This involved preparing library staff for new ways of working\u000a      including the delivery of training to \"silver surfers\", young people and\u000a      the unemployed to make use of online services; developing collaborative\u000a      ways of working and understanding community cohesion. Anne Turnbull,\u000a      Trainee Library and Information Officer, Newcastle Libraries, said of the\u000a      CPD: \"ICM staff designed a brilliant, hands-on programme which\u000a        covered topics from Web 2.0, community engagement, presentation and\u000a        management skills to reader development... the most valued and practical\u000a        lesson that we all took away from the programme was the importance of\u000a        reflective practice and the opportunity to share good practice and learn\u000a        from more challenging situations... as a team, we've gone from being\u000a        localised and out of touch to being leaders, innovators and\u000a        opportunists!\" (Source 6). This training led to a request to carry\u000a      out research on behalf of housing associations to discover the extent of\u000a      residents' online information literacy in preparation for Government plans\u000a      to digitise the entire state benefit system.\u000a    Based on our most recent investigation into the evaluation practices of\u000a      Key Stage 4 and 5 pupils (13-16 years) Pickard and Shenton have developed\u000a      a framework to assist in improving the evaluation and critical thinking\u000a      skills of young learners in their information interactions on the web. Our\u000a      Evaluation Framework tool for meta-evaluation of web-based resources for\u000a      secondary education has now been published in \"Creative Teaching and\u000a        Learning\" (V3 (2), 2012, pp22-28) and on the British Computer\u000a      Society Digital Literacy for Life programme website (Reports and thought\u000a      leadership, http:\/\/dlfl.bcs.org\/category\/17628),\u000a      extending the work beyond LIS and into IT and teacher education. A request\u000a      from a teacher led to the framework being tested with 6th form pupils\u000a      preparing research case studies for the A-Level awards (Source 7).\u000a      Evidence from this case study suggests that use of the Framework\u000a      significantly increased levels of self-efficacy in the use of digital\u000a      resources and increased awareness of the evaluation process. Evidence of\u000a      assimilation of knowledge, accommodation and transference were noted when\u000a      the intervention was applied across other subjects. One pupil said that\u000a      the framework had been: \"just as useful in my history coursework as it\u000a        has been here, I feel like I'm more in control now\". Another claimed\u000a      that: \"I used it all of the time, now I'm doing this stuff...\u000a        evaluating, without always thinking\" (Source 8). As a result of this\u000a      research Pickard and Shenton submitted a proposal to the UK Literacy\u000a      Association to write a minibook for their series about the Evaluation\u000a      Framework and practical approaches to its use within the classroom. The\u000a      UKLA responded very positively inviting them to contribute, saying: \"there\u000a        is an urgent need for more information on how to support children and\u000a        young people in assessing the value and relevance of the information\u000a        they are accessing from a variety of sources. This issue is becoming\u000a        particularly more pressing of course, the further we enter into the\u000a        internet age, as young people have exposure to so much information in\u000a        electronic and digital forms\" and \" felt [they] have an\u000a        important contribution to make within the context of this minibook\u000a        series\" (Source 9). There has been significant interest nationally\u000a      and internationally in using the Framework in Secondary and Higher\u000a      Education (Source 10).\u000a    All of this research contributed to the preparation of a successful\u000a      collaborative EU Tempus programme bid in 2012, which supports the\u000a      modernisation of HE in partner countries in Europe and Central Asia. The\u000a      &#163;700,000 \"IMPRESS\" project is concerned with knowledge transfer across\u000a      Ukrainian universities, focusing on digital literacy and other related\u000a      skills and aiming to provide a framework for the Ukrainian Ministry of\u000a      Education across their national HE sector.

This case study is underpinned by\u000a      a number of most significant projects, led by a number of staff based at\u000a      Northumbria within the UoA during the period.\u000a    The first, JUBILEE (1999-2004), was funded under the JISC Framework for\u000a      Monitoring and Evaluating User Behaviour in Information Seeking and Use of\u000a      IT and Information Services in UK HE, led by Dr L Banwell, Research and\u000a      Development Manager, then Director of the Information Management Research\u000a      Institute at Northumbria from 1999-2005. Over five cycles JUBILEE (JISC\u000a      User Behaviour in Information Seeking: Longitudinal Evaluation of\u000a      Electronic information services) involved national surveys and in-depth\u000a      case studies of both HE and FE information services. The findings revealed\u000a      that behaviour was unstructured and lacked a systematic approach to both\u000a      training and search patterns. A toolkit was produced for service providers\u000a      across the sector in the UK, USA and Europe which enabled information\u000a      practitioners to structure their service such that it provided the support\u000a      necessary for users to develop more efficient searching behaviours\u000a      (Reference 1). This work was complemented by the studies of two\u000a      fully-funded AHRC PhD studentships at Northumbria (1999-2002) which\u000a      explored \"The impact of access to electronic and digital information\u000a        resources on learning opportunities for young people\" (Pickard) and\u000a      \"The characteristics and development of young people's information\u000a        universes\" (Shenton). Their research provided insight into the role\u000a      of information behaviour in learning. It also provided a framework for\u000a      teachers and librarians to use in supporting children and students\u000a      learning in the emerging online environment. A follow-on three-year\u000a      longitudinal study of information behaviour in HE (2002-05) lead to the\u000a      revision of the original JUBILEE research toolkit to include guidelines\u000a      for supporting younger users in secondary and primary education (Reference\u000a      2). This work was led by Dr A Pickard (Lecturer at Northumbria from 2000,\u000a      and subsequently Senior then Principal Lecturer).\u000a    In 2006-07 case study research, led by Dr S McTavish (at Northumbria\u000a      between 1992 and 2007 first as Senior Lecturer then Principal Lecturer)\u000a      and Pickard, for local Public Library Authorities, as part of a national\u000a      initiative \"Welcome to your Library\" funded by the Paul Hamlyn\u000a      Trust, focused on the information needs and behaviour of refugees and\u000a      asylum seekers (RAS). It found that few RAS were aware of the free Public\u000a      Library service and were rather daunted by asking questions; those that\u000a      did use it found it a lifeline to friends and family (internet access) and\u000a      said all should be encouraged to use the service. This led to developments\u000a      in service provision in several regional libraries. For example, Newcastle\u000a      City Library created a community space with coffee mornings and short-term\u000a      loans of stock from the British Library in multiple languages for this\u000a      group of users; South Tyneside introduced a public information desk in the\u000a      library foyer and Sunderland; provision at Gateshead was found to be\u000a      appropriate to their community (Reference 3).\u000a    Research focusing on user behaviour in educational contexts was supported\u000a      by a Northumbria University Centre for Teaching and Learning (CETL) grant\u000a      (2008-10) (Pickard and Sambell). This project used action research to\u000a      explore the role of mentoring in scaffolding students through their\u000a      information literacy development; LIS final year students mentored second\u000a      year students in other disciplines during their information seeking\u000a      activities. An analysis of the outcomes identified how best to support\u000a      novice researchers in their information-seeking and how best to apply\u000a      formal interventions, such as guidelines on structured searches and an\u000a      introduction to online tutorials, into teaching plans.\u000a    In 2010 another JISC funded project \"Users' trust in information\u000a        resources in the web environment\", led by Pickard, continued to\u000a      develop this work in HE. This interdisciplinary research with colleagues\u000a      in psychology at Northumbria involved a systematic review of literature in\u000a      LIS and cognitive psychology and a community consultation with all\u000a      stakeholders (students, service providers and publishers). The research\u000a      led to the development of the \"iTrust\" model of online information\u000a      sources. The model added new dimensions to previous understanding of\u000a      users' trust in web-based resources, considering behaviour at the points\u000a      at which choices were made and intention to use particular sources. In\u000a      particular, it identified a need to address individual, personal models of\u000a      information interactions of young people (Reference 4). A follow-up\u000a      project in 2011 to determine how young people in Key Stages 4 and 5 (13-16\u000a      years) evaluate resources on the Web involved a survey of all students in\u000a      that age group at a secondary school in the North East of England\u000a      (Reference 5). This has resulted in a framework to guide the development\u000a      of personal, agile models of information behaviour of young people which\u000a      is now being applied by teachers and librarians in the UK, Europe and USA\u000a      (See Section 4).\u000a    In addition to the findings that increased our understanding of, and\u000a      ability to support, user behaviour in digital environments, research\u000a      methods in LIS were developed significantly during the course of\u000a      conducting this body of work. In particular, rigorous approaches to\u000a      qualitative investigation, in order to understand user interactions\u000a      better, were developed (Reference 6). This led to the publication of a\u000a      handbook on methods for LIS research.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35183","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The AC+erm research has achieved impact through its findings\u000a      (issues, solutions to adopt, and\u000a      strategic ERM framework), its participative methodology and its innovative\u000a      technology-enabled\u000a      dissemination strategy.

ARMS' Chief notes\u000a        that AC+erm's global and\u000a        diverse operational scope \"make it particularly valuable\" to the\u000a        organisation's operational\u000a        environment. \"Bottom line, AC+erm\u000a          jump-started our strategic planning, we're using it now to\u000a          flesh out an ERM roadmap.

Quite simply, an invaluable resource\"\u000a        (Source 2).\u000a      \u000aInfluencing methods, new ways of thinking and economic impact:\u000a        AC+erm led to a\u000a        different approach to decision-making and solution selection in the UN's\u000a        ARMS. The proposed\u000a        solution for a system to support a high-level, short-term panel\u000a        investigating a politically\u000a        sensitive incident was upgraded, despite a significant cost increase,\u000a        after ARMS applied\u000a        AC+erm's proportionate, risk-based paradigm in its assessment\u000a        of the proposal (Source 2).\u000a        AC+erm enabled ARMS to \"redefine the bottom line\" and\u000a        determine that reputation. Member\u000a        States' interests and long term access to records required the upgraded\u000a        solution. Conversely,\u000a        the same paradigm resulted in ARMS' decision not to invest in a\u000a        digital preservation system for\u000a        records of a \"high visibility\", \"historic\" UN commission,\u000a        but instead to recommend \"disposal of\u000a          the dataset on [its] closure\" and preserve duplicates in\u000a        file-based applications\/paper. This\u000a        enabled ARMS \"to realize cost avoidance to the organization in the\u000a          order of $300k.\" The\u000a        proportionate approach was accepted because AC+erm's risk\u000a        management is \"explicitly\u000a          positive and constructive (rather than just risk mitigation) [and]\u000a        supports strategic and\u000a          appropriate levels of resource allocation\". This validation of AC+erm\u000a        led to the issuance of\u000a        practical guidance for UN staff on ERM risk: https:\/\/archives.un.org\u000a        (Source 2).\u000a      \u000aShaping continuing professional development in the records\u000a            management discipline:\u000a        AC+erm led to the UN ARMS Chief's three-month sabbatical at\u000a        Northumbria (2013) - the first\u000a        awarded by the UN in records management. She extended her research\u000a        knowledge, evaluated\u000a        the new ERM strategic framework and is now implementing a phased\u000a        adoption in the\u000a        Secretariat. The sabbatical programme is limited, competitive and\u000a        prestigious and aims to\u000a        expose staff to \"state-of-the-art research and practices on issues on\u000a        the international agenda.\"\u000a        She used AC+erm outputs to develop a week-long development\u000a        programme in May 2013 for\u000a        UN staff in Bangkok: \"Content, activities, even training techniques\u000a          drew heavily on the\u000a          vignettes, Cynefin synthesis, and Delphi studies. Really great\u000a          response\" (Source 2). AC+erm\u000a        also led to practitioners engaging in research. Elizabeth Lomas, then\u000a        Records Manager at the\u000a        Royal Household, applied to study a PhD full-time with McLeod because of\u000a        her interest in\u000a        AC+erm (Nov 2007). Subsequently two of her 30 UK participants\u000a        in the doctoral study actively\u000a        discussed \"the benefits they perceived would come out of ... [the]\u000a          AC+erm project and stated\u000a          that this had made them want to actively take part in their `own'\u000a          research\" (Source 3).\u000a      \u000aInfluencing CPD, education and research internationally and\u000a            reframing debates:\u000a        Academics in the UK, China, Canada, New Zealand and Scandinavia have\u000a        used AC+erm since\u000a        2011 to inform the content of modules and lectures for continuing\u000a        professional development\u000a        (CPD) with practitioners and for undergraduate\/postgraduate students.\u000a        For example: \"I've used\u000a          those particular key findings statements [the importance of taking\u000a          into account the people\u000a          dimension, and also the role played by records managers (i.e. being\u000a          part of the problem)] as\u000a          scene setters, to establish why we need to talk about and investigate\u000a          these factors\" (Source 4,\u000a        Respondent 5). \"[The final project report] is an excellent tool to\u000a          discuss the complexity of RM\u000a          environments in an effective and relatively simple way\" (Source 4,\u000a        Respondent 2). Benefits are\u000a        that \"Students understand the interconnectedness of the three\u000a          perspectives [people,\u000a        processes, technology] and their future role as mediators between\u000a          often conflicting interests\"\u000a        (Source 4, Respondent 2) and \"the findings highlight the importance of\u000a        organizational and\u000a        human behavioural issues as challenges in implementing ERM systems\u000a        (Source 4,\u000a        Respondent 3). \"It is incredibly useful to be able to go beyond all\u000a          the anecdotal evidence that is\u000a          characteristic of records management\" (Source 4, Respondent 5). \"The\u000a          findings informed me,\u000a          as a teacher, substantively; they changed the content of my teaching\u000a          of change management\u000a          in that more evidence-based data and examples were available\"\u000a        (Source 4, Respondent 6).\u000a      AC+erm has \"made a very important contribution to\u000a          scholarly research in the discipline through\u000a          its development of an 'electronic' Delphi Technique\"; its \"innovative\u000a          research methodology\" has\u000a        been used annually since 2011 in two postgraduate research modules\u000a          \"when preparing\u000a          students to approach their own research projects.

ERM research is very limited with only one major global project\u000a      (InterPARES) and\u000a      relatively few doctoral studies. McLeod's AHRC funded AC+erm\u000a      research project (Accelerating\u000a      Positive Change in Electronic Records Management) (Reference 3) was\u000a      therefore significant not\u000a      only because of its subject coverage but also its methodology and global\u000a      participation.\u000a    Conducted from 2007-10 AC+erm remains the largest ERM research\u000a      project of its kind in the UK to\u000a      date. It investigated the people, processes and technology facets of\u000a      designing an organisation-\u000a      centred architecture for ERM to understand better the issues and develop\u000a      practical strategies to\u000a      accelerate change in managing e-records. It included a novel comprehensive\u000a      systematic literature\u000a      review, three empirical investigations conducted via global e-Delphi\u000a      studies and face-to-face\u000a      colloquia in the UK, and a major dissemination activity running throughout\u000a      the project, using a blog,\u000a      website, tweets and presentations. These engaged practitioners and\u000a      informed beneficiaries (with\u000a      global reach) of ongoing findings in a timely manner, to influence change\u000a      in understanding and\u000a      practice as the research proceeded. Over 200 professionals and academics\u000a      from multiple\u000a      disciplines and different stakeholder groups were engaged to create the\u000a      largest body of evidence\u000a      on the topic worldwide. The mixed methods approach and technology-focused\u000a      dissemination\u000a      strategy was innovative at the time and pushed boundaries in terms of\u000a      research in the discipline.\u000a      The research found that:\u000a    \u000a      there is a need to envision and articulate successful ERM;\u000a      people issues, rather than systems or technology, are at the heart\u000a        of\/central to the\u000a        challenge;\u000a      there is a wide range of critical success factors for ERM projects,\u000a        applicable to all\/most\u000a        organisations, but tactics and solutions are contextualised and complex;\u000a      the success and\/or failure of ERM implementations can be contingent on\u000a        the\u000a        presence\/absence of small or accidental factors;\u000a      traditional records management principles are applicable but practice\u000a        needs to be\u000a        adapted for the digital environment;\u000a      records professionals may be part of the problem as well as part of\u000a        the solution;\u000a      proportionate and risk- based approaches are needed (References 4, 5).\u000a    \u000a    Further synthesis of the data, using the Cynefin sense-making tool, has\u000a      led to a re-conceptualisation\u000a      of the ERM challenge and the development of a strategic framework to\u000a      understand the nature of the people issues which enables selection of the\u000a      appropriate approaches\u000a      for managing them in particular circumstances (Reference 6). This is\u000a      contributing to the\u000a      development of theory as well as practice.\u000a    The AC+erm research project team, on which this case study\u000a      focuses, was: Professor J McLeod, a\u000a      Reader at the start of the research (2007-); Ms S Childs, Senior Research\u000a      Fellow (2007-); Ms R\u000a      Hardiman, Senior Research Assistant (2007-10), now an external PhD student\u000a      at the University of\u000a      Amsterdam, and PhD student Dr N Hay-Gibson (2007-11).

This chapter (focused on the\u000d\u000a      international dimension of the Liverpool 2008 cultural programme) outlined\u000d\u000a      the `Cities on the Edge' (CotE) concept, described above. In its February\u000d\u000a      2004 report, the EU Selection Panel for European Capitals of Culture\u000d\u000a      welcomed the CotE concept as important in strengthening the otherwise\u000d\u000a      underdeveloped European dimension of the Liverpool bid. Considering the\u000d\u000a      importance of European cultural co-operation criteria in determining the\u000d\u000a      outcome of ECoC bids, it can be concluded that the CotE proposal made a\u000d\u000a      small but significant contribution to the UK jury's decision to choose\u000d\u000a      Liverpool as ECoC for 2008, and to the EU Panel's ratification of such\u000d\u000a      decision. Liverpool's designation as ECoC had a significant positive\u000d\u000a      impacts for the city. The 2008 ECoC programme attracted 9.7 million\u000d\u000a      additional visits to Liverpool, generating a total of &#163;753.8 million\u000d\u000a      additional direct visitor spend. 85% of Liverpool residents agreed with\u000d\u000a      the claim that \"the city was a better place to live than before the ECoC\u000d\u000a      award\" (1).\u000d\u000a    The positive response by the EU Panel was a key factor in Liverpool\u000d\u000a      Culture Company's decision to implement CotE as a project in the Liverpool\u000d\u000a      2008 cultural programme. Bianchini collaborated with Liverpool Culture\u000d\u000a      Company in the implementation of CotE in an advisory capacity from 2004-\u000d\u000a      2009. We must consider the impacts of the CotE project separately from the\u000d\u000a      wider impact of Liverpool's year as ECoC. Despite funding and management\u000d\u000a      difficulties, the CotE team and its partners were successful in several\u000d\u000a      projects, the definition of which was heavily influenced by Bianchini's\u000d\u000a      work. These included two conferences aimed at academics, policy makers and\u000d\u000a      other professionals: Intercultural Cities and On the\u000d\u000a        Waterfront; Culture, heritage and regeneration of port cities. The Rebel\u000d\u000a        Lectures programme was CotE's key initiative in the field of\u000d\u000a      dissident thought. The project was only partially implemented, and\u000d\u000a      revealed the need for more lead time, better planning, contextualisation\u000d\u000a      and publicity but achieved a remarkable coup in hosting Roberto Saviano,\u000d\u000a      the anti-Camorra Neapolitan writer, several months before the film of his\u000d\u000a      book, Gomorrah, came out in the UK. The visual arts projects\u000d\u000a      within CotE were especially successful. They included the production of\u000d\u000a      the edgy, high quality, interdisciplinary and highly cost effective Urban\u000d\u000a        Makers book, the well managed and artistically interesting Cities\u000a        on the Edge photography book and exhibition, the under-resourced but\u000d\u000a      imaginative Interchange exhibition, and the inspiring and\u000d\u000a      innovative Terminus film.\u000d\u000a    On the Edge of Passion, a film about football supporters in\u000d\u000a      Istanbul, Liverpool and Marseilles succeeded in attracting a wider\u000d\u000a      audience than that normally attending arts events. For the Likes of Us\u000d\u000a      was the collective name for arts projects in three of Liverpool's deprived\u000d\u000a      neighbourhoods. All projects within For the Likes of Us suffered\u000d\u000a      from underfunding and poor publicity, although they generally achieved a\u000d\u000a      good artistic quality. The key factor for the more successful of these\u000d\u000a      projects, La Dolce Vita (in the Kirkdale neighbourhood), was the\u000d\u000a      high quality of research on the artistic concept, and of collaboration and\u000d\u000a      strategic build-up of audience participation. CotE projects had a variety\u000d\u000a      of beneficiaries, ranging from the cultural sector and community\u000d\u000a      organizations in Liverpool, to individual artists and arts audiences in\u000d\u000a      the six participating cities, to the academics, policy makers and other\u000d\u000a      professionals attending the conferences. A total of just over 158,000\u000d\u000a      people (according to data supplied by the Liverpool Culture Company)\u000d\u000a      attended CotE events (the vast majority of whom &#8212; about 120,000 &#8212; watched\u000d\u000a      the open air screenings of the Terminus film).\u000d\u000a    Bianchini's co-authored book, Planning for the Intercultural City\u000d\u000a      (2004) was a key source of inspiration for the joint Council of\u000d\u000a      Europe\/European Commission Intercultural Cities action research project.\u000d\u000a      The project started in 2008 as a joint initiative of the Council of Europe\u000d\u000a      and of the European Commission. Its aim was introduce a new model of\u000d\u000a      governance and policy in multi- ethnic European cities. The project\u000d\u000a      provided examples of good practice, and made recommendations for reforming\u000d\u000a      policies in areas ranging from education to planning and urban design, the\u000d\u000a      arts, housing and economic development. The project also recommended\u000d\u000a      training and research initiatives to strengthen the intercultural skills\u000d\u000a      of local policy-makers. Eleven cities from eleven different European\u000d\u000a      countries were chosen to take part in the project's pilot programme in\u000d\u000a      2008. Nine additional cities joined the project in 2011. The main\u000d\u000a      beneficiaries were stakeholders working in the fields of cultural\u000d\u000a      diversity, community relations, multiculturalism, interculturalism and\u000d\u000a      anti-racism: local authority officers, politicians, other policy makers,\u000d\u000a      community activists and representatives, journalists and other\u000d\u000a      professionals.\u000d\u000a    (1) Data from Garcia, B.

Bianchini conducted this research from 1995-2007\u000d\u000a      at De Montfort University, Leicester, where he was Reader in Cultural\u000d\u000a      Planning and Policy and, since 2007, at Leeds Metropolitan University,\u000d\u000a      where he is Professor of Cultural Policy and Planning. Intercultural\u000d\u000a      exchange and interculturalism as a force for cultural, social and economic\u000d\u000a      dynamism and innovation are themes shared by Bianchini's research on\u000d\u000a      multi-ethnic cities and on port cities. Bianchini started researching\u000d\u000a      interculturalism in cities in the early 2000s, as part of the\u000d\u000a      `Intercultural Cities' research project inaugurated by independent\u000d\u000a      research centre Comedia with support from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation.\u000d\u000a      His book, Planning for the Intercultural City (2004) co-authored\u000d\u000a      with Jude Bloomfield, maps different policy approaches to managing ethnic\u000d\u000a      diversity in cities. The book makes the case for interculturalism as a\u000d\u000a      more effective model than multiculturalism (the dominant policy framework\u000d\u000a      in the UK). This particular area of research has been an interest since\u000d\u000a      1999, but it is a continuing strand of his work within the REF period and\u000d\u000a      during his time at Leeds Metropolitan University.\u000d\u000a    The concept of `Cities on the Edge' (CotE) defines how port cities like\u000d\u000a      Liverpool, Naples and Marseilles share a strong sense of their own\u000d\u000a      cultural identity, shaped by their history as ports, their openness to the\u000d\u000a      sea and the wider world, through the flux of migrants and port activities\u000d\u000a      bringing with them new ideas, musical styles and fashions. Port cities are\u000d\u000a      places of rebelliousness, autonomous cultural traditions, unorthodox\u000d\u000a      political action, and religious and cultural diversity. Simultaneously\u000d\u000a      these cities enjoyed a culturally iconic status abroad. Edginess as a\u000d\u000a      quality had to do with distinctive cultural attributes &#8212; which were shared\u000d\u000a      &#8212; including distinctive dialects, irreverent humour and a desperate\u000d\u000a      passion for football. The latter expressed a way of winning against\u000d\u000a      national economic, political and media establishments in the UK, France\u000d\u000a      and Italy that often designated Liverpool, Marseilles and Naples as\u000d\u000a      `losers'. A rebellious streak of anarchic individualism was identified in\u000d\u000a      all three cities, combined with strong communal solidarities, expressing\u000d\u000a      an independent spirit of the city and at the same time an underdog\u000d\u000a      mentality. Allied to these positive attributes, a difficult darker side\u000d\u000a      was also highlighted in job insecurity, unemployment and disorder, illicit\u000d\u000a      pleasures that could blur into addiction and organised crime, problems\u000d\u000a      which appeared endemic and insoluble, but to which the re-evaluation of\u000d\u000a      the positive aspects of cultural edginess perhaps offered a new, more\u000d\u000a      fruitful response. One of the key aims of the CotE project was to create\u000d\u000a      new international cultural linkages which would enhance the openness of\u000d\u000a      the cities taking part in the project. CotE explored the multiple meanings\u000d\u000a      of the concept of `edge': geographical, political, socio-economic,\u000d\u000a      artistic, and psychological, in relation to the participating cities.\u000d\u000a    CotE resulted directly in sixteen cultural projects involving the six\u000d\u000a      participating cities, 12 of which were directly influenced by Bianchini's\u000d\u000a      work. These included an opera, three international conferences (on serious\u000d\u000a      and organised crime, on intercultural cities and the regeneration of port\u000d\u000a      cities respectively), a series of public lectures (the `Rebel Lectures'),\u000d\u000a      an anthology of short stories, the publication of three books (an\u000d\u000a      anthology of short stories, a collection of essays about radical urban\u000d\u000a      tactics and a photographic book), two films, an international youth\u000d\u000a      theatre festival, two community arts projects involving different artistic\u000d\u000a      disciplines, a tour of unsigned rock and pop bands, and two visual arts\u000d\u000a      projects (an exhibition and an installation.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35581","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of this body of work has been far-reaching. The book on\u000a      strategic planning was the first of a series of 17 published by Kogan Page\u000a      and the CIPR &#8212; edited by Gregory. Since 1996, it has been the core text in\u000a      strategic planning for the CIPR's professional courses taught in the UK\u000a      and overseas, and a recommended text for the CIPR's 57 approved UK\u000a      University courses. It has been translated into 10 different languages,\u000a      including Chinese. A shortened version of the book forms the basis of a\u000a      chapter in Europe's best selling edited textbook on public relations\u000a      (Tench and Yeomans, 2008). Professional-body approval denotes that\u000a      strategic planning is recognised as a corner-stone of practitioner\u000a      competence. In addition, as President of the CIPR, Gregory led the\u000a      Institute to Chartered status with professional development being a\u000a      mainstay of the application to the Privy Council. In recognition of this\u000a      work she was awarded the Sir Stephen Tallents medal in 2009 for her\u000a      outstanding contribution to the profession, one of only 30 ever recipients\u000a      of this honour.\u000a    Secondly, following the work done with the Cabinet Office in 2004-2005,\u000a      all Whitehall Departments reframed their approach to communication\u000a      capability development. While the original version of Evolve has been\u000a      superseded, the most recent iteration (March 2013) was reviewed by Gregory\u000a      and returned to the process approach first designed by her in 2005. The\u000a      courses on Strategic Communication and Stakeholder Engagement developed\u000a      for the Cabinet Office and delivered by the Centre for PR Research (Leeds\u000a      Met) from 2004 became part of the core offering for Government Departments\u000a      until it was taken over by the National School for Government on the basis\u000a      of cost in 2009. As a result there has been a notable up-skilling and\u000a      upgrading of the communication function in a number of them, for example,\u000a      the Departments of Work and Pensions, Health, Transport and Her Majesty's\u000a      Revenues and Customs. A number of Ministries commissioned the Centre to\u000a      deliver bespoke sessions for them, including Scottish Office, DEFRA,\u000a      Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and Welsh Office. Gregory, on\u000a      attachment to the Cabinet Office in 2012, benchmarked their CPD courses\u000a      for academic accreditation which lays the ground for them being part of a\u000a      full Masters, with the framework allowing study up to doctoral level.\u000a    In 2013, Gregory was appointed by the Cabinet Office as a communication\u000a      capability Reviewer of Government Departments and was also one of five\u000a      Livechat Panelists (including the Executive Director of Government\u000a      Communication) launching the Government Communication Service, the\u000a      successor to the Government Communication Network.\u000a    Thirdly, the impact of work done for the DH has been extensive. NHS\u000a      Evolve (developed 2005- 2006) provided a web-based capability framework,\u000a      purpose built for the NHS and developed from the Cabinet Office research.\u000a      An enhancement was research on the specific competencies of senior\u000a      communicators which formed the basis of the first paper on communicator\u000a      competencies (Gregory, 2008) published in the field's foremost academic\u000a      journal.\u000a    The research underpinning the DH Best Practice policy document, TCO,\u000a      issued to all NHS organisations has been the subject of academic and\u000a      practitioner conferences around the world, including in Europe,\u000a      Scandinavia, South Africa, Australasia and the World Public Relations\u000a      Forum in Stockholm in 2010 where Gregory was a plenary speaker with Klaus\u000a      Schwab of the World Economic Forum and Professor Mervyn King. This\u000a      capability research was drawn together in a co- authored book by Gregory\u000a      and Willis (2013) which is the world's first on public relations\u000a      leadership. TCO remains the communication policy guide in the NHS and\u000a      formed part of the Authorisation process for Clinical Commissioning Groups\u000a      in 2013. Its principles are currently being used by the Trust Development\u000a      Authority to assess Trusts aspiring to Foundation status. The content has\u000a      also been adapted for a range of different professional audiences\u000a      including communicators from local government and the private sector.\u000a    The research underpinned a closed Masters programme in Strategic\u000a      Communication for the NHS which ran from 2009 - 2012 (withdrawn since the\u000a      changes in the system). It drew delegates from up to Board level and was\u000a      delivered using an innovative co-creation methodology (see Willis &amp;\u000a      McKie, 2012). Three graduates from the programme moved onto the NHS Top\u000a      Leaders programme for future CEOs. The Centre for Public Relations\u000a      Research also secured the NHS pilot Graduate Trainee Scheme in\u000a      Communication.\u000a    The work done to date has led to the Centre being involved in the\u000a      development and delivery of on-going Executive development programmes for\u000a      UK local authorities and private sector firms, the South African\u000a      Government (recently secured in association with the University of\u000a      Pretoria as partner), Swedish Institute of Public Relations (Professional\u000a      body) and leadership development for the New Zealand professional body.\u000a    The impact of the research with the Global Alliance has also been\u000a      significant. The principles behind the Stockholm Accords and Melbourne\u000a      Mandate initiatives have been embedded in professional body curricula\u000a      across the world, therefore every practitioner who takes a professional\u000a      qualification benefits from Gregory's research.

This is being undertaken by the Centre for Public\u000a      Relations Studies at Leeds Metropolitan University, of which Professor\u000a      Gregory is Director.\u000a    The starting point was Gregory's identification of the lack of a\u000a      systematic approach to planning communication programmes and campaigns for\u000a      large organisations. The planning process model she developed, first\u000a      published in 1996, was underpinned by research which synthesised academic\u000a      and practitioner models, the academic literature and practice experience.\u000a      The resultant text was endorsed by the professional body, the Chartered\u000a      Institute of Public Relations (CIPR) and is the most widely disseminated\u000a      book in a series of 17 published jointly by Kogan Page and the Chartered\u000a      Institute of Public Relations.\u000a    The founding research began in the mid-1990s, but accelerated when\u000a      Gregory proposed a structured approach to capability development to\u000a      Government. A secondment to the Cabinet Office resulted in 2004-2005 where\u000a      she led a team which developed the Government's capability framework,\u000a      Evolve, used across Whitehall. The research underpinning Evolve took a\u000a      grounded approach and included secondary and primary research into\u000a      capability and educational frameworks generally and then focused\u000a      specifically on communication education and training. The resulting model\u000a      embedded capability within a strategic process framework for communication\u000a      - unique at the time. In 2005 Gregory became an advisor to the Permanent\u000a      Secretary for Government Communication, after providing evidence to the\u000a      Phillis Review (2004) and delivered courses based on Evolve. A further\u000a      attachment to the Cabinet Office in 2012 resulted in the articulation of\u000a      academic accreditation for Government professional development leading to\u000a      Masters and Doctoral qualifications.\u000a    Between 2005-2007 the capability work was extended by the Department of\u000a      Health (DH) who funded research to adapt and extend Evolve. It involved\u000a      further primary research into the competencies needed by communicators in\u000a      the NHS. An additional piece of largely qualitative research investigating\u000a      `What Good Looks Like' in NHS Communication was commissioned in 2009 from\u000a      Gregory and her Leeds Met colleague, Paul Willis and underpins the Good\u000a      Practice policy document `The Communicating Organisation' (TCO) issued by\u000a      DH in 2009 to all NHS organisations. This was supplemented by conceptual\u000a      research in 2010 on metrics to evaluate organisational performance in\u000a      communication. In 2011-12, Gregory, on attachment to DH, completed primary\u000a      research using the principles of TCO to frame communication capability\u000a      requirements in the wake of the Health and Social Care Act 2012.\u000a    In parallel to these activities Gregory has taken an active role with the\u000a      national and global professional associations. In 2004 she was President\u000a      of the CIPR and in June 2013 she became Chair of the Global Alliance (GA),\u000a      the confederation of professional associations worldwide. In 2010 she was\u000a      responsible for co-developing the Stockholm Accords, an action-research\u000a      led, global benchmark for the profession and in 2012 co-developed the\u000a      Melbourne Mandate, an advocacy platform for the profession, which was\u000a      again action-research led. These initiatives have been used by\u000a      professional bodies, organisations, and NGOs internationally as a\u000a      benchmark for inclusion in their own capability programmes.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35587","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"},{"GeoNamesId":"1835841","Name":"South Korea"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"1694008","Name":"Philippines"},{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"},{"GeoNamesId":"597427","Name":"Lithuania"},{"GeoNamesId":"1668284","Name":"Taiwan"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Research in contemporary women's writing has had specific impact by\u000a      contributing to the\u000a      continuing personal and professional development of members of the public\u000a      and postgraduate\u000a      students significantly beyond Leeds Metropolitan University.

S. Byatt's and Alice Walker's short stories that include discussion\u000a      points deriving from their\u000a      research on these texts published in outputs 6 and 1 above. There have\u000a      been 72 individual visitors\u000a      to the CWWA book club website and 123 visits (ie. times the site has been\u000a      visited).\u000a    Research into contemporary women's writing has had impact on PGRs\u000a      extending significantly\u000a      beyond Leeds Metropolitan University. Watkins and Eagleton have provided\u000a      informal mentoring for\u000a      PGR students, opportunities for them to disseminate their own research\u000a      (via publication and\u000a      conference attendance) and have encouraged them to develop their ideas\u000a      about organisation and\u000a      leadership for women within academia. Dr Watkins is one of the organisers\u000a      of an AHRC-funded\u000a      Collaborative Skills Development programme in contemporary women's\u000a      writing, along with\u000a      Professor Lucie Armitt (PI, University of Lincoln), Professor Clare Hanson\u000a      (University of\u000a      Southampton), Dr Nadine Muller and Dr Fiona Tolan (both Liverpool John\u000a      Moores University) and\u000a      Professor Gina Wisker (University of Brighton) that is open to PGR\u000a      students across the UK. In\u000a      addition, CWWA was able to fund travel bursaries for both early career\u000a      scholars and (jointly with\u000a      PGCWWN) for postgraduate research students to attend the 2012 Taiwan\u000a      conference and also\u000a      offer a cash prize for the best conference papers delivered by scholars in\u000a      both categories.\u000a    CWWA has organised and supported a number of conferences and public\u000a        lectures.

It also studies the relationships between gender, race,\u000a      sexuality, ethnicity, and age in\u000a      contemporary literature. This work was carried out between 2000 and 2012\u000a      by Mary Eagleton,\u000a      Reader and then Professor from 1999-2010 in the School of Cultural Studies\u000a      at Leeds Metropolitan\u000a      University, Dr Susan Watkins, Reader in Twentieth-Century Women's Fiction,\u000a      also at Leeds\u000a      Metropolitan University (employed from 1998 onwards and as Reader from\u000a      2007) and by Dr Alice\u000a      Ridout, Post-Doctoral Fellow in Contemporary Women's Writing from 2006-9.\u000a    The research includes Professor Eagleton's project on gender, authorship\u000a      and the literary field,\u000a      which includes the publication of one monograph and a number of articles.\u000a      Dr Watkins's research\u000a      project in this period concerns the Nobel Prize-winning novelist Doris\u000a      Lessing and the relationships\u000a      between gender, race, nation and empire throughout her literary career.\u000a      This project has resulted\u000a      in one monograph, one co-edited essay collection (with Ridout), 3 articles\u000a      and the co-editing of two\u000a      special issues of journals. Dr Ridout's work has focused on contemporary\u000a      women writers' use of\u000a      re-writing as a strategy that reveals a shift from 1960s irony to\u000a      twenty-first century nostalgia. She\u000a      has published one monograph, one co-edited essay collection (with Watkins)\u000a      and 1 article.\u000a      Eagleton and Watkins co-edited a journal special issue on `The Future\u000a        of Fiction: The Future of\u000a        Feminism'. In 2006 Professor Eagleton founded a new international,\u000a      peer reviewed journal in this\u000a      field: Contemporary Women's Writing, published by Oxford\u000a      University Press. The first issue\u000a      appeared in 2007. Prof Eagleton was co-editor from 2007 until 2009 and Dr\u000a      Watkins is an\u000a      associate editor. Dr Ridout was book reviews editor from 2009-11.\u000a    Until recently there was no organization devoted to research into\u000a      contemporary women's writing. In\u000a      2005 Professor Eagleton established the Contemporary Women's Writing\u000a      Network, a forum for\u000a      promoting, supporting and disseminating research in this area, organised\u000a      by a steering group with\u000a      members representing 10 UK Universities. Professor Eagleton was Chair of\u000a      the steering group, Dr\u000a      Ridout was Secretary and Dr Watkins was a member. In March 2011 the\u000a      network was formally\u000a      constituted as the Contemporary Women's Writing Association (CWWA) and\u000a      currently has 204\u000a      members from around the world. The Association is currently chaired by Dr\u000a      Watkins. The\u000a      Executive is made up of elected officers and co-opted members representing\u000a      12 UK universities.\u000a      Members of the Executive are the leading figures in the field publishing\u000a      the most important work in\u000a      this area. In the past 8 years CWWA has established a website; helped\u000a      establish what has become\u000a      a thriving network (PGCWWN) and website for postgraduate students; been\u000a      recognised by the\u000a      English Association as a special interest group; organized 8 international\u000a      conferences; supported a\u000a      number of events, public lectures and seminars and established a virtual\u000a      book club.

Community groups, including LGBT groups\u000d\u000a      have also invited her to\u000d\u000a      speak on her work and discuss it with local people. This includes Equity\u000d\u000a      Partnership, Bradford (Feb\u000d\u000a      2012), and The Grave Passions arts event which was funded by London\u000d\u000a      Borough of Southwark\u000d\u000a      which was sold-out and oversubscribed.\u000d\u000a    Oram's interviews with curators at various case study historic sites has\u000d\u000a      also increased the mutual\u000d\u000a      understanding of the context of interpreting under-represented themes in\u000d\u000a      heritage and has played\u000d\u000a      a part in their interpretation policies and operational practices. For\u000d\u000a      example, her work on historic\u000d\u000a      houses and sexuality has led to consultation by English Heritage, in the\u000d\u000a      context of recent\u000d\u000a      parliamentary legislation (the Single Equalities Act 2010) which requires\u000d\u000a      public bodies to actively\u000d\u000a      consider their policies to take account of\/not discriminate in relation to\u000d\u000a      various protected\u000d\u000a      characteristics, including sexual orientation and gender.

His\u000a      knowledge of representational practices in marketing has enabled him to\u000a      make a very significant\u000a      contribution to the way that the City of York has understood the needs of\u000a      its visitor segments,\u000a      developed products to meet these needs and helped to place culture and\u000a      heritage at the centre of\u000a      the city's evolving tourism strategy. This recognition led to the\u000a      appointment of Dr Watson, in 2009,\u000a      as a non-executive Director of Visit York, the private sector company that\u000a      manages and markets\u000a      tourism in the City of York and the surrounding area in North Yorkshire.\u000a      He was re-elected for a\u000a      second term as a Director in 2012.\u000a    He has also convened and chaired the Director's Research Committee of the\u000a      same organisation.\u000a      This involved developing the organisation's overall competence in visitor\u000a      research and its\u000a      integration within the strategic marketing process through identification\u000a      of new market segments\u000a      using SPSS software. A key part of these developments has been to\u000a      integrate the business's\u000a      research activity with other aspects of its marketing activity, including\u000a      segmentation, product\u000a      development, campaigns and evaluation. The segmentation analysis has\u000a      benefitted in particular\u000a      from Dr Watson's research collaboration with the University of Seville.\u000a    Latterly, the work on representational practice, destination marketing\u000a      and community heritage has\u000a      found another application in the development of a new strategy for tourism\u000a      for the City of York. The\u000a      City Council in partnership with Visit York engaged Dr Watson not only to\u000a      help in developing the\u000a      strategy itself but also to seek his advice on the crucial issues of\u000a      stakeholder involvement in these\u000a      processes and the inclusion of local communities and communities of\u000a      interest in formulating the\u000a      strategy. In order to achieve this he organized three consultation\u000a      workshops that were carried out\u000a      at the City Council's headquarters and involved residents, local\u000a      businesses, politicians, members\u000a      of the arts community, the hospitality industry and attractions providers.\u000a      As well as organizing\u000a      these events Dr Watson used group facilitation techniques in order to\u000a      establish the views and\u000a      priorities of those involved.\u000a    In providing advice and support to the City Council and Visit York for\u000a      the strategy process Dr\u000a      Watson organised a conference at the University where he used his\u000a      knowledge and research in\u000a      the heritage and cultural sector to facilitate discussion and further\u000a      consultation with residents,\u000a      representatives of community groups and leaders in the local cultural\u000a      industries sector. This activity\u000a      has had a major impact in terms of the integration of academic and\u000a      practitioner activity that has\u000a      been fully recognised in the sector and which has provided stimuli for\u000a      tourism development &#8212; particularly\u000a      cultural tourism &#8212; and contributed to the overall quality of the tourist\u000a      experience in the\u000a      city and its surrounding area.

The study\u000a      involved an examination of\u000a      heritage buildings in both urban and rural locations and led to the\u000a      concept of the `rural-historic' as a\u000a      key marketing element in English tourism and part of an authorised\u000a      discursive domain in heritage\u000a      that had been established by his PhD supervisor, Laurajane Smith, in the\u000a      highly influential book\u000a      The Uses of Heritage (2006). This research was later written up as\u000a      `Country matters: the rural-historic\u000a      as an authorised heritage discourse in England' (see below for details).\u000a      His interest in the\u000a      ways in which culture and heritage are used in tourism extended into the\u000a      community management\u000a      of heritage and tourism resources, and he has actively sought\u000a      opportunities to apply this\u000a      knowledge in practical situations through engagement with tourism and\u000a      heritage operators in the\u000a      geographical region within which he is based. The starting point for these\u000a      applications of theory is\u000a      the ways in which heritage and culture can be embedded in tourism\u000a      governance, the strategic\u000a      management of tourism and the modalities of tourism marketing.\u000a    On the basis of these interests Dr Watson has co-edited five books (which\u000a      include chapters written\u000a      by him), and co-authored a fifth. He has also edited a special edition of\u000a      a journal and co-authored a\u000a      journal article exploring these themes in detail. A recent edited book,\u000a      co-edited with colleagues in\u000a      Australia, Heritage Tourism: Place Encounter Engagement\u000a      (Routledge, 2013) explores the ways in\u000a      which representational practice and touristic engagement reflect wider\u000a      concerns with politics and\u000a      identity. Each of the four edited books contains chapters that he has\u000a      either authored or co-authored.\u000a      His forthcoming co-authored book, The Semiotics of Heritage Tourism\u000a      (Channel View,\u000a      2014) examines in detail the narratives and discourses involved in the\u000a      marketing of heritage\u000a      attractions. The first book, Culture Heritage and Representation:\u000a        Perspectives on Visuality and the\u000a        Past (Ashgate, 2010), co-edited with Emma Waterton at the University\u000a      of Western Sydney, is an\u000a      examination of visual culture in the context of heritage tourism and draws\u000a      on a wide variety of\u000a      mainly UK and European-based case studies. His own chapter deals with the\u000a      representation and\u000a      marketing of heritage tourism on the Greek island of Rhodes. The second\u000a      book, edited with Emma\u000a      Waterton, Heritage and Community Engagement: Collaboration or\u000a        Contestation (Routledge, 2011),\u000a      is an examination of the ways in which heritage is managed and displayed\u000a      at the level of\u000a      community action and draws on case studies from Australia, Africa, the\u000a      Middle East and Europe. A\u000a      key feature of the book is the challenge it makes to conventional views of\u000a      community heritage as a\u000a      fully achieved goal within the sector and the ways in which communities in\u000a      their various forms\u000a      might be more effectively engaged. The third book, edited with Emma\u000a      Waterton and Laurajane\u000a      Smith, The Cultural Moment in Tourism (Routledge, 2012), is an\u000a      examination of the individual and\u000a      subjective aspects of engagement with cultural tourism and again draws on\u000a      international case\u000a      studies, from the United States, Europe, South East Asia and Australia.\u000a      This book was inspired by\u000a      a Visit York Board meeting when directors were discussing how visitors\u000a      engage subjectively with\u000a      the city's heritage and how this engagement could be developed in\u000a      marketing attractions. One of\u000a      Dr Watson's recent journal articles, co-authored with Emma Waterton,\u000a      `Reading the Visual:\u000a      Representation and Narrative in the Construction of Heritage' (see below\u000a      for details), draws on\u000a      case studies in the United Kingdom and Greece to demonstrate the\u000a      centrality of visual\u000a      representations in the marketing of heritage attractions, and the ways in\u000a      which these are linked\u000a      with dominant discourses about the past and about identity.\u000a    The common thread running through Dr Watson's work is an abiding concern\u000a      with the role that\u000a      cultural heritage plays in the development of communities and the\u000a      strategic marketing of\u000a      destinations and, accordingly, the challenges these pose for an effective,\u000a      balanced and inclusive\u000a      perspective on the way the past is constructed through heritage narratives\u000a      relating to issues such\u000a      as tourism, identity, sense of place and development.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39013","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Alamouti's production company Contra-Image is evidence of a beneficiary\u000d\u000a      whereby a new business has been created and is a viable entity that is\u000d\u000a      generating economic and cultural value.

His outputs\u000d\u000a      collectively share the desire to facilitate and foster debate concerned\u000d\u000a      with how narrativisation is inevitably intertwined with power structures\u000d\u000a      in the Foucauldian sense. As such he is committed to exploring new\u000d\u000a      egalitarian approaches to narrative expression in documentary filmmaking.\u000d\u000a      As a research-as-practice case study the underpinning research is\u000d\u000a      embodied in the output. For example,\u000d\u000a      Gilad and all that Jazz, produced between 2009-2011, included a\u000d\u000a      wide range of research methodologies such as archival mining, first person\u000d\u000a      interviews, historical analysis, oral history, the use of written and\u000d\u000a      visual testimonies, and semiotic reconfigurations. The pre-production\u000d\u000a      research centred on the life story and ideas of Gilad Atzmon, the\u000d\u000a      internationally renowned jazz musician, political activist and author.\u000d\u000a      Within the films broader remit his story was located within Israeli\u000d\u000a      identity politics and the occupation of Palestine. This resulted in the\u000d\u000a      first documentary to tackle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through this\u000d\u000a      type of prism and opened up a cultural and political debate that has long\u000d\u000a      remained repressed.\u000d\u000a    Boys with Broken Ears, produced between 2011 and 2013, was\u000d\u000a      motivated by the desire to represent and understand a neglected layer of\u000d\u000a      Iranian society: its working class youth. In the last ten years Iran has\u000d\u000a      emerged as a regional super-power at the centre of regional conflicts that\u000d\u000a      have the potential to escalate. However, in a country where 70% are under\u000d\u000a      30 years of age and 90% of these are from working class families, the\u000d\u000a      western mediatised image of Iran remains Tehran and middle-class centric;\u000d\u000a      the westernised individuals who make up 3% of the population. Using\u000d\u000a      interviews, archival mining, historical and social analysis and\u000d\u000a      documentation of events such as a world sporting championships, Alamouti\u000d\u000a      produced the first ever film to gain intimate access to the ordinary\u000d\u000a      working class youth living outside of Tehran. The research illuminated a\u000d\u000a      layer of society that is not in favour of the Islamic regime, as many\u000d\u000a      commentators have suggested, and who are deeply concerned by being held\u000d\u000a      back by stifling poverty and government betrayal. Produced between 2008\u000d\u000a      and 2009, The Citizens' Project initiated research that led to the\u000d\u000a      first global example of a web-documentary based on user-generated content.\u000d\u000a      Its objective was to explore citizenship on a global scale and was made 3\u000d\u000a      years before Kevin Macdonald's YouTube produced \"Life in a Day\".\u000d\u000a    The project was underpinned by research that created new technical and\u000d\u000a      procedural documentary filmmaking methods that solely used the Internet\u000d\u000a      for all stages of the production (from pre-production planning and\u000d\u000a      development through to distribution\/exhibition). It also involved\u000d\u000a      discursive investigations into modern citizenship concerned with finding a\u000d\u000a      way to represent and understand the often spatially fixed concept of\u000d\u000a      national identity through the increasingly de-territorialised medium of\u000d\u000a      the world wide web. Collectively this practise-as-research method\u000d\u000a      facilitated multiple directors from around the world and resulted in a\u000d\u000a      prize-winning documentary filmic experienced delivered via the web.\u000d\u000a    The sense of collective nationhood was similarly explored in the research\u000d\u000a      that informed Voices of Courage, produced in 2010 for the BBC.\u000d\u000a      Again, a wide range of research methods from historiography to interviews\u000d\u000a      and the analysis of archival data alongside qualitative accounts of\u000d\u000a      personal testimonies from individuals underpinned a film that was a\u000d\u000a      complex interrogation of space, place and identity. The research, based on\u000d\u000a      socio-historic themes, ideas and discourses, informed the approach to the\u000d\u000a      production which provided an alternative voice to the aggressive and\u000d\u000a      xenophobic attitudes that were being expressed through some elements of\u000d\u000a      the mainstream media on issues of asylum seeking.\u000d\u000a    Most recently Alamouti won a development grant from the Wellcome Trust\u000d\u000a      (out of 120 projects) to further develop his next documentary \"The Goodbye\u000d\u000a      Club\", which explores the psychological experience of dying from a first\u000d\u000a      person perspective. The project was the culmination of innovative\u000d\u000a      interview methods and research skills and credentials that Alamouti\u000d\u000a      acquired while working on Gilad and All That Jazz and Boys With Broken\u000d\u000a      Ears.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39024","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Solent Screen Research Cluster has seen numerous specialisms evolve\u000a      since its inception. One of the key areas has been original research and\u000a      publications focussing on largely neglected areas of sex and sexuality\u000a      studies in film representation and culture. The research, publications and\u000a      subsequent impact for this case study have emerged from and been shaped by\u000a      the work of the Onscenity Research Network &#8212; an AHRC funded initiative\u000a      (originally based at Sheffield University) which engages specifically with\u000a      the cultural, political and contemporary aspects of sex and sexuality in\u000a      the UK and Internationally. Forged from a symposium exploring the\u000a      possibilities of such a network (to which Kerr and Hines were specifically\u000a      invited) the Onscenity Research Network has grown into the dominant\u000a      forerunner which bridges academic studies with public and political\u000a      understanding of sexual cultures. This has recently culminated in the\u000a      emergence of the first ever Porn Studies journal (to which Kerr was\u000a      invited to be a member of the Editorial Board and Hines and Peberdy\u000a      invited as regular peer reviewers) which has garnered numerous headlines\u000a      in the press and stimulated debate on the cultural value of sexual\u000a      representation, pornography and the pornification of culture in the media\u000a      and political arenas. It is within this sphere that the sex and\u000a      sexualities research, outputs and impact noted in this case study &#8212;\u000a      particularly around the creative economy &#8212; can be found.\u000a    Kerr has been curating the Controversies, Short Film and BAFTA strands\u000a      for the annual Southampton Film Week, an event which engages broadly with\u000a      the public in various capacities including film education outside of\u000a      academia. The Controversies strand saw a research-informed talk on early\u000a      representations of sex in film to the public (Sex on Screen: An\u000a        Illustrated Talk, Oct 13 2010) and the Short Film strand has had\u000a      numerous short films screened by local and international filmmakers on\u000a      matters of sex and sexuality (for example Exploring the Body: Short\u000a        Film Roundtable, Discussion and Screening, Oct 8 2009). Also members\u000a      cited in this case study hosted a Short Film Special: Women and Film\u000a      (Oct 10 2011) with women filmmakers exploring the debate about gender,\u000a      filmmaking and film culture in the UK. Mark de Valk has presented\u000a      screenings of his film work including the Foucault inspired short film The\u000a        Life of Herculine Barbin (2009) and feature length film The Body\u000a        As Montage: A Spectacle of Punishment (2010) which examines gender,\u000a      sexuality, state politics and culture. The latter has also been selected\u000a      and screened at special events for the Lighthouse Cultural Centre in\u000a      Brighton (June 2010) and the Portobello Film Festival in London (September\u000a      2010). Both films draw on his doctoral research as one of the first\u000a      successful recipients of a PhD by Practice in film. Southampton Film Week\u000a      has attendees from across the country with a significant focus on the\u000a      south and south coast with a remit closely centred on public and community\u000a      engagement.

The research is located in,\u000a      connected to and influenced by related work emerging from the UK based Onscenity\u000a        Research Network Group, which has been involved in public, political\u000a      and policy debate on matters of sex and sexuality in British society and\u000a      culture (which we are members of). The cross-disciplinary nature of the\u000a      research acknowledges a shift towards the mainstream in the cinematic\u000a      representation of previously marginalized sexual practices that are often\u000a      comfortably demonized rather than critically discussed and explored.\u000a    Many current studies have opened up discussions concerning sex on screen\u000a      but remain rather broad and fixed in gender politics and feminist\u000a      discourses around sex on screen. The research draws on the recent critical\u000a      history of sex on screen through a context that acknowledges a range of\u000a      key critical thinkers in the field. This includes building on the\u000a      pioneering work of Linda Williams' breakthrough study from 1989, Hard\u000a        Core: Power, Pleasure and the `Frenzy of the Visible', which has now\u000a      come to be recognised as an indispensable account of the subject and the\u000a      need to address matters of on\/scenity whereby sex is on-scene\u000a      rather than merely ob-scene. The research underpinning this case study\u000a      extends the work of Williams by examining sex as text in both theory and\u000a      practice while continuing to question the concept of on\/scenity as\u000a      cultural attitudes to the explicit and obscene change. The demand to\u000a      historicise, theorise and frankly confront matters of sex and sexuality\u000a      through screen studies is effectively our central tenet intended to\u000a      illustrate how sex and sexuality on screen is eclectic, expressive and\u000a      demands closer examination. A research-based approach predicated on\u000a      examining and exploring theory and practice positively shapes and\u000a      influences our reach and significance. Such an approach now allows the\u000a      field to be collectively investigated outside of media effects debates\u000a      (which negates the polysemic nature apparent in film textual analysis).\u000a      This framework for understanding is supported in earlier work in the field\u000a      calling for its instigation and continuation (see Laura Kipnis (1996),\u000a      Laurence O'Toole (1999) and Brian McNair (2002), who collectively\u000a      investigate the very terms of debating the relationship between history,\u000a      technology, sex and modern culture).\u000a    The contradictory state of sex and sexualities as both known and unknown,\u000a      has driven this research which presents original work, fostering new\u000a      critical readings, understandings and approaches that, by necessity,\u000a      returns us to the screen as a dialogic text in various contexts\u000a      (critically, theoretically and industrially).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39795","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"357994","Name":"Egypt"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research underpinning this case study has changed professional\u000a      practices in the museums sector and shaped public discourse. At its height\u000a      EPOCH involved 609 researchers and 3DCO-FORM ran over 30 deployment\u000a      experiments, combining tools to address curatorial challenges, test\u000a      technologies and integration, raise awareness and train a new generation\u000a      of heritage professionals. The former Head of the V&amp;A's Photographic\u000a      Studio confirmed that 3D-COFORM `brought the V&amp;A Photographic Studio\u000a      into a new realm of expertise' absorbing new skills and creating `a whole\u000a      new form of imaging media'. (5.8) In Egypt, the National Centre for\u000a      Digitisation and the Egyptian Museum are collaborating to implement tools\u000a      and techniques that build on the 3D-COFORM project for the museum\u000a      conservation laboratory' and The Royal Belgian Museum of Art and History\u000a      has said `the 3D-Coform project was the first to adapt an integral\u000a      approach' (5.9). The research has had a `cutting-edge' impact on the\u000a      creation of collaborative international cross- organizational networks and\u000a      had a `joined-up' effect on cultural institutions (5.8).\u000a    Specific tools developed under EPOCH and\/or 3D-COFORM such as, for\u000a      example, the KU- Leuven Minidome now are in regular use. The Minidome\u000a      employs 198 lights and 1 camera to produce 3D relief-models of physical\u000a      artefacts. It is now in daily use in `the capture of digital simulations\u000a      of inscriptions on Near-Eastern clay tablets (5.9). Additionally, the\u000a      Minidome integrates with MeshLab which is an advanced 3D mesh processing\u000a      open-source software system developed and maintained by 3D-COFORM partner\u000a      CNR-ISTI. Downloads of MeshLab have increased sevenfold as a result of the\u000a      redesign originated by 3D-COFORM to over 250,000 per annum and viewers for\u000a      iPad, iPhone and Android are all being released in 2012-13.\u000a    3D-COFORM partner ICS-FORTH has provided the secretariat for development\u000a      of ISO standard 21127:2006 CIDOC-CRM, which is a reference ontology for\u000a      the interchange of cultural heritage information. 3D-COFORM's description\u000a      of provenance-related entities contributed to this activity by drawing\u000a      together the workflow from initial data capture to the communication of\u000a      results. The take-up of 3D-COFORM's metadata handling system is being\u000a      integrated within infrastructure projects, such as repositories, with\u000a      direct bearing on professional practice and standards.\u000a    The former Technical and Operations Director of Europeana (formerly the\u000a      European Digital Library) confirmed that 3D-COFORM was `instrumental' in\u000a      bringing the new content category of 3D models to Europeana being `one of\u000a      the first data suppliers to use the new...Data Model, and working through\u000a      the intricacies of 3D metadata [which] helped shape both the model and the\u000a      workflows around it' (5.10) In testing the workflow 3D-COFORM became the\u000a      first data provider to upload ~50 virtual objects to Europeana.\u000a    A recent exhibition of the 3D-COFORM research, Reshaping History,\u000a      made it possible for ICT and Cultural Heritage professionals and members\u000a      of the public to share, experience and explore stereoscopic digital\u000a      reconstructions of cultural objects and heritage sites (5.6). Opening in\u000a      Brighton (2012) the research has since travelled to Prato and to the\u000a      Naples National Archaeological Museum with requests for it to be exhibited\u000a      in Cairo, Berlin, London, Paris, Rio and Sao Paulo. In addition to a\u000a      footfall of &gt;10,000 exhibition visitors the research also has\u000a      stimulated public discourse through the press and media. This has included\u000a      a Euronews documentary broadcast in 121 countries to 193 million homes and\u000a      a BBC Radio 4, Today Programme, interview broadcasts to circa 4\u000a      million listeners. Other coverage includes: BBC South East News; ITV\u000a      Meridien News; Discovery Channel Canada; Italian regional TV channels; Al\u000a      Jazeera; The Telegraph; The Daily Mail; The Times\u000a      and La Stampa.\u000a    EPOCH has established new connected communities of practice and developed\u000a      a significant and sustainable legacy including a network of ten centres of\u000a      expertise (5.5). For example, the Norwich Forum Trust has cited its\u000a      `profound effect' in leveraging &#163;2.5m of capital investment, funding for\u000a      new projects and creating new forms of employment in the field of cultural\u000a      heritage (5.7). Professional advice and guidance from EPOCH's Stockholm\u000a      centre led directly to the formation of Digital Intangible Heritage Asia\u000a      (DIHA), a new research and development cluster at NTU, Singapore.\u000a      3D-COFORM has subsequently furthered this legacy establishing a Virtual\u000a      Competence Centre for 3D (Company No. 07912842) that will provide\u000a      independent advice on 3D-technologies to cultural institutions in the next\u000a      period. Current collaborations with cultural organisations provide further\u000a      evidence of impact. During this period Brighton joined University College\u000a      London and Oxford University winning an EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training\u000a      in Arts, Heritage and Archaeology, with Brighton leading the Digital\u000a      strand. Over 45 partners, including V&amp;A, British Museum, Tate, British\u000a      Library, BBC, English Heritage, Natural History Museum and Historic Royal\u000a      Palaces will all collaborate in the approved Centre.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Through digital cultural heritage research the Brighton-led EPOCH project\u000a      changed professional practice in the museums sector and shaped public\u000a      discourse.

The underpinning research in this\u000a      study realised by establishing EPOCH, the European Network of Excellence\u000a      in Open Cultural Heritage, (EU FP6 2004-08) a pan-European\u000a      interdisciplinary research community. It produced an agenda for research\u000a      that brought together intelligent ICT systems to develop a `workflow'\u000a      model through which to explore how their integration could be utilised for\u000a      technical and scientific analysis, conservation, preservation,\u000a      interpretation and display across the museum and heritage sectors.\u000a    Led by ARNOLD, EPOCH included a network of over 600 specialists whose\u000a      expertise spanned research, practice and policy. It addressed key research\u000a      questions at the intersection of ICT and cultural heritage, socio-economic\u000a      impact evaluation and the development of planning tools for sustainable\u000a      enterprises [reference 3.1]. In the summative paper ARNOLD reframed the\u000a      conventional model of knowledge transfer to one of co-creation and\u000a      knowledge exchange within the theoretical framework of `Pasteur's\u000a      Quadrant' [3.2]. This paper recognised that bringing together these fields\u000a      generated new methods and models: 1) in computer science exploring\u000a      knowledge representation, capture, manipulation and the use of 3D digital\u000a      objects; 2) in professional practice; and 3) in digitally-transformed\u000a      cultural heritage applications. EPOCH created a trust network of centres\u000a      of expertise sharing integrated multi-disciplinary working methods and a\u000a      common vocabulary (source 5.5); an agenda for future research [3.1] and\u000a      tools for planning and socio-economic impact evaluation [3.6]. These tools\u000a      were identified in the EU's final review as making `ground-breaking\u000a      progress in developing innovative methods and theory in the economics of\u000a      cultural heritage'.\u000a    EPOCH demonstrated the value of developing interlinked and re-useable\u000a      digital assets supported in multiple contexts by the parallel development\u000a      of interoperable digital tools. It devised an integrated workflow that\u000a      extended from documentation and investigation of cultural heritage data\u000a      through to scholarly communication, and the shaping of innovative,\u000a      real-time experiences, engagement of new audiences with cultural heritage\u000a      and creating added-value and new enterprise opportunities [3.3]. It made\u000a      the case for investment in systematic data collection through envisaging\u000a      contexts in which data could be reused.\u000a    After EPOCH, ARNOLD led 3D-COFORM (EU FP7) a large scale integrating\u000a      research project with 19 partners to advance the `workflow' from tangible\u000a      cultural heritage in its many and diverse contexts, through to the\u000a      development of tools and expertise for 3D collection formation, and a\u000a      distributed repository for 3D digital assets and their metadata.\u000a    The core aim of 3D-COFORM was to make 3D documentation a practical and\u000a      sustainable proposition for Cultural Heritage institutions and accommodate\u000a      mass 3D-acquisition by cultural heritage organisations [3.6]. Central to\u000a      3D-COFORM was the creation of a distributed 3D repository designed to\u000a      manage the digital provenance of artefacts, ensure long-term data\u000a      preservation and maintain its referential integrity. The repository\u000a      underpinned the EPOCH `workflow' model and held the results from ~20\u000a      tools, predominantly, developed as a result of 3D-COFORM research. These\u000a      3D-capture and associated processing tools included: laser and\u000a      structured-light scanners; photogrammetry systems; annotation; fragment\u000a      reassembly, and; modelling based on shape grammars. A viewer-browser, user\u000a      interface was developed to support conventional searches, augmented by\u000a      material and novel shape-based searching capabilities. Brighton developed\u000a      the graphic system integrating assets from the range of tools.\u000a    The 3D-COFORM exhibition [3.4] was curated to show each stage of the\u000a      integrated workflow with examples of cultural heritage research questions\u000a      illustrated with iconic heritage content. It was designed to inspire and\u000a      communicate to heritage and ICT professionals and to the public, the\u000a      value, potential and necessity of 3D computing within cultural heritage.\u000a    Key researchers:\u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          David Arnold:\u000a          Dean (Faculty of MIS) (Sept 2002&#8211;Dec 2009), Director\u000a            of Research Initiatives\/Dean of the Brighton Doctoral College (Jan\u000a            2010&#8211;to date).\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Andrew Grantham:\u000a          Research Fellow (Dec 1998&#8211;July 2006), Senior Research Fellow (Aug\u000a            2006-Aug 2011), Senior Lecturer (Sept 2011&#8211;to date).\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          James McLoughlin:\u000a          Senior Lecturer (Jan 1988&#8211;Nov 2003), Principal Lecturer (Dec\u000a            2003&#8211;to date).\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Despina Kanellou:\u000a          Research Fellow (Mar 2000&#8211;to date).\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Karina Rodriguez-Echavarria:\u000a          Research Fellow (Aug 2004&#8211;Oct 2009), Lecturer (Nov\u000a            2009&#8211;to date).\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Jaime Kaminski:\u000a          Research Officer (Dec 2004&#8211;July 2006), Research Fellow (Aug\u000a            2006&#8211;Oct 2009), Lecturer (Nov 2009&#8211;to date).\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Roger Evans:\u000a          Senior Research Fellow (Dec 1993&#8211;Sept 1994), Principal Research\u000a            Fellow (Dec 1994&#8211;July 1997), Reader (Aug 1997&#8211;to date).\u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40374","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"3202326","Name":"Croatia"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    During 2002-05 Knight conducted two AHRC funded research projects\u000d      examining the historical practices of several artists', women's and\u000d      independent moving image distributors &#8212; London Filmmakers' Co-op, London\u000d      Video Access, The Other Cinema, Lux, Film &amp; Video Umbrella, Circles,\u000d      Cinema of Women, and Cinenova &#8212; and their funders &#8212; primarily the Arts\u000d      Council, British Film Institute, and Film London. The research involved\u000d      extensive archive research via the records of these organisations, and\u000d      this paved the way for the Film &amp; Video Distribution Database (FVDD)\u000d      project. Developing the FVDD required seeking permission from the\u000d      organisations studied (or their successors) &#8212; as the rights holders of the\u000d      material &#8212; to publish a selection of their documentation online. All the\u000d      current rights holders saw the wider public awareness raising value in\u000d      making the documents publicly accessible and signed permissions contracts\u000d      for their online publication (obtained July 2006-October 2011).\u000d    Developing an online database raised questions\/challenges that are faced\u000d      by all online moving image collections and related e-resources, especially\u000d      with regard to their long-term sustainability. To address this issue,\u000d      Knight set up the AHRC funded Future Histories of the Moving Image\u000d      Research Network which brought together participants from inside and\u000d      outside academia to share information and learn from each others'\u000d      practices. The network ran a workshop to enable online resource managers\u000d      to acquire skills that would help them maintain and develop the use of\u000d      their e-resources without having to depend on the availability of funding.\u000d      Entitled `Doing It Outside', the workshop was held in October 2008 and\u000d      non-academic attendees included representatives from Picture This\u000d      (Bristol), FACT (Liverpool), and Bang! Short Film Festival (Nottingham).\u000d      These attendees reported that the workshop had been an energizing and\u000d      valuable experience in terms of thinking about how to develop their online\u000d      resources (Source 1).\u000d    Some of the distributors studied had not seen it as a priority to\u000d      preserve their own histories, and the FVDD has provided a way of\u000d      documenting their historical role in promoting British\u000d      artists'\/independent moving image work. In June 2013 Cinenova linked to\u000d      the FVDD from its website to enable users to `find out more about the\u000d      history of women's film and video distribution' (Source 2) and one of its\u000d      management committee members became an FVDD volunteer helping compile and\u000d      upload new content (Source 3). Artist websites have also started linking\u000d      to it (Source 4). FVDD webstats show that since January 2013 the number of\u000d      unique visitors to the database have been steadily increasing from just\u000d      under 200 to well over 300 per month. Most of the visitors are from the\u000d      UK, but also come from Italy, Germany, Poland, Canada, Australia, France,\u000d      India, Croatia, Netherlands, Sweden, China and Russia.\u000d    Knight's research into women's film and video distribution impacted on\u000d      the programming of the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London. In\u000d      February 2012, the ICA held a series of events focusing on the work of\u000d      filmmaker Lis Rhodes, a founding member of the women's distributor\u000d      Circles. The curator was referred to Knight's research which `spurted a\u000d      lot of ideas of how the program could be developed' (Source 5). Knight was\u000d      invited to participate in a public panel discussion about the history of\u000d      women's moving image distribution and provided access to documents from\u000d      Circles. Extracts from those documents were read out at the beginning of\u000d      the panel discussion to provide a historical context. The curator used the\u000d      title of a co-authored article Knight had published (at http:\/\/alt-fv-distribution.net\/papers.html#articles)\u000d      to name the ICA event `A Fragile Existence &#8212; A History of Women's Film and\u000d      Video Distribution' (Source 6). The event sold out (100-120 seats) and the\u000d      curator reported receiving a lot of positive verbal feedback.\u000d    The role of distributors tends to be invisible and hence little\u000d      understood. Lux, the UK's largest distributor of artists' moving image,\u000d      has used Knight's research to help raise awareness among their client base\u000d      about the promotional activities required to build audiences for artists'\u000d      moving image work and encourage artists to contribute to those activities.\u000d      Firstly, Knight was invited to participate in a public panel discussion,\u000d      held at Lux and entitled `Professional Practice: Distribution Seminar'\u000d      (June 2012), addressing issues of distribution for an audience of\u000d      practising moving image artists (Source 7). The organiser wanted to use\u000d      Knight's research to highlight to contemporary practitioners the\u000d      importance of understanding how moving image work gets seen and\u000d      demonstrate parallels between historical and contemporary practices. One\u000d      attendee emailed the organiser after the event, saying: `I wanted to let\u000d      you know how useful the session was on distribution ... I found the\u000d      openness, and the quality of information on offer really valuable. Having\u000d      attended many different events at various organisations in the past, I\u000d      have found the advice LUX has to offer to be highly supportive and\u000d      relevant' (Source 8). Secondly, Knight and curators\/writers Dan Kidner and\u000d      Elinor Cleghorn were also invited to contribute postings to the Lux Blog\u000d      about the FVDD database and the histories it makes available (July 2013)\u000d      (Source 9).\u000d    Finally, Knight's research has been used to inform teaching and learning\u000d      at other institutions. University of the Arts London (UAL), for instance,\u000d      run an MRes Art: Moving Image course in conjunction with Lux and uses both\u000d      the Reaching Audiences book and the FVDD on the course. The course\u000d      leader invited Knight to talk her students in June 2013 about doing\u000d      archive research and the uses\/limitation of digital resources in the study\u000d      of moving image, based on the experience of her own research projects\u000d      (Source 10). Students from UAL also became FVDD volunteers compiling and\u000d      uploading new content to the database (June 2013). The FVDD was used on a\u000d      Film History course at New York University in a session considering how\u000d      digitisation might affect how we see or `do' history (May 2012). Feedback\u000d      from the students noted the value of how the FVDD enabled access to PDFs\u000d      of the actual documents rather than having them only cited as evidence in\u000d      a secondary historical analysis, while also prompting discussion about the\u000d      selective nature of digital resources.\u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    (a) preserving and presenting cultural heritage;\u000d    (b) helping a central London arts centre programme a public panel\u000d      discussion on women's film and video distribution in the UK;\u000d    (c) helping an artists' moving image distributor\/agency to raise\u000d      awareness and understanding among practising artists and a wider public of\u000d      their role in delivering non-mainstream work to audiences;\u000d    (d) contributing to arts organisations' ability to exploit their\u000d      digital\/online resources;\u000d    (e) informing teaching and learning at other HEIs.\u000d    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Sunderland (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Sunderland","PeerGroup":"E","Region":"North East","UKPRN":10007159}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d    \u000a1.

Julia\u000d      Knight was the lead researcher on all aspects of the research (Reader from\u000d      2005-11, Professor 2011-date).\u000d    The primary research material had already been located and scanned during\u000d      2003-05 while Knight was at University of Bedfordshire. The material\u000d      included correspondence, funding applications, minutes of management\u000d      committee meetings, promotional material, distribution activity reports,\u000d      screening programmes, exhibition initiatives, policy documents, hirer\u000d      feedback forms, consultancies, business plans, newsletters, funding\u000d      assessment reports etc. Analysis of this material was undertaken in\u000d      conjunction with developing the Film &amp; Video Distribution Database\u000d      (FVDD) during 2005-10 after Knight commenced working at Sunderland.\u000d      Exploration of how best to ensure the sustainability of the FVDD and\u000d      similar moving-image related online resources took place via the AHRC\u000d      funded Future Histories of the Moving Image research network during\u000d      2007-09.\u000d    The research produced a book, several journal articles and book chapters,\u000d      an online database (FVDD), an information website (http:\/\/alt-fv-distribution.net)\u000d      and over 20 conference papers.\u000d    The key research insights\/findings underpinning the impact are:\u000d    \u000d      The role moving image distributors play is far more complex than just\u000d        physically delivering work to a screening venue (a popular\u000d        misconception), requiring ongoing engagement in promotional activity and\u000d        the development of strong links with exhibition outlets.\u000d      A range of factors impact on what work gets taken into distribution,\u000d        seen by audiences and hence the scope of moving image culture; and\u000d        non-mainstream distributors are crucial to ensuring a more diverse\u000d        moving image culture.\u000d      The challenges faced by small non-mainstream distributors &#8212; such as\u000d        smaller audiences, the need for extensive promotional activity,\u000d        under-resourcing, changing markets and keeping apace with new media\u000d        technologies &#8212; mean they can lack commercial viability.\u000d      Their existence is therefore often dependent on a combination of grant\u000d        aid and low-cost or volunteer labour, making them very fragile\u000d        organisations; the dependence on grant aid also tends to play a key role\u000d        in determining the nature and scope of the distributors' activities.\u000d      While the advent of digital distribution has to a certain extent made\u000d        it easier, quicker and cheaper to make moving image work\/resources\u000d        available, issues of selection are still key and extensive promotional\u000d        activity is still required to build audiences\/users.\u000d    \u000d    When the research was undertaken, the role of distribution in moving\u000d      image culture was critically neglected. In Film Studies, research had\u000d      concentrated on analysis of film texts (together with conditions\/modes of\u000d      production) and spectatorship (together with sites of\u000d      exhibition\/consumption), while distribution remained the invisible link\u000d      between the two. Hence this research represents a significant contribution\u000d      to developing awareness and understanding of the factors that shape film\u000d      culture. Furthermore, some of the distributors studied no longer exist, so\u000d      the research also played a key role in documenting the histories of those\u000d      organisations before their contribution to UK moving image culture is\u000d      forgotten or lost.\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40377","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    In 2008, the UK's Labour Government proposed a set of provisions to\u000d      criminalise possession of `extreme pornography' and launched a\u000d      consultation process to which Smith made a submission supported by more\u000d      than fifty academics from within Film, Media, Cultural Studies and\u000d      Sociology, leading to a request for a meeting from Baroness Miller (LibDem\u000d      Member of the House of Lords) to advise her on the rigour of the\u000d      Government's research base and about research findings offering a more\u000d      complex and complete view for her interventions in session [Source 1].\u000d      Although the legislation became law in 2009, advice to Baroness Miller\u000d      contributed to the tabling of amendments to the final drafting of the\u000d      legislation [Source 2]. Smith also advised anti-censorship groups\u000d      'Feminists Against Censorship' and 'Backlash' in their representations to\u000d      members of both Houses of Parliament and opposition to the proposed\u000d      legislation, leading to her nomination as Campaigner of the Year by the\u000d      disability advocacy group 'Outsiders'. She was also invited to contribute\u000d      to public debate via the Guardian's Comment is Free (this piece\u000d      sparked 149 `below the line' comments [Source 3] and discussion in the\u000d      wider blogosphere).\u000d    Subsequently, Smith was invited to speak on related issues at the UN's\u000d      Internet Governance Forum and to review research carried out by the\u000d      international EROTICS project undertaken by Association for Progressive\u000d      Communications. The succeeding Coalition Government's proposals to\u000d      regulate access to internet pornography through `opt-in' measures led to\u000d      invitations to speak at Internet Service Providers Association's public\u000d      meeting with MPs at Westminster and to debate young people and pornography\u000d      at the Westminster Media Forum. While described as `an important voice in\u000d      these debates' by lead MP Claire Perry, policy makers have declined to\u000d      take up Smith's proposition that further research is needed before any\u000d      legislative actions are taken and are pushing ahead with their plans in\u000d      the interests of `protecting children'; her commentary has, however, been\u000d      sought by numerous public outlets such as The Guardian, The\u000d        Times, Times Higher Education, The Conversation,\u000d      BBC's Newsnight, Woman's Hour and numerous local (national and\u000d      international) radio talk shows.

As part of the activities of the AHRC\u000d      funded Onscenity Network, Smith co-organised thirteen events\u000d      including Sex, Health and Media for practitioners, at Friends\u000d      House, London which was attended by 87 sexual health educators,\u000d      practitioners and academics.\u000d    As a result of this growing public profile Smith was asked to act as\u000d      expert witness in a case brought under the terms of Section 63 of the\u000d      Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2009, employing the methods and\u000d      approaches developed in her research in a report for the Defence which led\u000d      to the dropping of all charges in R v Holland (2010). The following year\u000d      Smith gave evidence in court in R v Webster 2011 on similar charges and in\u000d      R v Peacock (2012) under the Obscene Publications Act 1959 and also in R v\u000d      Walsh (2012). As expert witness Smith advised the Defence on their\u000d      strategy and gave testimony to the Court [Sources 4 and 5]. In each of\u000d      these trials she presented testimony exploring the textual formations and\u000d      histories of specific pornographic genres and their production, as well as\u000d      investigations into audience interests in sexually explicit media and\u000d      particular sexual practices such as BDSM (Bondage, Domination, Submission,\u000d      Masochism).

Beyond the\u000d      particular and significant impact on the individual defendants in each of\u000d      these cases (they were all acquitted), Smith's expert witness report for\u000d      Webster has been used in Career and Professional Development training for\u000d      solicitors and barristers at the Inns of Court. The various trials were\u000d      widely reported in the national press [Sources 7, 8 and 9] and across\u000d      social media &#8212; the Peacock and Walsh cases are also important as having\u000d      been the first prosecutions to be live-tweeted from Court\u000d      (#ObscenityTrial; #PornTrial) - as a result, Smith's evidence was carried\u000d      into wider and more public spaces beyond Judge and Jury [Source 5].

Pornography is the object of continuing concern;\u000d      intensely polarized debates tend to solidify around pornography's right to\u000d      exist or its moral and social consequences. With the rise of the Internet\u000d      and increasingly easier access to pornographic representations,\u000d      governments have been keen to enact legislation to minimise the impacts of\u000d      pornography. Unfortunately proponents of legislation too often call upon\u000d      research traditions fraught with problems, gaps and weaknesses. Working\u000d      within media and cultural studies traditions, Smith's research has focused\u000d      on the cultural and social theorisations of sexuality and its\u000d      representational forms, especially pornographic film, images and texts,\u000d      and also on the construction of new theories to explain practices,\u000d      pleasures and policy. She has sought to expand the approaches and\u000d      methodologies for the examination of pornography and has played a\u000d      significant role in developing its study. Much research into pornography\u000d      attempts to homogenise the vast array of materials which fall under that\u000d      generic term, however there are many varieties of porn - distinguished by\u000d      1) production: who produces it (large or small companies; corporate or\u000d      independent; professional or amateur; male or female;\u000d      gay\/straight\/queer\/trans etc.); how it is produced (scripted or\u000d      unscripted; videoed or filmed; text or image; professional or amateur;\u000d      paid or not paid etc.); 2) textualities (written or filmed; glossy or\u000d      authentic; mainstream or alt; full-length movie or scenes etc.) 3) address\u000d      (political; educational; for men; for women; for a sexual subculture;\u000d      humorous; satirical; historical; informational etc.); 4) consumption: who\u000d      views it (men or women; couples; gay\/straight\/queer\/trans\/alt etc.) and\u000d      how they access it (paid for, free or `gifted'; individually or with a\u000d      partner; for fun, for education, for community, for ideas, for\u000d      confirmation of `normality' etc.). Alongside these sit various other\u000d      categorisations - by sexual acts, named stars, directors, production\u000d      houses etc.\u000d    Smith's research (focused on texts, production and audiences) has\u000d      established that these divisions are not just semantics or playing with\u000d      the idea of variety in pornography: they are the means by which people\u000d      make their choices about what they will view and how. Although our general\u000d      view of pornography is that it is not a requirement for a `healthy' sex\u000d      life but an `entertainment' which should only, at best, be tolerated, this\u000d      is to refuse the idea that pornography has any special or important place\u000d      in the lives of those individuals who choose to view it. The research\u000d      underpinning the impact described here has explored several aspects of\u000d      understanding pornographic representations situated in a number of\u000d      research projects, including the first ever large scale study into the\u000d      meanings and significances of pornography for its audiences. Smith's\u000d      published works have developed new approaches to the study of pornographic\u000d      media, moving away from the questions about whether pornography should\u000d      exist and its putative effects on individuals and society; to examine the\u000d      ways in which pornography is not a singular genre but a range of\u000d      practices, styles and languages for speaking about sex across a variety of\u000d      media platforms. She has investigated a range of pornographic productions\u000d      and developed approaches to assessing and understanding pornography as\u000d      more than just obscene texts.\u000d    This work has had considerable purchase beyond the academy - key evidence\u000d      of impact includes being called as Expert Witness in Crown Court cases; a\u000d      number of open-access public engagement events; dialogue with members of\u000d      the Houses of Parliament and professional organisations; media engagement\u000d      and the establishment of a new international journal Porn Studies\u000d      with publisher Routledge.\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40560","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2328926","Name":"Nigeria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    As many as 200,000 people living in Britain may have fallen victim to\u000d\u000a      online romance scams &#8212; mass market fraud where criminals set up fake\u000d\u000a      identities using stolen photographs (often of models or army officers) &#8212;\u000d\u000a      and pretend to become romantically involved with their victim.

Many scam victims have been persuaded to part with large sums\u000d\u000a      before their suspicions are aroused.\u000d\u000a    Law enforcement agencies believe that this type of crime often goes\u000d\u000a      unreported; usually because victims feel embarrassed at being duped and\u000d\u000a      sometimes because victims still hope the relationship might turn out to be\u000d\u000a      genuine.\u000d\u000a    According to SOCA's [text removed for publication] Senior Manager for\u000d\u000a      Fraud Prevention, some victims \"have lost nearly every penny they had,\u000d\u000a      been robbed of their self-respect, and in some cases, committed suicide\u000d\u000a      after being exploited, relentlessly, by these criminals''.\u000d\u000a    University of Leicester research has played a key role in work in\u000d\u000a      identifying the scale of this problem and developing effective strategies\u000d\u000a      for supporting victims and preventing the crime.\u000d\u000a    Training\u000d\u000a    Training packages for the police (2011-2012): Findings from the\u000d\u000a      University's research were incorporated into police training packages\u000d\u000a      designed to improve `public protection' in areas such as Child Abuse,\u000d\u000a      Trafficking, Stalking and Fraud. First responders, CID and Fraud Academy\u000d\u000a      officers were also issued with guidelines &#8212; tested in a UK court case &#8212; on\u000d\u000a      how to treat victims of this particular crime.\u000d\u000a    London City Police National Fraud Course (2012 &#8212; ongoing): This\u000d\u000a      three-week intensive course trains groups of 30-50 police in how to deal\u000d\u000a      with fraud. In 2012 and 2013 Whitty presented her research in two training\u000d\u000a      sessions and provided suggestions on how police might better deal with\u000d\u000a      victims of online romance scams (e.g. by considering transference effect,\u000d\u000a      psychological impact and re-victimisation).\u000d\u000a    Co-operation with law enforcement bodies\u000d\u000a    Metropolitan Police Operation Podium (2012-2013): A criminal residing in\u000d\u000a      the UK was brought to trial and eventually pleaded guilty to conspiracy to\u000d\u000a      commit fraud by misrepresentation. Some 62 victims were identified\u000d\u000a      (including 18 women willing to assist police with prosecution), from\u000d\u000a      America, Canada and Trinidad and Tobago.\u000d\u000a    Using her project's findings, Whitty advised the Metropolitan Police on\u000d\u000a      how best to debrief the victims and gave on-going support for an\u000d\u000a      international prosecution. Victims were frequently in denial initially and\u000d\u000a      needed encouragement to accept that the relationship had been fraudulent,\u000d\u000a      as well as the support which their families could not always give.\u000d\u000a    Whitty advised on support agencies in the victims' countries, and alerted\u000d\u000a      police to the `transference effect'; an effect where a female victim\u000d\u000a      transfers the romantic feelings she had for the criminal on to the male\u000d\u000a      officer dealing with her case. In the light of Whitty's advice (and the\u000d\u000a      fact that transference among three victims had been going unrecognised by\u000d\u000a      police), a female family liaison officer was deployed to deal with these\u000d\u000a      victims. The judge's sentencing decision was informed by Whitty's report.\u000d\u000a    Ghana prosecution by the Serious Organised Crime Agency\u000d\u000a        (2011-ongoing): Whitty collaborated with SOCA in preparing victims\u000d\u000a      appearing in a dating scam court case in Ghana. The prosecution team draw\u000d\u000a      on the research's findings to refute defence arguments that the victims\u000d\u000a      were `mentally unstable' and therefore to blame.\u000d\u000a    Establishment of the Economic Crime Unit (for new National Crime\u000d\u000a        Agency) (2012): Whitty and three other UK academics provided\u000d\u000a      suggestions based on the research on appropriate priorities for the new\u000d\u000a      Economic Crime Unit established in 2013. Whitty suggested that the Unit\u000d\u000a      should investigate re-victimisation and the phenomenon of victims turning\u000d\u000a      to crime to recoup their losses.\u000d\u000a    International Mass Marketing Fraud Working Group (2011-ongoing):\u000d\u000a      This group consists of representatives of law enforcement agencies\u000d\u000a      worldwide (e.g., Serious Organised Crime Agency, FBI, Federal Trade\u000d\u000a      Authority, Secret Service, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Netherlands\u000d\u000a      Police, the Queensland Police, Ghanaian police and Nigerian Police). Its\u000d\u000a      members exchange information on mass marketing fraud and on strategies to\u000d\u000a      prevent it. Whitty is the only academic representative and has presented\u000d\u000a      her work to the group on several occasions. Her input has helped to\u000d\u000a      develop strategies on how to prevent online romance scams and support its\u000d\u000a      victims (for example, advising on the stages involved, prevention\u000d\u000a      messages, which victims need to be considered as vulnerable and on what\u000d\u000a      type of support victims need).\u000d\u000a    Victim Support\u000d\u000a    Breaking news to victims and providing support: SOCA and Devon and Cornwall\u000d\u000a    police (2012-2013): Research revealed that those individuals who have been\u000d\u000a    scammed often become repeat victims and lack the social support typically\u000d\u000a    available to victims of other crimes. SOCA initiated a trial to determine\u000d\u000a    the best way to break the news to potential victims and support those who\u000d\u000a    had fallen prey to the crime, once they had accepted they were victims. With\u000d\u000a    Whitty's help SOCA sent letters to 50 victims in one geographical area in\u000d\u000a    the hope of preventing them from sending money to the scammers. All victims\u000d\u000a    were encouraged to attend a meeting with SOCA, the police, Victim Support\u000d\u000a    and Whitty. The five who attended, along with close friends and carers, were\u000d\u000a    informed about the scam. A peer support group was formed and all but one of\u000d\u000a    the victims who attended the event continued sending money.\u000d\u000a    Raising public awareness and understanding\u000d\u000a    Whitty and [text removed for publication] have made several appearances\u000d\u000a      on radio and TV including BBC Breakfast, Today, The One Show and You've\u000d\u000a      Been Scammed). At one point, the findings made third spot on the BBC News\u000d\u000a      website and, surveys carried out by Whitty before and after the media\u000d\u000a      coverage, revealed that public awareness had significantly increased (48%\u000d\u000a      to 52% via television; 11%-15% via radio).

Professor T. Buchanan\u000d\u000a      (University of Westminster) was the co-investigator.\u000d\u000a    The first project included both quantitative and qualitative studies,\u000d\u000a      involving the surveying and interviewing of victims and conducting an\u000d\u000a      analysis of their online accounts. The principal findings and outcomes\u000d\u000a      were:\u000d\u000a    a. The development of a model used to explain the stages and persuasive\u000d\u000a      techniques employed by criminals, which has important implications for\u000d\u000a      prevention of this crime (1);\u000d\u000a    b. The type of profile criminals created in order to attract victims had\u000d\u000a      important implications for prevention of this crime (1,2);\u000d\u000a    c. The strong attachment to the criminal formed by the victim made the\u000d\u000a      scam difficult to break and often led to re-victimisation (2, 6);\u000d\u000a    d. The psychological impact on both financial and non-financial victims\u000d\u000a      (e.g., suicidal feelings, post-traumatic stress) was considerable, due to\u000d\u000a      their attachment to the fake persona and the loss of money. This had\u000d\u000a      important implications for the treatment of victims and sentencing of\u000d\u000a      criminals (3,6);\u000d\u000a    e. Some victims suffered sexual abuse, sometimes accompanied by\u000d\u000a      blackmail, which had important implications for the treatment of victims\u000d\u000a      (4,6);\u000d\u000a    f. Support for victims from family, friends and law enforcement officers\u000d\u000a      was often lacking, the blame attached to the victim being a contributory\u000d\u000a      factor (4);\u000d\u000a    g. Victims were inclined to transfer their affections from the criminal\u000d\u000a      to law enforcement officers with important implications for police\u000d\u000a      practice (3, 6);\u000d\u000a    h. Psychological variables predicted victimhood only to a limited extent\u000d\u000a      (5);\u000d\u000a    i. The previous assumptions of law enforcement about those most likely to\u000d\u000a      be targeted (older heterosexual women) were incorrect and other\u000d\u000a      demographic groups were found to be equally at risk (5, 6).\u000d\u000a    In July 2011, Professor Whitty, together with the Serious Organised Crime\u000d\u000a      Agency and Professor Buchanan ran a survey with YouGov (funded by the\u000d\u000a      University) to determine the national prevalence rates and public\u000d\u000a      awareness of the scam (3). This revealed that the prevalence rate was\u000d\u000a      approximately 230,000 in Great Britain, which was much higher than\u000d\u000a      originally thought. Action Fraud &#8212; the UK's national fraud and internet\u000d\u000a      crime reporting centre &#8212; had estimated 900 victims.

With that, the interculturality of these\u000a      theatre projects (performed at all levels of the production), allows for\u000a      the articulation of the mutual demonisation that generates the\u000a      imagological, ideological and geopolitical difference which exists between\u000a      Europe and the Balkans\" (`Europe on the Contemporary Macedonian Dramatic\u000a      Stage', Slavia Meridionalis, Issue no.12, 2012). The reach of Stefanovski's\u000a      work is evidenced by the number performances and publications his plays\u000a      have received. In 2008-12 full productions of The Demon of Debar Maalo\u000a      were staged in Serbia, Bulgaria and France, and in 2008-13 Stefanovski's\u000a      play Everyman was performed as staged readings in Romania and the\u000a      Czech Republic. During the same period three translations of the Demon\u000a        of Debar Maalo were published, and the script of Everyman\u000a      was published three times. Through these productions and publications Stefanovki's\u000a      practice-based research reaches audiences and communities of arts\u000a      practitioners in Europe and beyond.\u000a    The radical dynamic of Long's work, and thereby its political\u000a      potential, is described by the Royal Academician who selected two drawings\u000a      by Long for inclusion in the 2008 Royal Academy of Arts Summer\u000a      Exhibition: \". . . at the core [of Long's work] is fusion of\u000a      draughtsmanship and subversion. In an exhibition like the Royal Academy\u000a      Summer Exhibition, a bastion of British complacency, I was keen to\u000a      introduce an alternative view of what depicting an image, a human form,\u000a      can be\" (email, 16 July 2013). The reach of this work is evidenced by\u000a      audience numbers for the exhibitions in which Long's pieces have\u000a      been shown. The Royal Academy's Summer Exhibition, at which Long\u000a      exhibited in both 2008 and 2010, receives almost 200,000 visits each year\u000a      (source: Royal Academy of Arts website). In addition, Long's work\u000a      in the 2008 exhibition reached an audience beyond the gallery through\u000a      being featured in a BBC2 Culture Show special on the Summer\u000a      Exhibition (TX 12 June 2008). His practice-based research has also\u000a      achieved impact through its contribution to the enrichment of cultural\u000a      life in East Kent. In addition to exhibiting work in galleries (Sidney\u000a      Cooper Gallery, Canterbury 19-31 July 2008; Herbert Read Gallery,\u000a      Canterbury 2-14 March 2010; The Old Lookout, Broadstairs 14-19 June 2013),\u000a      Long has presented his practice-based research in drawing through\u000a      public performance as part of the Free Range series of experimental arts\u000a      events held at the Veg Box Caf&#233;, Canterbury (`The Drawing Machine: a Relay\u000a      of Joy', 14 March 2013). Described by music blogger Matthew Watkins as \"an\u000a      extraordinary event\", this piece was performed live to an audience of 40\u000a      (the maximum for this venue), while videos of the work received 247 plays\u000a      on vimeo.com by 31 July 2013.\u000a    Birtwistle's work in sound and video, which investigates the\u000a      radical potential of modernist poetics in contemporary art and\u000a      performance, creates impact through the generation of new ways of thinking\u000a      about the often-neglected role played by sound in cinema and the visual\u000a      arts. His research on radical modernist poetics and sound-image relations,\u000a      examined in his book Cinesonica (2010), has also reached audiences\u000a      for film, poetry and music in the South East region through public\u000a      performances. In 2012-13 Birtwistle curated and performed in three\u000a      public events organised as part of the Free Range Series, mentioned above.\u000a      In the first two of these (29 March 2012 and 21 March 2013), Birtwistle\u000a      worked with musicians and performers to produce live realisations of\u000a      Dadaist films and poetry, combining film projection, spoken word and\u000a      musical performance to create a form of live cinema. The third of these\u000a      events (25 April 2013) featured new video works by Birtwistle,\u000a      along with existing documentary and information films, each presented with\u000a      live musical accompaniment and spoken word performance. These events\u000a      create impact by presenting the cultural heritage of Dada cinema and the\u000a      documentary tradition in new ways, creating new forms of expression that\u000a      combine live music and spoken word with the projected image. The political\u000a      dimension of this work lies in ways in which the modernist archive has\u000a      been rearticulated by Birtwistle within a contemporary context,\u000a      reactivating the radical potential of forms of expression originally\u000a      developed in the first half of the last century. With the venue's maximum\u000a      audience capacity of 40, these live performances have reached a regional\u000a      audience of 120, and through video recordings made available online have\u000a      also gained an international audience, having received 1,422 views by 31\u000a      July 2013 from viewers in over 60 countries. As contributors to the Free\u000a      Range Series, the work of both Long and Birtwistle can be\u000a      seen to have had an impact on the cultural environment of the local area.\u000a      The series was awarded the Cultural Pioneer Award at the 2013 Canterbury\u000a      Culture Awards, the Chair of Judges commenting, \"These events are a rich\u000a      and creative mix of music, film, poetry, technology and even culinary\u000a      experimentation. They cross disciplines, blending performances to create\u000a      cultural experiences that amaze, inspire and excite\" (email 21 June 2013).\u000a    Birtwistle's practice-based work in sonic art has also reached\u000a      audiences outside the academy through performances (Camden Arts Centre,\u000a      2013), broadcasts and diffusion at festivals (Fabrica Europe 08,\u000a      Florence, 2008; Radio Papesse, Sienna, 2008; 38th\u000a      International Festival of Music and Electronic Art, Bourges, 2008;\u000a      Contemporary Museum, Baltimore, 2011). Through these broadcasts and\u000a      festivals Birtwistle participates in the international community\u000a      of sonic arts practitioners, thereby reaching audiences for his work\u000a      outside the UK.\u000a    Research produced by Stefanovski has also created impact through\u000a      the provision of expert advice to European NGOs and campaign groups\u000a      through his contribution to public discussion of arts policy in the EU. In\u000a      this way Stefanovski's research creates impact through his\u000a      membership of European cultural agencies. As an elected member of the\u000a      European Cultural Parliament (2006-present), whose purpose is to\u000a      strengthen the role of cultural and artistic ideas in the debate on the\u000a      future of Europe, Stefanovski has contributed to public discourse\u000a      and campaigning on arts policy and practice in the EU. For example, Stefanovski\u000a      participated in the 2009 session held in Gothenburg, one outcome of which\u000a      was a resolution sent to the Council of Europe, the European Parliament,\u000a      and the EU commission, in support of cultural institutions and the arts\u000a      community of Bosnia and Herzegovina. A second outcome of the same session\u000a      was a statement on unjust court proceedings against two Russian curators\u000a      facing legal action for organising the controversial 2007 Forbidden\u000a        Art exhibition in Moscow. Stefanovski has also contributed\u000a      to public discourse on arts policy in the EU through his involvement with\u000a      Culture Action Europe's We Are More campaign, which champions the\u000a      role played by culture and heritage in developing European democracy and\u000a      stresses the importance of public funding for arts and culture. Stefanovski's\u000a      My Quarrel with Kafka was commissioned to open and close the\u000a      campaign's launch event held in Brussels in October 2010, serving as a key\u000a      reference point for discussions that took place during the one-day\u000a      conference that followed.\u000a    The research produced by the Unit can thus be seen to engage with a range\u000a      of national and international beneficiaries, including theatre companies\u000a      and cultural organisations, as well as those who attend performances and\u000a      exhibitions.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The impact being described in this case study relates to the ways in\u000a      which the submitting Unit's research on the political dimensions of\u000a      creative arts practice has produced cultural benefits for arts\u000a      practitioners, audiences, and cultural organisations. Specifically, the\u000a      underpinning research has led to two main areas of impact: firstly, the\u000a      creation of new forms of artistic, social and political expression through\u000a      practice-based research in the arts, and secondly, the provision of expert\u000a      advice on cultural politics and policy to European NGOs and campaign\u000a      groups.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    Canterbury Christ Church University\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Canterbury Christ Church University","InstitutionName":"Canterbury Christ Church University","PeerGroup":"E","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10001143}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"791606","Name":"Debar"},{"GeoNamesId":"2800867","Name":"Bruxelles-Capitale"},{"GeoNamesId":"3031005","Name":"Bourges"},{"GeoNamesId":"2711537","Name":"Göteborg"},{"GeoNamesId":"524901","Name":"Moscow"},{"GeoNamesId":"3176959","Name":"Florence"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

This body of research emerges from the Unit's engagement with\u000a      theory-practice interchange in creative and media arts. This research\u000a      specialism has been supported and developed through the establishment in\u000a      2011 of theory-practice.net, a research initiative set up by the\u000a      Department of Media, Art and Design at CCCU to support collaborative\u000a      investigation of theory-practice interchange in creative media production,\u000a      and to which the three researchers featured in this case study have been\u000a      key contributors. A distinctive feature of the research produced by Stefanovski,\u000a      T. Long and Birtwistle is the shared critical concern with\u000a      the relationship between poetics, creative practice and cultural politics.\u000a      Although working in different media, each has produced research that\u000a      investigates the political potential of creative practice, paying\u000a      particular attention to the ways in which formal and stylistic techniques\u000a      might be understood, developed or re-articulated within a political\u000a      framework. Within this context two main areas of research activity have\u000a      created impact: (1) practice-based research that achieves impact through\u000a      performances, screenings, exhibitions and broadcasts; and (2) text-based\u000a      research that achieves impact through subsequent creative practice.\u000a    Stefanovski (Senior Lecturer, 2002-) has an established\u000a      international reputation as a writer for stage, TV and cinema. Since 1974\u000a      Stefanovski has been investigating issues of Balkan identity,\u000a      cultural history and politics through his creative writing. In plays such\u000a      as Everyman (2003) and The Demon of Debar Maalo (2006) Stefanovski\u000a      has examined the social and political changes Eastern Europe has undergone\u000a      since the collapse of communism, and the cultural and political\u000a      differences that distinguish Eastern and Western European experiences of\u000a      modernity. In addition to work for the theatre Stefanovski has\u000a      also published essays and articles examining the cultural politics of\u000a      identity. This latter body of work investigates the identity of small\u000a      nations and their languages, examined within both European and global\u000a      contexts, paying particular attention to cultural policy and the politics\u000a      of cultural translation (e.g. A Tale from the Wild East [2004], Chinese\u000a        Whispers [2010], A Quarrel with Kafka [published in Kavga\u000a        so Kafka i drugi esei, Skopje. Tabernakul, 2010]).\u000a    Birtwistle (Senior Lecturer, 1997-2002; Principal Lecturer\u000a      2002-2013; Reader 2013-) has been researching film sound, artists' film\u000a      and video, and sound art since 1999. At the core of Birtwistle's\u000a      interdisciplinary research is a concern with the political dynamics of\u000a      sound in both sonic and audiovisual forms of art. His theoretical work in\u000a      this area examines the ways in which radical poetics of sound, and\u000a      sound-image relations, have been theorised and understood -particularly in\u000a      relation to modernist traditions of art practice. In addition to published\u000a      outputs Birtwistle has developed this area of research through\u000a      creative practice in sound art and video, resulting in performances at\u000a      festivals, live events, film screenings, exhibitions and radio broadcasts.\u000a      This body of work draws directly on the creative resources of the art\u000a      historical archive examined in Birtwistle's theoretical research,\u000a      often rearticulating and redeploying elements of the modernist tradition\u000a      in ways that seek to investigate or reanimate their political potential.\u000a    T. Long (Senior Lecturer, 2003-) has undertaken practice-based\u000a      research that explores the relationship between art theory and creative\u000a      practice through the production of artworks in mixed-media installation,\u000a      sculpture and drawing. The political dimension of his research lies\u000a      specifically in its investigation of Antonin Artaud's notion of the subjectile,\u000a      and how this concept radically challenges and destabilises dominant\u000a      notions of identity. Long's artworks draw on the concept of the subjectile\u000a      to interrogate the ways in which subject and object operate together in\u000a      art, undermining the distinction commonly drawn between the two, and thus\u000a      challenging the spectator's understanding of subjectivity.

The programme ran from 2007-10, with Silverman as\u000a      consultant\/mentor. Silverman's contribution was acknowledged in media\u000a      coverage of the trial (e.g. report on the BBC World website on August 12,\u000a      2010 &#8212; www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-10930834?print=true).\u000a    The research in Sierra Leone and Liberia led to seminars in both\u000a      countries in 2012 and 2013, attended by leading representatives of civil\u000a      society. Arising from the Monrovia (Liberia) event in April 2012 a virtual\u000a      policy forum was established &#8212; uk.groups.yahoo.com\/group\/medialegitimacy\/-offering\u000a      a space for the sharing of ideas\/research\/ initiatives on fostering\u000a      democratic legitimacy in a post-conflict setting. The event in Freetown\u000a      (Sierra Leone) in March 2013 was attended by the Chair of the\u000a      Anti-Corruption Commission, as well as by the President of the Sierra\u000a      Leone Association of Journalists. A 63-page report of the proceedings &#8212; \"The Impact of the Special Court Trials on the People of Sierra Leone and\u000a      Liberia\" &#8212; was published and circulated widely in political, NGO and\u000a      academic circles in Sierra Leone.\u000a    The research in Sierra Leone and Liberia and the subsequent fostering of\u000a      institutional relationships has led to an initiative &#8212; CIMARC Scholars &#8212; in which early career academics from Anglophone West Africa, with an\u000a      interest in media, human rights and governance, will spend short periods\u000a      at UoB participating in the academic life of the university, thus\u000a      fulfilling a primary goal of the British Academy's Africa Partnership\u000a        Programme.\u000a    Prof. Gaber's professional and academic reputation has been the\u000a      foundation for election training programmes and reporting projects in\u000a      Tunisia, Uganda, Nigeria, Tanzania, Malawi and Burkina Faso. The Ugandan\u000a      project &#8212; the Ugandan Radio Network (URN) &#8212; is, at the time of\u000a      writing still ongoing. It initially entailed training 202 correspondents\u000a      in election reporting techniques, the production of radio packages,\u000a      (including simple editing) and how to transmit these packages to a central\u000a      newsroom in Kampala, where the reports were then distributed to FM radio\u000a      stations throughout Uganda. In a country, still in post-conflict recovery\u000a      from the LRA insurgency (The North of Uganda was convulsed by an uprising\u000a      by a group calling itself the Lord's Resistance Army which from 1986 until\u000a      relatively recently created terror and chaos throughout the region.) URN\u000a      has played a crucial role in promoting independent reporting, freedom of\u000a      expression and democratic elections, in both providing news that was seen\u000a      to be reliable and independent and empowering (and funding) Ugandan\u000a      journalists to undertake robust, accurate and unbiased political\u000a      reportage. Gaber's role in planning the project prior to launch, and then\u000a      organising and undertaking the national training programme prior to its\u000a      launch, can be attested to by the NGO that employed him.\u000a    The Nigerian project &#8212; funded by the UK and US governments &#8212; was based\u000a      around establishing and running the Nigerian Election News Report\u000a      (NENR) of which Gaber was the designer and first editor. During the 2011\u000a      general elections a nationwide team of journalists, who had earlier been\u000a      trained by Gaber, emailed news stories to the NENR headquarters in Lagos.\u000a      These were edited, voiced and uploaded to an open-access website for\u000a      downloading by any Nigerian website, newspaper, radio or TV station. What\u000a      was particularly innovative was that the packages were also delivered via\u000a      a mobile phone direct-dial system to over 1500 Nigerian journalists. The\u000a      mobile phone material could either be put to air by journalists working in\u000a      remote areas who had poor internet access, or be transmitted as alert\u000a      mechanisms that directed journalists to the NENR website. In this way,\u000a      journalists were being given unprecedented access to breaking election\u000a      news stories that were uncensored, accurate and timely.\u000a    The workshops &#8212; involving more than 100 Nigerian journalists &#8212; and the\u000a      NENR service had a significant impact. Over the life of the project the\u000a      NENR website received 34,229 hits (from launch in March to end on 16th\u000a      June 2011). Kemi Aduroja, political reporter for the TV news channel NN24\u000a      TV in Lagos said: \"This service (NENR) equipped journalists and made them\u000a      to be more active and more effective in reporting electioneering stories\u000a      which will eventually enhance non-partisan politics in Nigeria's\u000a      democracy\" and the President of the Nigeria Guild of Editors, Gbenga\u000a      Adefaye said that NENR \"would bring about professionalism in journalistic\u000a      style and reporting\". A full report of the project, Nigerian Election\u000a      Support Programme, (International Press Centre, Lagos www.ipcng.org)\u000a      was distributed widely at the conclusion of the project and a paper\u000a      outlining the project and its impact was delivered at the 2012 conference\u000a      of the UK's African Studies Association.\u000a    He is currently (2013 and 2014) working on a major project in the run-up\u000a      to elections in Malawi in May 2014. This involves training and mentoring\u000a      25 reporters with the aim of increasing the amount and quality of\u000a      issue-based reporting in the Malawian media.

This was followed, in\u000a      October 2007, with ethnographic work in the Central African Republic at\u000a      the request of the prosecutor's office at the International Criminal\u000a      Court. Silverman's acknowledged expertise in this area led to the award,\u000a      in July 2010, of a three-year, &#163;25,100 grant by the British Academy, under\u000a      its Africa Partnership programme, which has as a principal aim the\u000a      establishing of links between UK and African institutions and\u000a      intra-regional links within Africa. Silverman has supervised a PhD student\u000a      based in Sierra Leone, whose thesis is a qualitative examination of the\u000a      response of civil society in Sierra Leone to media coverage of two war\u000a      crimes trials &#8212; including the trial of Charles Taylor in The Hague.\u000a    Silverman's research on media content and ethnographic fieldwork in the\u000a      four regions of Sierra Leone helped to build bridges between civil society\u000a      groupings, lawyers, academics and activists, using the war crimes\u000a      reporting as a focus. The research shows that strengthening the lateral\u000a      links between media and civil society can be an effective antidote to the\u000a      arbitrary imposition of power by African `big men' which has, so often,\u000a      institutionalised weak and corrupt governance and led to violence and the\u000a      breakdown of order.\u000a    Gaber's underpinning research relates to his prolific output\u000a      investigating relations between journalists and politicians and, in\u000a      particular, his analysis of how the media has been reporting election\u000a      coverage in a mature democracy (UK) which he has then been able to apply\u000a      to countries in Africa that are transitioning to democracy. He has also\u000a      investigated issues regarding fair reporting of conflict and post-conflict\u000a      situations in other regions (e.g. Israel-Palestine). In his 2007 book,\u000a      particularly Chapter 11, Gaber applied his research findings about\u000a      election coverage in the UK to Africa. In a publication targeted at\u000a      African reporters he outlined his research findings and demonstrated its\u000a      relevance, and application, to reporting politics and elections in an\u000a      African context. This set out the key role the media should play in a\u000a      democracy, enabling citizens to make informed judgments, seeking to\u000a      represent and crystallise public opinion to the politicians, giving\u000a      politicians a space to respond to public concerns and to set out their own\u000a      policies and providing a `public sphere' for debate.\u000a    In his 2006 research, which analysed the previous year's General Election\u000a      in the UK, he demonstrated how the issue agendas of the media, the public\u000a      and the politicians diverged, and also demonstrated how the Labour Party &#8212; the eventual winners &#8212; whilst differing most radically from the agendas\u000a      being pursued by the media, was closest to that of the public's. Not only\u000a      did this research bring him to the attention of those organisations\u000a      involved in promoting democracy in Africa but also provided him with the\u000a      contextual basis to enable him to undertake the various initiatives with\u000a      which he was subsequently involved.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40672","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3686110","Name":"Colombia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    On the strength of their research expertise in the media and public\u000a      protection, in 2010, Gaber and\u000a      Silverman were appointed to the Government's Munro Review of Child\u000a        Protection. Community\u000a      Care magazine wrote that, \"A key task of Professor Eileen Munro's review\u000a      of child protection is to\u000a      examine the public perception of social workers and the media coverage of\u000a      the profession.\" Gaber\u000a      undertook a research project into how the police and council social\u000a      services in Sheffield and\u000a      Lincolnshire handled a sensitive child protection issue that at the time\u000a      had attracted a great deal of\u000a      media coverage. The confidential report, Crisis Media and\u000a        Communications Management in Social\u000a        Work: a case study, was submitted to the Inquiry in February 2011.\u000a    The final report &#8212; The Munro Review of Child Protection: A\u000a        child-centred system &#8212; received\u000a      widespread approbation on its publication by the Department of Education\u000a      in November 2011. Only\u000a      one of its 14 principal recommendations was rejected. A recent article in\u000a      the British Journal of\u000a        Social Work (Warner J.; `Heads Must Roll'? Emotional Politics, the\u000a      Press and the Death of Baby P)\u000a      noted the importance that Munro gives to the issue of media coverage. In The\u000a        Munro Review of\u000a        Child Protection (Munro, 2011), the relationship between social work\u000a      and the media receives a\u000a      significant amount of attention (see pp.121-7). Munro explicitly\u000a      highlights the need for politicians\u000a      and other public figures to avoid `knee-jerk reactions or conclusions' and\u000a      for `actions to be\u000a      thoughtfully reviewed' This reflects an important aspect of Gaber and\u000a      Silverman's work.\u000a    Following publication of the Review, Gaber and Silverman were asked by\u000a      the College of Social\u000a      Work to distil their research and experience, into a comprehensive media\u000a      training programme for\u000a      the College staff and spokespeople for the social work profession around\u000a      the country. They ran\u000a      eight workshops for the College throughout 2012. Some 35 social work\u000a      practitioners were trained\u000a      to undertake both radio and television interviews to explain the varying\u000a      demands of social work to a\u000a      general lay audience. The response to the training was overwhelmingly\u000a      positive and most of those\u000a      trained have appeared on local radio or regional media at some point to\u000a      represent the profession.\u000a      Further details of this can be obtained from Mark Ivory, Policy and\u000a      Communications Manager at\u000a      the College of Social Work (see below).\u000a    Drugs Policy\u000a    Silverman's book, Crime, Policy and the Media, was widely read in\u000a      policymaking circles and led to\u000a      an invitation to give evidence to the UK Drug Policy Commission (UKDPC),\u000a      set up to examine the\u000a      case for a fresh approach to drugs policy. He was interviewed by the UKDPC\u000a      chief executive,\u000a      Roger Howard (June 12, 2012) about the likely media response to any form\u000a      of legalisation or\u000a      gradual decriminalisation of certain drugs in the UK. Silverman also took\u000a      part in a select round-table\u000a      (11 October 2012) and his contribution helped fine-tune the UKDPC's final\u000a      report `A Fresh\u000a        Approach to Drugs', published that month and well publicised in the\u000a      media.

These studies\u000a      combined extensive\u000a      content\/discourse analysis of newspaper reportage with 45 semi-structured\u000a      interviews (with six\u000a      former Home Secretaries, a former Lord Chief Justice, an\u000a      ex-Attorney-General, leading police\u000a      officers and others). At the heart of the studies was an examination of\u000a      the relationship between\u000a      media coverage and policy-making, with particular emphasis on public\u000a      protection and drugs policy.\u000a      Different aspects of the research were published between 2007-10 in Policy\u000a        Review magazine\u000a      (widely circulated in Whitehall) as well as the British Journalism\u000a        Review and the Howard Journal of\u000a        Criminal Justice.

His principal focus has been how the\u000a      relationship between the media\u000a      and politicians has impacted on the policy formation process at local and\u000a      national level; in addition\u000a      to this he has published a number of specific outputs relating to child\u000a      protection and mental health\u000a      issues. In 2006 he contributed to the report of the Independent Inquiry\u000a      into the Care and Treatment\u000a      of Michael Stone.

The\u000a      changes include clarification of text about the age suitability of infant\u000a      and follow on formula products and the clarity of pack shots in\u000a      advertisements (pages 6 and 68 of 5.2). These recommendations\u000a      derive from the secondary research analysis and primary data collection of\u000a      the University of Leicester project. Further changes concerning\u000a      identifiers of the age of any infants shown in follow-on formula\u000a      advertising were also underpinned by the primary analysis of formula\u000a      advertising we undertook.\u000a    The robustness of our evidence base has been further reinforced by the\u000a      publication of two peer-reviewed papers. One of these papers went beyond\u000a      the original brief to highlight the way formula manufacturers were able to\u000a      circumvent restrictions to their product promotions in regulated\u000a      advertising by presenting product information for infant formula products\u000a      alongside that for follow-on formula products on their company web sites\u000a      that can be readily accessed by consumers. Follow-up research indicated\u000a      that three years on from the original research, four out of the five major\u000a      formula product manufacturers had addressed this issue and removed\u000a      publicly accessible links to infant formula product information.\u000a    The research therefore had a direct impact on a government policy-making\u000a      process; in spite of the change of government in June 2010 and the lack of\u000a      formal response to the panel's recommendations, the manufacturers have\u000a      nonetheless acknowledged and responded to our findings.\u000a    Current television advertising for follow-on formula adheres to the key\u000a      recommendations underpinned by Leicester's research. The recommendations\u000a      were that television advertising should:\u000a    \u000a      Provide text relating to age suitability in a box, in bold or\u000a        underlined.\u000a      Specify, unambiguously, the age of the child for whom the product is\u000a        intended in the voiceover of television advertisements.\u000a      Ensure that the infants shown in follow-on formula advertising are\u000a        unambiguously aged six months and over: for example by demonstrating\u000a        features such as good head and arm control; sitting upright; having hair\u000a        and teeth; showing emotional facial expression; being in an outdoor\u000a        environment; self-feeding.\u000a      Increase the size and enhance the clarity of product images (i.e.\u000a        packshots)\u000a    \u000a    These recommendations can be seen translated into practice in 2013\u000a      television commercials by leading formula manufacturers.

The labelling, advertising and promotion of these\u000a      products are subject to government controls. The regulations prohibit,\u000a      with some exceptions, the advertising of infant formula, but the\u000a      advertising of follow-on formula is permitted. The UK market for infant\u000a      formula products is large (c &#163;600m) and has grown by 50% over the last\u000a      five years. A concern within the health promotion and policy-making\u000a      community and among lobby groups supporting breastfeeding is that, within\u000a      this control framework, there is potential for parents, parents-to-be, and\u000a      carers to mistake advertising that promotes follow-on formula for\u000a      advertising for infant formula with the possible effect that support for\u000a      and uptake of breastfeeding are undermined.\u000a    Our research, directed by Professor Barrie Gunter and Mr Roger Dickinson,\u000a      was designed to establish the effect of revised regulations introduced in\u000a      2007 controlling the advertising and commercial presentation of infant\u000a      formula products. The research (see 3.1) was commissioned to\u000a      assist an independent review panel assembled at the request of the\u000a      Minister of State for Public Health to assess whether the new controls\u000a      were meeting their objectives, whether further action was needed, and what\u000a      future action, if any, would be appropriate. Gunter and Dickinson were the\u000a      joint grant-holders and principal investigators. The independent review\u000a      panel's work was concerned with a small though significant element of the\u000a      very much broader topic of the marketing and advertising of breast milk\u000a      substitutes. It set out to conduct a review `based on the best available\u000a      evidence and that this evidence should be robust and able to withstand\u000a      scrutiny' (5.3). The panel sought to commission academic\u000a      researchers with proven expertise to collect relevant data using\u000a      established social scientific methods of high validity and reliability and\u000a      to analyse and interpret these data in order to provide the panel with\u000a      firm evidence on which to base its recommendations.\u000a    An analysis of the textual and visual content of UK print, television,\u000a      internet and outdoor advertising for formula products was conducted for\u000a      two 12-month periods (January to December 2006; March 2008 to February\u000a      2009). Data from store displays for formula products in 108 retail sites\u000a      situated in Belfast, Cardiff, Edinburgh and Leicester between December\u000a      2008 and January 2009 were also analysed. Coding schedules were designed\u000a      to measure variables in the advertisements known to mediate consumers'\u000a      responses to advertising content.\u000a    Our research findings were presented in a report to the review panel in\u000a      July 2009. They showed that the advertising of infant formula and\u000a      follow-on formula had changed since the change in regulations in 2007.\u000a      Prevalence of information about product features increased from 2006 to\u000a      2008-09 in print advertisements while there was evidence that TV\u000a      advertising of follow-on formula and its intended use had become less\u000a      clear. After the change in regulations, TV advertisements were more likely\u000a      to use techniques designed to play on the emotions of consumers than print\u000a      advertisements; the use of emotional triggers becoming more prevalent. The\u000a      text in print and TV advertisements had become easier to read but\u000a      techniques that could further improve clarity reported by the research\u000a      team had not been utilised either before or after the change in\u000a      regulations. There was evidence that in TV advertising of follow-on\u000a      formula there had been a decline in the use of images showing age-related\u000a      factors that may indicate to consumers the suitability of follow-on\u000a      formula products.\u000a    All the data analysis was conducted by researchers at Leicester and was\u000a      led by Gunter and Dickinson with the assistance of Dr Julian Matthews\u000a      (Lecturer) and Ms Jennifer Cole (Graduate Research Assistant).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41013","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The project used an Open Innovation approach, which involved working with\u000a      existing open source software projects hosted by the Apache Software\u000a      Foundation.

It has\u000a      also been the subject of subsequent discussion as a model of best practice\u000a      for engagement by research projects with the Open Source community, for\u000a      example in an article by OSS Watch at the University of Oxford (2012).\u000a    The impact of the project for its consortia members is nicely summarised\u000a      by Stuart Campbell of TIE Kinetix: \"whilst we have probably been in around\u000a      10 projects to date, this is only the second one I can really say I'm sure\u000a      we will tangibly benefit from\"\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    OMELETTE was a project funded under the EC Framework 7 programme under\u000a      the Future Services theme.

This set out the\u000a      framework for combining telecommunications services with web mashups.\u000a    This was further developed with research on key supporting technologies\u000a      including interprocess communications in the context of web &amp; telecoms\u000a      mashups, described in Wilson, Daniel, Jugel and Soi (2012) and Chudnovsky\u000a      et al.

For example, connecting selection of a contact with\u000a      one application using a mobile device address book, with another\u000a      application capable of sending alerts via SMS or email.

This position\u000d\u000a      has made it possible to bring about the impact in the current assessment\u000d\u000a      period.\u000d\u000a    Professor Gill's background in Social Psychology and in Media and\u000d\u000a      Cultural Studies gives her a unique vantage point from which to contribute\u000d\u000a      to knowledge about the `sexualisation' of culture. In fields that are\u000d\u000a      known for their polarised arguments, Gill's work has made a contribution\u000d\u000a      that speaks across entrenched positions, and this in part accounts for the\u000d\u000a      impact of her work.\u000d\u000a    In January 2011 Gill was approached by the NSPCC to help develop their\u000d\u000a      response to the Home Office enquiry on children and sexualisation, As a\u000d\u000a      result of that collaboration she was invited to lead research for the\u000d\u000a      NSPCC that would explore `sexting' &#8212; that is the sending or receiving of\u000d\u000a      messages with sexual content, via mobile Internet technologies,\u000d\u000a      particularly smart phones.\u000d\u000a    The impacts of this research &#8212; launched in Parliament in May 2012 &#8212; have\u000d\u000a      led to a paradigm shift away from familiar concerns about paedophile\u000d\u000a      activity, showing that sexting is embedded in existing peer and power\u000d\u000a      networks, rather than being about `stranger danger'. At the launch of the\u000d\u000a      report, Jon Brown, head of strategy at the NSPCC, said: `What's most\u000d\u000a      striking about this research is that many young people seem to accept all\u000d\u000a      this as part of life. But it can be another layer of sexual abuse and,\u000d\u000a      although most children will not be aware, it is illegal.'\u000d\u000a    The implications of this shift in understanding are significant and are\u000d\u000a      already being taken up by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection\u000d\u000a      centre, by schools and by Internet safety organisations such as the UK\u000d\u000a      Council for Child Internet Safety (UKCIS).\u000d\u000a    Jon Brown described the research as very important and as a result of the\u000d\u000a      issues raised by the research the NSPCC is calling for all professionals\u000d\u000a      to receive training in the latest technology so they are better equipped\u000d\u000a      to deal with sexting. The NSPCC has also devised guidelines, based on the\u000d\u000a      research, for secondary schools and the communications industry to give\u000d\u000a      young people better protection through education which promotes\u000d\u000a      considerate, respectful relationships.\u000d\u000a    The research has been adopted by UKCIS and incorporated in the\u000d\u000a      Association for School Leaders' booklet `Sexting in Schools: What to\u000d\u000a        Do and How to Handle It; A Toolkit'. Linda Thompson of Rape Crisis\u000d\u000a      writes `Gill's work is the first research that highlights the gendered\u000d\u000a      nature of sexting.' These findings directly informed the advice on teacher\u000d\u000a      education contained within the teacher training materials.\u000d\u000a    Numerous speaking engagements and requests have followed publication &#8212;\u000d\u000a      most of them to educationalists (e.g. school governors), health\u000d\u000a      practitioners and organisations concerned with stopping bullying and\u000d\u000a      violence. These engagements include Gill's keynote at the Rape Crisis\u000d\u000a      conference in Glasgow in October 2013.\u000d\u000a    In addition to policy and practice impacts, Professor Gill's research has\u000d\u000a      also had impact on public debates via her appearances on such programs as\u000d\u000a      Thinking Allowed and Woman's hour, discussing issues such as sexualised\u000d\u000a      advertising.\u000d\u000a    Gill's interventions in debates about sexualisation have also had\u000d\u000a      considerable impact beyond the UK. In 2010 she gave evidence to UNESCO and\u000d\u000a      UNDAW. In March that year she was accorded the great honour of addressing\u000d\u000a      the European Parliament in Strasbourg, on the occasion of International\u000d\u000a      Women's Day. In September 2012 she took up a position as Chair of the\u000d\u000a      Scientific Committee on a European directive concerned with improving the\u000d\u000a      representation of women both on and off screen.

The alleged sexualisation of\u000d\u000a      culture attracts strong opinions, but there is a dearth of rigorous\u000d\u000a      research to constitute a sound evidence base for practice and policy\u000d\u000a      making. Professor Gill's research has been important for providing\u000d\u000a      careful, theoretically-informed empirical analyses of both the nature of\u000d\u000a      sexualisation and how people negotiate media cultures and public spaces\u000d\u000a      that many argue are increasingly sexualised. Gill has a long track record\u000d\u000a      in this field, dating from her early (1998-2000) Unilever-funded study of\u000d\u000a      young men's reactions to idealised male body imagery, which remains the\u000d\u000a      only empirical research on masculinity and sexualisation. Here, however,\u000d\u000a      we focus on the increasing impact of her work since she joined Kings\u000d\u000a      College London as Professor in Social and Cultural Analysis January 2010.\u000d\u000a    During her time at King's, from 2010-13, Gill worked with colleagues on\u000d\u000a      two important, original research projects. From 2008 to date she has\u000d\u000a      worked (with Dr Sue Jackson and Dr Tiina Vares) on a Marsden Trust (Royal\u000d\u000a      Society of New Zealand &#8212; value $750,000) award that focuses longitudinally\u000d\u000a      on `tween age' girls experiences of growing up in a more sexualised\u000d\u000a      culture. This group of children are repeatedly invoked as objects of\u000d\u000a      concern in media and policy debates about sexualisation, but their own\u000d\u000a      perspectives and experiences are rarely heard. Using an innovative suite\u000d\u000a      of methodological techniques including interviews, focus groups and video\u000d\u000a      diaries, the research tracks girls aged 9 until 13, as they move from\u000d\u000a      primary to secondary school and into adolescence.\u000d\u000a    In 2011 and 2012, Professor Gill worked with colleagues (Professor Sonia\u000d\u000a      Livingstone, Dr Jessica Ringrose and Dr. Laura Harvey) on an NSPCC-funded\u000d\u000a      study of `sexting' in schools. Based on interviews with young people in\u000d\u000a      year 8 and year 10 in two inner-city London schools, and also on analysis\u000d\u000a      of the role of social media in their lives, this study offers the first\u000d\u000a      qualitative understanding of how mobile Internet technologies are\u000d\u000a      impacting the kinds of sexual material young people see and engage with.\u000d\u000a      The research has highlighted the pivotal role played by BlackBerry\u000d\u000a      messenger in both pleasurable sexual communication and sexual harassment,\u000d\u000a      and has shifted the paradigm through which `sexting' is understood, by\u000d\u000a      highlighting the significance of peer networks rather than `stranger\u000d\u000a      danger'.\u000d\u000a    Beyond these two ground-breaking studies, Professor Gill's theoretical\u000d\u000a      development of ideas from her research has had a transformative impact on\u000d\u000a      debates about the alleged sexualisation of culture by:\u000d\u000a    a) foregrounding differences (that is, the different ways in which\u000d\u000a      gender, race, class, age and sexuality affect both who is `sexualised' and\u000d\u000a      how this is seen);\u000d\u000a    b) changing the terms of the debate so that the notion of\u000d\u000a      ``objectification'' is replaced by a more nuanced, Foucaultian-inspired\u000d\u000a      notion of `subjectification'\u000d\u000a    c) highlighting the importance of power to questions of sexualisation,\u000d\u000a      questioning current rhetorics of `sexiness' as `empowering'; and\u000d\u000a    d) intervening in debates about media literacy (often regarded as a\u000d\u000a      panacea for dealing with sexualisation) to highlight the fact that being\u000d\u000a      media literate (e.g. able to discourse critically upon the techniques used\u000d\u000a      to generate a sexy image) does not necessarily displace other more\u000d\u000a      complicated effects on individuals and groups.\u000d\u000a    Gill's research has also had a significant impact on debate transforming\u000d\u000a      understandings of power, objectification and media literacy and bringing a\u000d\u000a      strong focus on difference and intersectionality to discussions of\u000d\u000a      sexualisation. Her work has been translated into several different\u000d\u000a      languages, reprinted repeatedly, and extensively cited. Gill's 2008 paper\u000d\u000a      `Empowerment\/Sexism' is the most highly cited article ever published by\u000d\u000a      Feminism and Psychology, and her subsequent paper in Sexualities has a\u000d\u000a      similar profile. It is a measure of the impact of Gill's work in this\u000d\u000a      field, upon scholars and students, that her book Gender and the Media\u000d\u000a      was awarded the International Gender and Language Association prize for\u000d\u000a      the most important and influential work, in 2010, almost four years after\u000d\u000a      it was published.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41316","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact relates to three main categories: improving compliance with\u000a      water quality standards; mitigating economic risks; and improving\u000a      understanding through open government and information. The impact has the\u000a      following key beneficiaries:\u000a    \u000a      Government agencies and non-governmental agencies with responsibility\u000a        for environmental quality;\u000a      Farmers and land-managers, who have access to information that assists\u000a        them in mitigating the adverse effects on the environment while\u000a        maintaining agricultural production levels;\u000a      The general public, which benefits from the drive towards\u000a        environmental improvements.\u000a    \u000a    In the UK, there has been a long-standing water quality problem of\u000a      diffuse pollution (pollution sources that may be small individually but\u000a      which are collectively damaging). Therefore, compliance with water quality\u000a      standards (such as the EU's Water Framework Directive) is challenging,\u000a      particularly when the underlying causes of the pollution are not clear.\u000a      DDH's work means that compliance with water quality standards has improved\u000a      and pollution has been reduced as a result of better recording and\u000a      managing of key information. This has had immediate benefits to the public\u000a      in terms of a cleaner and safer environment and more diverse ecosystems.\u000a      Michael Dobson, Former Director of the FBA (Freshwater Biological\u000a      Association), has commented on DDH's impact in this area: `The research...\u000a      in the fields of digital archives, information management, data analysis\u000a      and visualisation, and data modelling and description standards... has had\u000a      significant impact on freshwater science... [Our collaboration] has led to\u000a      a better understanding of pollution processes in inland waterways and\u000a      lakes, and has improved the quality of information available to government\u000a      and regulatory authorities regarding water quality, thus playing a key\u000a      role in UK government-funded activities to improve environmental standards\u000a      and enabling compliance with the EU's Water Framework Directive' [5.1].\u000a    Beyond the legal and ethical requirement to monitor and improve water\u000a      quality, there are economic ramifications should the UK fail to meet the\u000a      Water Framework Directive requirements. Foremost among these is the risk\u000a      of financial penalties from the European Union, which can be as high as a\u000a      &#8364;28 million fine plus &#8364;120,000 daily penalties. According to Dr Bill\u000a      Brierley, Monitoring Advisor for the Environmental Agency: `Approximately\u000a      64% (by length) of English rivers currently fail the current Water\u000a      Framework Directive phosphorus standards and diffuse agricultural\u000a      pollution is one of the significant reasons for failure of ecological\u000a      status in England and Wales &#8212; the task of reducing nutrient levels is a\u000a      very significant one for both the Environment Agency and UK plc' [5.2].\u000a    The EU is prepared to implement steep penalties for river pollution and\u000a      came close to doing so in 2007 when France failed to improve water\u000a      quality. As Brierley has said: `The archive [created by the DDH team]\u000a      allows us to comply with the Water Framework Directive &#8212; the penalties for\u000a      not doing this are financial as well as environmental and reputational.\u000a      Without the work of the King's team it would be very difficult for us to\u000a      monitor, understand and demonstrate compliance or identify the sources of\u000a      diffuse pollution within agricultural catchments. It is only when we have\u000a      this detailed information that we can, together with other stakeholders,\u000a      identify, undertake cost benefit analyses of and prioritise both\u000a      mitigation and management actions' [5.2].\u000a    Access to data and freely available evidence is a key priority for the UK\u000a      government. The knowledge gained through this information management\u000a      research is being communicated to farmers, leading to improved practices\u000a      in relation to fertilisation of agricultural land so that pollution is\u000a      reduced while land productivity is maintained. This integrated data\u000a      sharing supports the work of the Environment Agency and facilitates\u000a      stakeholder engagement. As Dr Brierley of the Environment Agency says:\u000a      `The archive has, for the first time, collated and stored information,\u000a      monitoring data and evidence and makes this available to the Environment\u000a      Agency, Defra, academics and members of the public via web portals. This\u000a      ensures that the data is available for anyone to access, use, analyse and\u000a      scrutinise. ... This is one of the underlying principles of the River\u000a      Basin Management Plans in the Water Framework Directive' [5.2]. Moreover,\u000a      according to the Science Programme Manager at the Department for\u000a      Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra): `The implementation of an\u000a      archive consistent with open data standards, allowing linked data\u000a      approaches to analysis, is important to achieve the vision... KCL has\u000a      taken a leading role in developing appropriate access restrictions to\u000a      ensure data can be shared effectively in accordance with the INSPIRE\u000a      directive and open data strategy but within the limits of the data\u000a      protection act. Their work will ensure the investment in data collection\u000a      continues to have impact without disclosing sensitive information about\u000a      stakeholders' [5.3].\u000a    Beyond the Water Frameworks Directive, DDH has collaborated on other\u000a      Defra-funded activities, including meeting the INSPIRE (geographical data\u000a      recording) Directive and further developing the freshwater data model to\u000a      support another research platform, namely the Agricultural Greenhouse Gas\u000a      Platform. This platform supports activities to mitigate climate change. As\u000a      Dr Dobson of the Freshwater Biological Association states, this research\u000a      informs the UK government `about the practicalities of implementing the\u000a      EU's INSPIRE Directive... and contains a wide range of rules for managing\u000a      geo-spatial information. Defra is responsible for overseeing the\u000a      implementation of INSPIRE in the UK, and the collaborations are a showcase\u000a      for implementing the Directive in data archives, and for pioneering the\u000a      open publication of Defra's scientific data in accordance with the\u000a      Directive. The research carried out by CeRch [DDH] was a key factor in\u000a      enabling these results, and we expect the impact that it has had to date\u000a      to continue to grow further over the coming years' [5.1].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The advanced information management research of the Department of Digital\u000a      Humanities (DDH) has led to a better understanding of pollution processes\u000a      in inland waterways and lakes.

While DDH's work focused initially on the Humanities, the\u000a      research is applicable to and has been transferred and adapted to many\u000a      different domains. This case study shows the impact that the research has\u000a      had on freshwater biology, freshwater hydrology, and other aspects of\u000a      environmental science.\u000a    Unavailability of and lack of cohesion in environmental datasets is a\u000a      major stumbling block in meeting regulatory requirements and improving\u000a      environmental quality. For example, in 2009 Defra prepared an explanatory\u000a      memorandum to the INSPIRE (Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the\u000a      European Community) Regulations (No. 3157) stating that the five most\u000a      frequent difficulties experienced in the preparation of Environmental\u000a      and\/or Strategic Impact Assessments related to:\u000a    \u000a      Problems with getting access to existing data (70%);\u000a      Difficulties with finding out which data is available (56%);\u000a      Lack of availability of necessary data (51%);\u000a      Non-compatibility of datasets from different suppliers (47%);\u000a      Insufficient quality of existing data (47%).\u000a    \u000a    The pathway from research to impact began when the Unit was approached by\u000a      the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA) as a result of the research\u000a      reputation of DDH's Centre of e-Research (CeRch) in information\u000a      management. The FBA and DDH collaborated on research into standards,\u000a      vocabularies and infrastructure for data sharing and integration. The\u000a      research outputs now support the UK freshwater science community, which\u000a      includes industry, third sector, and non-HE research organisations.\u000a    The distinctive challenges posed by water quality information are the\u000a      result of its diverse and complex structure. Existing water data\u000a      collections are generally hand-crafted with diverse individual\u000a      characteristics that lead to an inherent `messiness' in the way data is\u000a      presented. There are over 30 criteria for assessing the status of rivers,\u000a      lakes, transitional waters and coastal waters. They all include\u000a      consideration of biological and chemical quality, environmental quality\u000a      standards, and physical aspects such as the quantity and dynamics of water\u000a      flow. Yet failure to understand or manage this complex data has serious\u000a      repercussions. If part of a water body fails to meet the standards\u000a      mandated by the Water Framework Directive (WFD) on any single criterion,\u000a      it will be judged to have failed overall.\u000a    DDH carried out a programme of research over several years designed to\u000a      lead to the more effective representation and exploitation of data related\u000a      to water quality infrastructures [3.4]. Research included interviews with\u000a      freshwater scientists and those with responsibility for freshwater data\u000a      creation. These interviews helped elicit attitudes to sharing and reusing\u000a      data and clarified the functional requirements for a freshwater data\u000a      repository [3.6]. DDH's research has delivered methods for `treating'\u000a      heterogeneous collections of data [3.1]. This includes the creation of\u000a      metadata (information about where each piece of data comes from) for\u000a      research data archives [3.2]. In addition, DDH delivered means of carrying\u000a      out semantic integration of research data sets, harmonising data stored by\u000a      different groups in different formats so that any query run on the\u000a      database will be able to match information appropriately. This approach\u000a      was also developed in relation to scientific and experimental data sets\u000a      [3.3].\u000a    The research developed innovative methods of visualising, querying,\u000a      analysing and processing information in an integrated fashion that had not\u000a      hitherto been possible. In the case of freshwater biology research, this\u000a      results in improved knowledge and understanding of pollution processes and\u000a      of their relationship to human activity, especially farming [3.6].\u000a    Key Researchers\u000a    \u000a      Mark Hedges, Senior Lecturer and Director of CeRch (at King's since\u000a        2005)\u000a      Richard Gartner, Lecturer (at King's since 2009)\u000a      Sheila Anderson, Professor of e-Research (at King's since 2002)\u000a      obias Blanke, Senior Lecturer (at King's since 2005)\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41317","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    By the beginning of 2008, there were millions of low resolution images\u000a      that were digitally available to the public. However, it is estimated that\u000a      there were fewer than 50,000 images from museums which were both high\u000a      resolution and freely available under open access provisions for non-\u000a      commercial use. By 2013, the number of freely available high-quality\u000a      images from museums had grown to more than 2 million [5.9].\u000a    Tanner's research fed into and impacted this growth. As Neal Stimler,\u000a      Associate Digital Asset Specialist at the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u000a      writes: `Tanner's report on digital rights strategies in American art\u000a      museums was a critical testament that contributed to the increase of open\u000a      access initiatives in museums in the United States. The report\u000a      fundamentally challenged the ethics of rights and reproductions practices\u000a      in museums, shifting museum efforts firmly in the principled direction of\u000a      public service and mission through open access' [5.3]. The Metropolitan\u000a      alone has released more than 540,000 images (of which 398,000 are high\u000a      resolution) for personal and educational use. Bill LeFurgy, Digital\u000a      Preservation Manager at the Library of Congress, has emphasised how\u000a      Tanner's research allows heritage organisations to advance arguments for\u000a      free access which are based on economics: `Governments and other funders\u000a      respond to this category of justification because it is constructed in\u000a      practical, tangible terms that clearly demonstrate value. In an era of\u000a      reduced budgets and increased competition for resources, it is essential\u000a      for institutions to marshal a strong and compelling value proposition'\u000a      [5.4].\u000a    Moreover museums and galleries in Europe and the US have cited Tanner's\u000a      research as instrumental in initiating and supporting their own drive to\u000a      open access. As Michael Edson of the Smithsonian states: `In my experience\u000a      within the Smithsonian Institution, Tanner's study provided me with the\u000a      data, insight, and rationale for defeating a proposed image use policy\u000a      [that] would have required an enormous up-front investment to build an\u000a      online image store, it would have kept images out of the hands of our most\u000a      productive users and collaborators for decades: it almost certainly would\u000a      have never made a profit. Tanner's study taught me how to think about the\u000a      value proposition of the proposed policy, and it gave me the data, and the\u000a      courage, to successfully change the course of the policy debate' [5.2].\u000a      Edson concludes that: `Tanner's study is the most important piece of\u000a      research in my field. I truly believe that any individual, anywhere in the\u000a      world, who sees a free, high resolution, high quality reproduction of a\u000a      museum object online has `Reproduction charging models and rights strategy\u000a      for digital images in American art museums' to thank' [5.2].\u000a    Other US art museums which have acknowledged the impact of Tanner's study\u000a      include the Yale University Art Museums, the US National Gallery of Art\u000a      and the Walters Art Museum. In 2011, Yale University Art Museums made over\u000a      250,000 high quality digital images of its cultural heritage collections\u000a      openly and freely available. John ffrench, Director of Visual Resources at\u000a      Yale Art Gallery, has said that Tanner's work `cemented their decision' to\u000a      move to an Open Access model: `In the months after Open Access was\u000a      announced we saw a 40% increase in the number of requests we received\u000a      through our Rights and Reproductions offices which we feel is a success\u000a      and clear indicator we made a wise move' [5.5]. In March 2012, the US\u000a      National Gallery of Art launched its new NGA Images site: `NGA Images [is]\u000a      a new online resource that revolutionizes the way the public may interact\u000a      with its world-class collection,' writes Alan Newman at the US National\u000a      Gallery of Art. `Since inception more than 400,000 images have been\u000a      downloaded... There is no doubt that Tanner's scholarship during the last\u000a      25 years has provided a leadership framework for cultural heritage\u000a      institutions developing public policy relating to collection image access'\u000a      [5.1]. The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore makes 19,000 images freely\u000a      available. William Noel, formerly of the Walters Art Museum, writes:\u000a      `Tanner is one of the most influential figures in a fast changing digital\u000a      environment for cultural heritage assets. In my view, he is a driving\u000a      force for change. I regard my own recent award as a \"White House Open\u000a      Science Champion of Change\" as in part belonging to Tanner... As I was\u000a      recently quoted in a Mellon report by Kris Kelly, the Walters loss of\u000a      control of its images was essential to its success. Simon Tanner and a few\u000a      colleagues held my hand as I relinquished that control' [5.6]. Noel states\u000a      that the Walters Art Museum has had 2.5 million views on Flickr over 3.5\u000a      years and has commented on how its illuminated manuscripts are now more\u000a      available to the public than those of larger national collections.\u000a    Tanner's research has had impact outside of the US. The National Gallery\u000a      of Denmark, for example, cites Tanner's work as instrumental. For example,\u000a      Merete Sanderhoff of the Department of Collections and Research at the\u000a      National Gallery of Denmark, comments: `The recognition that [charging for\u000a      access] is both expensive to run, and effectively prohibits the public\u000a      from accessing and using images of artworks that rightly belong to them,\u000a      has proven a highly efficient argument to make real change happen' [5.7].\u000a    Tanner, Vetch and others in the Department of Digital Humanities have\u000a      drawn upon this research to support their knowledge transfer activities\u000a      and the work of the King's Cultural Institute. Tanner has provided\u000a      consultancy that has drawn upon and updated the conclusions of the\u000a      research, and he continues to influence policy planning and implementation\u000a      in major cultural heritage institutions. Recent examples include work with\u000a      National Museums Liverpool to develop revenue streams from digital images.\u000a      He has also worked with the National Museums Northern Ireland (NMNI) to\u000a      develop a digitisation and digital preservation strategy for 2009-2011. As\u000a      the Head of Collections Management at the NMNI states: `Tanner's research\u000a      provides key evidence in setting new objectives for cultural heritage\u000a      digital content and engagement' [5.8]. Tanner's work remains influential\u000a      for national discourses on the use and availability of digital images as\u000a      seen in the 2012 report to the Heritage Agency of Denmark [5.10] and the\u000a      World Intellectual Property Organization Guide on Managing Intellectual\u000a      Property for Museums [5.10].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research by Simon Tanner has had a significant effect on open access\u000a      policy in the museum sector.

Mellon Foundation leading to a study entitled\u000a      `Reproduction charging models &amp; rights policy for digital images in\u000a      American art museums' [3.1] (published 2004; in turn building on research\u000a      carried out by Tanner focussing on the UK and Europe, published in 2002).\u000a      This was the largest single grant ever given by the Andrew W. Mellon\u000a      Foundation for research into museum policy and since publication this\u000a      research has become instrumental in influencing museum policy and thinking\u000a      concerning opening access to images, rights management strategy, and\u000a      charging models.\u000a    Tanner's research provided a quantitative and qualitative evidence base\u000a      which had not been achieved previously and has not been replicated since.\u000a      One hundred US art museums were surveyed and in-depth interviews\u000a      (sometimes over 2-3 days) were carried out with 20 museums. Over 4,000\u000a      data points were collected, correlated and compared to provide a unique\u000a      insight into policy, practice and the economic realities of museum digital\u000a      image provision. At the time, many museums thought that the provision of\u000a      images of artworks was very profitable for a few select major museums.\u000a      However, Tanner's research demonstrated that museums do not create images\u000a      of their art (digital or otherwise) for commercial reasons. Instead,\u000a      images are created for educational use, to serve the public, and to\u000a      promote the museum and its collections. The research demonstrated for the\u000a      first time that no museum was making a surplus from non-commercial (i.e.\u000a      scholarly, educational and public) use of images and that the cost of\u000a      managing intellectual property and maintaining payment structures in\u000a      cultural heritage collections almost always outweighed actual revenue.\u000a    The research has been influential as it still provides the key evidence\u000a      base upon which national and international cultural heritage policy is\u000a      considered. As Alan Newman, Chief of the Division of Imaging &amp; Visual\u000a      Services at the US National Gallery of Art has written: `A key argument\u000a      for unfettered access to online museum image collections is the study\u000a      Tanner did for the Andrew W. Mellon foundation... The analysis\u000a      demonstrated that the cost of maintaining and managing the business\u000a      structures for image licensing far exceeds the fees collected' [5.1].\u000a      According to Michael Edson, Director of Web and New Media Strategy at the\u000a      Smithsonian Institute, Tanner's research `was, and remains, a godsend&#8212;an\u000a      unprecedented instance of careful, methodical, evidence- based research in\u000a      a field dominated by voodoo economics and wishful thinking' [5.2].\u000a    A 2013 study by Kristin Kelly published in 2013 [5.9] demonstrates that\u000a      there has been a significant shift in museum policy since 2007-08 due to\u000a      the following critical factors: declining revenue; increasing lack of\u000a      comfort in where to draw the line between open and commercial uses; senior\u000a      leadership agreement in favour of an open access approach alongside\u000a      technological innovations which enable images to be made accessible with\u000a      greater ease. These factors have increased the impact of Tanner's research\u000a      among the core beneficiaries: the general public and life-long learners\u000a      who benefit from free access to images and content from museums and\u000a      galleries.\u000a    Key Researchers\u000a    \u000a      Simon Tanner, Director of Digital Consulting, Deputy Head of\u000a        Department of Digital Humanities (at King's from August 2003 onwards)\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41318","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3437598","Name":"Paraguay"},{"GeoNamesId":"3658394","Name":"Ecuador"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Professor Pratt has established an international reputation as an expert\u000d\u000a      in the mapping and\u000d\u000a      measurement of the social and economic dimensions of the cultural and\u000d\u000a      creative industries over 25\u000d\u000a      years.

He has created a new methodology,\u000d\u000a      fashioned a conceptual and\u000d\u000a      analytic lens, as well as a means of putting these into practice in the\u000d\u000a      field.\u000d\u000a    Figures based on Pratt's approach revealed the creative economy\u000d\u000a      contributing 3.4% of total world\u000d\u000a      trade, and exports of $424 Billion (UNCTAD 2008). This finding had a\u000d\u000a      substantial impact on policy\u000d\u000a      making; moreover it highlighted the nature of inequalities in cultural\u000d\u000a      trade and the degree of control\u000d\u000a      of local cultural `product'.\u000d\u000a    Professor Pratt's research comprises of four interlinked phases, all of\u000d\u000a      which have had distinct\u000d\u000a      forms of impact on cultural and economic policy: The first proposed,\u000d\u000a      developed and refined a\u000d\u000a      conceptual definition of the cultural and creative industries that\u000d\u000a      challenged existing nominalist\u000d\u000a      accounts to propose a `Cultural Industries Production System' (CIPS). This\u000d\u000a      notion has been\u000d\u000a      extended in later research to cover the whole cultural field.\u000d\u000a    This work has a vital related component: operationalizing the definition\u000d\u000a      in numerical terms that\u000d\u000a      have relevance to the sector, the community, and to policy makers. The\u000d\u000a      challenge has been to\u000d\u000a      devise pragmatic ways to use existing data sources (which are not suited\u000d\u000a      to purpose, and require\u000d\u000a      much statistical and conceptual manipulation to be rendered useful) as\u000d\u000a      well as to set out a practical\u000d\u000a      agenda for new data\/information collection.\u000d\u000a    Thus the breakthrough was defining the field and developing a\u000d\u000a      methodology; since this time a\u000d\u000a      series of practical steps have been to implement this with various policy\u000d\u000a      agencies internationally.\u000d\u000a      Each iteration offers an incremental application and further development\u000d\u000a      of the proof of concept.\u000d\u000a    A second phase, which was substantively pursued while Pratt was at King's\u000d\u000a      College, from 2009-13,\u000d\u000a      analyses the process of operation and governance of the cultural\u000d\u000a      industries and their\u000d\u000a      embedding in locales: notably cities. Based upon a series of writings\u000d\u000a      about the concept, Pratt has\u000d\u000a      reported on empirical studies, and drawn policy implications: again, this\u000d\u000a      work has been eagerly\u000d\u000a      taken up by the international policy community (as evidenced by the\u000d\u000a      keynote invitations to world\u000d\u000a      cities). This research, like the national cultural mapping studies, is the\u000d\u000a      most widely cited in the field.\u000d\u000a    A third phase has concerned innovation and knowledge exchange. In part\u000d\u000a      this developed from\u000d\u000a      work on a book on innovation and creativity (Pratt and Jeffcutt 2009), and\u000d\u000a      has extended to\u000d\u000a      collaborations with NESTA and WIPO. This is consolidated in Pratt's\u000d\u000a      leading role in the AHRC\u000d\u000a      Creative Economy Hub (Creative Works London). This is a major initiative\u000d\u000a      of knowledge transfer\u000d\u000a      with universities and the creative sector, running from 2012-2016.\u000d\u000a    Finally, Professor Pratt's work on creative clusters and world cities has\u000d\u000a      informed policy debates\u000d\u000a      about creative cities. His work furnished a methodology for a major report\u000d\u000a      for the Mayor of London\u000d\u000a      comparing 12 world cities and culture.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41871","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"}],"Funders":["British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Our research insights into new forms of journalism were a catalyst for\u000d\u000a      impact across three projects.

Numerous arts\u000d\u000a      organisations, including Cornerhouse (Manchester), FACT (Liverpool) and\u000d\u000a      Watershed (Bristol), strategised for two years before London 2012, to plan\u000d\u000a      citizen media activity. This work developed social media skills in\u000d\u000a      community media organisations, which would contribute to realising what Miah\u000d\u000a      argues as a crucial mechanism for democratising participation through\u000d\u000a      mega-events, so as to empower citizens [1].\u000d\u000a    The long-term impact of this project is evidenced in the work of Russia's\u000d\u000a      `SochiReporter', which has taken forward these principles ahead of the\u000d\u000a      Sochi 2014 Olympics [C] and Miah's appointment as mentor\u000d\u000a      for the IOC Young Reporters Programme, which aims to enhance the economic\u000d\u000a      benefits of the Olympic Games by developing the skills of novice\u000d\u000a      reporters. During 2012, #media2012 also influenced the work of an artist\u000d\u000a      who created a painted\/montage visual artwork symbolising its contribution\u000d\u000a      [D].\u000d\u000a    Out of the #media2012 collaborations, McGillivray developed\u000d\u000a      #CitizenRelay (#CR), which drew on findings [1, 2, 4] to create a\u000d\u000a      participatory media project funded by Creative Scotland [F]. #CR\u000d\u000a      built a structure within which individuals and unofficial organisations\u000d\u000a      across Scotland could develop journalism skills. The impact of this was\u000d\u000a      considerable, with #CR participants generating 20,000+ online visits\u000d\u000a      during the Relay's week-long stay in Scotland. The production team\u000d\u000a      produced 207 three-minute podcasts, over 100 YouTube videos, 805 Flickr\u000d\u000a      photos, and 350 Instagram images (see http:\/\/www.citizenrelay.net).\u000d\u000a      The consequence of this activity was a greater degree of participation and\u000d\u000a      the creation of an alternative lens through which people could make sense\u000d\u000a      of the Olympic programme. [I].\u000d\u000a    #CR developed new forms of media coverage and embedded the use of social\u000d\u000a      media into media organisations. For example, the Camglen Radio station\u000d\u000a      indicated how #CR \"was a milestone for us - cementing our ability to\u000d\u000a        broadcast live programming from various locations within the communities\u000d\u000a        that Camglen is set up to serve\" [G]. #CR also influenced\u000d\u000a      MediaTrustUK (funded by Big Lottery), helping to raise its profile in\u000d\u000a      Scotland and meeting \"a central policy objective of increasing our\u000d\u000a        reach and establishing links with hyperlocal sites\". MediaTrustUK's\u000d\u000a      director described \"#CR as `a model for engagement....a project model\u000d\u000a        that will act as a key reference point for future thinking.\" [H]\u000d\u000a    #CR also had an impact on large media producers, notably Scottish\u000d\u000a      Television, who recognised: \"there is no doubt that the extent and\u000d\u000a        depth of the updates provided via the #citizenrelay project helped to\u000d\u000a        provide a better quality of coverage to our readers' and how it `helped\u000d\u000a        to inform our thinking about how we cover other subsequent mass\u000d\u000a        participation events\" [J]\u000d\u000a    The project was reported by the BBC, the Guardian Datablog and STV local.\u000d\u000a      McGillivray also worked with the National Libraries of Scotland and\u000d\u000a      The National Archives to develop good practice guidelines for archiving\u000d\u000a      multimedia resources.

These discoveries have led\u000d\u000a      organisations to change their orientation towards society, become media\u000d\u000a      producers, build their community, and influence how the professional media\u000d\u000a      report stories.\u000d\u000a    Investigating new types of journalism at mega-events\u000d\u000a      Between 2008 and 2010 Prof Miah (appointed 2002-present) worked\u000d\u000a      with Dr Beatriz Garcia (University of Liverpool) and Dr Tina Zhihui\u000d\u000a      (Communication University of China) to study the use of `alternative\u000d\u000a      media' at the Olympics [1], continuing Miah's early Games\u000d\u000a      research from Salt Lake City 2002 to Beijing 2008. The primary output of\u000d\u000a      this was the first comprehensive overview of non- traditional media\u000d\u000a      coverage at the Games. Findings revealed how `citizen journalists' were\u000d\u000a      gradually occupying the places that were typically reserved for\u000d\u000a      professional reporters. The research examined changes in the kinds of\u000d\u000a      reporting that takes place, as a result, and the transformation in\u000d\u000a      people's perceptions of the media elite that it provokes.\u000d\u000a    The challenge of citizen journalism to standard media narratives\u000d\u000a      Subsequently, Miah carried out deeper studies into the narratives\u000d\u000a      of citizen journalists at mega-events, in collaboration with Prof\u000d\u000a        McGillivray (appointed 2010-present) [2] and with support\u000d\u000a      from CFi PhD student Ana Adi (2007-2010) [3]. Prof McGillivray's [4]\u000d\u000a      wider work with Prof McPherson and UWS Executive Dean Prof\u000d\u000a        Foley also informed the research into the role of mega-events within\u000d\u000a      society, as vehicles of contested social change and tools for re-examining\u000d\u000a      cultural and media policy. Together, these investigations focused on how\u000d\u000a      citizen-led stories challenge the narratives of traditional media and\u000d\u000a      create new opportunities for citizens to engage with socio-political and\u000d\u000a      cultural discussions. Moreover, they found that the journalism of citizens\u000d\u000a      during the Olympic Games are key drivers of political and social issues.\u000d\u000a      Their findings note how such journalism disrupts the otherwise highly\u000d\u000a      controlled Olympic environment. Furthermore, it reveals how such\u000d\u000a      interventions play a crucial part in articulating the wider social\u000d\u000a      anxieties that are created by the imposition of mega-events on society;\u000d\u000a      such as by drawing attention to injustices or political compromises in the\u000d\u000a      process of hosting such events.\u000d\u000a    New expertise in journalism\u000d\u000a      Alongside this work, between 2009 and 2010 Ewan Crawford\u000d\u000a      (appointed 2004-present) [5], Dr Robertson (appointed\u000d\u000a      1984-present) and Dr Elizabeth McLaughlin (appointed 2010) studied\u000d\u000a      the effect of social media on changes in media practice. Crawford\u000d\u000a      examined concepts of expertise in online newspaper opinion pages; his\u000d\u000a      findings explain the emergence of a new kind of democracy emerging as a\u000d\u000a      result of this media change.\u000d\u000a    Robertson and McLaughlin's [6] research into\u000d\u000a      political blogs show how social media brought into question the role of\u000d\u000a      experts. This analysis demonstrates that social media gives experts their\u000d\u000a      own platforms for broadcasting, where previously they may have been\u000d\u000a      restricted to promotion via a media organisation's own platform. In a\u000d\u000a      world where everyone has their own broadcast channel, the research shows\u000d\u000a      how claims over what counts as expertise become more contested,\u000d\u000a      fragmented, and consequently, more democratised.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41877","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Creating cultural capital, driving public engagement, shaping\u000a        discourse\u000a    Miah's research has inspired, informed and changed the working practices\u000a      of many art\/science\u000a      festivals around the UK which, in turn, have created new exhibits and\u000a      innovative events based on\u000a      Miah's observations and philosophical questioning.

Miah's research on human enhancement [2-5] influenced the\u000a      creation of\u000a      the Abandon Normal Devices festival, which received &#163;750,000 from the\u000a      Cultural Olympiad\u000a      from 2009-2012 (for which FACT was co-founding organisation).

Miah curated exhibitions, identified new\u000a      work for commissions,\u000a      and programmed 12 public debates over 3 years of the festival. The\u000a      festival Director states:\u000a      \"Prof Andy Miah has been a central part of the programme development\u000a        since\u000a        2009....supporting the development of commissions and debates, which\u000a        have in turn made\u000a        it easier for the festival to attract a diverse mix of audiences....Andy\u000a        has also developed the\u000a        salon, debate strand, which have been a central public engagement\u000a        strategy pulling\u000a        together the festival research questions between 2009-2012.\" [C]\u000a      The festival explores the\u000a      ethics of science and technology and attracted interest by many press\u000a      outlets, including\u000a      Wired, BBC, Vogue and Culture Show.

Miah's specially commissioned article featured\u000a      prominently in the\u000a      gallery guide (distributed to 10,000 visitors) and he was integrated into\u000a      the exhibition itself\u000a      (total footfall of 80,000), with over 90,000 web visits [D].\u000a      Evidence from visitor feedback\u000a      indicates how Miah's contribution influenced public opinion on the subject\u000a      of human\u000a      enhancement. For example, one blogger wrote: \"after reading Andy\u000a        Miah's essay in the\u000a        exhibition guide on enhancement in sport, I wonder if my stance is\u000a        coherent and consistent.\u000a        I haven't changed my mind, but I'm not feeling quite so sure-footed.\"\u000a    c) Co-producing interactive installations\u000a    Miah's research [1-2] also influenced the development of a physical,\u000a      interactive, touring\u000a      installation called `InMotion' [E] in the National Museum of\u000a      Scotland which engaged 30,000\u000a      participants within the Edinburgh International Science Festival over 17\u000a      days to explore\u000a      issues around elite sports.\u000a    Policy-making\u000a    During 2009-2010, Miah's research [3-4] influenced a European Parliament\u000a      inquiry on human\u000a      enhancement, following his participation on an earlier European Commission\u000a      FP6 Science and\u000a      Society Coordination Action project on the ethics of nanobiotechnology for\u000a      human enhancement.\u000a      Miah's research is cited in the report produced for the DG for Internal\u000a      Policies on Economic and\u000a      Scientific Policy, Science and Technology Options Assessment [F].\u000a      He is presently part of a select\u000a      research community on a European Commission project titled `Digital\u000a      Futures 2050' which is\u000a      `horizon scanning' to identify new policy issues arising from technologies\u000a      currently still under\u000a      development.\u000a    Public discourse &#8212; science and technology journalism\u000a    Miah's controversial perspective on the merit of human enhancement has\u000a      widely shaped public\u000a      debate, creating a significant media impact over 2008-2013, generating in\u000a      excess of 100 clippings\u000a      [G].

Also in 2012, Miah's research [1-2,\u000a      4] provided advice for a\u000a      theatrical co-production called `Seeking Perfection' on ethics and human\u000a      enhancement. This\u000a      partnership between universities, the Manchester Science Festival and\u000a      Contact Theatre was\u000a      inspired by Miah's explorations of human enhancement [2-3] This production\u000a      won a European\u000a      award for public engagement in 2011 [H].

This involved\u000a      collaboration with the British\u000a      Government Select Committee on Science &amp; Technology (2006-7), World\u000a      Anti-Doping Agency\u000a      (2002-7), Australian Institute of Sport (2003-5), Australian Law Reform\u000a      Commission (2002-3), UK\u000a      Sport (2004), and researchers from Ecole Polytechnic Federale de Lausanne,\u000a      Manchester\u000a      University, UCL, and Oxford University. His early analyses focused on\u000a      genetic technology, which\u000a      led to Miah's Co-Editorship of the special edition of the peer-reviewed\u000a      international refereed\u000a      journal, Research in Philosophy and Technology [1].\u000a    This work framed his subsequent groundbreaking publications on a) gene\u000a      doping, b) bio-digital\u000a      culture &amp; posthumanism, and c) public engagement with science. Miah's\u000a      research across these\u000a      areas shapes his approach to developing research impact and directs the\u000a      substance of the\u000a      impacts. Overall, Miah's body of research connecting science with\u000a      bioethics has been crucial in\u000a      debates on the ethical and cultural dimensions of human enhancement.\u000a      Miah's impact is driven by\u000a      his insights into the future use of technology for human enhancement and\u000a      he is a highly-sought\u000a      after commentator in this area.\u000a    a) Gene Doping research\u000a    With support from The Hastings Center (New York) and the Carnegie Trust,\u000a      Miah led the\u000a      pioneering study `Genetically Modified Athletes' (2004) [2]. This\u000a      research took place at the height\u000a      of public debate on the ethics of the human genome project. It\u000a      interrogated anxieties about gene\u000a      doping, the values associated with life and health extension, and the\u000a      wider ethics of human\u000a      enhancement. The research drew from an eclectic range of literature and\u000a      was reviewed favourably\u000a      in such journals as The Lancet, Yale J Public Health, and\u000a      Sociology of Sport Journal. These\u000a      investigations led to additional research on the wider utilisation of\u000a      biotechnology for non-therapeutic\u000a      purposes, such as cosmetic or functional enhancements [3]. He\u000a      appeared on BBC\u000a      Newsnight in 2004 and 2012 to present these insights.\u000a    b) Bio-Digital Culture &amp; Posthumanism\u000a    Miah's research also explored ethical concerns surrounding the\u000a      biological-digital interface, just\u000a      when technology at the nanoscale began to produce applications that could\u000a      be used to treat illness\u000a      or even enhance humans. He examined shifts in how healthcare providers\u000a      might seek digital\u000a      solutions. His findings are captured in the publication titled `The\u000a      Medicalization of Cyberspace' [4],\u000a      which was the first monograph to deal extensively with this subject,\u000a      offering a critical analysis of\u000a      how an overreliance on digital solutions might create a number of\u000a      challenges. This work also\u000a      outlined how such technology changes what it is to be human by distorting\u000a      fundamental organising\u000a      concepts, such as health, merit, value, species categories, and\u000a      inter-personal relationships [5].\u000a    c) Advancing public engagement\u000a    Overall, Miah's research has brought academia closer to society and his\u000a      published work advances\u000a      methodological debates about how best to undertake public engagement with\u000a      science. This\u000a      research informs how he approached the impact collaborations specified in\u000a      this case study.\u000a      Furthermore, his published work evidences the integration of research and\u000a      strategic thought\u000a      around impact [6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42129","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Widening access to and ensuring professional practice is \"fit for\u000a      purpose' is a key concern of Governments in the UK and overseas. This\u000a      policy drive by Governments has led directly to new modes of delivering\u000a      learning and teaching within and without universities, with the aim of\u000a      developing more evidence-based practice and encouraging professional\u000a      associations to open up alternative routes to professional practice,\u000a      including differing ways of categorising the \"professional'. In the\u000a      information profession, developments in relation to accrediting and\u000a      recognising work-based learning formally and devising Continuing\u000a      Professional Development (CPD) routes into professional practice have\u000a      employed frameworks and methodologies developed by the Aberystwyth\u000a      researchers.\u000a    Research by Broady-Preston and Bell into the effects of the operational\u000a      convergence of information and library services and the necessity for a\u000a      hybrid model of practice, underpinned the development of an in-service\u000a      training programme for South African Librarians [5.8]. Frameworks\u000a      identifying and analysing professional skills and competencies devised by\u000a      Broady-Preston and Preston resulted in the conceptualisation of 'blurring\u000a      professional boundaries' and the concomitant need to develop blended\u000a      information professionals, directly informing curriculum review at the\u000a      University of Sheffield [5.2], the re-conceptualisation and\u000a      repositioning of Australian Library and Information Science education [5.6]\u000a      and CPD frameworks in Australia, India, New Zealand and the Caribbean [5.3].\u000a    The 2009 qualitative methodology for reconfiguring concepts of\u000a      professional identify developed by Broady-Preston informed the future\u000a      direction of the library and information profession in Australia overall,\u000a      being used in a variety of research and policy initiatives funded by the\u000a      Australian Government. The Australian Learning and Teaching Council\u000a      Project employed it in its 2010-11 identification of the knowledge base\u000a      required to modernise the information profession in Australia to meet the\u000a      needs of 21st century practice, and more specifically, to develop a\u000a      structured, modular competency framework for health librarianship in the\u000a      Health Libraries Australia (HLA) Research Project, 2009-2011[5.4, 5.5].\u000a      Broady-Preston's 2009 work on the future of the information profession and\u000a      professional practice, together with the identification of skills and\u000a      competencies for practice was used to identify future directions for the\u000a      Australian Health Library profession by ALIA (Australian Library and\u000a      Information Association) [5.4].\u000a    CPD schemes and activity constitute a discrete sub-section of work in\u000a      relation to determining professional identity, skills, knowledge and\u000a      competencies, directly contributing to developing more robust and rigorous\u000a      evidenced-based practice. In 2008, Broady-Preston was appointed to two\u000a      CILIP Council Task and Finish Groups, the first designing and reviewing\u000a      the Framework of Qualifications and Accreditation (FoQA) for the\u000a      profession, and the second established to determine policy in relation to\u000a      Foundation Degrees [5.2]. The purpose of both groups was to\u000a      examine future needs for CPD in professional practice, including\u000a      identifying mechanisms for recognising and accrediting work-based learning\u000a      and requirements for lifelong learning in professional practice. This led\u000a      to the production of a pioneering light-touch mandatory CPD programme for\u000a      professional practice by CILIP, one of only two developed for the\u000a      profession globally, evaluated subsequently by Broady-Preston in 2009.\u000a    Widespread debate within the profession took place during and following\u000a      the presentation of the scheme and its evaluative model at the World\u000a      Congress in 2009. The debate was such that CILIP UK launched a survey of\u000a      their members in January 2010, revisiting their 2009 policy decision to\u000a      introduce mandatory CPD [5.8]. This led subsequently to the\u000a      development of a global framework for evaluating mandatory professional\u000a      CPD schemes, developed in conjunction with colleagues in New Zealand. A\u000a      comparative critique of the two schemes formed the basis for a structured\u000a      workshop discussion at the IFLA World Library and Information Congress\u000a      August 2010 in Gothenburg, Sweden, focusing on the role and relevance of\u000a      mandatory CPD activity in motivating and regenerating the contemporary\u000a      information profession, led by Broady-Preston. This contributed to the\u000a      temporary suspension in 2011 of the original UK scheme with its subsequent\u000a      revision and re-introduction in 2013 as a Revalidation scheme [5.1].\u000a    Further evidence of policy development and improvements to professional\u000a      practice is demonstrated by Broady-Preston's appointments and advisory\u000a      roles to Government and professional bodies resulting from the above,\u000a      including: 2009-10 membership of the Museums, Libraries and Archives\u000a      Council (MLA) Steering Group, Apprenticeships and Foundation Degrees; 2012\u000a      Adviser and Evaluator for the new CILIP Professional Knowledge and Skills\u000a      Base (PKSB) and the development of flexible CPD and access routes into\u000a      professional practice; and her 2013 appointment by the EU ESCO (European\u000a      Skills\/Competences qualifications and Occupations) Secretariat to the ESCO\u000a      Arts, Entertainment and Recreation Reference group, a European Commission\u000a      Europe-wide initiative to identify and categorise skills, competences,\u000a      qualifications and occupations in a standard way, using standard\u000a      terminology in all EU languages and an open format, usable by third\u000a      parties' software [5.9].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Departmental research identifying skills, knowledge and competency\u000a      frameworks is used by a range of Governments and professional associations\u000a      internationally to inform and improve contemporary information service\u000a      provision and professional practice.\u000a    The development of robust frameworks and methodologies has resulted in a\u000a      maturing knowledge and skills base for the information profession.\u000a      Research on competencies contributed directly to the future education and\u000a      training framework for the Australian library and information profession.\u000a      The design and evaluation of Continuing Professional Development\u000a      frameworks ensures that information and library professionals acquire and\u000a      maintain the knowledge and skills required to deliver quality information\u000a      to industry, the public and society as a whole.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    Aberystwyth University\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Aberystwyth University","InstitutionName":"Aberystwyth University","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"Wales","UKPRN":10007856}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a3.1.[international conference address and peer-reviewed paper]\u000a      Broady-Preston, J., and Bell, S.

In as much as libraries are fundamental to the conception\u000a      of librarianship as a profession, similarly, the profession- oriented\u000a      perspective plays a vital integrating role in sustaining library and\u000a      information science as a field of research and education, despite its\u000a      seemingly patchwork nature.\u000a    Award-winning research from 2000 onwards evaluating contemporary theories\u000a      of professionalism, has led to a fundamental re-examination of the nature\u000a      and role of the information profession. This work has four major strands:\u000a      (1) a conceptualisation of the changing nature of the profession and its\u000a      impact on professional practice; (2) development of a qualitative\u000a      methodology to assess concepts of professional identity and knowledge in\u000a      this context; (3) design, development, evaluation and accreditation of\u000a      flexible entry routes into professional practice and (4) systematic\u000a      frameworks to assess and accredit work- based learning and mandatory\u000a      continuing professional development (CPD)schemes.\u000a    Research into the effects of operational convergence of information and\u000a      library services and the necessity for a hybrid model of practice [3.1]\u000a      resulted in the conceptualisation of 'blurring professional boundaries'\u000a      and the concomitant need to develop blended information professionals [3.2].\u000a      Previously rigid boundaries in relation to qualifications, professional\u000a      practice, career development and professional skills and knowledge have\u000a      become more diffuse and as a concept, have been identified as a key driver\u000a      for change in the profession. This together with the impact of\u000a      developments in information and communication technologies (ICT) is\u000a      transforming the information landscape across all sectors of practice,\u000a      including archives and records management, in addition to more mainstream\u000a      library and information services [3.3,3.4].\u000a    Working in conjunction with colleagues in professional practice,\u000a      including the British Library amongst others, a qualitative methodological\u000a      framework combining strong Structuration and social identity theories was\u000a      devised to determine the meaning of \"professionalism\" within the context\u000a      of the contemporary information profession, outlined in an award-winning\u000a      paper [3.5]. The development of more flexible entry routes into\u000a      professional practice is underpinned by research completed by\u000a      Broady-Preston and Preston [3.2], complemented by the design of\u000a      mandatory CPD schemes and frameworks for their evaluation. Professional\u000a      identity is a key driver of CPD; the requirement to maintain and develop\u000a      professional knowledge beyond initial qualification is considered by\u000a      commentators to be a key attribute of professionalism. Broady-Preston\u000a      participated in the design of the mandatory CPD scheme by the UK Chartered\u000a      Institute of library and Information Professionals (CILIP), subsequently\u000a      developing an evaluative framework to assess its relevance, amended, and\u000a      further refining this in 2010-11 via a collaborative research project with\u000a      Cossham, a New Zealand academic [6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42130","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    DIS's holistic research into managing digital assets is informing and\u000a      influencing information management practice and policy globally while\u000a      contributing to professional development.

At the same time, Crofts\u000d\u000a      became interested in how the location-aware affordances of mobile and\u000d\u000a      smart technologies might enable a new understanding of the particular\u000d\u000a      micro-contexts of cinema history at a specific location. She has explored\u000d\u000a      this through several location-based pervasive media practice projects.\u000d\u000a    The Curzon Memories App (Reference 4), which developed out of a\u000d\u000a      collaboration between Charlotte Crofts and Cathy Poole, Education Officer\u000d\u000a      at the Curzon Community Cinema, Clevedon, is a location-based tour of the\u000d\u000a      inside and outside of the cinema and the Curzon Collection of Cinema\u000d\u000a      Heritage Technology. The app uses GPS to automatically trigger oral\u000d\u000a      histories, dramatisations, rephotography and details of the outside\u000d\u000a      building. Inside, QR codes are hidden throughout the auditorium and\u000d\u000a      `Living History' museum exhibits.\u000d\u000a    The Projection Hero installation (Reference 3), which is on\u000d\u000a      permanent display at the Curzon, invites the user to think about the\u000d\u000a      normally invisible labour of projection which secures their viewing\u000d\u000a      pleasure, rendering the technological `apparatus' of cinema visible. The\u000d\u000a      installation provides an opportunity for the visitor to develop a new\u000d\u000a      understanding of the way film and exhibition technologies frame their\u000d\u000a      experience of cinema, and how this is changing in the digital age. The\u000d\u000a      installation comprises a miniature cinema which the visitor can control\u000d\u000a      with their smartphone, dimming the lights, opening the curtains and\u000d\u000a      playing the movies, all of which are interviews with retired\u000d\u000a      projectionists. Projection Hero situates the user in the role of\u000d\u000a      the projectionist, peering through projection booth windows and as such\u000d\u000a      invites an empathetic, haptic and experiential relation to the subject of\u000d\u000a      projection. Furthermore, the installation draws on the field of smart\u000d\u000a      networked objects, known as `The Internet of Things', to provide new\u000d\u000a      methods of interpretation &#8212; using QR Codes, Arduino circuits, sensors and\u000d\u000a      actuators to enable the visitor to operate the cinema from their own\u000d\u000a      personal mobile device.\u000d\u000a    Spatialising the Archive: Addressing the Problem of Scalable Heritage\u000d\u000a        Apps\u000d\u000a    Building on The Curzon Project, The City Strata Project\u000d\u000a      (Reference 5) was a knowledge exchange collaboration with creative economy\u000d\u000a      partner Calvium Ltd and Bristol City Council. The research sought to\u000d\u000a      address the problem of how to deal with data storage in large-scale\u000d\u000a      heritage apps across multiple points of interest, given the 50MB limit (in\u000d\u000a      the case of Android). The City Strata platform innovated by\u000d\u000a      drawing data from the cloud instead of storing it in the app. This was\u000d\u000a      piloted in the Cinemapping App Prototype, which pulls data from Know\u000a        Your Place (a geo-referenced GIS map containing the whole of\u000d\u000a      Bristol's historic environment record), drawing records from its Historic\u000d\u000a      Cinemas layer. The project also undertook research and development into\u000d\u000a      users uploading data from the app directly back into the database,\u000d\u000a      exploring crowd-sourcing archive information to feed into the\u000d\u000a      archaeological record used in future planning processes. Another outcome\u000d\u000a      of the research was The Lost Cinemas of Castle Park App (Reference\u000d\u000a      6) which uses GPS triggered audio to bring to life over 100 years of\u000d\u000a      cinema-going in Bristol City Centre.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42553","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    4.1 Knowledge exchange with start-ups and designers\u000d\u000a    The research above underpins the formation of active knowledge exchange\u000d\u000a      relationships with\u000d\u000a      micro businesses and start-ups in the digital media innovation sector\u000d\u000a      which has enabled them to\u000d\u000a      start up, develop their market profile, produce better media products and\u000d\u000a      services, and increase\u000d\u000a      their market share.

This has led to partnerships producing prototype\u000d\u000a      products and services that\u000d\u000a      enhance the product portfolio of Creative Economy businesses.

The Group was managed for the BBC by\u000d\u000a      Diversity and Communities Editor for the English Regions and reported to\u000d\u000a      the Chief Operating Officer, BBC (see T1 below).\u000d\u000a    Jones was appointed Chair of the News Group (2010-12), her research\u000d\u000a      directly influencing its work and the design of the Newshare pilot (see\u000d\u000a      below) (T1, T2, T3, T4). The BBC's Editor, English Regions, says Jones'\u000d\u000a      research informed the Group's `analysis of the problems and agendas for\u000d\u000a      the BBC in the context of increasing use of participatory digital media by\u000d\u000a      a wide range of semi-professionals and amateurs and the way the BBC could\u000d\u000a      build links with community media organisations rather than maintaining a\u000d\u000a      \"top down\" approach to newsgathering' (T1). The Chair of the Community\u000d\u000a      Media Association (CMA) states that Jones' `longstanding research into the\u000d\u000a      importance of the BBC adapting to new digital news platforms and the role\u000d\u000a      of user-generated content ensured that she identified priorities that were\u000d\u000a      cognisant with the needs of both the BBC and the dispersed network of\u000d\u000a      semi-professional and amateur local news content developers that the (CMA)\u000d\u000a      represents' (T3).\u000d\u000a    Jones led the Group to initiate: (i) sustainable models for local digital\u000d\u000a      news content origination and delivery; (ii) partnership and co-production\u000d\u000a      models to create a more permeable and diverse local news landscape,\u000d\u000a      involving citizen journalists; (iii) newsharing initiatives providing\u000d\u000a      access to BBC archive content; (iv) skills sharing and access to BBC\u000d\u000a      training provision (T1, T2, T3). Gibbons confirms that these priorities\u000d\u000a      flowed from the argument made in her research that partnerships would\u000d\u000a      strengthen the content of both parties (T3). The BBC's Editor, English\u000d\u000a      Regions, says Jones was `influential in the Group identifying\u000d\u000a      co-production and partnership models as a key to harnessing locally\u000d\u000a      relevant news content' (T1, T2). The Group designed the Bristol Newshare\u000d\u000a      pilot (June 2011-April 2012) to test these initiatives (T1).The pilot was\u000d\u000a      the first experiment of its kind in the UK and was used as a model for\u000d\u000a      similar experiments in other UK regions (Norfolk, Luton and Northampton)\u000d\u000a      (T1, D4).\u000d\u000a    Key Outcomes from the work of the Group and the Newshare pilot\u000d\u000a        include:\u000d\u000a    1. A pioneering system of co-production embodied in the partnership\u000d\u000a        between BBC and community media radio stations Ujima and BCFN:\u000d\u000a        supporting a burgeoning community of semi-professional and amateur news\u000d\u000a        producers; engaging local and hyper local news sources; and opening up\u000d\u000a        the news agenda to voices outside the mainstream via voluntary sector\u000d\u000a        journalists (T2).\u000d\u000a      2. A multilateral, multiplatform local news archive sharing system\u000d\u000a        between the BBC and local not-for-profit news providers who were\u000d\u000a        signatories to the CMA's Memorandum of Understanding 2009, to strengthen\u000d\u000a        both sectors' content (T2). This resulted in local stories grounded more\u000d\u000a        firmly in local knowledge, reflecting a more representative range of\u000d\u000a        community interest groups through neighbourhood partnerships (D5) and\u000d\u000a        adding to the richness of news content.\u000d\u000a      3. Skills sharing and volunteer training programmes design to enhance\u000d\u000a        local news reporting. The BBC's Editor, English Regions, confirms Jones\u000d\u000a        was influential in the Group's `consideration of innovative training\u000d\u000a        models to give community and amateur journalists insight into\u000d\u000a        professional newsroom standards' (T1). To this end, she commissioned a\u000d\u000a        research report by Senior Lecturer in Journalism at UWE Phil Chamberlain\u000d\u000a        to map the ecology of local news supply and training needs, and develop\u000d\u000a        methods for offering skills-based courses to deliver local news\u000d\u000a        training. Pilot `Taster Sessions' were conducted to test out models. His\u000d\u000a        report was submitted to the group in 2011 (D4).\u000d\u000a      4. The Group's key strategic finding was that local news initiatives\u000d\u000a        should be embedded in a wider `cultural ecology', `harnessing the input\u000d\u000a        of key talent incubators in Bristol' (T2). The Chair of Bristol Media, a\u000d\u000a        member of the News Group and part of the BBC Anchor Collaboration in\u000d\u000a        Phases 1 and 2, confirms Jones' key role in briefing the Group in this\u000d\u000a        regard: `conducting research on models for TV delivery of digital news\u000d\u000a        content &#8212; extending her published research on the role of PSBs in\u000d\u000a        collaborating with community media networks' (T2). This finding informed\u000d\u000a        the design of Phase 2 of the Anchor Collaboration (signed for\u000d\u000a        2014-2017), as a further step in diversifying Bristol's news media\u000d\u000a        ecology (T2).\u000d\u000a     Benefits to Stakeholders\u000d\u000a    The Bristol Newshare pilot offered an opportunity for Jones to test out\u000d\u000a      her arguments that the BBC should identify ways of moving from a PSB to a\u000d\u000a      model of Public Service Communication, and examine the viability of\u000d\u000a      solutions she identified in a real situation. This provided a model for\u000d\u000a      BBC local news partnerships across the UK and tested measures to create\u000d\u000a      (i) a sustainable news ecology with (ii) greater diversity of voices,\u000d\u000a      which (iii) strengthened local content, (iv) leading to a change in\u000d\u000a      thinking in the BBC and Bristol's media networks which will inform change\u000d\u000a      in the future.\u000d\u000a    BBC: Public Service Communication\u000d\u000a    1. The Groups designed and tested initiatives to create a\u000d\u000a        paradigm-shifting model of digital local news content curation and\u000d\u000a        delivery for PSBs (T1, T2). The `challenge of ...the digital revolution'\u000d\u000a        for the BBC is to distribute its resources effectively to meet its\u000d\u000a        Public Purpose Remits' (D1). These include `sustaining citizenship and\u000d\u000a        civil society', `stimulating creativity and excellence' and\u000d\u000a        `representing the UK, its nations, regions and communities' which\u000d\u000a        instructs the Trust to ensure that the BBC `reflects and strengthens\u000d\u000a        cultural identities through original content at local...level' and\u000d\u000a        `promotes awareness of different cultures and alternative viewpoints,\u000d\u000a        through content that reflects the lives of different people and\u000d\u000a        different communities within the UK' (D2, pp 3-4).\u000d\u000a      The 2006 Royal Charter adds that these should be achieved through\u000d\u000a        `helping to deliver to the public the benefit of emerging communications\u000d\u000a        technologies and services' (D3, p3). Principal benefits identified by\u000d\u000a        the BBC's Editor, English Regions, in this regard were: (i) expanding\u000d\u000a        the range of communities of interest represented in order to address\u000d\u000a        diversity in content and users addressed; (ii) challenging orthodox news\u000d\u000a        agendas by expanding the pool of contributors to BBC news; and (iii)\u000d\u000a        extending the Corporation's reach and increasing licence fee payers'\u000d\u000a        access to the BBC as listeners, through the provision of more locally\u000d\u000a        grounded relevant, accurate and culturally attuned content (T1). The\u000d\u000a        Editor confirms the testing of models `allowed us to reconceive of our\u000d\u000a        relationship with community news media groups, and to consider our role\u000d\u000a        as curators of local content, originated by small entrepreneurial\u000d\u000a        companies, semi-professionals and amateurs (T1).\u000d\u000a      2. Significant commercial impact flows from the Group's demonstration of\u000d\u000a        the viability of partnership models. The BBC, as part of its licence fee\u000d\u000a        arrangement, is required to contribute &#163;25 million towards the\u000d\u000a        development costs of the new Local Media Companies in the UK. Some, if\u000d\u000a        not all, of this contribution will be `in kind'. Their Editor confirms\u000d\u000a        the Group's testing of this partnership, co-production and training\u000d\u000a        model `contributed to the BBC's thinking as we consider how to channel\u000d\u000a        our resources to support the development of a new generation of local\u000d\u000a        media companies and to create new newsroom practices for\u000d\u000a        digitally-enabled news-share environments' (T1).\u000d\u000a     Wider Industry Benefit: Supporting the Sustainability of the Local\u000d\u000a        News Sector\u000d\u000a    1. A key benefit was training opportunities as BBC offered community\u000d\u000a        media companies insights into professional content-development practices\u000d\u000a        and access to training resources for volunteer news producers (T1). This\u000d\u000a        included on-the-job skills development with amateurs working alongside\u000d\u000a        BBC personnel and access to BBC training resources, e.g. 40 Bristol\u000d\u000a        volunteers attended a day of BBC Bristol Training Workshops (T3). As\u000d\u000a        Chair, Jones brokered these arrangements (D4).\u000d\u000a      2. Further industry benefit derived from community radio stations\u000d\u000a        exploiting BBC archive content during this period for their broadcasts.\u000d\u000a        The Chair of Bristol Media confirms this led to BCFN and Ujima radio\u000d\u000a        stations strengthening their brand and achieving a higher profile, while\u000d\u000a        Bristol's media sector's commitment to audio as a medium for news\u000d\u000a        delivery was also strengthened (T2).\u000d\u000a      3. Stakeholders have a clearer view of the conditions for, and obstacles\u000d\u000a        to, effective partnerships and the best conditions and mechanisms for\u000d\u000a        creating change' and working together towards industry innovation\u000d\u000a        benefits (T2, T3). A direct outcome in this respect was a rewrite of the\u000d\u000a        BBCs 2009 Memorandum of Understanding defining the partnership between\u000d\u000a        the BBC and the Community Media Association (CMA) (February 2013,\u000d\u000a        awaiting BBC signature) (T2, T3). This business intelligence will inform\u000d\u000a        future rollout (T2, T3).\u000d\u000a      4. The News Group enabled a conversation between a disparate group of key\u000d\u000a        stakeholders from PSB to community-based and open-source media (T2, T4).\u000d\u000a        Jones `created a vibrant and energised group...to respond to the\u000d\u000a        challenges of news provision in the digital age' (T4). Bristol Media's\u000d\u000a        Chair confirms that this `has continued to influence the development of\u000d\u000a        Bristol as a media city' (T2).\u000d\u000a     Public Life and Community Benefit: Diversity and Community Relevance\u000d\u000a     1. Public and community benefit is created by enabling new kinds of\u000d\u000a        content with local relevance and authenticity and the inclusion of a\u000d\u000a        wider range of voices, to revitalise public culture. CMA's Chair says\u000d\u000a        this was a key interest for CMA and `was achieved through the BBC\u000d\u000a        working with a wide range of volunteer reporters, and its involvement of\u000d\u000a        BCFN as a partner' (T3). He sees this as a change flowing from Jones'\u000d\u000a        leadership (T2). The BBC's Editor confirms Jones' commitment to these\u000d\u000a        objectives (T1). Bristol Media's Chair agrees: `(Jones') research has\u000d\u000a        impacted upon the strategic input of stakeholder groups in Bristol's\u000d\u000a        media sector, and informed future debate on the news culture of Bristol\u000d\u000a        as a media city, and the BBC within this ecology, ensuring local digital\u000d\u000a        news provision is sustainable and reflects a diverse community of\u000d\u000a        voices' (T2).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    UWE research insights into a sustainable future for local digital news\u000d\u000a      and the democratic deficit of declining local news coverage focused on the\u000d\u000a      need for Public Service Broadcasters (PSBs, here the BBC) to support the\u000d\u000a      input of semi-professional and amateur news producers by creating\u000d\u000a      partnerships and developing co-production and training models between BBC\u000d\u000a      and community news media. These informed UWE leadership of the Bristol-BBC\u000d\u000a      Anchor Local News and Journalism Group which tested out ways of creating\u000d\u000a      change in Bristol's media ecology: brokering partnerships between the BBC\u000d\u000a      and community media companies and networks; devising co-production\u000d\u000a      practices between PSB\/voluntary sector journalists as a way of opening up\u000d\u000a      the news agenda to voices outside the mainstream; testing out practices\u000d\u000a      for skills sharing and training. Through its influence on the design of\u000d\u000a      the Newshare pilot, UWE research findings created benefits: for the BBC in\u000d\u000a      meeting its Public Purpose remits; enhancing the sustainability and\u000d\u000a      diversity of Bristol's media ecology by providing co-production and\u000d\u000a      training initiatives and business intelligence; and for the public by\u000d\u000a      strengthening relevance and diversity in local news content.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of the West of England (UWE), Bristol\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"West of England, Bristol (University of the)","InstitutionName":"University of the West of England, Bristol","PeerGroup":"D","Region":"South West","UKPRN":10007164}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"6167865","Name":"Toronto"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000aR1: Jones, J.

She argued this has resulted in a democratic\u000d\u000a      deficit. In light of a contraction in local newsgathering, she\u000d\u000a      investigated new practices based on the affordances of `prod-user'\u000d\u000a      (user-led) content creation as part of Web 2.0 news media, such as viable\u000d\u000a      grassroots digital business models, networks and collaborations (R1, R2,\u000d\u000a      R3, R4).\u000d\u000a    Jones argued that in the light of the shrinking of the local broadcast\u000d\u000a      news sector, there was an over-dominant supply of state-sponsored news,\u000d\u000a      leaving the BBC exposed as an over-dominant player and impeding\u000d\u000a      deliberative democracy in the limitation of diverse voices. A perception\u000d\u000a      that local news services were no longer located within and did not\u000d\u000a      adequately reflect their communities has led to a trend towards\u000d\u000a      `hyper-localness' in UK. PSBs worldwide are seeking to legitimise and\u000d\u000a      renew their services in the light of significant digital, economic and\u000d\u000a      cultural challenges (R1, R4, D1 P9 Para2). Jones addresses the\u000d\u000a      recommendation of the review of the BBC's Charter in 2005 that it should\u000d\u000a      engage with a broader section of the population for its present funding\u000d\u000a      regime to continue after the 2016 charter review, arguing that the BBC has\u000d\u000a      continued to marginalise citizen content as a superficial extension to\u000d\u000a      top-down coverage (R3). She argued that the success of the BBC in meeting\u000d\u000a      the primary recommendation of the Department of Culture Media and Sport\u000d\u000a      (DCMS) review of the BBC's Charter in 2005, to gain legitimacy by engaging\u000d\u000a      with a broader section of the population, would rest on it supporting the\u000d\u000a      development of community media training initiatives and acting as curator\u000d\u000a      to the content of citizen journalists and consumers (R1, R4).\u000d\u000a    Jones also identified important shifts in recent journalism practice\u000d\u000a      contending that the rapid expansion of digital technologies has challenged\u000d\u000a      the normative culture of the newsroom (R4). Although large corporate\u000d\u000a      producers attempted to revive the industry, innovations were brought about\u000d\u000a      by `digital natives' developing new modes of grass roots journalism (R4).\u000d\u000a      In its response to digital innovation, the BBC struggled to embrace\u000d\u000a      external voices and create a genuine interactive and participatory culture\u000d\u000a      while retaining authority and credibility (R3). To stay relevant, BBC\u000d\u000a      journalists need to change their cultural outlook and take on a\u000d\u000a      curatorial, co-creative role (R1, R4). Professionals and amateurs could\u000d\u000a      work together on local news using new alignments of productive power and\u000d\u000a      distributive capacity to foster `enhanced localness'. A complementary news\u000d\u000a      ecology could bring new models of digital journalism to flourish on a\u000d\u000a      civic and commercial basis (R4).\u000d\u000a    These insights led Jones to identify to a shift from a model of Public\u000d\u000a      Service Broadcasting, to Public Service Communication (R1)\u000d\u000a      as the key to industry revival and local relevance, prefiguring the BBC\u000d\u000a      Anchor Group Newshare project. BBC partnerships with local community news\u000d\u000a      producers, and professionals with amateurs, would foster a participatory\u000d\u000a      culture and achieve a new kind of authority and credibility through the\u000d\u000a      expansion of the plurality of voices informing news content, and its\u000d\u000a      support for professional skills development in the community news sector\u000d\u000a      (R2, R4).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42609","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"719819","Name":"Hungary"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aSince 1998 Dowd has developed a distinctive body of research notable for its ability to reach\u000d\u000abeyond traditional disciplinary boundaries. The variety embodied in Dowd's scholarly interventions\u000d\u000ahas been mirrored in the breadth of settings and institutions (outside academia) where those works\u000d\u000ahave been re-voiced, adopted and adapted. The evidence base for this claim derives from the\u000d\u000anumber of responses to the research in popular publications such as magazines; in newspapers\u000d\u000aand invitations to contribute to public presentations and publications outside academia; in online\u000d\u000amedia such as blogs and in programming notes for film screenings.\u000d\u000aConsidering the strand of his research that overlaps with visual cultures, Dowd's research has had\u000d\u000aimpact in the area of the visual arts (broadly understood) beyond HEIs. The path to this impact\u000d\u000aderives from the basis of his reputation for innovation and research not confined to a strictly\u000d\u000ademarcated discipline (Dowd 2003, 2006, and 2007). He has been invited to speak at events co-\u000d\u000ahosted by Tate Modern (150 delegates), at The David Roberts Art Foundation, and to introduce\u000d\u000afilm screenings at the Different Directions Film Festival in Galway, Ireland. He was invited to write a\u000d\u000acatalogue essay (published in English, Italian and Hungarian) for the artist selected to represent\u000d\u000aHungary at the 2005 Venice Biennale &#8212; B&#225;l&#225;zs Kisciny &#8212; and has written a short text published in\u000d\u000aSpanish on the work of his colleague Luciano Zubillaga (also submitting in this UOA).4 He has\u000d\u000acontributed to the reception of the work of these artists and through his engagement with cultural\u000d\u000ainstitutions and discourses concerning the visual and audio-visual arts beyond academia his work\u000d\u000ahas contributed to cultural enrichment.\u000d\u000aThe influence of his 2006 edited collection Genre Matters (Dowd 2006) is registered in curricula in\u000d\u000athe census period and led to Dowd being invited to act in a consultancy capacity and subsequently\u000d\u000ato perform the role of project partner on the successful AHRC-funded Genre Studies Network led\u000d\u000aby the University of Birmingham (2012-13). The pathway to impact claimed here is that through the\u000d\u000aunderpinning research an impact was ultimately achieved in the shape of engagement with\u000d\u000aindividuals located outside academia. The audience for the sessions reached significantly beyond\u000d\u000athe academic community to include delegates and participants for a variety of professional fields\u000d\u000aincluding art, journalism, librarianship, film archiving and professional translation.\u000d\u000aDowd's research in the field of literary studies has achieved impact in similar ways to his work in\u000d\u000afilm and visual culture. The pathway to impact claimed in respect of his research in the field of\u000d\u000aliterature is that on the basis of the underpinning research conducted by Dowd on the work of\u000d\u000aBeckett his work is now widely cited in undergraduate and postgraduate curricula. Thus his work\u000d\u000ahas led to the shaping and framing of debate within the field .as it is manifest in curricula. The\u000d\u000asame underpinning research has led to a direct impact on a significant constituency outside\u000d\u000aacademia.\u000d\u000aDowd's research into the work of the renowned literary author Samuel Beckett (1906-1989) is\u000d\u000aappreciated as having been of significant influence in establishing new links between the\u000d\u000aphilosophy of Gilles Deleuze and Beckett (Dowd 2007) and for consolidating the perception of the\u000d\u000aviability of applications of so-called Theory (deriving from post-war European philosophy) to\u000d\u000aliterature in the wake of the so-called `empirical turn' which has been felt in general in the area of\u000d\u000aModernism Studies with which the work of Beckett now tends to be grouped (following distinct\u000d\u000amodels of classification in preceding decades). This influential work has translated into discernible\u000d\u000aimpacts. His work is frequently a primary resource in undergraduate and postgraduate (MA)\u000d\u000areading lists. His published methodological debate with Matthew Feldman (Dowd 2008) &#8212; widely\u000d\u000aregarded as one of the most significant empirical scholars of Beckett &#8212; for example has been\u000d\u000aextensively used in undergraduate and postgraduate courses exploring contending methodological\u000d\u000aperspectives in the field. Dowd's standing in the sub-field of Deleuzian Beckett Studies was\u000d\u000aacknowledged when he was invited to participate in the Inaugural Samuel Beckett Summer School\u000d\u000aat Trinity College Dublin in July 2011. The first summer school was themed `Beckett and Deleuze'.\u000d\u000aDowd was responsible both for the week-long seminar core series on Beckett and Deleuze and for\u000d\u000aa keynote lecture. Notably, there were 80 delegates with more than half of the participants coming\u000d\u000afrom outside the University sector.\u000d\u000aDuring this period Dowd has published book reviews in the independent, collectively run journal\u000d\u000aRadical Philosophy and film that has a significant number of non-academic subscribers and in the\u000d\u000atrade magazines Film West (prior to the census period5) and Film Ireland.\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aThe nature of the impact described in this case study is twofold. First the case study evidences the\u000d\u000aimpact Dowd's research has had on learning and teaching in other Higher Education Institutions.\u000d\u000aThe evidence for this lies in the use of Dowd's publications by educators on University courses in\u000d\u000athe UK, the US, Australia and elsewhere. Impact of books and articles published in the period\u000d\u000a1998-2013 which are used in syllabi at other HEIs is evidenced by their inclusion in course\u000d\u000adocuments published by those institutions during the census period for REF2014.

The book's methodological framework was derived from immersion in film criticism of the\u000d\u000a1980s as this was carried out in the influential film journal Cahiers du cin&#233;ma, combined with an\u000d\u000aexperiment in the application of theories developed in the French philosopher Gilles Deleuze's two-\u000d\u000avolume work on cinema.

Following a paper at the annual Film-Philosophy\u000d\u000aconference in 2009, he was invited to contribute (on the basis of the underpinning research) to\u000d\u000awhat was to become a popular and high-selling volume widely used in undergraduate curricula.1 In\u000d\u000athree subsequent articles included in REF Section 2, Dowd explores the intertwining legacies of\u000d\u000afilm practice (Rivette in Dowd 2010, and another article not cited in the underpinning research due\u000d\u000ato restrictions of space2), film criticism (Daney, in Dowd 2010) and film-philosophy (Deleuze in both\u000d\u000aDowd 2009 and 2010).\u000d\u000aThe research which culminated in the publication of his book Abstract Machines: Samuel Beckett\u000d\u000aand Philosophy after Deleuze and Guattari (Dowd 2007) began with the publication of essays in\u000d\u000aThe Journal of Beckett Studies in 1998 and continued over the following 5 years. From 1998 to\u000d\u000a2001 Dowd was a lecturer in English Literature but also taught in the field of Film Studies.

The process of research into methods and means by which to explore the themes of his\u000d\u000awork led to exploration of archival sources, cultural capital (in the shape of the work of the\u000d\u000acomposer Luis Zubillaga; the lost Venezuelan film El Huerco), and locations resonant (for example\u000d\u000athe Centro Cultural de la Memoria Haroldo Conti and the Ente Espacio Memoria y Derechos\u000d\u000aHumanos in Buenos Aires in the film Cosas por Venir1) of the political and cultural memory\u000d\u000atargeted by Zubillaga. The research processes resulted in multiple methods of dissemination and\u000d\u000aimpact. For example, one of the research methods adopted by Zubillaga derives from his\u000d\u000aconsideration of himself primarily as an artist. The specificity of the intended output (film) did not\u000d\u000apreclude the artist framing and staging his work in sections, and in formats which allowed for a\u000d\u000afragmentation and multiplication of modes of engagement by the audience (the latter being linked\u000d\u000ato Zubillaga's interest in a form of historiography marked by plurality). This he has done in the\u000d\u000ashape of gallery installations and exhibitions. In so doing he extended the range of engagement\u000d\u000awith his audiovisual work beyond the film festival context and into the realm of the gallery. This has\u000d\u000abeen true for the majority of his film outputs.\u000d\u000aDowd's research into theories of cinema has contributed also, in a material way, to generate\u000d\u000aimpact. As part of the research process, during the development of both Music for a Missing Film\u000d\u000aand Cosas por Venir, Dowd engaged with Zubillaga concerning narrative and the conceptual\u000d\u000avocabulary used in the voiceovers for each film. He has also published a text about Music for a\u000d\u000aMissing Film (cited in the 300 word statements on Zubillaga's work and included in the portfolio\u000d\u000aaccompanying Zubillaga's submission).\u000d\u000aSeveral constituencies have been affected by the work, and those constituencies are diverse. The\u000d\u000aLatin American audiences who benefitted from exposure to Music for a Missing Film at its three\u000d\u000afestival screenings in South America were a cine-literate group engaged by a recognisable\u000d\u000atestamentary strand in Latin American culture. The worldwide beneficiaries of the film through its\u000d\u000aDVD distribution and other public screenings are numbered at in excess of 4,000. The impact of\u000d\u000aCosas por Venir is in its early stages, but nonetheless can be measured via the engagement of\u000d\u000aaudiences through gallery and theatre exhibition (at the IMT Gallery in London, the Buenos Aires\u000d\u000aMuseum of Modern Art) and debate (as took place following the screening of parts of Cosas por\u000d\u000aVenir at the Theater Vierte Welt in Berlin).

He brings to the discipline of filmmaking a level of intellectual enquiry informed by\u000d\u000athese interests. His research outputs as a filmmaker can be broadly identified as possessing a film\u000d\u000aessay dimension &#8212; a widely recognised style or genre of socially engaged filmmaking. As an artist\u000d\u000awith an identity forged between Venezuelan and Argentinian contexts, but as a resident of the UK\u000d\u000aduring the period of impact, Zubillaga could also be classified as an `accented' filmmaker as\u000d\u000adefined by the film theorist Hamid Naficy (Accented Cinema, Princeton UP 2002).

The archival research has in\u000d\u000aturn led him to the excavation of meanings in lost or peripheral cultural outputs. Through these acts\u000d\u000aof restoration and reframing, Zubillaga's work amounts to the performative and material\u000d\u000areimagining of, on the one hand, the suppressed avant-garde movements of Latin America, and on\u000d\u000athe other, a critical exploration and interrogation of the legacy of the right wing dictatorships of\u000d\u000aVenezuela and Argentina which decimated the utopian hopes of the avant-garde.

Game studies and digital textualities Newman's work on\u000a      game studies has been key in focusing attention on games as complex\u000a      digital objects. In 2006, he was invited to collaborate with A-Level Media\u000a      Studies tutors and the former Principal Examiner for A-Level Media Studies\u000a      on the first textbook on videogames for post-16 media studies.\u000a      Subsequently, Newman was invited to act as an advisor on the DfES\u000a      Nottingham eGames project and is currently working on developing materials\u000a      on videogames and digital literacies for Key Stage 3 in association with\u000a      the GameCity team and Autodesk.\u000a    Newman's expertise in game music and digital audio have led to\u000a      invitations to chair public events on writing and producing interactive\u000a      game music (e.g. `Ear Candy' public lecture event Barbican, May 2011,\u000a      audience approx. 100) interviews (e.g. New Statesman 2011 on the\u000a      cultural impact of videogame music); features (e.g. 360 magazine\u000a      on game audio); and gallery guides (e.g. on game music technology for the\u000a      National Centre for Craft and Design's 2013 book accompanying the 2013-14\u000a      `Revolution in the Bedroom, War in the Playground' exhibition).\u000a    Newman has been part of the GameCity festival's steering group since its\u000a      inception and continues to work closely with the Director and team\u000a      programming events and strands, as well as convening and presenting\u000a      sessions on aspects of game studies, design and history for the festival's\u000a      general public audience (attendance over 45,000 in 2012).\u000a    2. Gameplay as socially-situated activity Newman's work on\u000a      gaming fan cultures was supported by Capability Funding throughout\u000a      2004-07. Among the deliverables of the project were a series of\u000a      industry-facing seminars that sought to establish and promote awareness of\u000a      amateur, grass-roots production. Consequently, Newman was commissioned by\u000a      Publisher Eidos to provide consultancy on strategies for engagement with\u000a      fans of its Championship Manager franchise. Newman was later invited to\u000a      provide consultancy for Sony Computer Entertainment Europe's PR agency,\u000a      and to speak about his published work on player subjectivities to JCPR and\u000a      Flamingo research as part of the development of the European PlayStation 2\u000a      launch strategy and the PlayStation `Mental Wealth' TV campaign.\u000a    Following a keynote presentation at the Games Marketing Forum (2007) and\u000a      public lecture at The National Archives (2009), Newman was invited by The\u000a      Wellcome Trust to chair a panel on gaming and science at Sheffield\u000a      Doc\/Fest (2009). Subsequently, Newman was commissioned by the Wellcome\u000a      Trust's Broadcast Team to provide a literature review and strategic\u000a      consultancy on ways of using videogames and gameplay to broaden the\u000a      Trust's public engagement with science agenda. The internal report was\u000a      delivered in 2010 and a series of presentations to the Trust's Broadcast\u000a      team drew explicitly on Newman's work.\u000a    Newman's work has led to interviews and media appearances (e.g. for The\u000a        Wall Street Journal on cultures of play and superplay) and\u000a      invitations to deliver public lectures (e.g. at the British Library and\u000a      The National Archives. Following these events, Newman was invited to\u000a      advise on the terms of reference for a Computer Games and Gaming Cultures\u000a      special collection of the British Library's UK Web Archive project (Paul\u000a      Whatley, project lead at the BL supplied Newman's 2011 IJDC article as the\u000a      `recommended reading' to participants prior to the first collections group\u000a      meeting). Newman sits on the Collections Board with colleagues from\u000a      museums, libraries and the UK videogames industry (and was interviewed in\u000a      The Independent, Feb 2012 on the collection's launch). As well as\u000a      interviews in the gaming press, Newman has made appearances on BBC Radio\u000a      4's Front Row discussing user-generated content in gaming, and the\u000a      influence of Nintendo's Super Mario series; BBC World Service on games\u000a      history, and BBC4 TV's 'Games Britannia' (first broadcast 2011) discussing\u000a      the emergence of videogames as a mainstream popular cultural form.\u000a    3. Media preservation In 2007 Newman was invited by the\u000a      curatorial team for New Media Collections at the National Media Museum to\u000a      advise on a possible special collection of videogames. Newman was\u000a      commissioned to conduct a feasibility study researching the extent of\u000a      current formal and grassroots videogame collecting activity across Europe\u000a      and the US. Newman was subsequently invited to join the team in\u000a      establishing the National Videogame Archive. The launch of the collection\u000a      was widely covered in the mainstream and specialist press in the UK,\u000a      Europe and US and Newman gave numerous print, online and radio interviews.\u000a      Working with the Curator of New Media and Head of Collections at the\u000a      National Media Museum, Newman co-authored the Special Acquisitions\u000a      Provisions for the collection. Approved by the Museum's Board of Trustees\u000a      in 2008, this document and its six collecting themes, draws explicitly on\u000a      Newman's work.\u000a    Through his work on the GameCity festival, Newman has programmed a series\u000a      of public-facing events highlighting the vulnerability of digital media to\u000a      obsolescence and media decay. He has convened and chaired public panel\u000a      sessions with scholars such as Henry Lowood of Stanford University and the\u000a      Preserving Virtual Worlds Project; Stella Wisdom, Digital Curator from the\u000a      British Library; as well as organising a series of 'Director's\u000a      Commentaries' events in which videogame developers critically reflect on\u000a      their professional practice. These events allow audiences to interrogate\u000a      game design practice and form part of the archival documentation for the\u000a      games held by the NVA. Newman was also commissioned by Guinness World\u000a      Records to write a feature on the history of videogames for the 2014\u000a      Guinness World Records Gamers Edition volume.\u000a    Throughout 2012-13, Newman embarked on a programme of public talks\u000a      supported by Electronic Arts and media partner Future Publishing. Held at\u000a      arts and cultural venues throughout the UK, including the BFI Southbank,\u000a      Liverpool FACT, Midlands Arts Centre, and Bristol Arnolfini (audiences\u000a      average 75-100), the events focused specifically on aspects of Newman's\u000a      work as set out in his 'Best Before' book. Positive feedback from\u000a      audiences and venues has led to a second national speaking tour and a\u000a      quarterly residency at the BFI Southbank to deliver public-facing events\u000a      on videogames (the 2012\/13 BFI events sold out in advance).\u000a    Following a keynote presentation on game preservation at the Japan\u000a      Foundation in London, Newman was invited to Kyoto in January 2013 by the\u000a      Ritsumeikan Game Research Center. Newman delivered a keynote presentation\u000a      on UK approaches to game preservation and, along with Henry Lowood of\u000a      Stanford University, was invited to consult with officials from the\u000a      Japanese Ministry for Cultural Affairs on strategies for establishing game\u000a      preservation projects.

Key to this work\u000a      is Newman's analysis of narrativist and ludological approaches to game\u000a      studies which synthesises these apparently competing methodologies; as\u000a      well as the detailed studies of game structure which offer theorisation of\u000a      'interactivity' through the interrelationship between 'play' and\u000a      'non-interactive play'; and the innovative analysis of the complexities of\u000a      gamers' dynamically shifting subject positions.\u000a    2. Gameplay as socially-situated activity (e.g. Refs 3 and\u000a      4: `Playing (with) Videogames' (2005); and 'Playing with Videogames'\u000a      (2008). Taking its lead from fan studies, Newman's research extends game\u000a      studies by exploring the practices of play and playfulness that are\u000a      typically elided in examinations of games as technology, rules or systems.\u000a      Newman's work on game cultures has been key in highlighting the shadow\u000a      economies of production in relation to practices of `modding', `cosplay'\u000a      and collecting that support and sustain gaming. In particular, Newman's\u000a      work on gameplay as `lived experience' and `configurative practice' has\u000a      provided rich case studies of the ways games are remade through\u000a      self-consciously resistant acts of play, superplay, and reverse\u000a      engineering. By problematising the object of study as a fluid, mutable set\u000a      of resources constituted through acts of play and performance, Newman's\u000a      work has foregrounded the shadow economies and cultures of videogame\u000a      fandom.\u000a    3. Game preservation (e.g. Refs 5 and 6: `(Not) playing\u000a      games' (2011); and 'Best Before: videogames, supersession and\u000a      obsolescence', 2012). Newman's work on digital media preservation\u000a      highlights the vulnerability of digital games and the need, and\u000a      complexity, of concerted strategies to archive, interpret and exhibit them\u000a      as part of cultural heritage. This work leads in the emerging field of\u000a      game studies by drawing scholars, curators and preservation practitioners'\u000a      attentions to the challenges of physical media and data decay; the effects\u000a      of the discursive production of technological obsolescence upon which the\u000a      global videogame industry's business practices are based; and the need for\u000a      a new approach to game preservation in which playability is reconcieved\u000a      not as the outcome but rather part of the object of preservation practice\u000a      (what Newman proposes as 'gameplay' vs 'game' preservation).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42672","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    1. Histories of drinking culture and policy in the UK\u000a      Nicholls' book The Politics of Alcohol received positive reviews,\u000a      including selection as a Choice\u000a      `Outstanding Academic Title' in 2010. Nicholls was invited to present key\u000a      findings from the book in\u000a      both oral (Evidence: 23rd April 2009) and written form to the\u000a      Health Select Committee in 2009. He\u000a      is cited in the final report of the committee, January 2010(1), which\u000a      contains an introductory\u000a      chapter dedicated to putting alcohol policy in historical context.\u000a      Nicholls' evidence on the impact of\u000a      policy on drinking culture was key to the Committee concluding that\u000a      Government had a clear\u000a      capacity to influence drinking behaviours. His contribution to the Alcohol\u000a      Focus Scotland expert\u000a      group on licensing provided historical support for the assertion that\u000a      drinking behaviours could be\u000a      influenced by policy. His evidence on the downturn in consumption in the\u000a      1930s and 1940s has\u000a      been used extensively by Alcohol Focus Scotland in their work with the\u000a      Scottish Government, and\u000a      Rethinking Alcohol Licensing has directly shaped proposed\u000a      amendments to Scottish licensing\u000a      legislation (2). The published version of his report to Alcohol Focus\u000a      Scotland is currently the only\u000a      single-article overview of Scottish licensing history available (3).\u000a    Nicholls' 2009 Knowledge Transfer Fellowship was designed to explore the\u000a      relevance of historical\u000a      knowledge to frontline alcohol service providers. Four day-long workshops\u000a      (Plymouth 14\/2\/11;\u000a      Bristol 28\/2\/11; Taunton 7\/3\/11; and Poole 17\/2\/11) brought together a\u000a      total of over 100\u000a      participants from across the South West of England, including senior NHS\u000a      commissioners, heads\u000a      of local authority licensing teams, police officers, service providers,\u000a      trade representatives and\u000a      academics. The final report of the project has been downloaded from the\u000a      South West Public\u000a      Health observatory over 500 times and is also available on the Public\u000a      Health England Alcohol\u000a      Learning Centre website. In addition to four day-long workshops, Nicholls\u000a      ran shorter workshops at\u000a      the Dartington Hall public health residential school in October 2009 and\u000a      September 2011, each\u000a      attended by around thirty senior health commissioners.\u000a    Nicholls' work on the history of alcohol has attracted widespread public\u000a      attention beyond policy\u000a      forums. He was commissioned to write an article which formed the cover\u000a      story for the January\u000a      2010 edition of History Today. His book provided a key source for\u000a      the 2010 Radio 4 ten-part series\u000a      Britain on the Bottle, for which Nicholls was also interviewed July\u000a      2010 (3). He has given public\u000a      lectures on alcohol history at the Wellcome Institute (20\/4\/12) and he has\u000a      discussed alcohol history\u000a      on Thinking Allowed (Radio 4) twice (19\/10\/09 and 6\/2\/12).\u000a    2. Alcohol and the media\u000a      Nicholls' research and publications on social media marketing and his\u000a      involvement in the early\u000a      stages (March 2011) of revisions for the fifth edition Portman\u000a        Group Code of Practice on Alcohol Standards\u000a      (November 2012) helped ensure that social media activity was captured by\u000a      the revised\u000a      regulations:\u000a    3. Alcohol licensing policy\u000a      Nicholls involvement in the Rethinking Alcohol Licensing project\u000a      with Alcohol Focus Scotland has\u000a      had a demonstrable and significant impact on Scottish licensing policy at\u000a      a national and local level.\u000a      The key recommendations from the report formed the basis of proposed\u000a      amendments to the 2005\u000a      Licensing Act which were released for consultation in 2012 (2). As part of\u000a      this and the follow-up\u000a      project `Licensing and Public Health: From Principles to Practice',\u000a      Nicholls established (June 2011)\u000a      a UK-wide stakeholder network on licensing and public health. This led\u000a      directly to the co-production\u000a      of a Local Government Association\/Alcohol Research UK guidance paper on\u000a      licensing\u000a      and public health which has been very widely accessed by local health\u000a      commissioners and\u000a      licensing teams in England and Wales (5). The network activities have\u000a      informed the work of the\u000a      Safe, Sociable London partnership including the development of a licensing\u000a      and public health\u000a      toolkit for all London authorities; they have also informed the activities\u000a      of two major alcohol\u000a      advocacy organisations: DrinkWise North West and Balance North East, both\u000a      of whom are strongly\u000a      supporting the development of links between health and licensing in their\u000a      regions. Nicholls has\u000a      spoken at events organised by both groups.\u000a    Nicholls was directly involved in discussions (July-September 2012) with\u000a      the Department of Health\u000a      prior to the launch (in November) of the consultation on the 2012 Alcohol\u000a      Strategy, specifically\u000a      regarding the role of public health in licensing practice. He took part in\u000a      two invited technical groups\u000a      (at the Department of Health and the Home Office) which guided Government\u000a      thinking on key\u000a      aspects of the Alcohol Strategy. He has had numerous meeting with alcohol\u000a      policy leads at the\u000a      Department of Health and Home Office outside of these forums and, and he\u000a      was also asked (July\u000a      2012) to provide a historical overview for an initial symposium on alcohol\u000a      harm chaired by the\u000a      Chief Medical Officer as part of her work towards revising national\u000a      guidelines on alcohol. Since\u000a      leaving Bath Spa University, Nicholls continues to contribute to the\u000a      development of national and\u000a      regional policy initiatives in his work at Alcohol Research UK.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study refers to research on British drinking cultures and\u000a      alcohol policy carried out by\u000a      James Nicholls, Reader in Media and Social Policy, Department of Film and\u000a      Media Production\/HCI\u000a      (2004-September 2012).

Nicholls wrote an invited commentary on the 2012 Government\u000a        Alcohol Strategy for\u000a        Drugs: Education, Prevention and Policy, as well as Alcohol\u000a        Research UK's formal response to the\u000a        Strategy consultation (7).\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42765","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Leveson Inquiry and media reform\u000a    To increase the impact of its work, the Spaces of the News team founded\u000a      the Coordinating Committee for Media Reform (CCMR), later renamed the\u000a      Media Reform Coalition (MRC), which consists of 30+ pressure groups and\u000a      numerous academics. Each section has an elected chair, all of whom are\u000a      members of the Spaces of News Research team, to campaign on a specific\u000a      issue. Fenton was asked to join Hacked Off's Board in July 2012 and later\u000a      became Vice-Chair.\u000a    The proposals for media reform developed from this research were adopted\u000a      by the TUC as policy, with the full endorsement of the NUJ and BECTU. Five\u000a      written submissions were made to Leveson, one requested by Leveson\u000a      himself, and Curran and Phillips each gave evidence to the Leveson\u000a      inquiry. The Leveson report refers to the work of the CCMR in volumes 1\u000a      and 4 [1]. It has been presented at meetings around the country\u000a      co-organized by the NUJ and associated pressure groups, and at a special\u000a      TUC conference and numerous other public meetings in London. In\u000a      association with NUJ and Hacked Off, fringe meetings were held along with\u000a      private dinners for MPs at all the party conferences in 2012 as well as a\u000a      fringe meeting at the TUC congress in the same year. MRC also organized a\u000a      public lecture by Baroness O'Neill on media regulation; a conference on\u000a      internet and the law with the NUJ; an Early Day Motion on the issues; two\u000a      well-attended public rallies addressed by politicians and civil society\u000a      representatives; plus a lobby of Parliament on the recommendations of the\u000a      Leveson report.\u000a    This work has brought the team into regular contact with many\u000a      parliamentarians. Fenton has presented the work of the MRC to Harriet\u000a      Harman, the Shadow Cabinet Minister for Culture Media and Sport, and\u000a      Fenton and Curran presented the work to the Shadow Minister Helen Goodman.\u000a      The work is feeding Labour policy on media ownership for the Party's next\u000a      election manifesto. Goodman used the research on local news for a speech\u000a      referring to Goldsmiths [2]. Harman referred to the research in a speech\u000a      she gave to the Westminster Media Forum [3].\u000a    The researchers took part in a stakeholder discussion at the DCMS\u000a      concerning amendments to the Crime and Courts Bill that affect online\u000a      journalists and small publishers. MRC held a public consultation and\u000a      recommended that cost benefits available to those who sign to any new\u000a      recognized self-regulatory body should be extended to small-scale news\u000a      bloggers, and that micro-businesses should be exempt from the Crime and\u000a      Courts Bill which defines penalties and exemplary damages for those who\u000a      refuse to join a regulator. The government adopted and enacted these\u000a      recommendations.\u000a    In her role as Vice-Chair of Hacked Off's Board, Fenton has played a\u000a      major role in trying to ensure that any media reform relating to press\u000a      regulation complies with the recommendations in the Leveson report and is\u000a      independent and effective. Unprecedented and historic progress has been\u000a      made towards the achievement of these objectives, and Hacked Off has been\u000a      instrumental in this. In March every party in parliament gave its backing\u000a      to a Royal Charter with underpinning legislation that will implement the\u000a      Leveson recommendations &#8212; providing for effective press self-regulation\u000a      that is independent both of government and of editors and proprietors. In\u000a      October 2013 this Royal Charter was sealed. In seven decades of\u000a      controversy on this issue no parliament has ever gone nearly so far (and\u000a      this without impinging in any way on freedom of expression).\u000a    Hacked Off drove this process, both in the public sphere by articulating\u000a      the case for Leveson implementation, mobilising and focusing opinion, and\u000a      in the political sphere by ensuring that key politicians understood the\u000a      issues, were aware of strong public feeling, and had the means and tools\u000a      to implement Leveson. Hacked Off lobbied, rebutted, drafted, persuaded,\u000a      analysed, reported, denounced, advocated, briefed, argued and manoeuvred\u000a      at a high level of intensity working closely throughout with victims of\u000a      press abuses and with other reform-minded groups. It also operated in the\u000a      teeth of relentless and often bitterly hostile resistance from leading\u000a      national newspaper groups, making Hacked Off the most successful media\u000a      campaign in history.\u000a    The state of news in the digital age\u000a    This research was cited extensively in the Parliamentary Select Committee\u000a      Report on Media Ownership in 2008, in the Ofcom report on the proposed\u000a      complete purchase of BSkyB by News Corporation, and in Ofcom's advice to\u000a      the Secretary of State for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport [4]. It\u000a      contributed to NUJ strategy, and the NUJ's then General Secretary, Jeremy\u000a      Dear, quoted it in a speech to the European Parliament [5]. The Chartered\u000a      Institute of Journalists has also used the work in its lobbying [6].\u000a    Fenton and Freedman have held regular meetings on the state of the news\u000a      in the digital age with key personnel at Ofcom and DCMS. The work has also\u000a      informed news organisations' own internal reviews and discussions. This\u000a      has involved engagement with prominent journalists from the Guardian and\u000a      Radio 4, as well as ITN's own research into the future of news. The\u000a      Principal of ITN Consulting commented that the meeting held between Fenton\u000a      and himself was `extremely useful' [7].\u000a    Local media and citizen journalism\u000a    This research led to the launch of the Media Trust's Newsnet, an online\u000a      project giving people the unique opportunity to connect, share and learn\u000a      to tell their local story. Newsnet is a UK-wide community of citizen\u000a      journalists, community reporters and local storytellers, which gives them\u000a      the tools, skills and connections to get more from their local news. The\u000a      marketing director of Media Trust has said that `if Goldsmiths hadn't\u000a      identified citizen journalism as having such potential, we may never have\u000a      taken this approach' [8].\u000a    The work also triggered the development of the East London Lines, a\u000a      successful local news website run out of the department.[9]\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research by members of the Department of Media and Communications on news\u000a      and journalism in the digital age has been critical in three main areas of\u000a      impact.

The project investigated\u000a      the nature of news in the digital age, exploring the changing dynamics of\u000a      news production through 170 interviews with news media professionals,\u000a      mini-ethnographies in three news production sites and a qualitative\u000a      analysis of online news content.\u000a    The research challenges utopian visions of the internet as a brave new\u000a      world with everyone connected to everyone else. `New' media have not\u000a      expanded the news that we read or hear, or changed mainstream news values\u000a      and formats; neither have they connected a legion of bloggers to a mass\u000a      audience. Instead, professional journalism suffers as the economic model\u000a      for traditional news production falls apart in the digital age. There is\u000a      pressure in the newsroom to fill more space at greater speed, with fewer\u000a      journalists in permanent positions and more job insecurity. Journalists\u000a      are thrust into forms of news production which are more akin to creative\u000a      cannibalisation than the craft of journalism. While having improved access\u000a      to stories and sources online, they talk less to their sources and are\u000a      captured in desk-bound, cut-and-paste journalism. Ready-made fodder from\u000a      tried and tested sources takes precedence over the sheer difficulty of\u000a      dealing with the mass of user generated content or the overload of online\u000a      information. This leads to the homogenisation of content as\u000a      ever-increasing commercial pressures add to the temptation to rely not\u000a      just on news agencies but also on all cheaper forms of news gathering.\u000a    Follow-up work, supported by Carnegie, considered the role of civil\u000a      society in news media, in the context of the recommendation (now\u000a      abandoned) for Independently Funded News Consortia. It revealed that Civil\u000a      Society Associations can play a key role in the extended news environment\u000a      of the digital age. They can act as wardens of and contributors to news\u000a      media; facilitate deliberation; expand the diversity of views on existing\u000a      news platforms; and even develop news platforms of their own.\u000a    Additional work supported by the Media Trust explored the news needs of\u000a      local communities via four in-depth case studies, including a study of\u000a      community news outlets and their relationship with mainstream news media.\u000a      The methodology involved interviews with key news providers and\u000a      protagonists, community focus groups, and interviews with news policy\u000a      leaders. The research supports the link between local news and democracy\u000a      by interrogating how it functions and what is required for it to thrive.\u000a      It also considers in detail the demand side of news. What do people want\u000a      from their local news and why does it matter to them? It then puts these\u000a      into an economic, regulatory and technological context in order to\u000a      understand the changes that are taking place. This research offers a\u000a      direct response to the current crisis in local news, with concrete\u000a      suggestions on how to deliver an independent local news service that meets\u000a      the needs of local communities.\u000a    Most recently, funding from the OSF and the Andrew Wainwright Reform\u000a      Trust has enabled us to set up the Coordinating Committee for Media Reform\u000a      with the explicit task of seeking to impact upon the Leveson Inquiry, the\u000a      Communications Review and the subsequent white paper on the basis of our\u000a      research in this field to date.\u000a    Research outputs underpinning the wider public impact have included\u000a      numerous books from prestigious publishers [2-4], as well as 14\u000a      peer-reviewed journal papers and chapters (e.g. Journalism Studies;\u000a        International Journal of Press\/Politics; Journalism Practice; European\u000a        Journal of Communications; Convergence; Global Media and Communication)\u000a      [examples at 5-6], 60 conference papers and 5 submissions to government\u000a      consultations [example at 7].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42767","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Through his research, writings, websites (www.commercialwatch.co.uk;\u000d\u000a      www.cpbf.org.uk) and policy\u000d\u000a      submissions, Hardy is recognised as a leading authority and critic of\u000d\u000a      product placement and related media-advertising integration.

At his invited meeting in April 2012 with Helen Goodman MP, Shadow\u000d\u000a      Minister of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Hardy discussed\u000d\u000a      proposals&#8212;supported by his research&#8212;that would establish ownership caps on\u000d\u000a      media entities and impose public service obligations on large media\u000d\u000a      organisations operating below that cap. These proposals have subsequently\u000d\u000a      influenced the development of policies on media ownership within the\u000d\u000a      Labour Party [c] and media reform networks. As the Director of the\u000d\u000a      Goldsmiths Leverhulme Media Research Centre notes, Hardy's research on\u000d\u000a      media ownership regulation `has greatly influenced policy debate. He has\u000d\u000a      confronted the failure of past media monopoly regulation, and come up with\u000d\u000a      a solution...This approach has been enormously influential on civil\u000d\u000a      society organisations &#8212; shaping the policy of the Campaign for Press and\u000d\u000a      Broadcasting Freedom, Media Reform Coalition, and TUC, among other\u000d\u000a      organisations. I hope it is not a breach of confidence to say that the\u000d\u000a      Hardy approach (though it was not formally identified as such) was on the\u000d\u000a      agenda of a meeting convened by a shadow cabinet minister to discuss the\u000d\u000a      future policy of the Labour Party in this area, during the summer [of\u000d\u000a      2013] and continues to be in the frame' [g].\u000d\u000a    The same proposals have also influenced the development of policies on\u000d\u000a      media ownership for the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), especially\u000d\u000a      via CPBF analysis of the UK media and proposals for regulatory reform.\u000d\u000a      Discussing Hardy's contribution, the Union's Senior Campaigns and\u000d\u000a      Communications Officer attests: `Jonathan Hardy's research on\u000d\u000a      communications policies and media regulation has been beneficial in\u000d\u000a      informing the work of the NUJ. He has been invited to contribute to NUJ\u000d\u000a      submissions to government and other consultations. Submissions he has\u000d\u000a      written for the CPBF have also been influential and helpful to the NUJ in\u000d\u000a      the preparation of its own submissions or comments on regulatory issues.\u000d\u000a      In particular, his research and proposals on reforming media ownership\u000d\u000a      regulation have had an important impact on the formulation of NUJ policies\u000d\u000a      in this area. The NUJ has benefited from Dr Hardy's research on\u000d\u000a      communications law and policy, media concentration and media issues in\u000d\u000a      developing its policies and in providing evidence-based recommendations on\u000d\u000a      regulation to parliament, government and regulators. The NUJ has also\u000d\u000a      benefited from research informing articles and other communications with\u000d\u000a      our members on media regulation issues and in building support and\u000d\u000a      awareness of media reform agendas' [h].\u000d\u000a    In April 2012, policies on media plurality and reform of the public\u000d\u000a        interest test were adopted by the Trades Union Congress Executive\u000d\u000a        Committee. The Committee's Head of Secretariat has recognised the\u000d\u000a      `important contribution' of Hardy's media ownership regulation research to\u000d\u000a      this. In particular, he cites the influence of Hardy's proposals for a 15%\u000d\u000a      public interest threshold and 30% market cap, as well as public interest\u000d\u000a      obligations on large media groups, on the Committee's approach to tackling\u000d\u000a      media concentration. Thus, he explicitly acknowledged that Hardy's work on\u000d\u000a      media concentration and the public interest `has informed the policies\u000d\u000a      adopted by the TUC Executive in April 2012. The policy document Media\u000d\u000a      Ownership and Regulation, endorsed by the TUC executive, includes a\u000d\u000a      summary of the CPBF proposals on media ownership and control, which\u000d\u000a      Jonathan developed, and quotes from a CPBF document he wrote... Unions\u000d\u000a      responded positively to the paper, which therefore formed the basis for\u000d\u000a      the TUC submission to the Leveson Inquiry...Jonathan's work has therefore\u000d\u000a      made an important contribution to the development of policies for reform\u000d\u000a      of media ownership that have been endorsed and promoted widely across the\u000d\u000a      trade union movement' [f].\u000d\u000a    The reach of these impacts on policy have been extended internationally\u000d\u000a      via the use of Hardy's research on product placement to inform policy\u000d\u000a      submissions made to the European Commission consultation on the\u000d\u000a      Audiovisual Media Services Directive, as well as to Ofcom and DCMS in the\u000d\u000a      UK. Written submissions include a CPBF response to Ofcom's Consultation\u000d\u000a      Broadcasting Code Review, `Commercial References in Television' (September\u000d\u000a      2010). These submissions were acknowledged by DCMS and Ofcom as\u000d\u000a      contributing to arguments against the liberalisation of product placement\u000d\u000a      and, whilst unsuccessful in preventing its introduction, have influenced\u000d\u000a      the manner of implementation and safeguards established [i].\u000d\u000a    In addition to its impacts on policy discussion and formulation, Hardy's\u000d\u000a      research has enhanced public and practitioner awareness of and\u000d\u000a        engagement with media policy issues. These impacts on practitioner\u000d\u000a      awareness have been achieved particularly via Hardy's regular\u000d\u000a      contributions to the CPBF journal, Free Press, which reaches an\u000d\u000a      audience of c. 3,000 readers, including 19 affiliated trade unions.\u000d\u000a      Notable examples of popular media coverage of his research and its\u000d\u000a      findings since 2008 include an article on Hardy's co-authored report to\u000d\u000a      Ofcom about Rupert Murdoch's 'corrosive role', published in the Guardian\u000d\u000a      in 2010 [j], and a media interview for BBC Business Scotland on the impact\u000d\u000a      of product placement (BBC Scotland 2012). Both through these sorts of\u000d\u000a      contribution to popular media discourse and through his presentation of\u000d\u000a      research insights at public events, Hardy has contributed to wider public\u000d\u000a      engagement with and understanding of issues relating to his research on\u000d\u000a      the governance and regulation of communications.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    University of East London (UEL) research on media policies has\u000d\u000a      contributed to policy submissions made to the UK government, Leveson\u000d\u000a      Inquiry, politicians and regulators, and to supranational organisations\u000d\u000a      such as the European Commission. The research has particularly informed\u000d\u000a      the development of policies adopted by civil society organisations and has\u000d\u000a      influenced regulatory outcomes, policies and policy debates, especially\u000d\u000a      where these relate to product placement, cross- media promotion, and media\u000d\u000a      ownership and pluralism.

The broad focus of Hardy's research is media policy and regulation,\u000d\u000a      including studies of the UK media and comparative analysis of media\u000d\u000a      systems. More specific research interests include media ownership and\u000d\u000a      pluralism, media law and competition regulation, and the relationships\u000d\u000a      between media and advertising. Hardy's work in these fields has\u000d\u000a      incorporated comparative analyses of media ownership regulation in North\u000d\u000a      American and European media, and scrutiny of policies on convergence and\u000d\u000a      changes in the regulation of press, broadcasting and advertising.\u000d\u000a    Published in 2008, Western Media Systems [1] examines the\u000d\u000a      contexts in which media ownership policies have changed at national and\u000d\u000a      supranational levels, comparing policies across North America and Western\u000d\u000a      European media systems. The book, described by Professor David\u000d\u000a      Hesmondhalgh (Leeds University) as `a major contribution to comparative\u000d\u000a      media research', proposes an expansive framework for media systems\u000d\u000a      analysis based on a critique of the main approaches adopted hitherto, and\u000d\u000a      provides an original, political economic analysis of convergence and\u000d\u000a      change in media systems. Hardy has examined UK communications policy in\u000d\u000a      work conducted as part of his doctoral research (1999-2004) and in\u000d\u000a      post-doctoral work (2004-2012) on policy under the New Labour Government\u000d\u000a      and the work of the new communications regulator Ofcom. His published\u000d\u000a      research on UK television policy 2000-2010 [4] examines policy changes,\u000d\u000a      policy actors and influences on policies. This research demonstrates that\u000d\u000a      while marketisation and liberalisation were the dominant tendencies,\u000d\u000a      regulatory changes were less pronounced and involved a more complex\u000d\u000a      mixture of interventionist, deregulatory and re-regulatory tendencies than\u000d\u000a      was suggested by the radical pro-market rhetoric generated within New\u000d\u000a      Labour and Ofcom, [4].\u000d\u000a    In his work on media and advertising regulation, Hardy has examined the\u000d\u000a      ways in which liberalisation has, at the behest of commercial, media and\u000d\u000a      advertising industry lobbies, been countered in certain areas by\u000d\u000a      governmental intervention, including in response to public concerns\u000d\u000a      mobilised by civil society organisations [2]. His 2010 book Cross-Media\u000a        Promotion [3] analyses media industry behaviour and regulation in\u000d\u000a      the UK and USA, incorporating case-studies of regulatory responses to\u000d\u000a      cross-media promotion across newspapers, television and online, and\u000d\u000a      regulation of product placement and related media\/advertising integration.\u000d\u000a      The book exposes the failure of UK regulatory arrangements and media\u000d\u000a      policy responses since the late 1980s to address the problems of media\u000d\u000a      power and market power generated by intensifying cross-media promotion.\u000d\u000a    More recent research has continued to examine the changing relationship\u000d\u000a      between media and marketing [6]. It combines research on cross-media\u000d\u000a      promotion practices in the UK media with an analysis of cross-promotion as\u000d\u000a      a regulatory issue, including in the application of the public interest\u000d\u000a      test and the policy process surrounding the proposed merger of News\u000d\u000a      Corporation and BSkyB [5].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42768","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research outlined above has had wide-ranging impacts on beneficiaries\u000a      in London, across the UK and internationally.

The widespread national and\u000a      international engagement with and awareness of its existence as a form of\u000a      musical expression &#8212; among the general public as well as practitioner and\u000a      consumer audiences &#8212; was achieved in part by extensive coverage in both\u000a      the trade and popular media of Goodman's work as a dubstep producer and\u000a      DJ. Much of this coverage included critical acknowledgment of the\u000a      significance of his work, its contribution to dance music broadly and its\u000a      basis in the underpinning research outlined above [a].\u000a    Goodman's second album, Black Sun, was released in 2009 and sold\u000a      12,816 copies. In its review of the album, BBC Music described Kode9 as\u000a      occupying `the very scalpel-sharp edge of its [dubstep's]\u000a      boundary-slashing evolution' [b]. Goodman has also taken dubstep to a\u000a      global audience via dozens of DJ appearances, including the 2008 Mutek\u000a      Festival (Montreal, 2,000 attendees), 2011 Sonar Festival (Tokyo, 4,000),\u000a      2012 Electraglide Festival (Tokyo, 4,000) and the 2012 Sonar Festival\u000a      (Barcelona, 8,000). In addition, he has curated and marketed original work\u000a      by numerous artists on his label, Hyperdub, releasing 12 albums and 64\u000a      singles since 2008. The catalogue includes Burial's Untrue, which\u000a      was nominated for the UK Mercury Prize in 2008 and has sold more than\u000a      100,000 copies.\u000a    Contribution to the cultural life of East London, including through\u000a        the preservation and renewal of social dance traditions\u000a    In 2003, Gilbert and Lawrence co-founded Lucky Cloud Ltd. to preserve and\u000a      renew the distinctive social dance tradition analysed in their research.\u000a      Since 2008, Lucky Cloud has organised 24 dance music events at the Light,\u000a      Shoreditch, attracting 320 paying guests per party. Co-founded in 2005 by\u000a      Gilbert, and growing out of Lucky Cloud, Beauty and the Beat holds\u000a      bi-monthly dance events at the New Empowering Church, Hackney, attracting\u000a      a younger crowd of c.350 per party. Goodman has continued to DJ regularly\u000a      at Plastic People and has also worked as a resident at Smithfield's\u000a      Fabric, playing to crowds of c. 2,000. In 2011-12 Lawrence worked with\u000a      Wire editor Tony Herrington to stage the four-part symposium series\u000a      Critical Beats: Electronic Dance Music, Club Culture and the East London\u000a      Connection at performing arts venue Stratford Circus, which attracted a\u000a      total audience of 313 and was subsequently broadcast on NTS [c].\u000a    These events have contributed to East London's soaring international\u000a      reputation for artistic and musical diversity and excellence. `Known for\u000a      its cutting-edge bars, offbeat galleries and ethnic restaurants, East\u000a      London is by far the city's trendiest area,' the New York Times reported\u000a      in April 2012. `Wear comfortable walking (and dancing) shoes to discover\u000a      its neighbourhoods east of the Tower of London, namely, Shoreditch,\u000a      Bethnal Green, Hackney Wick and Dalson' [d].\u000a    Informing and influencing practice among international music, arts and\u000a        museums professionals\u000a    Research and expertise has been shared through formal and informal\u000a      consultancy and advisory activities with a range of practitioners and\u000a      professionals in the music, art and museum sectors. As a result, it has\u000a      informed professional practice, supported the development of major public\u000a      exhibitions, and contributed to important trends such as the recent public\u000a      convergence between dance music culture and the art world.\u000a    The researchers have propagated DJ\/dance culture within the arts and\u000a      museum sectors particularly through their contribution of original\u000a      artworks, cultural resources and specialist knowledge to partners in those\u000a      sectors.

Research conducted since then has\u000a      included his 2009 biography of the composer and dance music producer\u000a      Arthur Russell, Hold On to Your Dreams: Arthur Russell and the\u000a        Downtown Music Scene, 1973-92 [4].\u000a    Steve Goodman (joined UEL in 2002, now Senior Lecturer) further enriched\u000a      the cluster's research via his cultural practice, which includes\u000a      pioneering work as a producer of dubstep, an innovative genre within the\u000a      field of electronic dance music. Goodman's Memories of the Future\u000a      [5], released in 2006 under his DJ and production moniker Kode9,\u000a      synthesised his contributions to FWD&gt;&gt;, an influential night held at\u000a      Plastic People in Shoreditch, with earlier 12\" releases. Developed in\u000a      parallel with his DJ and studio work, Goodman's 2010 book Sonic\u000a        Warfare: Sound, Affect and the Ecology of Fear [6] explores the\u000a      politics of frequency, including bass-heavy dubstep.\u000a    Work within the Dance Music Culture research cluster is united by the\u000a      researchers' shared focus on the theorisation of sound and the body, and\u000a      the cultural history and political potential of social dance. It\u000a      foregrounds innovative and socially resonant themes, addressing the\u000a      history, theory and practice of DJ culture and the different ways in which\u000a      the DJ has become a paradigmatic figure of creative practice in an\u000a      information-rich environment. It has engaged with questions relating to\u000a      the social and political significance of dance music culture, including\u000a      the dancing crowd's capacity for collective expression and its embodiment\u000a      of new forms of conviviality in the contemporary city [1, 2, 3, 4, 6].\u000a    The research has further explored issues of bodily affect and musical\u000a      aesthetics in both philosophical and empirical terms [1, 2, 3, 4, 6],\u000a      whilst contributing to the rejuvenation of dance aesthetics [5]. Finally,\u000a      it has brought these issues to bear on the analysis, documentation and\u000a      facilitation of musical and aesthetic innovation outside of the\u000a      institutionalised contexts of art and commercial music.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43379","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The UK PR sector has a workforce of 61,000. Accurate evaluation of their\u000a      PR activity allows organisations to apply their resources as effectively\u000a      as possible. Watson's research and academic advice has significantly\u000a      contributed to a shift in industry evaluation practice away from AVE to an\u000a      evidence-based, objective-driven approach. In addition, it has led to\u000a      increased budget allocations for measurement and evaluation (GAP study,\u000a      2012) (R1).\u000a    Watson helped establish the European Summit on Measurement, held in\u000a      Berlin in 2009 and it was at the second Summit in Barcelona in 2010 when\u000a      the seven `principles' for measurement of PR and communication activity\u000a      were established. Barcelona Principle 3 states: \"AVEs are not the value of\u000a      Public Relations\" (R2).\u000a    Watson's involvement in the Barcelona Principles and Principle 3 in\u000a      particular, is evidenced by the Chief Executive of the US-based Institute\u000a      for Public Relations (IPR). Referencing P1 and P2 specifically, he states\u000a      Watson \"has been a vigorous participant in professional debate and\u000a      discussion to help bridge the gap between the university world and\u000a      professional practice\" (R1).\u000a    He continues: \"His research papers have been valued highly by the IPR\u000a      Measurement Commission for their practical advice for people working in\u000a      the field. He has made an important contribution to the Commission's\u000a      policy rejecting Advertising Value Equivalency (AVE) and to a major\u000a      international policy statement in this regard (within a declaration known\u000a      as the Barcelona Principles that has been adopted by public relations\u000a      professional bodies around the world). More recently Watson's work on\u000a      other public relations measurement issues, such as the concept of Return\u000a      on Investment (ROI, see P4), has sparked intense industry discussion in\u000a      North America\" (R1 and see R3 for the IPR policy).\u000a    Impacts arising from the Principles began in 2010. The IPR concluded\u000a      there is no evidence to suggest advertising and editorial space hold\u000a      equivalent value (R4). In October that year Watson used his research\u000a      evidence (P1 and P2) to present a case to CIPR's chief executive to ban\u000a      the use of AVE in its annual awards. CIPR adopted this policy in late 2010\u000a      and it is still current (R4).\u000a    The Chief Executive of the CIPR confirmed the role Watson's research\u000a      played in the decision to ban the use of AVE in its awards: \"In this\u000a      activity, we have been greatly assisted by the work undertaken on this\u000a      subject by Professor Tom Watson of Bournemouth University. Two of his\u000a      works particularly provided these policy developments with intellectual\u000a      credibility: `Evaluating Public Relations', co-authored with Paul Noble,\u000a      part of the CIPR PR in Practice Series and a joint paper with Professor\u000a      Anne Gregory `Defining the gap between research and practice in public\u000a      relations programme evaluation &#8212; towards a new research agenda'. Both\u000a      works set out problems with AVE and encourage the profession to develop a\u000a      more comprehensive, realistic and valuable approach to measurement and\u000a      evaluation of public relations management\" (R5).\u000a    The CIPR is the longest-standing (since 1948) and most respected UK PR\u000a      professional organisation. The Excellence awards attract more than 700\u000a      entrants on average per year and have a significant influence on industry\u000a      practice. The CIPR's stance against AVEs is set out in its Excellence\u000a      Awards judging rules which state: \"The CIPR's understanding of best\u000a      practice does not include the use of Advertising Value Equivalent (AVEs)\u000a      in any form and AVEs will not be scored.\" Entrants are informed that any\u000a      use of AVE \"will result in a zero score in the Award's measurement\u000a      criteria\" (R4).\u000a    To gauge the response to CIPR's policy move against AVEs, entries from\u000a      the 2010 and 2011 awards (pre and post-AVE ban) in the five categories\u000a      with most entries were investigated by BU (Fig. 1). A total of 85 entries\u000a      were reviewed and showed the effect was immediate.\u000a    Fig. 1. Use of AVE as a measurement metric in CIPR awards.

It\u000a      was not possible, therefore, to compare all 2010 and 2011 in the five\u000a      categories.\u000a    Although judges had an instruction to reject AVE-supported entries, usage\u000a      of AVE dropped by nearly half (46.7%) when the 2011 entries were compared\u000a      with the 2010 winners.\u000a    Notably six of the world's twelve leading public relations award schemes\u000a      have also barred the use of AVE as evidence in entries. Watson's research\u000a      has made a significant contribution to this trend.

Evidence from practitioner\u000a      surveys, industry award schemes and articles shows extensive reliance on\u000a      this faulty metric.\u000a    AVE values news coverage at equivalent cost of the space or airtime in\u000a      advertising and is criticised by Watson (P2) as a false comparison for a\u000a      number of reasons:\u000a    - AVE does not take into account whether the coverage is positive or\u000a      negative. For example, a piece of negative news coverage could be given a\u000a      high financial equivalent value.\u000a    - AVE will value the size of an entire article, even if the organisation\u000a      is only mentioned once alongside a number of their other competitors.\u000a    - Advertisement content is controlled by the advertiser and can, for\u000a      example, include any number of key brand messages or logos. News coverage\u000a      is controlled by the news editor, subject to an unbiased editorial\u000a      process, and therefore not necessarily what the organisation is choosing\u000a      to say.\u000a    - AVE suggests all news releases are attempts at advertising, demeaning\u000a      the reputation of public relations.\u000a    - AVE measures a form of output not outcomes, such as shifts in\u000a      perception, changes of opinion or decisions to take action.\u000a    Watson argues that evaluation should take a more holistic approach,\u000a      related to the campaign objectives. He claims there is no single system\u000a      that can be applied because every organisation and campaign has different\u000a      requirements and priorities (P2).\u000a    Watson examined different methods of evaluating public relations activity\u000a      as an alternative to AVE (P2). He looked at how best to gather and\u000a      interpret information, a range of structures and approaches that can be\u000a      applied, the most efficient way to devise a media evaluation system and\u000a      objective setting. An Excel-based spread sheet connected to publication P2\u000a      guides organisations in evaluating their media coverage. Some of the\u000a      factors included are:\u000a    - Tonality of message (positive\/negative\/neutral);\u000a    - Relevance of target audience or media outlet;\u000a    - Opportunities to see\/hear (relating to readership or ratings);\u000a    - Whether the news coverage is only about the one organisation (solus) or\u000a      whether it is one of many;\u000a    - Use of spokespeople; identification of journalists;\u000a    - Effectiveness of public relations strategies and tactics.\u000a    More recently, Watson's research focus has moved to evidence-based\u000a      evaluation of PR and communication activities, especially the application\u000a      of the business concept Return on Investment (ROI) to measure\u000a      effectiveness (P4).\u000a    In parallel to his research into public relations measurement and\u000a      evaluation, Watson has examined the historic evolution of AVE, to better\u000a      understand why it has become such a feature of the industry. This has\u000a      resulted in several publications (P5 and P6) identifying AVE's origin with\u000a      press agents and publicists in the US during the 1920s and 1930s. Its\u000a      usage became widespread from the 1960s onwards.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43380","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The most direct and immediate impact of the research was to shape the\u000a      language of the new legislation to create a copyright exception for\u000a      parody, based on empirical evidence. Being the first rigorous academic\u000a      study in this area in the UK, the findings of the research were\u000a      instrumental to the policy process.\u000a    Impact took place through a consultative process with policymakers at the\u000a      IPO. Following completion of the reports the research team presented the\u000a      findings to the Government and other stakeholders at a series of meetings\u000a      in London. These included the Copyright Research Expert Advisory Group\u000a      (CREAG) at the IPO offices in June 2012 (R1) and an ESRC-sponsored\u000a      Festival of Social Science conference on Copyright policy held in\u000a      Bournemouth in November 2012 (R2). The findings were peer reviewed by an\u000a      expert panel and published on IPO.gov.uk in January 2013 (R3-5).\u000a    The BU research team recommended that UK policy adopt the widest possible\u000a      exception to parody permitted under EU provisions. Such a copyright\u000a      exception would allow both commercial and non-commercial parody, and would\u000a      adopt a wide definition to include a range of different forms of parody\u000a      expression.\u000a    The BU research was heavily cited by the Government in its legislative\u000a      impact assessment in 2012. The IPO wrote: \"The research carried out by\u000a      Bournemouth University found that there is no demonstrable harm to the\u000a      popularity (and by inference reputation) of original works arising from\u000a      spoof or parody videos. [...] An evaluation of potential substitution and\u000a      dilution effects found that in neither case was there compelling evidence\u000a      that the parody is damaging to the original in terms of the copyright\u000a      owner's ability to attract and monetise an audience for their original\u000a      copyright work on the online platform.\" (R6).\u000a    In December 2012, Business Secretary Vince Cable announced that the\u000a      Government plans to reform the Copyright regime in the UK, introduced in\u000a      the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill. On 31 July 2013 the Government\u000a      published a draft of their proposed changes to the law, including the\u000a      exemption from IP copyright on the grounds of parody (R7).\u000a    Societal impacts of the proposed copyright exception\u000a    The proposed exception for parody will have significant and widespread\u000a      effects for a range of beneficiaries including UK media businesses,\u000a      technology providers, fans and consumers. The new law will grant the\u000a      ability to anyone to create parodies of existing work, without requiring\u000a      permission from rights holders. Such an exception would enable parodies of\u000a      popular music, film, art and literature. While the research clearly shows\u000a      that there are minimal economic downsides for rights holders, the\u000a      potential benefits in terms of freedom of expression and economic growth,\u000a      are considerable.\u000a    The BU research cites advertising revenue value from this activity at\u000a      tens of millions of pounds, but the original Hargreaves report values it\u000a      as billions, taking into account growth of the creative industries, the\u000a      `up-skilling' of young people and other economic factors.\u000a    This type of activity gives young people the opportunity to train\u000a      themselves in digital literacy, creating an excellent skills base for the\u000a      UK and helping to place us at the competitive edge of the creative\u000a      industries. The videos in the study also gave voice to minority racial and\u000a      sexual orientation groups, enabling vocalisation of marginalised\u000a      viewpoints in the public sphere and encouraging freedom of speech.\u000a    The study showed retail sales of original records were higher when\u000a      heavily parodied. As this does not necessarily show it was a result of the\u000a      parody, less popular content was also studied. Findings showed heavily\u000a      parodied work out-performed those not parodied; suggesting parody acts as\u000a      a discovery mechanism for lesser known artists.\u000a    These impacts are widely acknowledged, often by the original rights\u000a      holders themselves who sometimes gain revenue from the parody. This is\u000a      evidenced by the fact that original rights holders have not contested the\u000a      proposed change in law and generally do not enforce their copyright by\u000a      demanding parody material is taken down.\u000a    Evidence-based policy making\u000a    This body of research has advanced the role of transparent,\u000a      evidence-based policy in the regulation of Intellectual Property. The\u000a      experience gained on the part of the IPO in commissioning, evaluating and\u000a      disseminating the findings has strengthened the credibility of academic\u000a      research as a tool for sound policy planning. The IPO has recognised the\u000a      importance of empirical research to inform IP policy and has requested\u000a      that key researchers (Erickson and Kretschmer) undertake embedded\u000a      placements with the IPO in 2013 to assist with implementation of IP\u000a      policy. In order to support that effort, the IPO has contributed &#163;51,000\u000a      to an ESRC Knowledge Exchange activity by Kretschmer and Erickson on IP\u000a      and policy. The purpose is to amplify the relationship between academics\u000a      and policy officials initiated during the parody research study, and\u000a      extend the role of empirical research to answer further IP regulatory\u000a      questions.\u000a    While reach of the impact is currently limited to the UK, the European\u000a      Patent Office in Alicante has shown interest in the work and it is being\u000a      presented at various conferences. This further verifies the importance of\u000a      this research in evidencing the significant social and cultural\u000a      opportunities for the range of beneficiaries the proposed copyright\u000a      exception for parody would bring.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Parody of music videos, television shows and other media is not permitted\u000a      under UK intellectual property law.

The\u000a      successful bid was led by Erickson (BU 2010-2013), with co-applicants\u000a      Kretschmer (BU 1999-2012) and Mendis (2011 to present) and produced two\u000a      government reports (P1&amp;P2) and a further paper bringing together of\u000a      the legal analysis and the empirical data (P3).\u000a    The purpose of the research was to assess the economic impact commercial\u000a      rights holders would experience if their work could be freely parodied\u000a      under copyright law. The government had no rigorous evidence on the\u000a      potential commercial effects of such a copyright exception, so could not\u000a      make a sound policy judgement.\u000a    The commissioned research was the first large-scale empirical study of\u000a      the economic effects of parody carried out in the UK. The BU team\u000a      undertook a comparative study of commercial music videos and amateur\u000a      parodies on YouTube, selected for its status as the leading online video\u000a      platform. The researchers sampled 8,299 pieces of user-generated content\u000a      relating to top-100 charting music singles in the UK for the year 2011 to\u000a      determine whether economic effects were caused by the presence of parody\u000a      (P1).\u000a    The study noted that parody was a fluid and changing communicative\u000a      process, so researchers selected videos that were tagged and defined as\u000a      such by the uploading user. Four different categories of parody emerged:\u000a      Target parody, which targeted a particular person or organisation; Weapon\u000a      parody, which drew attention to a third party such as a political group;\u000a      Self-parody and parody that had no obvious purpose. All videos were new\u000a      work using original work for a new purpose.\u000a    The study yielded the following findings:\u000a    \u000a      Parody and remix are significant online consumer activities: On\u000a        average, there are 24 user-generated parodies available for each\u000a        original commercial music video. Parodies in this study had 655 million\u000a        viewers.\u000a      There is no evidence for economic harm to rights holders through\u000a        either substitution or reputational damage: The presence of parody\u000a        content is correlated with larger audiences for original music videos.\u000a      New creative input by parodists is considerable: Most added original\u000a        new video recordings, and in 78% of all cases the parodist appeared on\u000a        camera.\u000a      There exists a small but growing market for this type of online\u000a        parody: Parody videos in the study generated up to &#163;2million in revenue\u000a        through advertising, a portion of which was shared with creators and\u000a        rights holders. The BU research valued advertising revenue at &#163;10s of\u000a        millions.\u000a    \u000a    P2 offers a comparative legal review of the law of parody in seven\u000a      jurisdictions and P3 reviews the previous findings and analyses their\u000a      relevance for copyright policy.\u000a    On the basis of this evidence, the research team recommended that the IPO\u000a      and the Government move ahead with a planned copyright exception for\u000a      parody, on the grounds that it would offer small but measurable economic\u000a      benefits to both rights holders and parodists, in addition to other social\u000a      and cultural benefits.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43381","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    BU research has demonstrated the social and cultural benefits of radio\u000d\u000a      archives.

In Ireland UR1 and UR3\u000d\u000a      were influential in decisions by the Junior Certificate School Programme\u000d\u000a      (JSCP) to ensure their school libraries moved beyond a focus on\u000d\u000a      standardised attainment tests to look at wider learning, when evaluating\u000d\u000a      achievements (CE1). The JCSP Demonstration Library Project, part of\u000d\u000a      Ireland's Literacy and Numeracy Strategy, is funded by the Dept. of\u000d\u000a      Education and Skills (DES) to improve educational provision and equality\u000d\u000a      of opportunity in socio-economically disadvantaged communities. The first\u000d\u000a      10 of 50 JCSP school libraries sanctioned by the DES were operational from\u000d\u000a      2007 indicating ongoing social and educational impact in the REF period (CE1).\u000d\u000a    Professional bodies, Independent Advisory Bodies, and NGOs\u000d\u000a      UR3 and UR4 have continued to be used to the present day to\u000d\u000a      raise awareness of the role of school libraries and their impact on\u000d\u000a      learning and literacy. In a blogpost (CE3) response to the Campaign\u000d\u000a      for the Book's 2009 call for school libraries to be made statutory in\u000d\u000a      England, Jonathan Douglas, Director of NLT, cites UR3 and UR4\u000d\u000a      as supporting evidence to argue that it is not simply a school library\u000d\u000a      that is important in developing the learner, but the presence of a skilled\u000d\u000a      librarian and integration of the library in the school's teaching and\u000d\u000a      learning strategies. Douglas also uses a further outcome of UR3\u000d\u000a      and UR4 as evidence of the need to fill a gap in UK data to enable\u000d\u000a      better planning of school libraries.\u000d\u000a    A number of UK and international advocacy tools have drawn on the\u000d\u000a      research and\/or recommended it as a resource for practitioners in their\u000d\u000a      own advocacy and development work. An example with wide international\u000d\u000a      reach is the IFLA School Library Advocacy kit (CE4), where UR3\u000d\u000a      and UR4 are the only examples of recommended research undertaken\u000d\u000a      outwith the US, Australia and Canada. Within the UK, CILIP Scotland\u000d\u000a      recently cited UR4 evidence to back up its response to North\u000d\u000a      Lanark's budget proposals (CE5).\u000d\u000a    SLIC reports that it has continued to use UR3 and UR4 to\u000d\u000a      the present day \"to inform its strategic approach to school library\u000d\u000a      services and to share good practice with practitioners\" and that the\u000d\u000a      research has \"given practitioners a credible source of information to\u000d\u000a      demonstrate the value of library services\" (CE6). The on-going\u000d\u000a      impact and value is evidenced by SLIC's commissioning in 2013 of an\u000d\u000a      updated critical review of evidence to cover the period since UR3\u000d\u000a      and UR4 (CE6). Preliminary findings, reinforcing the impact\u000d\u000a      of school libraries in IL, reading, attainment and learning, have already\u000d\u000a      been the subject of an invited presentation to librarians, teachers and\u000d\u000a      policy-makers at the Scottish Learning Festival, Sept 2013, with a public\u000d\u000a      commitment by SLIC to use the research as launchpad to improve on-going\u000d\u000a      data collection.\u000d\u000a    School libraries and librarians, CPD and practice\u000d\u000a      Invitations to give keynote presentations to practitioners and\u000d\u000a      policy-makers (e.g. Gulbenkian Foundation, Lisbon, 2006; Scottish Learning\u000d\u000a      Festival, 2005, IL Network, Stockholm 2006) enabled reach into teaching as\u000d\u000a      well as librarianship professions, using evidence from a range of Making\u000d\u000a      Connections studies (UR1, UR2, UR3, UR4, UR5, UR6) to develop\u000d\u000a      international awareness of the relationship between IL, learning and the\u000d\u000a      role of school libraries. Following the Gulbenkian event a self-evaluation\u000d\u000a      framework, influenced by UR3, was developed to improve the impact\u000d\u000a      of school libraries in Portugal (CE7). Examples of impact beyond\u000d\u000a      the library profession are the inclusion of research in literacy\u000d\u000a      guidelines for elementary educators in the US (CE8); and\u000d\u000a      collaborative teacher-librarian IL initiatives at a Scottish secondary\u000d\u000a      school, stimulated by teachers' involvement in UR5, and in turn shared\u000d\u000a      widely by the school (CE8).\u000d\u000a    UR3 recommended that pre-service training and CPD of both teachers\u000d\u000a      and librarians should address the need for greater understanding of their\u000d\u000a      roles in learning in school libraries. In her professional journal article\u000d\u000a      (CE9) school librarian Lynn Barrett uses this to support a call for\u000d\u000a      more effective staff development for librarians in their professional role\u000d\u000a      in developing IL. Other examples of CPD use of the research include\u000d\u000a      Saskatchewan School Library Association's recommendation of UR3\u000d\u000a      for teacher-librarian development in their role as \"instructional leader\"\u000d\u000a      (CE9); and its use in a practitioner-led CILIP workshop (CE9).\u000a      Activity on librarian blogs (CE10) provides evidence that the\u000d\u000a      research (UR4, UR5) is changing librarian thinking.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research since the late 1990s has developed an evidence base on the role\u000d\u000a      of school libraries in developing information literacy and learning.

It is based on the multi-stakeholder\u000a      participatory model that characterizes the IGF, which includes UN\u000a      member-states, IGOs, business, NGOs, academics, and technical experts in\u000a      all discussions.\u000a    The key results of this work are the Charter of Human Rights and\u000a        Principles for the Internet and the 10 Internet Rights &amp;\u000a        Principles [1]. The Charter and the Ten Principles were launched\u000a      during the Arab Spring of 2010-2011. They have become central to other\u000a      calls for internet rights such as European Digital Rights (EDRI, 2011), to\u000a      international mobilization against the ACTA and SOPA bills in the USA, and\u000a      to keeping human rights at the centre of debates around internet\u000a      governance and telecommunications regulations at the UN. The aftermath of\u000a      the revelations of widespread illegal state surveillance of online\u000a      communications has raised the ante over the last year, confirming as it\u000a      does the prescience of this work to generate a broad-based and\u000a      recognizable articulation of human rights and principles for the online\u000a      environment. The IRP Coalition, and the Charter of Human Rights and\u000a        Principles for the Internet, have been instrumental in this\u000a      agenda-setting domain.\u000a    Franklin has played a key role both in driving forward the debate and in\u000a      achieving the widest possible international influence [2]. A founding\u000a      member of the IRP Coalition in 2008, she was a contributor to the drafting\u000a      of the IRP Charter in 2009-2011. In November 2012 she became the IRP\u000a      Coalition co-Chair at the 2012 UN Internet Governance Forum meeting in\u000a      Baku, and in this role she has achieved a prominent public presence during\u000a      2013 [3]. As human rights and the internet have become a growing public\u000a      concern, this leadership role is where Franklin has been helping shape and\u000a      steer debates about placing the IRP Charter, and human rights generally,\u000a      into international and national legal and regulatory frameworks.\u000a      Franklin's impact is anchored in her research projects and publications;\u000a      and in over a decade of observation, active participation and public\u000a      leadership in online and on-the-ground decision-making debates. Its value\u000a      for the preservation of human rights online was recognised both by the\u000a      Council of Europe's Compendium project on the existing rights of internet\u000a      users [4] and by the UN Human Rights Council [5]. Her research to date,\u000a      and her advocacy around human rights and the internet, recognizes that it\u000a      is vital to engage ordinary people and NGOs in other areas (e.g. health,\u000a      education, development) in this emerging arena, as everyday life, work,\u000a      and politics become increasingly embedded in the online environment and\u000a      practices that internet technologies enable.\u000a    Civil society participation in the IGF, and gradually in arenas such as\u000a      ICANN and ITU meetings, reflects increasing public awareness and\u000a      controversy over how rights and responsibilities in the offline\u000a      environment are reflected, yet distinct, in the online environment.\u000a      Franklin's activism is a formative contribution to setting this agenda and\u000a      the terms of debate. Human rights and related socio-cultural concerns\u000a      (e.g. disability, non-English language needs, cultural legacies) &#8212; once\u000a      considered as a footnote to the `real' business of software design and\u000a      telecommunication engineering task forces, or realpolitik of global versus\u000a      state-centric internet governance agendas &#8212; are now top of the agenda.\u000a      Franklin has been especially influential in framing the influential and\u000a      highly praised IPR Charter of Human Rights and Principles for the\u000a        Internet and in the development of the follow-up IRP Charter\u000a        2.0: Human Rights &amp; Principles for the Internet in Practice [6].\u000a      Furthermore she has played a major part in the IRP Coalition's role as\u000a      part of a wider movement to put human rights and principles on the\u000a      Internet Governance Forum agenda. This year's meeting in Bali, Indonesia\u000a      sees this goal achieved [3].\u000a    The IRP Coalition's work on the IRP Charter has been a cornerstone and\u000a      inspiration for a range of initiatives to promote human rights issues\u000a      online around the world. Examples include the Brazilian Marco Civil and\u000a      its Bill of Digital Rights (The\u000a        Brazilian Internet Steering Committee), the Swedish government (Stockholm\u000a        Internet Forum), the Council of Europe, and NGOs such as European\u000a      Digital Rights (EDRi). Acknowledgment of the relevance of the IRP\u000a      Charter's role in promoting human rights as a core principle for\u000a      developing appropriate checks and balances to abuses of human rights\u000a      online has been gathering pace in the past two years, for example among\u000a      the Council of Europe, the Multistakeholder Advisory Group that organizes\u000a      the annual UN IGF meetings, European and US internet service providers,\u000a      interest groups and consumer associations.\u000a    The existence of a coherent and inspirational framework for human rights\u000a      in the diverse domains that make up internet governance has excited\u000a      attention from policy-makers, pundits and media watchdogs around the\u000a      world: from Vint Cerf, the `father of the Internet' in the US, and the\u000a      Canadian-based Centre for Law and Democracy [7], to the Centre for\u000a      Internet and Society in Bangalore, India; from civil society groups in\u000a      Latin American countries such as Brazil and Argentina, to the UK-based\u000a      network Nominet and EU forums like the Council of Europe and the European\u000a      Dialogue on Internet Governance (EuroDIG), where Franklin was moderator at\u000a      the final plenary session [8]. At all these points the IRP Coalition, and\u000a      Franklin's scholarly output and leadership, have played an instrumental\u000a      role in reframing the debate, and keeping the internet governance and ICT\u000a      for Development agendas accessible to human rights concerns. Recent\u000a      revelations of widespread and excessive forms of governmental online\u000a      surveillance of ordinary people on a global scale have put human rights\u000a      and principles at the centre of the future of the internet, so her work\u000a      has gained traction and increasing public attention in the media [9].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Franklin is a key participant in a formative period for global media and\u000a      communications, in which power struggles over ownership and control of the\u000a      internet are intensifying. Her work presaged the current global outcry\u000a      over illegal forms of state-sponsored online surveillance and\u000a      non-transparent forms of corporate storage and control of personal data.\u000a      She combines participatory action research and critical theory with a\u000a      leadership role in advocacy on human rights for the online environment.\u000a      Focusing on UN and intergovernmental arenas in internet governance, her\u000a      research unpacks how public, private, and civil society actors look to\u000a      frame the terms of debate around diverging priorities for the internet's\u000a      future design, access, and use. Her work has put human rights and\u000a      principles advocacy for the internet onto the international human rights\u000a      and internet governance agendas. It has played a formative role in\u000a      increasing recognition &#8212; at the UN and European Union for instance &#8212; that\u000a      online we have rights too.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    GOLDSMITHS, UNIVERSITY OF LONDON\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Goldsmiths' College","InstitutionName":"Goldsmiths' College","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"London","UKPRN":10002718}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"1650535","Name":"Provinsi Bali"},{"GeoNamesId":"1277333","Name":"Bangalore"},{"GeoNamesId":"2673730","Name":"Stockholm"},{"GeoNamesId":"587084","Name":"Baku"}],"References":"\u000a    Evidence of the international quality of the research: References\u000a      [2] and [3] are articles in major peer-reviewed journals, while the\u000a      monograph at [6] is published by one of the world's leading university\u000a      presses.\u000a    \u000a1.

Her research\u000a      explores ways in which developments in information and communication\u000a      technologies, society, culture, and politics collide and collude with one\u000a      another, from a macro and micro perspective. She adopts an\u000a      interdisciplinary theoretical framework to address the interaction between\u000a      state and non-state actors, socio-cultural practices and political\u000a      economic imperatives in internet design, access and use.\u000a    Through the development and launch of a Charter of Human Rights and\u000a        Principles for the Internet in 2010-2011 (the IRP Charter), the\u000a      Internet Rights and Principles Dynamic Coalition (IRP Coalition) of the UN\u000a      Internet Governance Forum has become a formative force in coordinating\u000a      intergovernmental organizations, internet business associations, and NGOs\u000a      working on rights-based initiatives for the internet. The coalition has\u000a      broad membership from civil society, government, academic, technical, and\u000a      business sectors. Members share information and debate issues via the\u000a      coalition mailing-list and social media, face-to-face and through\u000a      conference calls. They pioneered a `multistakeholder' working culture at\u000a      the UN through their success at `collabowriting' the IRP Charter and its\u000a      accompanying Ten Principles. This work has inspired others and contributed\u000a      to official recognition from the UN Special Rapporteur on Freedom of\u000a      Expression, in his 2011 report.\u000a      This first step was followed with the landmark Resolution of the UN Human\u000a      Rights Council in 2012 that focused for the first time on the issue of\u000a      human rights online.\u000a    Franklin's participation in this project &#8212; founded on the rigours of\u000a      ethnographic research, the use of `virtual research' methods alongside\u000a      narrative interviews, and discourse analysis of official outputs and\u000a      internal consultations &#8212; informs the empirical findings and theoretical\u000a      contributions of her published work to date. For example, the first\u000a      version of the IRP Charter (launched at the September 2010 IGF meeting in\u000a      Vilnius) was presented at the Seminar Series of the Edinburgh Centre for\u000a      Law and Society, University of Edinburgh, on 28 October 2010. Subsequently\u000a      her research has been closely integrated with the development of the\u000a      Charter 2.0 project, formally initiated at the UNESCO WSIS+10 meeting in\u000a      Paris, February 2013. Her research output includes academic journal\u000a      articles, articles and reports for researchers, policy-makers and NGOs\u000a      (e.g. [1-2]), presentations at academic and cross-sector meetings (e.g.\u000a      the Edinburgh Centre for Law and Society, European Dialogue for internet\u000a      Governance 2013, and at the Council of Europe Ministers Meeting, Belgrade\u000a      2013), as well as refereed journal articles (e.g. [3]), commissioned book\u000a      chapters based on her research profile in this area [4-5], and public\u000a      media (e.g. The Guardian 2013, The Conversation 2013).

Two\u000d\u000a      BBC Radio 4 programmes have drawn extensively on her research on the\u000d\u000a      creative industries in the\u000d\u000a      UK: a dedicated edition of Thinking Allowed presented by Laurie Taylor\u000d\u000a      (January 2005) and a three-part\u000d\u000a      series on the History of the British Art School presented by Jarvis Cocker\u000d\u000a      in 2008 (`The Art of\u000d\u000a      Pop', produced by Bob Dickinson).\u000d\u000a    McRobbie also worked closely with NESTA during the 2000s, in particular\u000d\u000a      with Si&#226;n Prime who\u000d\u000a      implemented many of her proposals with dozens of fashion designers.\u000d\u000a      Subsequently Prime joined\u000d\u000a      the Goldsmiths Institute of Creative and Cultural Entrepreneurship, and\u000d\u000a      they have together been\u000d\u000a      the driving force behind a recently-launched MA in Fashion, which\u000d\u000a      brings a critical perspective to\u000d\u000a      debate with creative practitioners &#8212; designers, writers, thinkers and\u000d\u000a      curators &#8212; who actively seek to\u000d\u000a      challenge traditional boundaries. In this way education and research\u000d\u000a      directly come to bear on\u000d\u000a      professional practice.\u000d\u000a    In Germany and Austria\u000d\u000a    McRobbie's fashion recommendations have been published in Europe and\u000d\u000a      translated into German,\u000d\u000a      appearing in a number of journals, newspapers and books. They have helped\u000d\u000a      to shape some of\u000d\u000a      the start-ups mentioned below. In Berlin in particular since 2008, her\u000d\u000a      research fed into discussions\u000d\u000a      about how under-utilised city spaces (`Zwischennutzungen') could be turned\u000d\u000a      into fashion start-up\u000d\u000a      social enterprises, with subsidized rents for `socially worthy' projects.\u000d\u000a      McRobbie's proposals to\u000d\u000a      bring together groups of young designers and to encourage more cooperation\u000d\u000a      with local suppliers\u000d\u000a      and with pools of available labour with regard to knitting, sewing,\u000d\u000a      crocheting etc. have come to\u000d\u000a      fruition, especially in the Berlin neighbourhood of Neuk&#337;lln. This\u000d\u000a      happened because policy\u000d\u000a      advisors, urban consultants, designers and entrepreneurs themselves were\u000d\u000a      familiar with her writing\u000d\u000a      and research, both in English and in translation.\u000d\u000a    Published in an influential German volume, `\"I Was Knitting Away Night\u000d\u000a      and Day\": Die Bedeutung\u000d\u000a      von Kunst und Handwerk in Modesdesign' [4] became a key text for\u000d\u000a      policy-makers and fashion\u000d\u000a      producers in Berlin, influencing the model of co-operative working among\u000d\u000a      small-scale fashion\u000d\u000a      designers as a recommended pathway for economic viability. The article\u000d\u000a      cited at [3] was also widely\u000d\u000a      read in English by German urban policy-makers. Directly influenced by this\u000d\u000a      work were such\u000d\u000a      organisations as Inpolis (especially its NEMONA network for\u000d\u000a      fashion designers and seamstresses)\u000d\u000a      [8], Common-Works ModeProduktion (providing fashion production\u000d\u000a      services for 30 Berlin-based\u000d\u000a      fashion design companies) [9], and the film production company Turanskyj\u000d\u000a        &amp; Ahlrichs GbR.\u000d\u000a    In 2010 McRobbie initiated local neighbourhood ethnographic research on\u000d\u000a      Berlin fashion start-ups,\u000d\u000a      with particular reference to female self-employment strategies. Also\u000d\u000a      important to this research is\u000d\u000a      the NGO dimension, including ways of working with local migrant women in a\u000d\u000a      more equitable and\u000d\u000a      socially engaged way. In this context she has interviewed and taken part\u000d\u000a      in deep immersive\u000d\u000a      observation with fashion designers based at the Common-Works Studio and\u000d\u000a      the Inpolis\/NEMONA\u000d\u000a      studio in Neuk&#337;lln, as well as with the sewing workshop or `co-sewing\u000d\u000a      space' NadelWald. The\u000d\u000a      Managing Director of Common-Works has used this research to extend the\u000d\u000a      feminist social\u000d\u000a      enterprise outreach dimension of the company [9], while the CEO of Inpolis\u000d\u000a      is committed to a\u000d\u000a      collaboration that reflects the social egalitarian model of fashion\u000d\u000a      co-working [8, described in 6].\u000d\u000a      Such work has led to McRobbie being invited to join the Neuk&#246;lln\u000d\u000a      Neighbourhood Fashion Forum.\u000d\u000a    In June 2012 McRobbie organised, hosted and introduced in German a\u000d\u000a      tailor-made event entitled\u000d\u000a      Fashion Matters Berlin. Held at the September Gallery in Kreuzberg with\u000d\u000a      Goldsmiths support, it\u000d\u000a      brought McRobbie into contact with designers and labels such as Issever\u000d\u000a      Bahri and Augustin\u000d\u000a      Teboul as well as with influential journalists such as Maria Exner, the\u000d\u000a      fashion editor of the major\u000d\u000a      German newspaper Die Zeit, and the German correspondent for Women's\u000d\u000a        Wear Daily [10].\u000d\u000a    McRobbie's articles listed above were highly influential on the Director\u000d\u000a      of Espace-Surplus Le Grand\u000d\u000a      Berlin, and they helped shape the contours of the cultural enterprise and\u000d\u000a      feminist organisation\u000d\u000a      entitled `f******* &#8212; Towards New Perspectives on Feminism'\u000d\u000a      [11]. One result of the collaboration\u000d\u000a      was a major three-day gallery event of this name, held in February 2013 at\u000d\u000a      n.b.k. (Neuer Berliner\u000d\u000a      Kunstverein), which received extensive publicity in Frankfurter\u000d\u000a        Allgemeine Zeitung and elsewhere\u000d\u000a      [12]. An ongoing joint commitment is to the AHRC CREAte Programme (Fashion\u000d\u000a      IP workstream),\u000d\u000a      drawing on the collaborator's legal expertise in Berlin. The workstream\u000d\u000a      was launched on 24 June\u000d\u000a      2013 with a symposium entitled `Fashion Matters in Times of Globalisation\u000d\u000a      and Digitalisation: City\u000d\u000a      Spaces, Designers, Producers, Supply Chains, Technology and IP' [13].\u000d\u000a    Leading out of these initiatives on a more permanent basis is a new\u000d\u000a      network &#8212; Fashion Matters\u000d\u000a      Berlin &#8212; which McRobbie initiated in 2013. This is already developing\u000d\u000a      several additional research\u000d\u000a      and policy strands, alongside her involvement in the AHRC CREAte\u000d\u000a      programme. In addition, she\u000d\u000a      has regularly taken part in fashion policy and creative start-up\u000d\u000a      roundtables in Munich and Vienna.\u000d\u000a    NGOs in Germany and Italy\u000d\u000a    McRobbie has collaborated since the early 1990s with EU-funded\u000d\u000a      feminist\/green NGOs, including\u000d\u000a      the long established Life e.V. in Berlin and BBJ Germany\/Italy\u000d\u000a      Consultancy Services (now share.it)\u000d\u000a      in Germany and Italy &#8212; both not-for-profits founded in 1988, specialising\u000d\u000a      in vocational training and\u000d\u000a      employment support for young people and under-40s across Europe. More\u000d\u000a      recently McRobbie has\u000d\u000a      connected these two organisations with the new generation of fashion and\u000d\u000a      creative start-ups in\u000d\u000a      Berlin and Milan; she is currently on the Scientific Advisory Board of\u000d\u000a      share-it [14, 15].\u000d\u000a    She has again widened the net of this research to include `creative\u000d\u000a      multi-taskers' and this has led\u000d\u000a      to her work being influential at municipal level in Sicily and in Umbria.\u000d\u000a      The article listed at [3]\u000d\u000a      informed and helped to shape the design and implementation of two EU\u000d\u000a      Social Fund Projects with\u000d\u000a      field-work programmes in Italy and Germany. Both projects aimed at\u000d\u000a      enhancing the employability\u000d\u000a      of young people through media and arts training with `insertion' or paid\u000d\u000a      internships in small media\u000d\u000a      and cultural enterprises. McRobbie played a key role in the four-year EU\u000d\u000a      Social Fund STEP\u000d\u000a      programme in Palermo: Territorial School for Emergent Artists, which\u000d\u000a      mentored 40 youngsters in\u000d\u000a      Palermo into new creative work [16]. She also worked closely with young\u000d\u000a      artists and designers who\u000d\u000a      participated in the BEKORE EU Vocational Mobility Project in Berlin and\u000d\u000a      Spoleto in 2009-2012,\u000d\u000a      presenting a report at the final conference for the project in Berlin\u000d\u000a      [17].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Angela McRobbie, Professor of Communications at Goldsmiths since 1998, is\u000d\u000a      an expert on urban\u000d\u000a      fashion start-ups.

It is longitudinal in character, enabling her to trace her\u000d\u000a      respondents through the various\u000d\u000a      stages of their careers.\u000d\u000a    In 2010, McRobbie initiated ethnographic research on Berlin fashion\u000d\u000a      start-ups, with particular\u000d\u000a      reference to female self-employment strategies. In this context she has\u000d\u000a      interviewed and taken part\u000d\u000a      in deep immersive observation with more than 20 fashion designers. She\u000d\u000a      hosted a tailor-made\u000d\u000a      event titled Fashion Matters Berlin in June 2012 at the September Gallery\u000d\u000a      in Kreuzberg (with\u000d\u000a      Goldsmiths support), attended by editors and journalists from Women's Wear\u000d\u000a      Daily (Germany) and\u000d\u000a      by Tanja Muehlhans, member of the Berlin Senate. The initial results of\u000d\u000a      this ethnography of fashion\u000d\u000a      micro-economies and of working life as a Berlin-based designer were\u000d\u000a      published in Cultural Studies\u000d\u000a      in 2012\/13 [6] and are already cited in the Berlin policy world, for\u000d\u000a      example by the CEO of\u000d\u000a      Inpolis\/NEMONA as described below.\u000d\u000a    McRobbie also hosted a roundtable event at Goldsmiths on 24 June 2013,\u000d\u000a      which was attended by\u000d\u000a      over 50 people, including one of the designers from her original London\u000d\u000a      study from 1998, as well\u000d\u000a      as journalists and policy advisors. In addition, two Berlin designers and\u000d\u000a      fashion company directors\u000d\u000a      attended, as did a representative of the Italian fashion industry Chamber\u000d\u000a      of Commerce, the Camera\u000d\u000a      della Nazionale Moda. One of the intentions of the research and\u000d\u000a      roundtables such as this is to use\u000d\u000a      the insight from the policies implemented in Berlin to inform the new\u000d\u000a      generation of fashion start ups\u000d\u000a      in London and the UK. The London `multi-taskers' interviews are reported\u000d\u000a      in McRobbie's\u000d\u000a      forthcoming book Be Creative?

Using analytical tools such as\u000d\u000a      feature analysis matrices [2.1], evaluation frameworks [2.1] and\u000d\u000a      technology adoption models, research has led to impact on the efficiency\u000d\u000a      and effectiveness of policing in the Leicestershire Police. The unique\u000d\u000a      aspect of Leicestershire Police's mobile solution, informed by the\u000d\u000a      research, was the adoption of Mobile Data Terminals (MDTs) into response\u000d\u000a      vehicles, with a Citrix Operating System, offering a user friendly\u000d\u000a      interface and keyboard, with full desktop access to all officer\u000d\u000a      information systems, thus `mimicking' desktop access available in the\u000d\u000a      police station and reducing need for response officers to return to base.\u000d\u000a      This contrasts with the less successful, but more common, approach of many\u000d\u000a      Forces relying on the provision of Blackberry hand devices to officers.\u000d\u000a      The in-car MDT solution contributed directly to the achievement of a\u000d\u000a      number of significant public policy goals for policing, such as higher\u000d\u000a      street visibility, higher profile neighbourhood policing, and reduced time\u000d\u000a      spent on bureaucracy. Statistics from April 2012 [5.1] demonstrate\u000d\u000a      that, since the implementation of mobile technology within the Force:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Visibility of response officers has risen 44%;\u000d\u000a      Patrol hours for response and neighbourhood officers has increased by\u000d\u000a        an average of 8000 hours\/month;\u000d\u000a      All crime within the Force's region has fallen 26.6%, with burglary\u000d\u000a        down 23%;\u000d\u000a      Public confidence in the Force has almost doubled to a current level\u000d\u000a        around 85.4%;\u000d\u000a      Public satisfaction with the Force's response to Anti-Social Behaviour\u000d\u000a        stands at around 92.5%;\u000d\u000a      Anti-Social Behaviour rates are the third lowest in England and Wales\u000d\u000a        at 39.85 per 1000 population and are still falling.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Senior Force personnel have declared strong confidence in the significant\u000d\u000a      role that the Loughborough University research played in this success [5.2].\u000d\u000a      In terms of cash savings, the evidence shown by Table 1 indicates that\u000d\u000a      mobile technologies have contributed to financial productivity\u000d\u000a      improvements within Leicestershire Police of over &#163;5 million for 2009 and\u000d\u000a      2010.\u000d\u000a    Table 1: Summary of financial savings to Leicestershire Police\u000d\u000a        following implementation of MDTs [5.1]\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a          Benefits\u000d\u000a          Financial\u000a              Saving\u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a          Local Police Officer Visibility\u000d\u000a          &#163;3,582,092\u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a          Mileage savings (April 2010 to Oct 2010)\u000d\u000a          &#163;10,516\u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a          Reduction in crime input staff (per annum)\u000d\u000a          &#163;37,219\u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a          Sale of police buildings: revenue costs\u000d\u000a          &#163;245,535\u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a          Sale of police buildings: capital costs\u000d\u000a          &#163;1,200,000\u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a          TOTAL\u000d\u000a          &#163;5,075,362\u000d\u000a        \u000d\u000a      \u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The MDTs are also facilitating further modernisation of policing with new\u000d\u000a      ways of working including:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Remote working in isolated, rural sites, with 80 police officers now\u000d\u000a        operating in the heart of local neighbourhoods;\u000d\u000a      More efficient witness viewing\/ ID procedures;\u000d\u000a      Custody visits using handheld devices;\u000d\u000a      Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR);\u000d\u000a      Major crime investigation features e.g. HOLMES enquiries which now\u000d\u000a        update immediately leading to real-time intelligence-led policing;\u000d\u000a      More efficient crime reporting process, with time taken reduced from\u000d\u000a        three days to 11 minutes;\u000d\u000a      Electronic signatures for witness statements;\u000d\u000a      Mobile control rooms for major events such as Download festival and\u000d\u000a        EDL protests;\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The project was recognised at the 2009 UK British Computer Society IT\u000d\u000a      Industry awards [5.3].

The outcomes of the policy work were incorporated into policy\u000a      statements and practical professional guidelines developed by\u000a      international and national organisations and institutions, including the\u000a      International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions and the\u000a      NPO [5.1]. Within the UK, a specific area of impact of the policy\u000a      and strategy research has been in the reconfiguration of the Preservation\u000a      Advisory Centre (PAC), the successor body (2009- ) to the NPO. The new\u000a      structure and terms of reference of the PAC were a direct outcome of the\u000a      work published as Feather, Lockyer, Matthews and Muir [3.2].\u000a    2. The development of a Preservation Needs Assessment (PNA) tool was a\u000a      key element in achieving significant impact. It has been applied in\u000a      libraries and archives throughout the UK [5.1], leading to the\u000a      publication of Knowing the need reports (2006, NPO and 2013, PAC)\u000a      on the emerging picture of preservation need in libraries and archives in\u000a      the UK and Ireland. The 2006 report, based on 97 individual surveys,\u000a      representing over 28 million items was the first ever national survey of\u000a      preservation needs in the UK which achieved this level of granularity. The\u000a      2013 report is based on 86 surveys representing collections totalling more\u000a      than 50 million items [5.2]. This data, analysed for PAC by LISU\u000a      (Library and Information Statistics Unit), a research unit in this UoA,\u000a      has strengthened the information base which informs national policy and\u000a      investment, and institutional strategy. Through the NPO, the PNA has been\u000a      used in libraries in Australia, Israel and Sweden, and archives in Norway.\u000a    3. The impact of the disaster management strand of the research also\u000a      began before 2008; for example, the guidelines [3.4] were adopted\u000a      by practitioners in libraries and networks across the UK and publications\u000a      from the research included in guidance and bibliographies for disaster\u000a      management across the world The disaster plan of the M25 Consortium of\u000a      Academic Libraries, for example, was directly based on this work which\u000a      continues to be influential in institutions and consortia [5.3].\u000a      In 1996, it was found that 30% of UK institutions had disaster management\u000a      plans, rising to 62% by 2013 (Knowing the Need, 2013), an increase\u000a      which was a consequence of the Loughborough University research and the\u000a      high profile of its dissemination in the relevant sectors. There is also\u000a      wider and continuing impact beyond libraries and archives, providing, for\u000a      example, an evidence base for English Heritage to develop nationwide\u000a      training for heritage employees and managers and fire service personnel\u000a      (by mid-2012 it had run 16 courses and trained 350 people) [5.4, 5.5].\u000a      There has also been a significant international dimension to this work as\u000a      evidenced by the engagement of the International Committee of\u000a      the Blue Shield [5.6].\u000a    4. The need for legislative change clarified by the research was\u000a      recognised by the Hargreaves review of intellectual property law in the\u000a      UK. At the end of 2012, the UK government formally indicated its intention\u000a      to update current preservation exceptions to facilitate digital\u000a      preservation. JISC used Muir's work [G3.7] in its written\u000a      submission\u000a      (http:\/\/www.publications.parliament.uk\/pa\/cm201213\/cmselect\/cmbis\/367\/367vw50.htm)\u000a      to the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee [5.7]. Since\u000a      then, the UK Intellectual Property Office has sought views on how to\u000a      implement an improved preservation exception (http:\/\/www.ipo.gov.uk\/techreview-research-library.pdf).\u000a      The international impact of the research is evident in the work of the\u000a      Legal Panel of the Aligning National Approaches to Digital Preservation\u000a      meeting organised by the Library of Congress and the National Library of\u000a      Estonia in 2011. The results of the international study on copyright and\u000a      digital preservation formed the basis of an international workshop on\u000a      copyright and preservation at the World Intellectual Property Organization\u000a      in 2008. The WIPO Standing Committee for Copyright and Related Rights has\u000a      now included copyright exceptions in its work programme; this derives from\u000a      one of the key findings of the research. In the UK, the government\u000a      established a Legal Deposit Advisory Panel (LDAP) to progress the work\u000a      done at Loughborough. The Panel's e-journals working group (chaired by\u000a      Muir) established a pilot e-journal deposit scheme and identified and\u000a      analysed the definitional and practical implementation challenges. The\u000a      LDAP made recommendations on regulations for legal deposit of non-print\u000a      publications in 2009. The regulations came into force in April 2013 (http:\/\/bit.ly\/ZhFDud).\u000a      The legal deposit libraries are now collecting digital material for\u000a      long-term preservation and are already making this material available to\u000a      the public. For example, material on NHS reform is now discoverable\u000a      through the British Library's search interface.\u000a    5. The results of the scoping and feasibility study for an archived\u000a      e-journals registry were used by EDINA (which operates the national union\u000a      catalogue of serials) in the development of the Piloting an E-journals\u000a      Preservation Registry Service, which is now a successful operational\u000a      service (The Keepers Registry), international in coverage [5.8].\u000a      This service can be used by collection managers in decision making in\u000a      acquiring and preserving electronic journals.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Since 1993, the outcomes of preservation management research at\u000a      Loughborough University have:\u000a    \u000a      contributed to the content and development of international and\u000a        national policies for preservation of materials and data in information\u000a        collections and memory institutions\u000a      led to the development of a method and tool which has been widely\u000a        applied for assessing preservation needs in these collections\u000a      significantly improved disaster management procedures in libraries and\u000a        archives\u000a      influenced changes in cultural heritage-related laws including\u000a        international agreements to facilitate preservation of digital material\u000a      enabled the creation of a registry tool to support collection managers\u000a        in decision-making on the preservation of journals.\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactType":"Cultural","Institution":"\u000a    Loughborough University\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Loughborough University","InstitutionName":"Loughborough University","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"East Midlands","UKPRN":10004113}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    Outputs\u000a    \u000a3.1.

Feather, Matthews and Eden (1994-1999) comprehensively researched\u000a      preservation practices and issues in UK libraries in 1993-1994 [G3.1].\u000a      This national survey (682 British libraries &#8212; all public library\u000a      authorities, all national, university and a sample of college and special\u000a      libraries, with a 72% response rate) identified good practice and\u000a      significant gaps in understanding among funding bodies and senior\u000a      professional leaders [3.1]. Feather and Eden followed this with\u000a      detailed research at policy level [G3.3]. Feather, Matthews, Muir\u000a      and Lockyer (2004-2008) subsequently investigated preservation policies\u000a      and practices in libraries, in 2007, which included a review of the\u000a      National Preservation Office's (NPO) activities [G3.2, 3.2]. This\u000a      research evidenced the developments of the previous decade including the\u000a      derivation of evidence-based policies from previous research at\u000a      Loughborough University.\u000a    2. The research (at 2.1) led to greater understanding and recognition of\u000a      UK national needs in preservation management. In 1997, Matthews led a team\u000a      which undertook additional research which provided the data to underpin\u000a      the team's development of a collection survey method for assessing\u000a      preservation needs in libraries and archives [G3.4] locally and\u000a      nationally [3.3]. Prior to this no such dedicated tool for use in\u000a      British libraries existed.\u000a    3. In 1995-1996, Matthews led the first comprehensive research into\u000a      disaster management in British Libraries [G3.5]. The libraries\u000a      which responded to the survey at 2.1 were surveyed and interviews with a\u000a      range of non-library stakeholders (for example, fire service personnel,\u000a      local authority emergency managers, insurers, disaster recovery company\u000a      experts) were undertaken. This research investigated disaster management\u000a      practice, discovering data and giving insights into professional and\u000a      technical issues on a national scale, identifying issues which needed to\u000a      be resolved and helping to define methodologies for the implementation of\u000a      policies. Key findings were incorporated into guidelines for policy and\u000a      practice [3.4]. Matthews undertook further research in this field\u000a      between 2006 and 2008. This was broader in scope, with coverage extended\u000a      to include archives and museums as well as libraries, also drawing on\u000a      international experience including the consequences of large scale natural\u000a      and man-made disasters and recent widespread flooding in England at that\u000a      time\u000a    4. Developments in digital publishing from the late 1990s necessitated a\u000a      reconsideration of legal deposit arrangements and long-term preservation\u000a      of, and access to, digital materials. The policy and practical\u000a      implications of the legal deposit and long-term storage of digital\u000a      materials was the focus of work led by Muir. Key findings included that\u000a      copyright posed a barrier to preservation of digital material and that\u000a      publishers had strong concerns about the nature of access to their\u000a      publications and possible impact on their businesses. Further research\u000a      included surveys that confirmed that current preservation copyright\u000a      exceptions were no longer fit for purpose and needed to be revised [3.5]\u000a        [G3.6]. This led to a major project with libraries and publishers to\u000a      research international copyright issues in digital preservation; the team\u000a      went on to explore the international dimension [G3.7]. Key\u000a      findings across the four jurisdictions surveyed (UK, Netherlands, USA and\u000a      Australia) were that existing exceptions to copyright were not appropriate\u000a      for digital preservation or for digitising orphan works, threatening the\u000a      preservation of digital heritage.\u000a    5. Muir researched the issues around the creation and management of an\u000a      archived e-journals registry [G3.8] and used these to develop a\u000a      set of scenarios for the registry and a set of alternative implementations\u000a      [3.6].

This service provides a search interface to CTA data\u000a      based on a rigorous controlled vocabulary, and is widely used by authors\u000a      and repository librarians to determine the conditions by which articles\u000a      state of publishers' acceptance of self-archiving, having been extended\u000a      and exploited by Sherpa and now used internationally; for the period\u000a      2010-11, there have been 457,629 visits, of which 85,493 are from the UK,\u000a      64,293 from the USA and 32,032 from Australia, and a total of 2,176,548\u000a      page views [5.2].\u000a    4.2) Research described in 2.2 made a major contribution to understanding\u000a      the potential benefits of OA and was recognised as having driven the\u000a      JISC's OA policy forward [5.3]. RCUK commented: \"RCUK welcomes\u000a      this substantial and interesting report. It will be of great use to the\u000a      Research Councils as we develop our future policies in relation to\u000a      publishing and in particular open access\" [5.4]. The Open Access\u000a      Implementation Group described its impact as \"profound\" in\u000a      that it generated discussions between scholarly publishing stakeholders,\u000a      provided a method for costing OA, was cited in the Finch report to support\u000a      its conclusions that OA is beneficial to the UK, and substantially\u000a      influenced the RCUK's policy on OA [5.5]. The significance of the\u000a      contribution of this work to the HE sector and to the UK economy is also\u000a      evidenced by the national media coverage generated [5.6]. The\u000a      report, and subsequent research inspired by the economic model presented\u000a      therein, sparked animated discussions with the commercial publishing\u000a      sector. The research generated a forum for discussions between the\u000a      Publishers Association, the ALPSP (Association of Learned and Professional\u000a      Society Publishers), and the STM Association on the one hand and the JISC\u000a      on the other, over issues of immediate importance to the UK HE sector and\u000a      the UK economy, including two specific points: how can the dissemination\u000a      of research outputs be made more effective through the internet and Web\u000a      technologies; and why are subscription costs continuing to rise at rates\u000a      above inflation? [5.7]\u000a    4.3) Research described in 2.3 outlined a way forward for the UK Research\u000a      Councils in relation to OA, building on the extensive activities already\u000a      supported through repositories such as UK PubMed Central and ESRC Society\u000a      Today. In response to the study, the Chief Executives of the Research\u000a      Councils agreed that, over time, the UK Research Councils will support\u000a      increased open access, by:\u000a    \u000a      building on their mandates on grant-holders to deposit research papers\u000a        in suitable repositories within an agreed time period, and;\u000a      extending their support for publishing in open access journals,\u000a        including through the pay-to-publish model.\u000a    \u000a    This was taken forward by the Research Councils and HEFCE, and open\u000a      access to research outputs is now mandated by all UK Research Councils [5.8].\u000a    4.4) The research described in 2.4 provided a deeper understanding and a\u000a      fuller picture of author and reader attitudes towards OA, and particularly\u000a      self-archiving, for the scholarly publishing industry and the OA\u000a      community. The findings have been discussed at length, for example [5.9],\u000a      and enabled the research community, including publishers and research\u000a      institutions, to engage in an open discussion of OA. The multiform\u000a      evidence base gathered, as well as specific findings of the Behavioural\u000a      strand led by Fry, is influencing the work of the European Commission in\u000a      the development of its digital agenda [5.10].\u000a    The impact of this group of studies is significant in that access to\u000a      published scholarly material has been broadened out to those end-users who\u000a      otherwise might not be able to access such material due to financial\u000a      constraints. This has been achieved through development of end-user\u000a      services, informing policy on Open Access mandates, and contributing to\u000a      the empirical evidence to support wider discussion on Open Access\u000a      publishing at the International level.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research at LU carried out from 2003 to 2011 has made a significant\u000a      impact on the practical realisation of Open Access (OA) to scholarly\u000a      publications at an international level.

Eight journal articles based on the project have\u000a      been published, three focussing on the analysis of CTAs [3.1]. In\u000a      2004, complementary research [G3.2] by Dr Fytton Rowland (Senior\u000a      Lecturer; 1995-2008), Probets, Dr Ann O'Brien (Lecturer; 1987 to date),\u000a      Oppenheim and Dr Adrienne Muir (Senior Lecturer; 2000 to date)\u000a      investigated technical models, preservation, and political\/cultural issues\u000a      affecting OA repositories. This Jisc-funded project was undertaken in\u000a      association with Cranfield University and consultants Key Perspectives,\u000a      and concluded that a distributed model for OA repositories should be\u000a      adopted in which content was maintained in institutional repositories with\u000a      metadata harvested to support a range of additional services [3.2].\u000a      This model provides a sound technological basis to underpin\u000a      self-archiving.\u000a    2.2) In 2006, Oppenheim and Dr Eric Davies (Director, LISU, 1994-2007)\u000a      collaborated with Outsell UK [G3.3] to prepare an evidence-based\u000a      analysis of data concerning scholarly journal publishing, for the Research\u000a      Information Network (RIN), RCUK and the Department of Trade &amp;\u000a      Industry. Their Baseline Report identified gaps in the evidence base [3.3],\u000a      which served to focus further research into OA. In 2007-08, Claire Creaser\u000a      (Director, LISU, 1994 to date), Oppenheim (lead investigator), and\u000a      Professor Anne Morris (Professor, 1985 to date) collaborated with\u000a      Professor J. Houghton (University of Victoria, Australia) on a project\u000a      commissioned by Jisc [G3.4] investigating the economic\u000a      implications of alternative scholarly publishing models. The aim was to\u000a      inform policy discussion and enable stakeholders better to understand the\u000a      institutional, budgetary and wider economic and social implications of the\u000a      three emerging models of scholarly publication &#8212; subscription journals,\u000a      open access journals and self-archiving in repositories. The costs and\u000a      benefits of each were described, and a functional operational economic\u000a      model created [3.4].\u000a    2.3) Also in 2007-08, Creaser was PI for the LU's contribution to a\u000a      research project [G3.5] led by a commercial partner for RCUK,\u000a      investigating the effects and impacts of OA on publishing models and\u000a      institutional repositories in light of national and international trends [3.5].\u000a      The report concluded that the impact of the Research Councils' open access\u000a      mandates had been limited, and led to action by the Research Councils to\u000a      strengthen their policies on open access to research outputs.\u000a    2.4) Subsequent research includes a two year project [G3.6],\u000a      completed in 2011, funded by the Europe-wide Publishing and the Ecology of\u000a      European Research (PEER) consortium, to inform their members (including\u000a      the International Association of Science, Technical and Medical Publishers\u000a      (STM) and the European Science Foundation) about author and reader\u000a      behaviour towards journals, with a specific focus on self-archiving\u000a      articles on a European level [3.6]. Led by Dr Jenny Fry (Senior\u000a      Lecturer, 2007 to date), Probets and Creaser, this project combined\u000a      existing expertise in the research group with new expertise in the\u000a      disciplinary shaping of scholarly communication contributed by Fry.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43741","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Since 2008, the research has had primary impact on the approach to\u000d\u000a      audience recognition,\u000d\u000a      development and engagement at the Tate Museum Group and the operations of\u000d\u000a      its family of\u000d\u000a      museums.

The ICH team was\u000a      invited to speak at several events including:\u000a    \u000a      The Edinburgh Mela Festival (2010) &#8212; also posted an article by the ICH\u000a        team on their\u000a        website and promoted its work through press releases to local media,\u000a        including STV, BBC\u000a        Scotland, Radio Forth, Evening News and Metro;\u000a      Meetings (2010) for the Sikh Sanjob and the Saheliya Women and Girls\u000a        groups; and\u000a      Nari Khallyan Shango (Bengali and Pakistani groups)\u000a    \u000a    This contributed to the involvement of BEM groups and individuals in the\u000a      ICH in Scotland initiative\u000a      and validated the concept of `one Scotland, many cultures' promoted by the\u000a      team.\u000a    Education: One of the most effective means of safeguarding ICH,\u000a      the team concluded, was its\u000a      embedding within the primary and secondary curriculum. The guidelines of\u000a      the Scottish Curriculum\u000a        for Excellence (CfE), noted above, demonstrated that there was\u000a      considerable scope for the\u000a      curriculum as a vehicle for dissemination of ICH-related knowledge and\u000a      practice. Trevor Gray,\u000a      Education Officer for Renfrewshire Council, and lead on development and\u000a      implementation of the\u000a      CfE, carried out a study on behalf of the initiative on ways in which\u000a      knowledge, understanding and\u000a      participation in ICH could form part of classroom practice for different\u000a      age groups. In turn, this\u000a      provided a robust foundation for classroom implementation. Meetings were\u000a      held with GLOW, the\u000a      intranet for Scottish schools managed by Learning Teaching Scotland. All\u000a      32 LAs have signed up\u000a      to GLOW and, with GLOW mentors for every school in Scotland, GLOW offers\u000a      support structures\u000a      to host ICH-themed material and facilitate its educational exploitation.\u000a      This now forms part of its\u000a      agenda.\u000a    International: Different international organisations have also\u000a      regularly invited the ICH team to\u000a      undertake various events, including:\u000a    \u000a      giving public lectures (Vigo) and seminars (Museo do Poblo, Santiago)\u000a        in Galicia (2009);\u000a      addressing the Dutch government and cultural organisations (Deurne,\u000a        2012);\u000a      leading symposia at the Smithsonian, Library of Congress and NEA\u000a        (Washington DC,\u000a        2013); and,\u000a      speaking at a symposium to celebrate the UNESCO 2003 Convention's 10th\u000a        Anniversary\u000a        (Venice, 2013).\u000a    \u000a    International impact was also ensured when UNESCO's Paris ICH division\u000a      asked the ICH team in\u000a      2009 to lead in creating an ICH training kit in print and on CD. This kit\u000a      was distributed to field\u000a      offices and national commissions in sub-Saharan Africa for both local\u000a      re-printing and distribution.\u000a      The result was a comprehensive and comprehensible information package:\u000a      brochures, addressing\u000a      different audiences; inventories of intangible heritage and safeguarding\u000a      examples; a chronology of\u000a      evolution of the ICH programme; and a set of FAQs. The major beneficiaries\u000a      are ICH communities\u000a      of practice and policy-makers.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) Initiative at Edinburgh Napier\u000a      University researched the role\u000a      and safeguarding of `living culture' in Scotland based on the 2003 UNESCO\u000a      Convention.

The\u000a      project sought to establish strategies for the long-term safeguarding of\u000a      ICH through partnerships\u000a      with communities of practice and several regional and national\u000a      stakeholders. The initiative\u000a      emphasised: the importance of ICH as a key impetus of cultural diversity;\u000a      its contributions to\u000a      community (local and national) health, cohesion and identity; and the\u000a      threats faced by ICH locally\u000a      and globally.\u000a    The Edinburgh Napier University (ENU) ICH team is led by its\u000a      co-Directors, Professors Alison\u000a      McCleery (2007&gt;) and Alistair McCleery (2007&gt;) and has included as\u000a      Research Assistants, Dr\u000a      Linda Gunn (2007-2011), David Hill (2008-2011), Dr David Bowers (2012&gt;)\u000a      and Elaine Lambie\u000a      (2012&gt;). It also employs as Research Fellow Kenneth Wardrop (2012&gt;)\u000a      and it has funded four\u000a      student internships for periods of between two and three months. The team\u000a      has worked in\u000a      collaboration with external stakeholders including Museums Galleries\u000a      Scotland (MGS), Creative\u000a      Scotland, COSLA (Local Authorities) and the UK National Commission for\u000a      UNESCO.\u000a    Two key issues were identified in 2007\/8 at the initiative's inception:\u000a      given UNESCO definitions,\u000a      what should be considered, from a Scottish standpoint, to constitute ICH;\u000a      and, what is being\u000a      done\/should be done to protect ICH [1]. After researching international\u000a      practices and subsequently\u000a      reporting [2] on findings to IFACCA (International Federation of Arts\u000a      Councils and Culture\u000a      Agencies), the decision was taken that Scotland's living culture should be\u000a      defined in the most\u000a      inclusive way possible. This conclusion was reached through consultation\u000a      with a range of bodies\u000a      and communities of practice, but was important in a Scotland context\u000a      because it underpinned a\u000a      sense of civic &#8212; rather than ethnic &#8212; national identity by contrast with\u000a      other European states [3, 5].\u000a      The initiative had also concluded by 2009 that ICH practices cease to\u000a      exist not through the active\u000a      choice of practitioners but rather by neglect. Another key finding was\u000a      that safeguarding should coopt\u000a      existing mechanisms (such as education or tourism) to ensure that ICH\u000a      survives and evolves,\u000a      while retaining community ownership. An important research outcome was the\u000a      creation of an\u000a      online inventory shell from 2009-2011 for MGS [6]. The team's research\u000a      findings on ICH practices\u000a      informed the strategy for data collection for the inventory, which had to\u000a      ensure continuing\u000a      ownership by those communities holding the knowledge of particular\u000a      practices. The team used\u000a      workshops and other forms of consultation to refine its approach to this\u000a      inventory and to underpin\u000a      community involvement before handing the inventory over to MGS.\u000a    This research had identified community involvement and educational\u000a      opportunities as key factors\u000a      and recognised the need for sustainable income sources. An outcome of this\u000a      has been a\u000a      commission from Creative Scotland, supported by Visit Scotland, to examine\u000a      how ICH in Scotland\u000a      can be most sensitively exploited to provide income through cultural\u000a      tourism. Findings from this\u000a      research (due in 2013) should enable the construction of national and\u000a      international ICH\u000a      development strategies for individual governments and tourism agencies\u000a      that balance the cultural\u000a      interests and revenue needs of communities.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43949","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research made clear impacts on the development of the Scottish\u000a      publishing and on government policy towards it.

This informed a more detailed study undertaken by\u000a      the team for SAC on the strategic future of publishing in Scotland,\u000a      published as a full report and summary report in 2004 [1]. The\u000a      methodologies adopted in 2003-4 proved sufficiently robust to permit, with\u000a      some updating, a further study in 2006-7 that allowed for the beginnings\u000a      of a longitudinal study as well as the introduction of new topics such as\u000a      e-publishing. This fresh study (including Gunn 2005-10) was conducted with\u000a      the collaboration of the trade body, Publishing Scotland, and consequently\u000a      received wide dissemination through industry seminars and conferences and\u000a      in academic outlets [2]. Successful applications for studentship funding\u000a      to the AHRC and the Carnegie Trust permitted the extension of this work in\u000a      three fresh directions: an examination (Ramdarshan Bold 2008-11) of the\u000a      internal rights market within Scotland (compared with the UK and Ireland)\u000a      from the perspective of both authors (in collaboration with the Society of\u000a      Authors Scotland) and publishers [3]; a transnational comparative study of\u000a      Scotland and Catalonia (Boswell 2009-13) examining in particular the NDPB\u000a      infrastructures supporting publishing in both national regions [4]; and an\u000a      investigation of the European market in fiction rights (Craighill\u000a      2010-present) that focussed on authors and publishers within the small\u000a      nations and national regions of the EU [5]. This critical mass of work was\u000a      underpinned by the development by McCleery of a rationale for\u000a      `small-nation publishing', and the establishment of that term as common\u000a      currency within the field, through a number of international presentations\u000a      and papers. This moved understanding on from the particular (Scotland) to\u000a      the commonalty of issues and challenges (Europe). This was initially\u000a      articulated in the 2009 COLICO Lecture on `Small-Nation Publishing'\u000a      delivered to the joint annual conference of professional library\u000a      organisations from both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland [6].\u000a      This lecture was made available on the COLICO website for downloading and\u000a      published as a small booklet. The ideas expressed within it were further\u000a      developed at invited lectures in Oslo (2010) and Antwerp (2010), both key\u000a      loci for `small nation publishing'. McCleery and Ramdarshan Bold continued\u000a      the longitudinal study in 2010, and again extended it to include a profile\u000a      of authorship in Scotland. The latter represented a more sophisticated\u000a      outcome than the only other previous study (1998) that McCleery had\u000a      himself commissioned as a member of the then SAC Literature Committee. The\u000a      reputation gained by the Edinburgh Napier team from these longitudinal\u000a      studies led to an award from the Scottish Funding Council's Interface\u000a      scheme, promoting Knowledge Exchange with SMEs, to incorporate this\u000a      research within an annual glossy report, `Books in Scotland', that would\u000a      be distributed as widely as possible to increase awareness and\u000a      understanding of the sector. The first report was published in November\u000a      2012 and the second will follow in November 2013.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44336","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of Neely's work on Tait has occurred within the arts world and\u000a      cultural life more broadly, and in education; also in policy making,\u000a      through investment in the preservation of Tait's work.\u000a    As a direct consequence of Neely's championing of Tait, her work is now\u000a      receiving the recognition it deserves. The establishment of a major annual\u000a      award, in Tait's name (with Glasgow Film Festival\/Creative Scotland\/LUX,\u000a      for which Neely is a jury member) in 2009 serves as evidence of the\u000a      growing profile of Tait's work. In 2013 Neely is delivering a guest\u000a      lecture on Tait at the University of Missouri-Columbia.\u000a    Neely has also substantially helped to develop archive holdings at the\u000a      Scottish Screen Archive, The Orkney Archive, The Pier Arts Centre\u000a      (Stromness, Orkney) and The Scottish Poetry Library, also of artists'\u000a      moving image agency LUX.\u000a    In addition to prioritizing the preservation of Tait's work, Neely's\u000a      project has also been concerned with ensuring that Tait's work is seen.\u000a      Tait generally made films in 16mm, the format in which she intended them\u000a      to be exhibited. It has been a priority to show Tait's films in this\u000a      format wherever possible. This has been the case at a number of screenings\u000a      and events including two screenings in the US (Ragtag Cinema, Missouri and\u000a      The University of Iowa) and several festivals and screenings in the UK\u000a      (Edinburgh International Film Festival, Glasgow Film Festival, Orkney\u000a      Science Festival, Dunoon Film Festival, Whitechapel Gallery, The Big Sheep\u000a      Symposium &#8212; see a wider range of events, below).\u000a    However, it was also seen as necessary to make the material more widely\u000a      available through digital modes. Some of the newly recovered films are now\u000a      available on Scottish Screen Archive's website and a new DVD box set will\u000a      also be released (closely involving Neely, in collaboration with LUX).\u000a      This will include new films as well as films omitted from the original DVD\u000a      produced by LUX. It will also include the first DVD of Tait's feature\u000a      film, Blue Black Permanent. An accompanying booklet edited by\u000a      Neely will bring together archival material with interviews and essays\u000a      from filmmakers and academics engaged in Tait's work.\u000a    The preservation and circulation of her films, the publication of Tait's\u000a      poetry and writings, the establishment of an award in her name, have\u000a      ensured Tait's work is receiving the audience it deserved, and was long\u000a      overdue. Not only have the newly discovered and rediscovered films offered\u000a      further material for analysis to challenge earlier understandings of\u000a      Tait's work, but also, more widely, readings of Scottish film culture.\u000a      Likewise, Tait's work as a poet was little known before Neely's research,\u000a      thereby ensuring a broadening of the scope of studies of Scottish poetry.\u000a    Finally, the wide reach of this research outside the academic world has\u000a      also had particular relevance for the growing number of artists\u000a      researching and working with 16mm film.

Tait was a\u000a      truly independent filmmaker who established her own film company and\u000a      self-financed most of her productions. Her work stretches across an\u000a      impressive range of styles (eg hand-painted animations, film poetry\u000a      or observational portraits of her immediate surroundings). Part of the\u000a      explanation of the oversight of this major pioneer of UK experimental film\u000a      is associated with the challenging working methods presented by her films,\u000a      but it is also because of Tait's own reluctance to secure her work within\u000a      archival collections. She also produced various writings, including\u000a      poetry, the latter chiefly unpublished until Neely's engagement with her\u000a      work.\u000a    The research for the project began in 2005, when Neely organized an event\u000a      on Tait at the Glasgow Film Theatre with The Drouth magazine and\u000a      Ian Goode (Glasgow University). Neely's research into Tait then developed\u000a      with the support of two research grants from the Carnegie Foundation:\u000a      Carnegie Small Research Grant (&#163;2000, for research on Margaret Tait), June\u000a      2009 (a previous Small Research Grant of &#163;2000 in 2006 began the\u000a      process).This enabled Neely to make initial visits to Orkney to examine\u000a      the extensive holdings of Tait's collection at the Orkney Archive. After\u000a      Neely joined the University of Stirling in 2007, this research was\u000a      developed further and in 2010, an AHRC Early Career Fellowship enabled\u000a      Neely to deepen her research on Tait (2010, &#163;50,187, for the creation of a\u000a      book-length study of the filmmaker and an edited collection of Tait's\u000a      poetry and writings).\u000a    Although the bulk of Tait's short work was deposited with Scottish Screen\u000a      Archive after her death in 1999, Neely's project found a great number of\u000a      films to be in urgent need of attention. Several films that had been\u000a      identified as 'missing' following the initial restoration project of her\u000a      work (conducted by Peter Todd, Scottish Screen Archive and LUX) were\u000a      recovered as part of Neely's research. These include A Pleasant Place\u000a      (1969), Tait's only known narrative short, Palindrome, (1964), a\u000a      rare film starring Stella Cartwright, also known as The Muse of Rose\u000a        St and My Room (date unknown), a very early observational\u000a      portrait of Tait's, shot in her room on Via Ancona (for which her company,\u000a      Ancona Films, was named) where she lived while studying film in Rome. The\u000a      collection continues to grow as new materials are identified by friends\u000a      and family in Orkney.\u000a    Neely's project also investigated Tait's writings and poetry, some of\u000a      which had been self-published in the late 1950s, but also the vast\u000a      collection of unpublished poems in Tait's archive. The project ensured the\u000a      publication of a collection of Tait's poems, stories and other writings\u000a      (Carcanet 2012). A number of recordings of Tait reading her poems were\u000a      discovered, digitized and organized into a collection for a new database\u000a      of Tait's work on the Scottish Poetry Library website. The project has\u000a      also involved the preservation of additional papers and ephemera relating\u000a      to Tait's life and work.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44337","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Blain was asked to give evidence as a witness or was otherwise involved\u000d\u000a      in the process of all four\u000d\u000a      major Westminster and Holyrood parliamentary initiatives on Scottish media\u000d\u000a      matters in the period\u000d\u000a      2008-2011, having given evidence to the Scottish Broadcasting Commission\u000d\u000a      (2008), the\u000d\u000a      Westminster `Crisis in the Scottish press industry' inquiry (2009), the\u000d\u000a      Holyrood consideration of the\u000d\u000a      local\/weekly press industry (2010), and having been a member of the\u000d\u000a      Scottish Digital Network\u000d\u000a      Panel (SDNP, 2010-2011), these engagements in addition to speaker and\u000d\u000a      panellist roles in related\u000d\u000a      public events including those organized by the Scottish Government.\u000d\u000a    Corroborating sources below detail the main areas of impact, which are\u000d\u000a      (a) government responses\u000d\u000a      to evidence given at the two press inquiries and to the SDNP report and\u000d\u000a      (b) the public response to\u000d\u000a      the SDNP report.

Access to Banatvala's research has\u000d\u000a      enabled Moving Theatre to move from producing works for UK national\u000d\u000a      touring to being a leading international research and development company\u000d\u000a      in the field of audio-drama.\u000d\u000a    Banatvala's research has made an impact in three important areas:\u000d\u000a    1. The practice and reach of bilingual radio drama:\u000d\u000a    Prior to Banatvala's research, bilingual radio drama was primarily drama\u000d\u000a      written in two languages but not integrated into a single drama (e.g.\u000d\u000a      Beckett's work). Following Banatvala's research there has been a tangible\u000d\u000a      uplift in bilingual radio drama, evidenced by, for example:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      BBC Radio has collaborated with Radio France to produce D&#233;j&#224; Vu,\u000d\u000a        a play in French and English, on Radio 4 and Radio France in 2009 [www.arteradio.com\/son\/334014\/].\u000d\u000a      Among the radio projects which received funding in 2010 from Ireland's\u000d\u000a        Cogar Sound &amp; Vision, three were bilingual Irish\/English [www.cogar.ie\/default.aspx?treeid=346&amp;ItemID=76].\u000d\u000a      In 2013, the international arm of the French National Radio Station\u000d\u000a        (Radio France International) began broadcasting a bilingual radio drama\u000d\u000a        series in French and Hausa to African listeners [http:\/\/allafrica.com\/stories\/201310120194.html].\u000a        This is believed to be the first of its kind.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    In addition, the bilingual plays emanating from his research have reached\u000d\u000a      audiences beyond their partner countries, for example:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Australian Broadcasting Corporation Radio National acquiring Bucharest\u000a        Underground in 2010 for Airplay, its primary radio drama\u000d\u000a        programme, attracting an average audience of 40000 [www.abc.net.au\/radionational\/programs\/airplay\/bucharest-underground\/3029062].\u000d\u000a      Following the award of the Prix Marulic 2009, Hannu Karisto from YLE\u000d\u000a        Radio Finland is in negotiations to broadcast A La Villa Bab Azzoun.\u000a\u000d\u000a      Radio Romania specifically broadcast Bucharest Underground\u000d\u000a        through its international arm, Radio Romania International.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    2. The practice of live recording of serious drama:\u000d\u000a    A further manifestation of Banatvala's research has been the\u000d\u000a      establishment of the radio play as an act of live theatre and as an\u000d\u000a      important theatrical experience in its own right, through the recording of\u000d\u000a      serious drama as a live performance in front of a theatre audience (e.g. A\u000d\u000a        La Villa Bab Azoun and The Way of All Women recorded live in\u000d\u000a      London, 2009). Prior to this, live radio had been confined to comedy and\u000d\u000a      panel games in the UK and some community radio. For example, the Romanian\u000d\u000a      Cultural Centre presented a live performance of Bucharest Underground\u000d\u000a      as a cultural event in 2009. In the UK, since 2010, The Wireless Radio\u000d\u000a      Company has established a reputation as a producer of live performances\u000d\u000a      for radio drama recordings, playing to sell out audiences. Other companies\u000d\u000a      too have subsequently developed a profile for radio plays for live\u000d\u000a      performance: the Fitzrovia radio plays have toured to popular and critical\u000d\u000a      acclaim in each year since 2009, for instance, and a version of The\u000d\u000a        Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy for radio will tour theatres in\u000d\u000a      late 2013 performing to live audiences.\u000d\u000a    3. Partnership working across cultural and linguistic borders:\u000d\u000a    The impact of Banatvala's research in this area is reflected in the\u000d\u000a      Moving Theatre company's involvement in a partnership programme (set up\u000d\u000a      2010) with Theatre Ephemeride (France), Radio Romania International,\u000d\u000a      Association Greenwave (Georgia) and Tbilisi State Music and Drama Theatre\u000d\u000a      (Georgia) which received EU Cultural funding and support from Arts Council\u000d\u000a      England for The Mechanics &#8212; a programme to reinterpret the story\u000d\u000a      of Carmen using a range of languages and performing arts forms. At\u000d\u000a      the heart of The Mechanics was the creation of a full-length\u000d\u000a      bilingual stage play reinterpreting the Carmen story for an\u000d\u000a      English and French audience. Other elements of the programme included:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      a radio installation led by Association Greenwave in which selected\u000d\u000a        participants worked with an artist on themes inspired by the Carmen\u000d\u000a        story;\u000d\u000a      an original `interactive radio drama' (with Wireless Theatre Company),\u000d\u000a        extending the radio drama as an art form for the digital age. Individual\u000d\u000a        online users create their own drama from a selection of scenes, sound\u000d\u000a        effects and music and then re-post their creation for others to hear.\u000d\u000a        All the scenes are professionally performed but the individual listener\u000d\u000a        is invited to create his\/her own relationship with the piece by choosing\u000d\u000a        which to include and deciding where to take the storyline.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Across the programme, figures reported to the Arts Council for The\u000d\u000a        Mechanics included 48 artists involved; 1,000 participants; 4,000\u000d\u000a      members of live audiences; and 150,000 viewing the production via\u000d\u000a      broadcast, online or written versions; 6 commissions; artist employment of\u000d\u000a      1,200 days; and 40 education, training or participation events across the\u000d\u000a      partner countries during 2011-12.\u000d\u000a    A partnership between Moving Theatre and Lado Meshkishvili State Theatre\u000d\u000a      (Georgia), delivered a ground-breaking bilingual production of Troillus\u000a      and Cressida in Georgian and Russian with interpolated verbatim\u000d\u000a      monologues (2011). The monologues were drawn from interviews from\u000d\u000a      participants in the Georgian\/Ossetian war. The production involved 24\u000d\u000a      actors, two translators, a set and costume designer for eight weeks.\u000d\u000a    The research has also contributed to the UK listener's appetite for\u000d\u000a      internationally-produced radio drama and a willingness to engage with\u000d\u000a      unfamiliar formats, languages and themes. One indicator of this has been a\u000d\u000a      clear interest in the UK in establishing an International Radio Drama\u000d\u000a      festival in Britain. Drama producers from ABC Australia, Radio Romania,\u000d\u000a      Radio Croatia, Deutchelandfunk and the BBC have all supported this\u000d\u000a      proposal. A survey of thirty representatives at the 2013 Prix Marulic\u000d\u000a      received unanimous support for such a festival. The project has similarly\u000d\u000a      been met with approval from Arts Council England, Canterbury Festival\u000d\u000a      2010, East Sussex County Council (RUGEF programme) and the Interreg Manche\u000d\u000a      European funding programme.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case study is based on research investigating the nature, challenges\u000d\u000a      and potential of audio-drama, and especially bilingual audio-drama.\u000d\u000a      Specifically, it explored the possibilities for creating bilingual drama\u000d\u000a      for monolingual audiences; the effects of using different recording\u000d\u000a      environments; and the advantages of cross-cultural collaboration.\u000d\u000a    Impact includes: (i) a growth in the practice and reach of bilingual\u000d\u000a      audio-drama in the radio broadcasting sector, both in the UK and\u000d\u000a      internationally; (ii) the establishment of the radio play as an act of\u000d\u000a      live theatre; and (iii) an increased awareness of the possibilities for\u000d\u000a      collaborative audio-drama production across cultural and linguistic\u000d\u000a      borders.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    London South Bank University\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"London South Bank University","InstitutionName":"London South Bank University","PeerGroup":"D","Region":"London","UKPRN":10004078}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"613607","Name":"Kutaisi"},{"GeoNamesId":"683506","Name":"Bucharest"},{"GeoNamesId":"611717","Name":"Tbilisi"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    The Works Season, The Works Partnership (2009), Artistic Director\u000d\u000a      J.

It was carried out over the period\u000d\u000a      2005-2009, and was led by Jonathan Banatvala (Senior Lecturer in Theatre\u000d\u000a      Practice: Creative Producing at LSBU, and Artistic Director of Moving\u000d\u000a      Theatre), with international collaborators: Dr Gunther Freisinger (Vienna\u000d\u000a      University), Toma Enache (Radio Romania International) and Eoin Brady (RTE\u000d\u000a      Lyric FM). The research was funded by grants from the Arts Council,\u000d\u000a      England (&#163;40,000) and the EU Culture 2000 programme (&#8364;60,000).\u000d\u000a    A two phase action research methodology was adopted, to explore:\u000d\u000a    a) whether radio drama could be created entirely bilingually to be fully\u000d\u000a      understood by a monolingual audience from either language;\u000d\u000a    b) the impact of recording radio drama in a range of different recording\u000d\u000a      environments; and\u000d\u000a    c) the artistic benefits of partnership working across cultural and\u000d\u000a      linguistic borders.\u000d\u000a    Phase 1 (2005-6), co-ordinated and led by Banatvala, involved all four\u000d\u000a      partners and selected multi-lingual actors, in identifying and developing\u000d\u000a      a framework and conventions for the creation and delivery of radio dramas\u000d\u000a      in two languages. This culminated in a two-day `laboratory' workshop.\u000d\u000a      Suitable pieces were adapted, recorded and analysed. The research clearly\u000d\u000a      identified the important contribution of creatively written code-switching\u000d\u000a      in the overall listening environment and how this enhances the dramatic\u000d\u000a      experience.\u000d\u000a    In Phase 2 (2007-9), each production team contributed to the production\u000d\u000a      of a season of five 30-minute bilingual dramas in English and a second\u000d\u000a      language. As well as producing the two UK productions, Banatvala curated\u000d\u000a      and directed the overall season (on opera heroines). The research also\u000d\u000a      explored different recording environments: two of the dramas were recorded\u000d\u000a      in front of live theatre audiences, one was recorded on location in rural\u000d\u000a      Ireland, and one in a traditional recording studio. In a further\u000d\u000a      development, the studio-recorded drama was then performed live as an\u000d\u000a      audio-drama at LSBU before a multi-lingual audience of over 100 people.\u000d\u000a      The season of radio dramas was intended for an online audience as well as\u000d\u000a      for a mainstream radio broadcast.\u000d\u000a    Key findings from the research were:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Bilingual radio drama which a monolingual audience could understand\u000d\u000a        could be produced without the aid of visual clues.\u000d\u000a      Notwithstanding the linguistic challenge, the audience experience was\u000d\u000a        enhanced because the changes in language were used to signal\u000d\u000a        relationship and character developments through the process of code\u000d\u000a        switching between bilingual characters.\u000d\u000a      The choice of music and soundscape were important in contributing to\u000d\u000a        audience engagement and understanding. The musicality of the language\u000d\u000a        was also a key factor in this process.\u000d\u000a      The audience experience across the two languages was not necessarily\u000d\u000a        identical but neither was superior to the other.\u000d\u000a      Where the performance was recorded as live and subsequently edited,\u000d\u000a        this was not directly discernible for the radio audience but it had an\u000d\u000a        important impact on the performers and the heightened performances they\u000d\u000a        gave. This was reflected in the overall quality of the production.\u000d\u000a      A live audience can fully respond to bilingual radio drama as an art\u000d\u000a        form in its own right.\u000d\u000a      The choice of English as one of the languages by all producers gave\u000d\u000a        the plays a broader international currency than had been expected.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    This innovative research indicates that carefully orchestrated bilingual\u000d\u000a      radio drama not only equals but can exceed the dramatic experience of\u000d\u000a      listening to radio drama in a single language. The outputs which embody\u000d\u000a      the research primarily consist of live performances, creative writing,\u000d\u000a      multilingual radio and audio, with impacts on cultural life and civil\u000d\u000a      society.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44393","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3686110","Name":"Colombia"}],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The beneficiaries of the European Social Survey Infrastructure (ESSi\u000a      project, 2006 to 2011) are located internationally and especially in the\u000a      European Community (EC). An undirected form of measuring this impact is\u000a      provided by the ESS Data Archive team which produces data user statistics.\u000a      In September 2012 there were 50,255 registered users from 226 countries\u000a      (ESS User Survey, 2012). The total number of users (non-registered and\u000a      registered) and those who access the reports and online materials is even\u000a      higher. 90% of them are based in Europe and 6 of the countries directly\u000a      involved in the ESSi exercises are in the top 10 countries in terms of\u000a      user numbers. According to the ESS User Survey (2012), students are the\u000a      main users and beneficiaries of the ESSi new methodology and the provision\u000a      of data and methodological guidelines are most likely used as learning\u000a      materials in universities. However, 11% of all users are outside the\u000a      academic sector in NGOs, governments, private enterprises or other types\u000a      of activities (ESS User Survey, 2012). As a result, the research has\u000a      significant reach, providing material to support work on media and public\u000a      opinion surveys to a wide range of non-academic users. According to the\u000a      ESS website, the guidelines for coding were downloaded 882 times and the\u000a      training page 805 times by 21st June 2012. Following the launch\u000a      of the new ESS website on 10th September 2013 there had been\u000a      371 visits as at 26th November 2013.\u000a    The research contributed directly to the development of new methods for\u000a      cross-national studies and improved the ESS coding of news. The new way of\u000a      understanding media claims allows a categorisation of content and provides\u000a      a score that creates a more powerful tool for measuring the strength and\u000a      direction of news (ESS, 2012, `Rationales for Changes and Improvements').\u000a      This approach also allows national centres to estimate more accurately the\u000a      time and resources required for data coding. These improvements benefit a\u000a      variety of users of survey data, including government bodies and social\u000a      research consultancies working on media studies and especially those\u000a      analysing cross-national public opinion surveys. The guidelines also\u000a      provide national agencies working on ESS with an international framework\u000a      for collecting, archiving and analysing media claims. The minimum number\u000a      of sources to be used and the time period for the data collection are also\u000a      specified in the new methodological framework (Harrison et al.\u000a      2012, p3).\u000a    The European Commission, in its European Communities publication series,\u000a      has publicly acknowledged City University London's role in the ESSi 'improving\u000a        social measurement in Europe' and building up 'a network of\u000a        specialists to refine methods of event-reporting across nations as a\u000a        necessary backdrop to measuring attitude change among people in\u000a        different EU countries' (European Commission, 2009). City's research\u000a      identified existing problems in the data collection among different\u000a      countries and created a framework for coding media claims that has already\u000a      been applied and will be used again in the next round of the ESS (ESS,\u000a      Round 7 Specification for ESS ERIC Member and Observer countries, 2013,\u000a      p27).\u000a    To improve the effectiveness of the ways in which the ESS measured the\u000a      influence of media events on social opinions and attitudes, a descriptive\u000a      tool was devised to evaluate the potential impact of news on the public.\u000a      The process engaged directly with non-academic beneficiaries through\u000a      several consultations and workshops with representatives of the different\u000a      countries. The biennial European Survey Research Association (ESRA)\u000a      conference in Prague in 2007 and in Warsaw in 2009 enabled discussions of\u000a      ideas with other experts on the ESS. Similarly, the symposium organised by\u000a      Statham and Tumber at City University London (31st March 2009)\u000a      constituted a valuable opportunity for external experts on methodology to\u000a      give additional advice, comments and pointers on the project. The 2011\u000a      Lausanne Conference, in which our team presented a paper, included\u000a      presentations by leading non-academic international researchers including\u000a      governmental organisations (Office for National Statistics, Australian\u000a      Bureau of Statistics, Singapore's Ministry of Social and Family\u000a      Development, Colombia's Institute for Education Evaluation) and social\u000a      research institutes and consultancies (Natcen (Britain's leading\u000a      independent social research institute), Ipsos, TNS, Gallup).\u000a    A database identifying national differences in the `political climate' is\u000a      also being produced as part of the research process that started in 2006\u000a      and it was applied across different rounds of the ESS. The software format\u000a      of the dataset allows consultants, policy-makers and other non-academic\u000a      researchers to access this baseline for research and facilitates the\u000a      coordination of cross-national and wider research programmes.\u000a    The improved methodological tools are being used by ESS country\u000a      coordinators in rounds 6 and 7.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The European Social Survey (ESS), established in 2001 and located\u000a      at City University London, is a major multinational social survey\u000a      involving the participation of 36 countries. It is designed to monitor\u000a      change and explain the interaction between Europe's changing institutions\u000a      and the attitudes, beliefs and behaviour patterns of its diverse\u000a      populations. The impact of the ESS is extensive nationally and\u000a      internationally particularly through improving survey methodology and\u000a      through the subsequent adoption of these standards and practices by other\u000a      national and international survey programmes. This has led to higher\u000a      standards of measurement in policy-oriented surveys and commercial survey\u000a      practice. The ESS was awarded the Descartes Prize for `Excellence in\u000a      scientific collaborative research' in 2005 in recognition of its\u000a      world-leading quality. In 2014 the ESS will become the first UK-hosted\u000a      European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ESS ERIC) when it is launched\u000a      on 31st January at the Royal Society in London by Commissioner\u000a      Geoghegan-Quinn of the European Commission Directorate-General (Research\u000a      and Innovation) and the UK Minister for Universities and Science, the Rt.\u000a      Hon.

The new\u000a      methodological tool enhances understanding and analysis of media claims by\u000a      governments and policy-makers. The work undertaken has addressed the need\u000a      for interpretation of attitude questions across different countries and\u000a      variations in responses to cross-national studies.\u000a    The impact was achieved through 1) the design of new methodologies for\u000a      the coding of media claims by governments and policy-makers; 2) providing\u000a      contextual data on media events; 3) the provision of guidance manuals and\u000a      training across eight European countries for coding and archiving data for\u000a      media analysis; and 4) the development of a media events framework for the\u000a      analysis and understanding by policy-makers of `normal' and `exceptional'\u000a      findings of public opinion surveys.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    City University London\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"City University, London","InstitutionName":"City University, London","PeerGroup":"C","Region":"London","UKPRN":10001478}],"Panel":"D         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"3067696","Name":"Prague"}],"References":"\u000a    Statham P., &amp; Tumber H.

The research was aimed at understanding\u000a      the ways in which media claims on news are interpreted and it classified\u000a      and developed new methodological tools for the cross-national study of\u000a      news.\u000a    Initially, Statham and Tumber outlined an overall description of the ESS\u000a      providing a rationale for event data collection. This was necessary to\u000a      examine the impact of specific events on survey responses nationally. The\u000a      analysis revealed the lack of a methodical and systematic basis for the\u000a      retrieval of information. This led to the development of a systematic\u000a      media-based approach and a new methodology. The research included pilot\u000a      studies, coordination from several European countries, workshops and\u000a      conferences. These activities, directed by Statham and Tumber, built on\u000a      the previous three rounds of the ESS. The media landscapes of five\u000a      European countries were studied to cover the different cultural and\u000a      national dynamics along the North\/South and East\/West axes of Europe; and\u000a      the range of old and new democracies. Statham and Tumber's research\u000a      benefited from the cooperation of eight different countries for the data\u000a      collection phase between 2010 and 2011: Spain, Portugal, the UK, the\u000a      Netherlands, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Greece.\u000a    An extensive literature review was conducted between April and December\u000a      2006 to map European national newspapers and existing methods for\u000a      comparative news content analysis. Limitations and existing variations in\u000a      the conceptualisation and characterisation of media claims were analysed.\u000a      Simultaneously, a pilot study was conducted (between 10th\u000a      September 2006 and 6th January 2007) to test a coding scheme\u000a      for media events. The UK, Germany, Poland, Spain and Ireland were included\u000a      in this study. Successive versions of research papers were presented by\u000a      the research team in February and June 2007 addressing ways to develop new\u000a      methodological tools to analyse news content in cross-national studies.\u000a    Background, guidelines, coding scheme and a codebook based on the work of\u000a      Statham and Tumber are now available online. The new scheme for coding and\u000a      analysing media claims is being applied in the 6th and 7th\u000a      rounds of the ESS.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44394","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The Impunity and the Rule of Law Initiative produced a positive impact on\u000d\u000a      public engagement, policy making and civil society; and influenced\u000d\u000a      international legislation and NGO practices concerning human rights,\u000d\u000a      freedom of information and protection of journalists. This was visible\u000d\u000a      during the `Working Conference of the Initiative on Impunity and the\u000d\u000a        Rule of Law'. The event, held at City on 1st June 2011,\u000d\u000a      was attended by many stakeholders including senior members of\u000d\u000a      international and intergovernmental organisations including UNESCO,\u000d\u000a      Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and\u000d\u000a      Inter-American Committee on Human Rights, journalists' federations and\u000d\u000a      expert NGOs including Amnesty, Article 19, Journalistes en Danger,\u000d\u000a      Reporters without Borders and the Red Cross, among many others.\u000d\u000a      Participants included Assistant Director-General of UNESCO Janis Karklins\u000d\u000a      and Director of Human Rights of the UK Foreign Office Susan Hyland. UNESCO\u000d\u000a      considered the conference to be a major international and\u000d\u000a      interdisciplinary event aimed at developing new global initiatives\u000d\u000a      intended to protect journalists and end the impunity of those who murder,\u000d\u000a      assault or threaten them. UNESCO stated on its website (2011) that the\u000d\u000a      Initiative which had organised the conference 'has already received the\u000d\u000a        backing of Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a long-time advocate for the\u000d\u000a        worldwide protection of journalists' rights' who also sent a special\u000d\u000a      message to the conference.\u000d\u000a    The conference marked the launch of a topical report by the New\u000d\u000a      York-based NGO, Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) which revealed that\u000d\u000a      13 countries around the world had five or more unsolved cases of murdered\u000d\u000a      journalists committed during the past decade. The conference attracted\u000d\u000a      sponsorship and funding from important organisations (the Open Society\u000d\u000a      Institute &#8212; &#163;1,047; the Norwegian PEN Centre which works defending freedom\u000d\u000a      of expression and advocating human rights worldwide &#8212; &#163;1,334; and the\u000d\u000a      Swedish National Commission for UNESCO &#8212; &#163;3,943). As co-director of the\u000d\u000a      Initiative, Tumber provided the welcoming and introductory remarks at the\u000d\u000a      conference which started the process of consultation and set the\u000d\u000a      precedents for the International Programme for the Development of\u000d\u000a      Communication (IPDC) at the United Nations' first Inter-Agency Meeting\u000d\u000a      with the UNESCO States members on 13th and 14th\u000d\u000a      September 2011. UNESCO made use of the Initiative's London Conference as a\u000d\u000a      preparatory meeting for its Inter-Agency Meeting in Paris and stated on\u000d\u000a      its website: 'As a first step towards this event [the UN Inter-Agency\u000d\u000a        meeting], a meeting entitled Safety\u000d\u000a          and Protection for Journalists: A Responsibility for the World was\u000a        organized in June 2011 by the Initiative on Impunity and the Rule of\u000d\u000a        Law. The conclusions drawn from this meeting will be presented at the UN\u000d\u000a        Inter-Agency Meeting in Paris.' Research and policy proposals\u000d\u000a      prepared by our research team became reference materials for this meeting.\u000d\u000a      Archbishop Desmond Tutu's speech at the conference raised awareness about\u000d\u000a      the violence against media workers throughout society and appealled to\u000d\u000a      world governments for urgent intervention. Draghici and Woods delivered\u000d\u000a      proposals based on previous research (the scoping exercise) carried out by\u000d\u000a      Xenos, to strengthen existing UN mechanisms for increasing co-operation\u000d\u000a      and preventing attacks against journalists.\u000d\u000a    The Initiative produced a valuable impact on public engagement by\u000d\u000a      creating an international platform of academic and legal expertise\u000d\u000a      comprising governmental and non-governmental experts from organisations\u000d\u000a      (including International Bar Associations, Index on Censorship, OSCE,\u000d\u000a      Columbia Law School, Saferworld, the UK House of Lords, The Salzburg\u000d\u000a      Global Seminar and UN, Media Legal Defence Initiative and International\u000d\u000a      News Safety Institute) to seek acceptance for fighting violence against\u000d\u000a      journalists and the right of citizens to be informed. A list of relevant\u000d\u000a      resources and working papers is accessible on the Initiative website.\u000d\u000a    The role played by Gaber (Professor of Journalism at City) and the UK\u000d\u000a      Government's representative on the Intergovernmental Council of the UN's\u000d\u000a      International Programme for the Development of Communication based at\u000d\u000a      UNESCO, was crucial. Gaber, an active contributor to the Initiative,\u000d\u000a      persuaded the Council to direct UNESCO to convene a meeting of all UN\u000d\u000a      agencies to draw up and implement a plan to increase journalists' safety\u000d\u000a      and hold governments accountable for the impunity provided to their\u000d\u000a      assailants. The UK Ambassador at UNESCO, Matthew Sudders, singled out\u000d\u000a      Gaber as a key contributor to the process in a letter sent on 24th\u000d\u000a      August 2012 to the Director of the Freedom of Expression and Media\u000d\u000a      Development UN Division. The UN officially adopted the proposal and Gaber\u000d\u000a      represented the UK at a meeting in Vienna in November 2012 of all relevant\u000d\u000a      UN agencies, national governments and international organisations. The\u000d\u000a      meeting heard progress reports on the implementation of the plan so far\u000d\u000a      and made recommendations for future action. Gaber's crucial role in\u000d\u000a      getting the Initiative underway was noted in a House of Commons debate by\u000d\u000a      Don Foster MP on 21st March 2012 [7]. In August 2012 Tumber was\u000d\u000a      asked by the UK National Commission for UNESCO for input into a review of\u000d\u000a      UNESCO's draft work plan on the Safety of Journalists and the Issue of\u000d\u000a      Impunity and to comment on the draft of the UK response to the UNESCO Plan\u000d\u000a      [8].\u000d\u000a    The CLJJ organised a further conference on `Obstacles to free speech\u000d\u000a        and the Safety of Journalists' on 2nd May 2013, an\u000d\u000a      activity which forms part of and is specifically referenced in the UNESCO\u000d\u000a      Implementation Strategy 2013-2014 [9].\u000d\u000a    The consultation proved crucial to shaping policy interventions and the\u000d\u000a      coordination of inter-agency mechanisms. It suggested high-level expert\u000d\u000a      consultations for the Austrian government at the UN Human Rights Council\u000d\u000a      and informed the final UN Action Plan to combat violence against\u000d\u000a      journalists on how to monitor progress at both national and international\u000d\u000a      levels. This Action Plan, prepared during the first UN Inter-Agency\u000d\u000a      Meeting on the safety of journalists and the issue of impunity, will\u000d\u000a      establish an inter-agency mechanism to monitor progress and assist\u000d\u000a      countries in the development of legislation favouring freedom of\u000d\u000a      expression. Evidence of the application of the recommendations made by the\u000d\u000a      Impunity Initiative at City can be identified in the UNESCO 2013-2014\u000d\u000a      strategy on freedom of speech (p.28) [10].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The number of journalists killed or injured in the course of their work\u000d\u000a      around the world has increased.

Professor Tumber has been a faculty member of City since 1988\u000d\u000a      and Director of the CLJJ. Professor Woods joined City in 2008 and was the\u000d\u000a      Director of Law for CLJJ until August 2013. The project aims to provide an\u000d\u000a      independent platform to assess the effectiveness of existing legal,\u000d\u000a      political and institutional safeguards against violence directed at\u000d\u000a      journalists and to present the case for more effective international\u000d\u000a      mechanisms to counter such crimes and end impunity. Underpinning the\u000d\u000a      Initiative are monographs, research papers, desk-based research, a\u000d\u000a      database, a conference and collaborative consultations among academics,\u000d\u000a      legal experts and national and inter-governmental organisations, examples\u000d\u000a      of which are given below.\u000d\u000a    A series of publications shaped the development of the sociological part\u000d\u000a      of the Initiative. These included Media at war: the Iraq Crisis\u000d\u000a      (2004) [1], co-authored by Tumber and Palmer (Emeritus Professor at London\u000d\u000a      Metropolitan University), which offered an analytical account and provided\u000d\u000a      inspiration for future research and an invaluable framework to journalists\u000d\u000a      and other audiences for understanding how war coverage and media\u000d\u000a      organisations operate in situations of violent conflict. Tumber and\u000d\u000a      Webster's monograph, Journalists under Fire (2006) [2] constituted\u000d\u000a      the first book that compiled detailed empirical research on frontline\u000d\u000a      journalism. The legal aspects of the research were produced by Xenos\u000d\u000a      (Research Assistant in The City Law School during this time) who conducted\u000d\u000a      a systematic review of existing human rights and international\u000d\u000a      legislation, which informed subsequent research. Dr Draghici (Law, at City\u000d\u000a      since 2009) and Woods produced a Legal Instruments Study for the Safety of\u000d\u000a      Journalists and the issue of Impunity that was published at the\u000d\u000a      Headquarters of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural\u000d\u000a      Organization (UNESCO) on 13th and 14th September\u000d\u000a      2011 [5]. The Initiative also presented several reports providing material\u000d\u000a      for collaborative consultation with members of The Open Society\u000d\u000a      Foundation, Norwegian PEN and UNESCO. A complementary Political Aspects\u000d\u000a      Study was produced by Horsley (CFOM) in May 2011 in the form of a\u000d\u000a      free-standing pamphlet.

The direct political\u000d\u000a      impact of the report is further evidenced by Lord Howell, the Chairman of\u000d\u000a      the House of Lords Committee on Soft Power, who said at the Committee's\u000d\u000a      meeting on 15th July 2013: `The excellent paper that comes\u000d\u000a        from the British Council...states, which I rather like, that \"soft power\u000d\u000a        involves the things that make people love a country rather than fear it.\"[8]\u000d\u000a    Influence and Attraction had additional impact in promoting public\u000d\u000a      comment and debate about soft power. The Financial Times [9]\u000d\u000a      devoted an article to a discussion of the report, saying that \"Governments\u000a        are waking up to soft power\". Dorian Lynskey's article about the\u000d\u000a      report on The Guardian website garnered 226 comments [10]. The\u000d\u000a      report was also covered by the Huffington Post [11] and by\u000d\u000a      London's Evening Standard [12].\u000d\u000a    The most direct financial impact of Holden's work on Cultural Diplomacy\u000d\u000a      can be seen in the creation of the World Collections Programme (WCP) which\u000d\u000a      provided a grant of &#163;3M between 2008 and 2011 to enable the British\u000d\u000a      Library, British Museum, Natural History Museum, Royal Botanic Gardens\u000d\u000a      Kew, Tate and the V&amp;A to undertake work in the priority areas of the\u000d\u000a      Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Melissa Nisbett of King's College London\u000d\u000a      wrote [13]: \"There was a general consensus [that the] research was a\u000d\u000a        catalyst for the WCP grant being awarded to the cultural organisations:\u000d\u000a        (1) It heightened the realisation among politicians of the importance of\u000d\u000a        culture in the formation of international relations... (Senior Policy\u000d\u000a        Adviser); (2) That was the trigger that unlocked the World Collections\u000d\u000a        money...(Senior Strategist)...\". In turn, Jonathan Williams, Deputy\u000d\u000a      Director of the British Museum, has confirmed the impact of the WCP not\u000d\u000a      only on the partner institutions, but in terms of public benefit: \"The\u000d\u000a        partners in the World Collections Programme were established not just to\u000d\u000a        be great London institutions, but to put their collections to work for\u000d\u000a        worldwide public benefit. The WCP brought these organisations together\u000d\u000a        as never before and enabled them to deliver their international\u000d\u000a        programmes in a concerted fashion, working together to enable these six\u000d\u000a        great world collections really to belong to the world.\" [14] Holden\u000d\u000a      has given public speeches about cultural diplomacy internationally: in\u000d\u000a      Tokyo at the invitation of the Japan Foundation (2010) (covered on TV and\u000d\u000a      in the press), in Barcelona (2009) and in Berlin (2009).\u000d\u000a    Cultural Value\u000d\u000a    Holden's papers dealing with cultural value and published by Demos have\u000d\u000a      had a wide impact and have been well-received. The Chair of the Arts\u000d\u000a      Council of Wales wrote `I warmed, as I would have expected, immediately\u000d\u000a        to your wise and determined pamphlet (Democratic Culture). [5] I\u000d\u000a        have nothing but praise' and wrote separately that `Arts Council\u000d\u000a        Wales has relied heavily on the research intelligence conducted and\u000d\u000a        published in recent years by John Holden.' [15]\u000d\u000a    Between 2008 and July 2013 Holden gave speeches and presentations on\u000d\u000a      cultural value and associated issues to 46 non-academic audiences, 21 in\u000d\u000a      the UK and 25 overseas. Some were at international gatherings of\u000d\u000a      politicians and administrators, such as the Cyprus and Czech EU Presidency\u000d\u000a      cultural conferences (2012 and 2009 respectively) and the Singapore Global\u000d\u000a      Arts exchange (2010). Through these talks Holden has had an impact on that\u000d\u000a      constituency, as witnessed by a comment in a letter from Japan's Kanagawa\u000d\u000a      Foundation (2012): `The following remarks are just a small selection of\u000d\u000a        the many glowing comments we received about your talk from attendees:\u000d\u000a        \"As someone who works in government and management, the talk helped me\u000d\u000a        to understand the importance of explaining the role of culture\"'.\u000d\u000a    Some of the speeches have been in professional fora such as keynotes for\u000d\u000a      the Arts Marketing Association (AMA) annual conference in 2008 and 2009.\u000d\u000a      The Executive Director of the AMA wrote: \"Feedback from delegates for\u000d\u000a        his presentation was exceptionally high; ... Presenting a coherent and\u000d\u000a        thought-provoking session raising real practical issues.\" Another\u000d\u000a      practitioner, the Chief Executive of the Historic Royal Palaces, wrote \"John\u000a        has a pre-eminent reputation as a creative thinker, provocative writer\u000d\u000a        and great communicator about cultural policy.\" [17]\u000d\u000a    Holden has also given public lectures, including at the Sydney Opera\u000d\u000a      House (2011), Adelaide (2009) and Edmonton (2008). The conference: `Future\u000a        of the City: The Arts Symposium' (June 2011), organised by The\u000d\u000a      Cultural Policy Center and the Office of Civic Engagement at The\u000d\u000a      University of Chicago and the National Endowment for the Arts, attracted a\u000d\u000a      high-level mixed audience that included the editor of the Chicago\u000d\u000a        Tribune and the writer of The Wire. The organisers later\u000d\u000a      emailed: \"Thank you for your excellent introductory talk framing our\u000d\u000a        symposium conversations on June 7. Everyone I have talked with since the\u000d\u000a        event has specifically mentioned how thoughtful and illuminating your\u000d\u000a        talk was. Thanks so much for starting the day out in a way that framed\u000d\u000a        the issues so effectively for a very eclectic audience.\"\u000d\u000a    Public impact has also been achieved through media appearances in the UK,\u000d\u000a      where Holden has appeared on the Today Programme, Front Row\u000d\u000a      and You and Yours; and in Australia, Canada, Malta, the Czech\u000d\u000a      Republic, Hong Kong and Japan. There are at least 8 videos of Holden's\u000d\u000a      speeches and presentations posted on YouTube and Vimeo, with 4,807 hits.\u000d\u000a      [19]\u000d\u000a    Politicians and practitioners have sought direct meetings to discuss\u000d\u000a      cultural value. For example, the Overview and Scrutiny Committee at\u000d\u000a      Maidstone Borough Council, whose members were undertaking an \"in-depth\u000d\u000a      review of the value of leisure and culture\" wrote to Holden as they were\u000d\u000a      \"... extremely keen to discuss with you your work on valuing culture.\"\u000d\u000a      The impact is also international. As Calgary Arts wrote: `Holden...was\u000d\u000a        invaluable in assisting Calgary's leaders in gaining a clear\u000d\u000a        understanding of the valuable role that culture plays for a city and its\u000d\u000a        citizens.' [21]\u000d\u000a\u0009\u0009Holden has had a major impact on cultural\u000d\u000a      leadership. Together with the British cultural historian Robert Hewison,\u000d\u000a      he advised the philanthropist Dame Vivien Duffield on the creation of the\u000d\u000a      Clore Leadership Programme. As a result she has invested &#163;1M in the\u000d\u000a      Programme each year since 2003 with 253 cultural leaders awarded\u000d\u000a      Fellowships to date. The scheme has, according to Arts Professional, been\u000d\u000a      `widely praised'. In the Daily Telegraph of 25th\u000d\u000a      September 2009, Rupert Christiansen wrote that: `A major agency of\u000d\u000a        improvement has been the Clore Leadership Programme...devised by John\u000d\u000a        Holden and Robert Hewison.'

In a series of\u000d\u000a      works [1-7], notably Cultural Value and the Crisis of Legitimacy\u000d\u000a      (2006) [1]; Democratic Culture (2008) [5]; and Culture and\u000d\u000a        Class (2010) [6], he made a major contribution to debates about\u000d\u000a      cultural value both in the UK and internationally. His research provides a\u000d\u000a      conceptual framework for the articulation of the societal value of culture\u000d\u000a      (broadly defined to encompass the arts, commercial culture and `homemade'\u000d\u000a      culture, both traditional and of the internet age) by identifying\u000d\u000a      intrinsic, instrumental and institutional values. In the UK context, it\u000d\u000a      provides a rationale for public funding and investigates political\u000d\u000a      attitudes to government support of cultural activity; and the relationship\u000d\u000a      of funded culture to the creative industries. Holden argues that the\u000d\u000a      relationship between politicians and professionals working in the cultural\u000d\u000a      sector has become fractious because of the funding system's obsession with\u000d\u000a      targets and instrumental economic and social outcomes. He suggests that\u000d\u000a      legitimacy for public funding should rest on a combination of cultural\u000d\u000a      quality, measurable outcomes and the public value created by cultural\u000d\u000a      institutions.\u000d\u000a    Cultural Value and the Crisis of Legitimacy [1] was launched by\u000d\u000a      the then Minister for Culture David Lammy, who said, \"I know how\u000d\u000a        influential John Holden's earlier work for Demos has been in bringing\u000d\u000a        the concept of public value to life in the cultural sector. So I am\u000d\u000a        pleased to see Demos making another valuable contribution to this\u000d\u000a        important debate. This is a vital area. It is at the heart of the\u000d\u000a        changes I want to bring about as Minister for Culture.\" The debate\u000d\u000a      on the value of culture, of which Holden was a prime instigator, continues\u000d\u000a      to resonate as evidenced by the AHRC's current &#163;2M Cultural Value\u000d\u000a        Project for which Holden is a member of the Advisory Group.\u000d\u000a    Following this work on cultural value, Holden, in collaboration with a\u000d\u000a      team of researchers at Demos, investigated the role of culture in\u000d\u000a      international relations. He argued that mass tourism, 24-hour news,\u000d\u000a      migration and the escalating use of the internet would combine to create a\u000d\u000a      situation where peer-to-peer global communication was widespread and where\u000d\u000a      much of the content of that communication would be cultural. Cultural\u000d\u000a        Diplomacy (2007) [2] argued that governments needed to pay more\u000d\u000a      attention to the subject of culture in international relations. The International\u000a        Journal of Cultural Policy noted that \"the report was debated in\u000d\u000a        the House of Lords and the House of Commons. It was credited with\u000d\u000a        heightening the realisation amongst politicians of the importance of\u000d\u000a        culture within international relations.\" (Nisbett, J. Cultural\u000d\u000a        Policy, 3-4 (2012)). In the House of Commons debate, Ed Vaizey, now\u000d\u000a      Minister for Culture said, \"the reason why cultural diplomacy is high\u000d\u000a        on the agenda is the publication of the Demos pamphlet on the issue. I\u000d\u000a        should like to take a few seconds to praise the work of John Holden.\"\u000d\u000a      (Hansard, 13\/3\/2007)\u000d\u000a    Holden's latest report for the British Council, `Influence and\u000d\u000a        Attraction: Culture and the race for soft power in the 21st century'\u000d\u000a      (2013) [7] examines the data and trends in the field of cultural relations\u000d\u000a      and suggests how countries may enhance their global standing through\u000d\u000a      culture by discussing the role of cultural institutions, educational\u000d\u000a      exchanges and the role of the media.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44545","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Throughout his academic career, Hopper has been committed to\u000a      communicating his work beyond an academic audience, and has maintained a\u000a      particular interest in adult education and distance learning. From 1999 to\u000a      the present he has worked as a tutor for Oxford University's Department\u000a      for Continuing Education (OUDCE). He has taught twenty-four 10-week\u000a      courses for their Weekly Public Programme Office, specialising in modern\u000a      and contemporary Irish literature and film, and literary adaptation (his\u000a      courses since 2008 include `Flann O'Brien: An Introduction to his\u000a      Writings' and `Irish Writing After Joyce'). Since 2008, he has taught six\u000a      week-long summer school programmes for international students on Irish\u000a      literature and film. He has also written and taught a series of online\u000a      programmes for OUDCE, including, most recently, `Modern Irish Literature'\u000a      (2008).

More recently, he contributed to\u000a      two radio documentaries on Flann O'Brien for Bookbound (Dublin\u000a      City FM, 2009), and Arts Tonight (RT&#201; Radio 1, 2011): http:\/\/www.rte.ie\/radio1\/arts-tonight\/programmes\/2013\/0909\/473230-arts-tonight-monday-9-september-2013\/?clipid=1307036\u000a      [listening figures: 15,000].\u000a    Hopper has written essays and reviews on Flann O'Brien for the New\u000a        Statesman (`With Love and Squalor' [`Critic at Large'], 15 August\u000a      2011) and the Irish Times (`The Balm and the Bane of the\u000a      Intelligentsia', 26 March 2011), and is a regular contributor to the Times\u000a        Literary Supplement.

To mark the centenary of Flann\u000a      O'Brien's birth in 2011, he was the keynote speaker at international\u000a      conferences held in Singapore and Vienna. Several other centenary events\u000a      were open to the public, including talks for the Woodstock Literary\u000a      Society, Oxfordshire (December 2011), the Irish Cultural Centre,\u000a      Hammersmith, London (October 2011), Trinity College, Dublin (October\u000a      2011), Birkbeck College, London (May 2011), and Sligo Institute of\u000a      Technology (February 2010). Hopper is also a member of the International\u000a      Flann O'Brien Society (Steering Committee, 2011-present).\u000a    This impact feeds into a developing network of links with cultural and\u000a      community organisations in Britain and Ireland, and further afield in\u000a      Europe and Southeast Asia. In June 2013, to mark the publication of The\u000a        Short Fiction of Flann O'Brien, the book was launched at the Irish\u000a      Embassy in Rome during the Second International Flann O'Brien Conference\u000a      (this event was covered by the Irish Times: http:\/\/www.irishtimes.com\/culture\/books\/the-hard-life-meets-la-dolce-vita-1.1438055).\u000a      Other recent public events include an interview with actors\/directors Mark\u000a      O'Halloran and Mikel Murfi at Universit&#224; Roma Tre (June 2013), and a\u000a      public lecture on Flann O'Brien at St Mary's University College (April\u000a      2013). In February 2013, Hopper chaired a panel on Irish literature for Irish\u000a        Writing London at the Irish Cultural Centre, Hammersmith, which led\u000a      to him being invited to join the Advisory Board of the Irish Writers'\u000a      Festival, London.\u000a    As part of the 2013 Irish Writers Festival, Hopper was invited to give a\u000a      public lecture on Flann O'Brien at House of Commons, London (8 October\u000a      2013). (Although strictly speaking this event falls beyond the census\u000a      cut-off date (31 July), the impact being claimed is evidence of Hopper's\u000a      research influence on the group of MPs who sponsored the event, i.e. the\u000a      All Party Parliamentary Group on the Irish in Britain, a body of\u000a      considerable significance in this context.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study focuses primarily on Dr Keith Hopper's work on Flann\u000a      O'Brien and Neil Jordan. It demonstrates his re-evaluation of modern and\u000a      contemporary Irish writers and filmmakers, combined with his accessible\u000a      exploration of the interfaces between fiction and film. Hopper's research\u000a      focuses on formally innovative texts which challenge the dominant\u000a      conventions of Irish and international realism.

Based at the St Mary's Centre for Irish Studies (CIS) since\u000a      August 2012, the impact from research undertaken in 2012-13 draws,\u000a      unsurprisingly, on his already established research.

The revised 2nd edition of his\u000a      monograph, Flann O'Brien: A Portrait of the Artist a Young\u000a        Post-modernist (Cork: Cork UP, 2009), reconfigures O'Brien as a\u000a      highly subversive writer, and identifies The Third Policeman as\u000a      one of the earliest examples of post-modernist fiction.\u000a    In 2011, Hopper co-edited a special Flann O'Brien centenary issue of The\u000a        Review of Contemporary Fiction (Illinois: Dalkey Archive Press),\u000a      which includes essays by scholars from Ireland, Britain, the US, the Czech\u000a      Republic, Spain, France, Singapore and Australia. It was awarded the\u000a      International Flann O'Brien Society Award for Best Book, 2011-12.\u000a    In 2013, during his tenure as Research Fellow at the CIS, Hopper\u000a      co-edited The Short Fiction of Flann O'Brien (Illinois: Dalkey\u000a      Archive Press). This anthology features an inclusive selection of\u000a      O'Brien's short stories (written under several pseudonyms), as well as his\u000a      final unfinished novel. It also includes new translations of stories\u000a      originally published in Irish and other previously unpublished pieces.\u000a    Hopper has published numerous essays on O'Brien, including a chapter in Literature\u000a        and Ethics: Questions of Responsibility in Literary Studies (New\u000a      York: Cambria Press, 2009) and an article in Printed Project 12: Virtual\u000a        Fictional (Dublin, July 2010). His forthcoming publications include\u000a      the lead chapter in Flann O'Brien: Contesting Legacies (Cork: Cork\u000a      UP, 2014). This research links in with CIS colleagues Dr Richard Mills and\u000a      Dr Anne Goudsmit, who both work in the area of modern and contemporary\u000a      Irish writing.\u000a    (ii) Hopper's work on Neil Jordan centres on his DPhil dissertation\u000a      (awarded February 2013). This will be published by Oxford University Press\u000a      in 2014 under the title Imagining Otherwise: Neil Jordan's Fictions\u000a        and Films. Much has been written about Jordan's film work, although\u000a      his fiction has been less well served. While this monograph does examine\u000a      Jordan's films, the primary focus is on the literary texts. Jordan's\u000a      counterrealist fiction is considered in terms of the Irish literary\u000a      tradition, and in the broader context of Irish politics and history.\u000a    Hopper has also published numerous articles on Jordan, including, most\u000a      recently, an article in Litteraria Pragensia (December 2012) and a\u000a      chapter in Shadows of the Gunmen: Violence and the Modern Irish\u000a        Experience (Cork: Cork UP, 2008). This research links at CIS to Prof\u000a      Lance Pettitt, who has also written on Jordan's films and non-realist\u000a      film-work of Thaddeus O'Sullivan and John T. Davis.\u000a    (iii) Prior to 2008, Hopper was the general editor of the of the\u000a      twelve-volume Ireland into Film series (Cork UP, 2001-2007), which\u000a      examined adaptations of Irish literary classics. Authors commissioned\u000a      include internationally-renowned scholars such as Colin MacCabe, Margot\u000a      Norris, Cheryl Herr, and Lance Pettitt (whose 2001 volume appeared in the\u000a      series). This ongoing research on adaptation ties in well with essays by\u000a      Pettitt on William Trevor (2013) and by Mills on Bernard MacLaverty\u000a      (2014). Hopper's recent writing on adaptation includes an article in Danny\u000a        Boyle: Interviews (Mississippi: University Press of Mississippi,\u000a      2011), and a chapter on Aidan Higgins and Harold Pinter in Aidan\u000a        Higgins, the Fragility of Form: Critical Essays and Observations\u000a      (Illinois: Dalkey Archive Press, 2010).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44547","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1036973","Name":"Mozambique"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3865483","Name":"Argentina"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact feeds into a developing network of links with cultural and\u000d\u000a      community organizations in Britain and Ireland in particular, but\u000d\u000a      increasingly further afield.

This is demonstrated to\u000d\u000a      operate in both first and subsequent generation Irish people, but in\u000d\u000a      different ways, and consequently it informs a wider, longitudinal\u000d\u000a      understanding of Ireland's cultural history.

In\u000a      2009 Heald was awarded the Stiwdio Safle award (Arts Council Wales) which\u000a      involved a residency in an acute inpatient psychiatric unit at Glan Clwyd\u000a      Hospital N. Wales. Liggett was invited to co-facilitate the painting\u000a      workshops and to make collaborative works based on their shared\u000a      theoretical interests and experiences of working in the hospital. The\u000a      Ablett residency gave artists, Heald and Liggett, the opportunity to\u000a      converse with patients, and staff allowing them to further explore art and\u000a      science collaborations and theoretical notions of 'in-between-ness.' Out\u000a      of this work, Visualising the Invisible was an exhibition\u000a      that they co- curated at Glyndwr University as part of the Wrexham Science\u000a      Festival in July 2010. The exhibition featured patients and artist's\u000a      individual and collaborative artworks consisting of images of numerous\u000a      small paintings on gesso board, a selection of photographs and several\u000a      experimental short films. The films were presented as projections onto\u000a      walls and on specific objects, such as the medical screens. The exhibits\u000a      displayed rhythms, colours and trace, communicating ideas that the\u000a      patients have been unable to articulate in the spoken word but expressed\u000a      through their artworks. There were both therapeutic and collaborative\u000a      elements in the production and editing of the art works.\u000a    In further research in collaboration with Dr Richard Tranter, consultant\u000a      psychiatrist, Prof. Robert Poole, Professor of Mental Health and GP\u000a      surgeries, Heald and Liggett proposed new perspectives into the effects of\u000a      anti-depressant medications. Scientists know that antidepressants subtly\u000a      alter the way people perceive emotional stimuli around them, altering\u000a      people's social behaviours, on a level that people are not consciously\u000a      aware of. Through arts\/science research the collaborators are interested\u000a      to explore if patient changes are reflected in the way people express\u000a      themselves and respond to their environment, prior, during and post\u000a      antidepressant medication. The collaborative arts\/science practice\u000a      explored these interests through creative, patient led, artistic\u000a      expressions of change alongside conventional, reductionist measures of\u000a      changing depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory) producing\u000a      sophisticated fusions of art\/science. The aim of the study was to help\u000a      understand some of the effects of antidepressants and how people recover\u000a      from depression. This work was set in the context of a rapidly expanding\u000a      knowledge of how the brain processes emotional stimuli, how these\u000a      processes are affected by depression, and how these processes change in\u000a      response to treatment. People with depression show characteristic changes\u000a      in the way they perceive the world around them, particularly the way they\u000a      interpret emotional stimuli, for example interpreting facial expressions\u000a      in others. To inform future directions of research in this area this\u000a      innovative art\/science collaboration explored experiential changes during\u000a      treatment with antidepressants. In addition to the aims of the\u000a      psychiatrists, the artists were keen to explore the role of preverbal\u000a      language and creativity for patients navigating the \"in-between-ness\"\u000a      from depression to recovery. This was informed by concepts of preverbal\u000a      language and `in-between-ness' and `psychological resonance'.\u000a    The work has been disseminated through exhibitions and performances (e.g.\u000a      Videoformes film screening and live performance event in Trinty\u000a      Church, Salford live streamed to Maison du Peuple, Clermont-Ferrand,\u000a      France (15th March 2012); Film to Change, A selection of short\u000a      films on the subject of mental health - White film screened\u000a      as part of the Film to Change series Albert Room, Leeds Town Hall (16th\u000a      November 2010) and conference papers (e.g. Claiming Creativity: Art\u000a      Education in Cultural Transition (21 - 24 April 2010) at Columbia College,\u000a      Chicago, USA, ESA Research Network Sociology for the Arts, University of\u000a      Lisbon, Portugal `European Society or European Societies' (2 - 5 September\u000a      2009)\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44579","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact of UoA36 36-1 is most clearly demonstrated in its\u000d\u000a      peer-reviewed successes in the\u000d\u000a      awards fora for the audio broadcast industries.

Through\u000d\u000a      archive research and\u000d\u000a      commentary, the programme explores the way that northern English\u000d\u000a      masculinities have been\u000d\u000a      portrayed in British film and television, reconciling issues of blatant\u000d\u000a      sentimentality with the real-life\u000d\u000a      social parallels that inform the canon of the past 50 years.\u000d\u000a    `Affluent Workers Revisited, Revisited' was conceived, researched and\u000d\u000a      written and produced by\u000d\u000a      Harrison in collaboration with presenter Sarfraz Manzoor and sociologist\u000d\u000a      Prof. Fiona Devine.\u000d\u000a      Harrison had developed an interest while an undergraduate student in the\u000d\u000a      Goldthorpe study of\u000d\u000a      car workers (`Affluent Workers', Goldthorpe) in the 1960's and Fiona\u000d\u000a      Devine's subsequent study\u000d\u000a      of a similar Luton-based sample in the 1980s.

A spokesman for the Poverty Al iance said of this research in 2013: \"There is little doubt that this piece of work for JRF influenced our thinking around influencing public attitudes to poverty &hellip; We continue to use the research in discussion about the media and poverty, so it has a continuing influence on our work\" (see Section 5, Source 5).\u000d\u000a Between May 2008 and July 2009 there were a total of fifteen public engagement events related to the project. In addition to the official launch of the end-of-project report in London on 10 September 2008 - an event attended by a wide range of journalists, documentary makers, third-sector workers and people experiencing poverty - these included presentations to the All Parliamentary Group on Poverty, Westminster (June 2008); the BBC College of Journalism (September 2008); the Trades Union Congress National Conference (October 2008) and the Association of Journalism Educators (June 2009). In October 2009, as part of preparations for the launch of the EU Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion (2010), PIPI co-ordinator Teresa Hanley presented the key findings of the GCU report at a workshop facilitated by JRF during the European Commission's Poverty and Media Seminar in Brussels (Source 2), leading to an EU-funded project, with JRF on the advisory group, aimed at improving media coverage of people experiencing poverty and including development of a guide for EU journalists, thereby giving the project additional EU-wide reach.\u000d\u000a Following a presentation of the results of the project, the Society of Editors commissioned the 88- page Reporting Poverty in the UK: a Practical Guide for Journalists (2008, revised 2009, see Source 3 for download figures) offering advice and guidance on how to report poverty without reproducing negative stereotypes uncritically. This booklet was distributed to over 400 newspaper editors in the UK as well as to all journalism courses in UK universities, and also fed into the accompanying Reporting Poverty Resource Pack (download figures under Source 4) produced by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation for journalism tutors, trainers and students. Both of these documents specifically acknowledge their debt to, and the inspiration they have drawn from the findings of the GCU project.\u000d\u000a These dissemination activities led to focused efforts to change both professional journalism practices regarding reporting poverty and the representation of poverty in television drama. The news editor of a leading Scottish broadsheet (Source 7) reported that while her paper had always taken coverage of poverty-related issues seriously, the research had helped them to become more aware of the potentially negative effects of certain words or the use of certain images. A sub-editor at a leading tabloid (Source 8) commented that \"As a journalist who has had to report and edit on a series of differing poverty stories, I am familiar with this relevant guide. The issues surrounding poverty are complex and variable and this guide was useful at helping to clarify and simplify subject matters. It was also used to determine appropriate words and phrases to use correctly and without prejudice\". A Senior Development Officer of BBC Drama (Source 8) indicated that the report had made for interesting reading and was certainly an issue she would bear in mind when developing storylines for upcoming dramas. In addition the report provided material for a 2013 Royal Television Society lecture on Social Class and Television.\u000d\u000aIn terms of policy-related impact, the Scottish Government commissioned McKendrick to write Briefing Paper 26, Writing &amp; Talking about Poverty, in January 2011 (Source 9). This stresses the need for \"careful consideration to be given to how we describe poverty and argues that language is an important tool that should be mobilised in anti-poverty activity\". The Poverty Al iance \"Stick&nbsp;Your Labels\" campaign, based on the findings of the GCU report and aimed at eradicating the use of stigmatising language in relation to those experiencing poverty (Source 5), was subsequently publicly endorsed by the leaders of all the main Scottish political parties. Further evidence can be found in the impact assessment which JRF commissioned for the PIPI project as a whole (Source 1). A government policy maker on poverty and social exclusion in Northern Ireland interviewed as part of this assessment pointed out how the project's focus on the ways in which damaging stereotypes can be reproduced unthinkingly had \"alerted her to the danger of using the language of the 'underclass'\" (page 21). Although the Reporting Poverty Guide was not written with third-sector workers in mind, members of this group interviewed as part of the PIPI impact assessment found the GCU subproject extremely useful in many ways. For example \"A grassroots discussant in Liverpool said the 'Reporting Poverty' guide was \"one of the best marketing tools ever to get it out to people how bad journalism can entrench negative attitudes to people stuck in poverty, and the subsequent effect it has on society\" (page 20).\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a The primary beneficiaries of Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU) research into media representations of poverty are people experiencing poverty themselves.

The Discourse Analysis sections (primarily Chapters 4 and 5) of the report (Reference 1 below) built on a long-standing research effort by members of the CCMS group into Discourse Analysis of newspaper reporting of a range of social issues, most notably representations of asylum seekers (Reference 3), and analysis of both the dramatisation of social issues in television serials (References 2, 5 and 6) and their narrativisation in television news (Reference 4). The innovative nature of this research - it was the first to mobilise Bourdieu's concept of differing forms of capital to analyse representations of poverty - led to O'Donnel being invited to participate in a similar project and to produce related publications in Spain (References 2 and 4).\u000d\u000a The main findings of the research were:\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a a consistent tendency among sections of the press to frame poverty reporting through negative and damaging stereotypes of those experiencing poverty, largely blaming them for their situation and presenting them as entirely lacking in resources\u000d\u000a a likewise strong tendency in television productions to either render poverty invisible by redefining it as a lack of social capital (the case of serials) or to equate it with notions of an \"underclass\" (reality programming) undeserving of social support\u000d\u000a the existence of only a tiny minority of programmes (among these The Secret Millionaire) which attempted to offer an alternative to the dominant representation Following widespread dissemination and media coverage of the findings (see for example Section 5, Source 10), journalists, television drama producers and politicians undertook to change - and have changed - both their discourse and their practice in relation to representing poverty.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"44637","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    In 1998 Gaelic support organisations and Scottish Government\u000d      policy-makers on Gaelic were only beginning to question previous language\u000d      policy which saw English as the utilitarian language of business, and\u000d      Gaelic as the language of church and home. Our research has played a key\u000d      role in changing this perception and leading to new policy initiatives in\u000d      this field. This can be seen in clear pronouncements within subsequent\u000d      policy documents from both the Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE)\u000d      Economic and Development Agency and others stressing the benefit of\u000d      investment in Gaelic language arts and culture for wider economic and\u000d      social development. As the Chair of the Gaelic Language Board put it six\u000d      years ago,&#160; when the impact of the research was making itself clearly\u000d      felt: \"Some of the best research in Gaelic is now coming from Glasgow\u000d      Caledonian\" (West Highland Free Press, 16th February\u000d        2007).\u000d     In 2007 Chalmers was invited to contribute to seminars\u000d        held by the Gaelic television funding agency MG Alba on the relationship\u000d        between Gaelic arts and culture and the economy. The argument stressing\u000d        the link between the two subsequently featured in the debates leading up\u000d        to the establishment of BBC Alba. The relevance of this research also\u000d        led to the involvement of Chalmers and O'Donnel in the Framework 6 EU\u000d        Integrated Project DYLAN - Language Dynamics and the management of\u000d          diversity - which brought in &#163;160k to GCU over 5 years (October\u000d        2005 - September 2010). The work of this IP was described as \"exemplary\"\u000d        by the European Commission and a resultant summary which included the\u000d        explicit approach of Chalmers and Sproull in relation to Scotland was\u000d        disseminated throughout Europe in popular form in six languages to\u000d        policy makers working at the interface between language and the economy.\u000d        The project also featured in news reports on BBC Alba (20th November\u000d        2009) and on the BBC's Gaelic-language radio station Radio nan G&#224;idheal,\u000d        whose reach is 80 percent of Gaelic speakers in Scotland.\u000d     The 1998 and 2006 reports have also been quoted in the\u000d        background documents against which the Glasgow Gaelic Language Plan was\u000d        constructed in 2008, with Chalmers being invited to be part of the\u000d        underpinning design team: one result is that in recent years there has\u000d        been a notable increase in the demand for places at Gaelic-speaking\u000d        schools in Glasgow and other parts of the geographical area covered by\u000d        the reports. The approach of identifying the Gaelic Economy and its link\u000d        to arts and culture was key to a further report, of which Chalmers was\u000d        also co-author, commissioned by the Gaelic Language Board: the\u000d        Hecla\/Chalmers\/Danson\/McLeod report on Measuring the Gaelic Labour\u000d          Market - Current and Future Potential (2008).\u000d     The publication of this last report led to a seminar\u000d        on the Gaelic Labour Market and Skills Development hosted by Highland\u000d        and Islands Enterprise (HIE) and Comunn na G&#224;idhlig (the Gaelic Language\u000d        Society) in November 2011, where opening remarks were given by the\u000d        Government Minister for Learning and Skills, and keynote introductions\u000d        given by Hecla Consulting (principal author of the report) and by the\u000d        Scottish Government Employability, Skills and Lifelong Learning Analysis\u000d        team. The seminar was attended by representatives of the Scottish\u000d        Government; HIE; Highland Council; Skills Development Scotland; Creative\u000d        Scotland; MG Alba; the Social Enterprise Academy and BBC Scotland. A\u000d        follow up working party was agreed, which is continuing its work to\u000d        identify skills gaps and subsequent possible action. The holistic\u000d        approach championed by the reports and their underpinning research is\u000d        currently mirrored in documents produced by different policy and\u000d        government agencies: for example HIE's \"Strengthening the Gaelic\u000d        language\" (2009) focuses on young people, broadcasting, cultural tourism\u000d        and the arts as a priority, working with partners including Comunn na\u000d        G&#224;idhlig, the Gaelic Festival Society and the Gaelic Arts Agency. An\u000d        Lochran's \"Gaelic Arts Strategy\" (2005) focuses on \"core, strategic and\u000d        project activities to develop a Gaelic arts infrastructure in Glasgow\".\u000d     At the public launch of Chalmers and Sproull's second\u000d        research report in 2006 the Chair of HIE said in its praise: \"Investing\u000d        in &#8230; the native language and cultural traditions of the&#160; region\u000d        will &#8230; lead to business creation and ultimately higher GDP.

However, prescriptions for\u000d      economic and social development in Gaelic-speaking areas through\u000d      industrialisation and the development of growth poles or technological\u000d      clusters did not halt the decline of the population, or the use of the\u000d      language, in peripheral communities where Gaelic was prevalent. The first\u000d      longitudinal report by Chalmers and Sproull, published in 1998 - The\u000d        Demand for Gaelic Artistic and Cultural Products and Services (Reference\u000d      1 below) - challenged these assumptions and initiated a change in attitude\u000d      to this question, placing Gaelic language, arts and culture at the centre\u000d      of economic regeneration and progress. The second report published in 2006\u000d      - The demand for Gaelic Goods and Services in the Western Isles and\u000d        Skye and Lochalsh-a 10 year Longitudinal Study - developed the\u000d      analysis further by focusing on artistic and cultural activity related to\u000d      the Gaelic language as a motor for economic development within the\u000d      framework of a more internally driven approach to sub-regional economic\u000d      development, at the same time establishing the concept of the \"Gaelic\u000d      Economy\" as the accepted approach to conceptualising work in this area.\u000d     More recent research has examined in depth the successful implementation\u000d      of this approach by the Highland Council, the main local council in the\u000d      Gaelic-speaking area, highlighting the need for a recognised mechanism for\u000d      assessing both the language revitalisation and the economic regeneration\u000d      impact of potential projects (Reference 2) and showed a novel connection\u000d      between the G&#224;idhealtachd - the traditional geographically-based\u000d      Western Isles Gaelic heartland dealt with in the first report - and a\u000d      revised conception of the G&#224;idhealtachd based on cities and\u000d      labour markets outside of the Islands, where Gaelic language and culture\u000d      were now becoming embedded within the creative sector thereby allowing\u000d      increasing connectivity across these island and mainland geographies\u000d      (References 3 and 4). This expanded focus has also revealed how evidence\u000d      appears to exist that the presence of an (albeit dispersed)\u000d      Gaelic-speaking community in Glasgow has enabled a particular cultural\u000d      dynamic in the Gaelic arts and cultural sector there which is not matched\u000d      in the English-language arts and cultural sector, allowing the analysis in\u000d      the 1998 report to be further applied to urban areas (Reference 5).\u000d      On-going research has further extended the framework of analysis to\u000d      include the impact of recent developments in the Gaelic-language media\u000d      landscape and has supplied evidence of how the launch of the BBC Alba\u000d      Gaelic-language television channel in 2008 - one outcome of the processes\u000d      illustrated in the 1998 report - also contributed to reinforcing diversity\u000d      through a strengthening of the language itself (Reference 6).\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44651","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    An impact of this research has been to enable inter-tribal networks\u000a      across Kenya to document their suppressed histories, identify their\u000a      community needs, and become empowered agents in a process of peace and\u000a      reconciliation. Skills 4 Rural Kenya is a charity focusing on\u000a      removing barriers to ICT provision due to inadequate infrastructures and\u000a      lack of skilled workforce by providing equipment donation, capacity\u000a      building, skills training and research and development (source 5.1). It\u000a      has been modelled on the community informatics research of DAY [3.2, 3.3]\u000a      and his co-researchers. The work of this charity has been welcomed by the\u000a      UN and Kenyan government, which have asked the organisation to expand on\u000a      previous initiatives to help overcome the digital divide between urban and\u000a      rural Kenya. ICT initiatives in Mtandao Viganjani are community-owned\u000a      rural networks acting as diverse communal information resource\u000a      mobilisation centres and community advocacy and awareness spaces,\u000a      providing a converging point of community synergy. Empowerment of\u000a      marginalised and victim communities in Kenya has been facilitated through\u000a      the provision of audiovisual filming technology and enhanced access to ICT\u000a      in the community. The charity has distributed over 500 computers to 17\u000a      villages across Kenya; this in addition to the two prototype initiatives\u000a      in Kibugat and Antubochiu (target total=195 centres, provision of 20,000\u000a      computers, reaching potentially two million people across the age-range).\u000a      Videos, created by young Kenyans, that reflected on post-election\u000a      violence, demonstrated how rural tribes could employ appropriate\u000a      technology to raise issues within their local communities. This created a\u000a      platform from which local voices could be heard (5.4). Focus Youth\u000a      International said of UoB's work in providing training that facilitated\u000a      the use of ICT in peace-promotion in the run-up to the 2013 national\u000a      elections: `We have used the materials made by Day and his teams\u000a      in our work on reconciliation and peace-building in relation to\u000a      inter-tribal relations. It has been most valuable in helping us give a\u000a      voice to victims and those previously disenfranchised from public debate'\u000a      (5.8, 5.3).\u000a    A further impact of the research has been to help citizens to understand\u000a      their democratic place in a wider society and polity in order to affect\u000a      their political participation. Rongo University College, Kenya, has\u000a      adopted the UoB community informatics research model, following UoBs\u000a      `inspiring example' in training communities and marginal groups in\u000a      communications technologies (5.6). Building on this research, Rongo has\u000a      taken the decision to establish a modern multi-media centre based on\u000a      outreach to needy communities and groups, including youth and communities\u000a      in remote rural areas. The International Youth Council (Kenya Chapter)\u000a      observes, quoting the direct words of one of its peaceworkers: `ICT\u000a      training, particularly film-making, was essential to equip the youths in\u000a      their numbers, from ethnic diversity, and tell their story and take the\u000a      message out from here of the need for peace, using technology ... the\u000a      Kibugat and ICT initiative opened a remote village in Kenya, united by ICT\u000a      and Peace irrespective of their ethnic background, to the windows of the\u000a      world' (5.7).\u000a    The research has generated new practices of participatory, community-led\u000a      and neighbourhood planning, identifying community needs and using agile\u000a      technologies with partner agencies, for practical community development,\u000a      as in the introduction of community media centre models in Kenya, and the\u000a      adoption of neighbourhood planning models in rural Sussex. The Chairperson\u000a      of the International Youth Council (Kenya) sees adoption of the UoB model\u000a      as `the start of an initiative that will go a long way in exchanging media\u000a      best practices between UoB and our youth while laying foundations for the\u000a      media training center and online radio. This will be critical also in\u000a      promoting citizen journalism and exposing real time stories by the people,\u000a      for the people and used by the people'.\u000a    Action in Rural Sussex (AiRS), working with GANT, has adopted UoB\u000a      research in its developmental policies. AiRs CEO writes `Nick Gant's work\u000a      and the partnership project concept and toolkit Community21 has challenged\u000a      some of our presumptions about policy needs for small rural communities,\u000a      and brought back the community itself into processes such as neighbourhood\u000a      planning'. Following independent and positive evaluation of the Community21\u000a      prototype, AiRS, in its Business Plan, 2012-14, states its\u000a      development objective to `roll out the community-led planning tool,\u000a      Community21, in Sussex, the South East, and at least five other counties\u000a      through a partnership with other rural community councils' (5.2). The CEO\u000a      confirms that `the principle of neighbourhood and community planning is\u000a      now vital to our policy implementation processes' (5.5).\u000a    Partnerships between academic researchers and non-academics in\u000a      participatory research have constituted a form of democratic research\u000a      design, a radicalisation of the more passive action research model. These\u000a      partnerships, thriving as forms of knowledge exchange, have been developed\u000a      in localities, adopted by regional and national agencies, and applied in\u000a      international settings.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This impact case study focuses on the effects of digital technologies on\u000a      rural communities, including networks of inter-tribal relationships in\u000a      Kenya.

Based\u000a      in UoB's then Department of Library and Information Studies GILL's early\u000a      work on the information society and foundations of human-centred systems\u000a      design developed a model that placed users firmly at the centre an\u000a      emergent digital world, and proposed the bringing together of researchers,\u000a      practitioners, entrepreneurs, and social and cultural actors in the\u000a      application of digital technologies in social and cultural development.\u000a      His work emphasised individual creativity and personal empowerment\u000a      alongside changes being brought to social and community values in a\u000a      networked society. Over the next decade GILL's pioneering work [3.1] was\u000a      built upon by DAY (with Schuler), developing approaches to community needs\u000a      analysis and information technologies, and HENWOOD et al., exploring\u000a      dimensions of the digital divide in relation to everyday life [3.2].\u000a    This progressive mapping of an emerging network society led to a concern\u000a      with the dynamics of provision and use of the new technologies at\u000a      community and individual levels, and with the potential of ICTs to\u000a      transform the quality of everyday life. This, in turn, laid the\u000a      foundations for building a revised public sphere that would stimulate the\u000a      reinvigoration of civil society. DAY's work synthesized perspectives, in\u000a      the international context, and called for the further development of\u000a      models of participatory research into a collaborative model of democratic\u000a      design &#8212; a form of research with, in, and for, communities [3.3]. His\u000a      edited volume Community practice in the network society: Local\u000a        action\/global interactions (2004) confirmed the translational\u000a      potential of the model, and was described as `unique in the field' by\u000a      Frank Webster (in a review in the European Journal of Communication\u000a      20 (2), 2005). The research at Brighton progressed to further studies into\u000a      the role of ICTs in community development through digital-aided networking\u000a      in rural settings.\u000a    The CNAA\/ICT (Community Network Analysis &amp; Information and\u000a      Communication Technologies) project was one of 17 national case-studies in\u000a      the ESRC's PACCIT (People at the Centre of Communication and Information\u000a      Technologies) programme. The pilot study in Brighton\/Hove found that\u000a      community learning with, and through, network technologies &#8212; when situated\u000a      within meaningful contexts that promote reflective dialogue &#8212; will result\u000a      in the development of relationships of trust and friendship. This can be\u000a      seen as contributing to processes that stimulate the growth of social\u000a      capital [3.4]. If communities are to utilise effectively digital\u000a      technologies then these must be appropriate to the needs of the community\u000a      ecology. The impact evaluation report of the project concluded that: `The\u000a      number of successes afforded, particularly by the 17 later Phase, LINK and\u000a      LINK-like projects represent a successful portfolio...with a range of\u000a      impacts' (p.52). The UoB work has been mobilised further within the local\u000a      community, and applied in Kenya by, for example, Community Media 4\u000a        Kenya (CM4K) with non-academic stakeholders and partners.\u000a    This accumulative research demonstrated that policy assumptions about\u000a      digital technologies routinely misunderstand everyday needs, making it\u000a      imperative to develop forms of sustainable connectivity between\u000a      researchers and providers in meeting the needs of users. Parallel\u000a      participatory studies related to issues of local planning and design needs\u000a      grew out of work by GANT and CHAPMAN [3.5] on sustainability and design,\u000a      leading to GANT's generation of the planning and networking tool, Community21\u000a      (Toolbox for Sustainable Communities), described in `Community21: Digital\u000a      toolbox for sustainable communities' (GANT, N. and GITTINS, T., (2010) Gateways:\u000a        International Journal of Community Research and Engagement 3, pp.\u000a      155-170). The Community21 project was generated in the context of\u000a      new and emerging localism, deploying a range of digital interface,\u000a      participation and content management methods to foster the use by\u000a      communities of agile technologies [3.6]. Established in partnership with\u000a      the former Rural Community Council Network (Sussex), AiRS (Action\u000a      in Rural Sussex), it has engaged communities in self-reflection,\u000a      participation, and collaborative design of their neighbourhoods,\u000a      generating new roles for people as lay architects and planners of their\u000a      own community futures and neighbourhoods, and including digital activism\u000a      workshops for children and young people.\u000a    Key Researchers:\u000a    \u000a      \u000a        \u000a          Karamjit Gill:\u000a          &#160;Principal Lecturer (Jan 1970&#8211;July 2003)\u000a            Professor (Aug 2003&#8211;Dec 2003).\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Peter Day:\u000a          Senior Media Lab Technician (Jan 1994&#8211;Mar 1994),\u000a            Research Assistant (Apr 1994&#8211;Aug 1997), Lecturer (Sept 1997&#8211;May\u000a            2002), Senior Lecturer (June 2002&#8211;to date).\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Nick Gant:\u000a          Senior Lecturer (Sept 2000&#8211;July 2006), Principal\u000a            Lecturer (Aug 2006&#8211;November 2012), Assistant Head (Nov 2012&#8211;to\u000a            date).\u000a        \u000a        \u000a          Flis Henwood:\u000a          Senior Research Fellow (Feb 2001&#8211;Jan 2002), Senior\u000a            Lecturer (Feb 2002&#8211;Feb 2003), Principal Lecturer (Mar 2003&#8211;May\u000a            2003), Reader (May 2003&#8211;July 2006), Professor of Social Informatics\u000a            (Aug 2006&#8211;to date), Head of School (Dec 2007&#8211;May 2008).\u000a        \u000a      \u000a    \u000a    "}]

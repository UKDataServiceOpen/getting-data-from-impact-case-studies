First, tailored\u000d\u000a      collaborations with specific institutions have improved the communication\u000d\u000a      of conservation messages to visiting publics. Second, impact across the\u000d\u000a      sector has been achieved by creating new resources and training courses\u000d\u000a      for practitioners.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Improving International Conservation Education\u000d\u000a      In partnership with the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (290,000\u000d\u000a        visitors p.a.), the research findings were used to improve the quality\u000d\u000a        of their visitor experience through better exhibition design and more\u000d\u000a        robust evaluation. From 2011, the Trust began to implement focus\u000d\u000a        group-inspired improvements, while also continuing to monitor how these\u000d\u000a        were being received. The Trust's Wildlife Park had previously been\u000d\u000a        over-reliant on conveying information through dense and inaccessible\u000d\u000a        texts, which failed to communicate conservation messages effectively.\u000d\u000a        The research guided numerous changes to practices and communication\u000d\u000a        content, including changes in navigation aids around the park, the\u000d\u000a        development of new interactive means of delivering conservation messages\u000d\u000a        through audio guides, video displays and other communication systems\u000d\u000a        specifically designed for younger visitors, such as free web content and\u000d\u000a        blog posts. The new approach was light, image-rich and more\u000d\u000a        comprehensible. In addition, volunteers and interns were introduced to\u000d\u000a        offer guidance and information about new exhibits. To create the\u000d\u000a        impression of a natural habitat, jungle sounds and vegetation were\u000d\u000a        introduced in the reptile house. These changes were evaluated in 2012 in\u000d\u000a        a survey of c. 200 visitors to the park that provided clear evidence of\u000d\u000a        positive responses. Visitors demonstrated increased concern with (and\u000d\u000a        better understanding of) the importance of conserving wildlife habitats\u000d\u000a        while also showing more interest in taking action to protect threatened\u000d\u000a        species. The Trust has also modified their training programmes for\u000d\u000a        projects around the world: changes have been put in place for projects\u000d\u000a        overseas which have led to indigenous populations taking better care of\u000d\u000a        wildlife in their respective areas.\u000d\u000a      Research with the Zoological Society of London (1.2 million visitors\u000d\u000a        p.a.) has improved their use of systematic and high quality evaluation\u000d\u000a        techniques to determine the success of their public engagement\u000d\u000a        activities specifically aimed at children. The wider use of qualitative\u000d\u000a        evidence, such as annotated drawings for example, has replaced\u000d\u000a        evaluations based solely on visitor numbers as the means to assess\u000d\u000a        aspects of exhibit impact. Success is now measured in terms of learning.\u000d\u000a        Such innovations allow the zoo to understand the strengths and\u000d\u000a        weaknesses of their current public engagement practices and to take\u000d\u000a        appropriate action where needed.\u000d\u000a      Providing training resources for the conservation sector\u000d\u000a      The research has contributed to the development of best practice by not\u000d\u000a        only engaging the public with conservation messages but also developing\u000d\u000a        systems to evaluate the impact of conservation education. Both have been\u000d\u000a        communicated to professionals in the field though presentations at\u000d\u000a        practitioner conferences and the provision of training for those seeking\u000d\u000a        to impart conservation messages to the public. Research results have\u000d\u000a        been presented, by invitation, to practitioner audiences at over 30\u000d\u000a        conferences and workshops from 2009-2013, reaching over 2500\u000d\u000a        conservation educators directly. Examples include the British and Irish\u000d\u000a        Association of Zoos and Aquariums, Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust,\u000d\u000a        European Association of Zoos and Aquariums and the International Zoo\u000d\u000a        Education Association. Examples of impact on practice include exhibition\u000d\u000a        changes in Bioparco Roma\/Rome Zoo (1 million+ visitors p.a.) to improve\u000d\u000a        the quality of a high profile exhibition (June 2011). The researcher(s)\u000d\u000a        worked with the zoo in advance of a major new exhibition on small\u000d\u000a        primates. The Head of Education at the Zoo attended a training event\u000d\u000a        held at the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust where findings from the\u000d\u000a        research were presented. As a result, the Callitrichid Exhibit\u000d\u000a        was renamed The Smallest Monkey in the World, reflecting research\u000d\u000a        findings on the effectiveness of simplified messages. Jensen was invited\u000d\u000a        to inspect the results, which focused on adjustments from technical to\u000d\u000a        more generally understandable messages to excite greater public\u000d\u000a        attention. Equally, with reference to the research conducted for the\u000d\u000a        National Marine Aquarium in Mauritius, a redesign of their conservation\u000d\u000a        training programme created a more context-oriented understanding of\u000d\u000a        conservation of coral reefs that reached beyond scientific details and\u000d\u000a        specified practical conservation activities that could be recommended to\u000d\u000a        the island's visitors.\u000d\u000a      The research has been cited in media which reach a worldwide audience.\u000d\u000a        This included a BBC radio interview in 2010, which allowed Jensen to\u000d\u000a        share his research findings to a broader public audience. Evidence in\u000d\u000a        blog posts and online comments shows evidence of wider impact: the\u000d\u000a        research also had an impact when the results were cited in the public\u000d\u000a        debate about zoo ethics when Born Free's CEO engaged in detailed\u000d\u000a        critical discussion (see below).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The survival of many animal species is currently threatened by\u000d\u000a      environmental challenges and unsustainable resource consumption.

Three interlinked projects in collaboration with the\u000d\u000a      Zoological Society of London (ZSL, 2009-2011), the Durrell Wildlife\u000d\u000a      Conservation Trust, Jersey (DWCT, 2010-2012) and the National Marine\u000d\u000a      Aquarium, Mauritius (NMA, 2013) underpinned this agenda.\u000d\u000a    Supporting Children's Learning\u000d\u000a    Research for London Zoo addressed children's capacity to learn during zoo\u000d\u000a      visits. This project used focus groups, ethnographic research and a\u000d\u000a      large-scale questionnaire (n = 3018 children aged 7-14),\u000d\u000a      administered before and after zoo visits, to evaluate changes in\u000d\u000a      children's understanding of wildlife and conservation. Results\u000d\u000a        demonstrated the zoo's potential impact: 53% of the children\u000d\u000a      demonstrated statistically significant improvement in understanding about\u000d\u000a      animals and their habitats after a visit. When supplemented by educational\u000d\u000a      presentations by zoo staff, an additional 39% reported greater concerns\u000d\u000a      about species extinction. The results also showed how the content of\u000d\u000a      presentations and teaching methods influenced outcomes. Children responded\u000d\u000a      negatively to the use of animal skins and skulls or when their own\u000d\u000a      teachers were presenting evidence and many expressed ethical objections to\u000d\u000a      animals held in captivity. Positive responses were elicited to more\u000d\u000a      contextual learning that enabled children to understand animals in their\u000d\u000a      native habitats. The results offered the Zoological Society of London new\u000d\u000a      insights into how children could be encouraged to engage with wildlife\u000d\u000a      conservation and how zoos could be used as positive education spaces.\u000d\u000a    Engaging with Adult Visitors\u000d\u000a    Research (within an EC-FP7 project: EU Zoos-XXI) addressed adult visitors\u000d\u000a      to the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, a charity which runs 50\u000d\u000a      conservation projects in 14 countries and has trained over 3000\u000d\u000a      conservationists from across 128 countries. After an initial public\u000d\u000a      participation meeting, follow up focus groups addressed three\u000d\u000a      inter-related goals: how to communicate wildlife conservation messages;\u000d\u000a      which types of zoo-based information systems were most effective and the\u000d\u000a      importance of dialogue with visiting publics to inform new approaches.\u000d\u000a      This project evaluated the conservation aids and public engagement systems\u000d\u000a      found in the park and developed recommendations about how these might be\u000d\u000a      improved. Research showed the importance of interactive public\u000d\u000a      consultation to the process of designing conservation information and the\u000d\u000a      ways it is transmitted and that a range of physical, emotional and\u000d\u000a      informational needs to be addressed. The findings were used to restructure\u000d\u000a      the wildlife park's educational provision. Follow-up research on visitors,\u000d\u000a      once the recommended changes had been implemented, demonstrated that\u000d\u000a      learning had taken place and that visitors' concern with conservation had\u000d\u000a      increased.\u000d\u000a    Training Conservationists\u000d\u000a    Research on conservation training was central to a smaller scale project\u000d\u000a      undertaken in collaboration with the National Marine Aquarium in\u000d\u000a      Mauritius.

In addition two thousand copies of a research findings\u000d\u000a        bulletin outlining the main findings (see section 2 above http:\/\/www2.warwick.ac.uk\/fac\/soc\/sociology\/rsw\/research_centres\/gender\/gppcd\/dissconf)\u000d\u000a      were distributed to all Welsh Assembly members, MPs, chief executives of\u000d\u000a      local authorities, political parties, councillors in local government, and\u000d\u000a      a range of voluntary sector organisations in Wales; the latter included\u000d\u000a      Welsh Women's Aid, Chwarae Teg\/ Fair Play and the Wales Women's National\u000d\u000a      Coalition, as well as the EHRC (Wales), the House of Lords and the\u000d\u000a      National Assembly for Wales Libraries and the European Women's Lobby. The\u000d\u000a      research findings were also presented at the Welsh Institute for Social\u000d\u000a      and Cultural Affairs Seminar, Bangor, March 2008 and at practitioner\/\u000d\u000a      academic conferences held during the course of the project.\u000d\u000a    Impact on third sector organisations\u000d\u000a    The findings relating to domestic abuse and gender inequalities were\u000d\u000a      drawn on by the End Violence Against Women campaign in Wales (launched in\u000d\u000a      2009 and now the Violence Against Women Action Group), through the Wales\u000d\u000a      Women's National Coalition (before its demise) and Welsh Women's Aid. They\u000d\u000a      were used to develop campaign material by the End Violence Against\u000d\u000a      Women Group in Wales and by Welsh Women's Aid. In collaboration with Welsh\u000d\u000a      Women's Aid, Charles produced an information leaflet on the\u000d\u000a      misleading use of statistics about the gendering of domestic abuse. This\u000d\u000a      leaflet and the widely publicised research findings bulletin\u000d\u000a      contributed to an enhanced cultural understanding of how domestic\u000d\u000a      abuse relates to gender and to the withdrawal of misleading statistics\u000d\u000a      formerly found on the Welsh Assembly Government website and on other\u000d\u000a      websites (for example, Swansea City Council, the Dyn project). They also\u000d\u000a      raised questions about the gender-neutral definition of domestic abuse\u000d\u000a      adopted by the Welsh Assembly Government and Swansea City Council in their\u000d\u000a      domestic abuse strategies.\u000d\u000a    This impact was achieved in the following way. The research pointed out\u000d\u000a      that a gender-neutral definition of domestic violence could reduce\u000d\u000a      resources available for women and children escaping domestic violence\u000d\u000a      because of the alleged need for an equal level of provision for men in\u000d\u000a      similar circumstances. Such a gender-neutral definition was present at the\u000d\u000a      all-Wales and local level in domestic abuse strategies. An early draft of\u000d\u000a      the chapter by Charles and Jones, `Developing a domestic abuse strategy'\u000d\u000a      later published in Charles and Davies (eds.) Gender and social justice\u000d\u000a        in Wales, Cardiff University Press (2011), which discussed the\u000d\u000a      research findings, was circulated and discussed within the End Violence\u000d\u000a      Against Women group in Wales in 2009. As a result of these discussions a\u000d\u000a      campaign was initiated for a gendered definition of domestic abuse and an\u000d\u000a      information leaflet was drafted. A strategic decision was taken in 2009\u000d\u000a      not to press this issue but to wait for the results of the consultation\u000d\u000a      process on the development of a Welsh Assembly Government (WAG) strategy\u000d\u000a      to end violence against women and girls in Wales. This resulted, in 2010,\u000d\u000a      in the launch of the new WAG strategy on violence against women which\u000d\u000a      includes a gendered definition of violence against women.\u000d\u000a    By means of these discussions and the development of position documents\u000d\u000a      by the End Violence Against Women group and Welsh Women's Aid, the\u000d\u000a      research findings contributed to campaign materials used by organisations\u000d\u000a      working to end violence against women in Wales. These campaigns fed into\u000d\u000a      the development of the Welsh Assembly Government's first violence against\u000d\u000a      women strategy, The Right to be Safe (2010), which adopts the\u000d\u000a      United Nations definition of violence against women as well as clarifying\u000d\u000a      that violence against women is an equality and human rights issue.\u000d\u000a    The director of EHRC (Wales) had been on the project's advisory group.\u000d\u000a      Subsequently (2010) the EHRC contacted Charles to develop a case study on\u000d\u000a      the effects of domestic violence at work which she did in collaboration\u000d\u000a      with Beecham. The case study, Bridget's story, showed how a supportive\u000d\u000a      workplace is vital in ensuring that routes to safety are achievable. It\u000d\u000a      also provides evidence based costs for providing support to individuals\u000d\u000a      within the workplace. It was used as part of EHRC Wales's campaigning\u000d\u000a      material on the need to develop workplace policies on domestic violence in\u000d\u000a      Wales. Subsequent impact evaluation carried out by EHRC (Wales) showed\u000d\u000a      that the campaign had helped to raise awareness of domestic abuse in the\u000d\u000a      workplace; 35 devolved organisations had a domestic abuse workplace\u000d\u000a      policy, covering 180,032 staff in Wales, and 8 devolved organisations were\u000d\u000a      developing policies which will cover 29,422 staff.

The main project focused on devolution\u000d\u000a      within the UK, the accompanying increase in the proportion of women\u000d\u000a      political representatives in the new legislatures in Scotland and Wales\u000d\u000a      and the extent to which a gender balance of political representatives\u000d\u000a      influences policy development. Wales was chosen as a case study because\u000d\u000a      the National Assembly for Wales had equal numbers of women and men\u000d\u000a      representatives. One of the policy areas it explored was domestic abuse\u000d\u000a      which linked it to the other two projects: the first of these was an audit\u000d\u000a      of existing provision for survivors and perpetrators of domestic abuse to\u000d\u000a      provide an evidence base for the development of the Safer Swansea domestic\u000d\u000a      abuse strategy, while the second developed a case study of the effect of\u000d\u000a      domestic abuse in the workplace for use by the Equalities and Human Rights\u000d\u000a      Commission (EHRC) (Wales). The main project was carried out by Nickie\u000d\u000a      Charles (PI University of Warwick) in collaboration with Charlotte Davies\u000d\u000a      (Co-I) and Stephanie Jones (research assistant) (Swansea University)\u000d\u000a      between September 2005 and January 2009. Using Wales as a case study, the\u000d\u000a      research explored the effect on political processes and participation of\u000d\u000a      the election of a high proportion of women representatives to devolved\u000d\u000a      government; one of the policy areas it explored was domestic violence. The\u000d\u000a      two smaller projects were carried out by Charles (PI) and Jones and by\u000d\u000a      Charles (PI) and Beecham (Warwick).\u000d\u000a    This research shows that:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      a gender balance among political representatives affects the\u000d\u000a        way politics is done, the policy issues that are prioritised and the\u000d\u000a        organisational culture of political institutions. Assembly Members\u000d\u000a        experienced the National Assembly as less masculinised than either the\u000d\u000a        Westminster parliament or local government in Wales with less pressure\u000d\u000a        to behave in a competitive `masculine' way and a less confrontational\u000d\u000a        way of doing politics. Issues such as domestic violence, equal pay and\u000d\u000a        family and child welfare were prioritised in policy development. These\u000d\u000a        differences were linked both to the National Assembly being a new\u000d\u000a        political institution and to there being a gender balance amongst\u000d\u000a        Assembly Members.\u000d\u000a      a diversity of political representatives facilitates engagement with a\u000d\u000a        greater range of civil society organisations. The positive measures\u000d\u000a        introduced to increase the diversity of political representatives and,\u000d\u000a        in particular, to achieve a gender balance, were not universally\u000d\u000a        supported. Within the National Assembly there was widespread support for\u000d\u000a        positive measures while at local level there was resistance to such\u000d\u000a        measures and a view that they resulted in women being elected who were\u000d\u000a        not `up to the job'.\u000d\u000a      the new political institution was contributing to a revitalisation of\u000d\u000a        civil society and the National Assembly for Wales was more open than\u000d\u000a        local government to those organising around gender-based issues.\u000d\u000a      there was a tension between gendered and gender-neutral framing of\u000d\u000a        policy issues in relation to domestic violence and the equalities\u000d\u000a        agenda. For instance a gender-neutral definition of domestic violence,\u000d\u000a        which did not reflect its gendered nature, had been adopted by the Welsh\u000d\u000a        Assembly Government in its 2005 domestic abuse strategy; and statistics\u000d\u000a        suggesting that men were almost as likely as women to experience\u000d\u000a        domestic violence were being used by the Welsh Assembly Government and\u000d\u000a        the Dyn project (a third sector organisation supporting male victims of\u000d\u000a        domestic abuse). This gender neutrality was having a detrimental impact\u000d\u000a        on the stability and sustainability of voluntary sector provision to\u000d\u000a        women and children threatened with domestic violence in some local\u000d\u000a        authority areas.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"2420","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research has contributed extensively to public debate on household\u000a      food poverty and its socio-political ramifications at local, national and\u000a      international levels.

She was sole academic speaker at an Industry and\u000a      Parliament Trust event on the future of household food security at the\u000a      House of Commons in October 2012: research citations pepper the published\u000a      notes. Invited participation in a WHO\/EU policy discussion on obesity\u000a      (Riga, 2008), consultancy work for UNHCR on human rights and nutrition and\u000a      invited participation as one of three international experts at an\u000a      Institute of Medicine workshop in Washington DC (2011) reviewing\u000a      relationships between food insecurity and obesity - all this illustrates\u000a      how international public engagement has been stimulated by this research.\u000a    Media Impacts Following the 2008 financial crisis, rising food\u000a      prices created increasing media interest in how poorer households could\u000a      cope, an interest further stimulated by recent cuts in UK welfare\u000a      benefits. As her research centred essentially on policy and the diet of\u000a      poorer households, Dowler's advice and comment has been persistently\u000a      sought. She is a regular contributor to Radio 4's The Food Programme, a\u000a      key media outlet for academics, practitioners and policy makers in the\u000a      field, and has made many media contributions, including appearances on\u000a      regional television in the West Midlands and Scotland. Dowler acted as\u000a      professional adviser for ITV1's series The Hunger Shame and appeared in\u000a      BBC 1 The Great British Budget Menu - both centred on dietary issues\u000a      facing poor households. Patrick Butler, social policy editor at The\u000a        Guardian (among other journalists), uses Dowler as his primary\u000a      source on food policy and poverty. Invited comments in the print media on\u000a      food and poverty, household food insecurity and food banks have included a\u000a      commissioned editorial in Food Ethics Council (FEC quarterly\u000a      journal) that led to an invited letter in The Observer (1 January,\u000a      2012) in response to an earlier article on food banks. This was\u000a      subsequently cited in a Guardian article on the growing reliance on food\u000a      banks, prompting public debate (21 August 2012).\u000a    Public Engagement Impact National impact also emerged from local\u000a      research on household food sustainability. Work supported by Council for\u000a      Protection of Rural England (CPRE) produced a research toolkit to enable\u000a      local people to develop their own `mapped' interconnections between local\u000a      food producers, retailers and consumers (see Dowler and Kneafsey, Mapping\u000a        Local Food Webs Concepts and Methods. Interim Report Part 1, SURGE,).\u000a      Local volunteers in 16 locations accepted the challenge: using surveys,\u000a      interviews and outreach they analysed interactive networks between local\u000a      production, food outlets and consumption within a 2.5 mile radius of town\u000a      centres, revealing economic, social and environmental benefits of local\u000a      food systems. Published reports on 6 pilot and 10 subsequent locations,\u000a      with a summary (From Field to Fork: The Value of England's Local Food\u000a        Webs - citing Dowler and co-researchers), were launched at the House\u000a      of Commons (June, 2012) and announced in a news release (11 June 2012)\u000a      \"New national report finds local food is recipe for economic success\".\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Building on a background in nutritional science, Professor Dowler's\u000a      research on social and policy aspects of food, nutrition and household\u000a      food security has created impact at local, national and international\u000a      levels.

This expertise developed further\u000a      through interlinked research projects, funded by local, national and\u000a      international agencies (2000-13). The research focuses on household food\u000a      security in terms of two inter-related agendas: (a) difficulties\u000a      encountered by poor households faced by falling real incomes, reduced\u000a      state benefits and rising food prices; (b) the interconnections between\u000a      food production and consumption within specific localities.\u000a    Addressing Food Poverty. From 2000-03, Dowler worked in the team\u000a      that successfully tendered for the Food Standards Agency (FSA) Low Income\u000a      Diets Methods Study, preparing for the FSA Low Income Diet and Nutrition\u000a      Survey (2003-6), for which she acted as adviser. This research led to two\u000a      further projects (2008 - 10) for the Department of Food, Environment and\u000a      Rural Affairs (DEFRA) that analyse (a) factors threatening UK household\u000a      access to healthy and sustainable food in a context of rising prices and\u000a      falling real incomes; (b) how consumers in low income households\u000a      understand and address the rising cost of food. Research findings\u000a      reveal critical consumer concern over food budget management and nuanced\u000a      understanding of price increases. Despite unfamiliarity with `food\u000a      security' concepts, respondents recognise the need for affordable,\u000a      universally accessible, healthy food and reject `consumer choice' as a\u000a      mechanism to achieve sustainable food security, while expressing strong\u000a      views concerning the responsibility of government. Research outcomes.\u000a      This research has led to a current DEFRA-funded Rapid Evidence Assessment\u000a      to evaluate `food aid' provision as a means to address household food\u000a      problems in times of austerity, specifically the charitable sector's role\u000a      through food banks [and associated food provision], at national and\u000a      international levels. Diets of poor households continue to command public\u000a      attention; consultative work for the FSA [and the Northern Ireland Office]\u000a      on UK household food poverty is forthcoming.\u000a    Local Food Networks. Early work on four small-scale local studies\u000a      (Dowler: PI) analysed nutritional needs and access to healthy food in\u000a      deprived areas (2000-4). Collaboration on a ESRC\/AHRC- funded project,\u000a      `Producers, Consumers and Food: Exploring Reconnection' (2003-6) analyses\u000a      6 food schemes (5 in the UK, 1 in Italy) that encourage direct contact\u000a      between food producers and consumers, to examine the multiple ways in\u000a      which these `reconnect': biologically, socially and morally. Research\u000a        findings show how local networks foster local economies, integrity,\u000a      environmental citizenship, health and well-being. Consumers act as\u000a      economic and social agents with sophisticated understandings of the\u000a      complexities of food production and consumption, challenging assumptions\u000a      about their necessary separation, low household income notwithstanding. Research\u000a        outcomes. The ESRC\/AHRC project has led to a subsequent project\u000a      (2008-09), funded by the Council for the Protection of Rural England\u000a      (CPRE) that develops participative research `toolkits' to enable\u000a      communities to map `local food webs': to identify economic and social\u000a      benefits of locally produced and retailed food: also to demonstrate how,\u000a      through engagement with the local food economy, community-level food\u000a      resilience could be created. Research results include Mapping\u000a        Local Food Webs Toolkit, a physical (later online) research package\u000a      for local adaptation and use.

This is a web-resource which streams the music of territorially and\u000a      linguistically isolated scenes, making their music available to English\u000a      speakers and enabling musicians to promote their work internationally. Its\u000a      main objective was to `translate' the culture of post-socialist punk into\u000a      the languages of potential audiences, and to combine accounts from the\u000a      research sites with academic, journalistic, and media accounts. RottenBeat\u000a      averages 4,166 views a month, approximately 90% of which are external to\u000a      Warwick.\u000a    The research team supported new forms of artistic expression. As\u000a      well as creating RottenBeat it provided opportunities for live performance\u000a      which enabled post-socialist punk bands to bring their music to\u000a      international audiences. Over a hundred musicians participated in the\u000a      research with two of the bands putting on live performances in the UK. For\u000a      many, it was the first time English- speaking audiences had been able to\u000a      appreciate the views and music of these artists. One of the participants\u000a      from Saint Petersburg explained that he wanted `people abroad to know that\u000a      Russia is not only about Putin, Abramovich, oil, and mafia, but that here\u000a      there are also people like us, who are fighting'.\u000a    The project provided a new platform for previously `undiscovered',\u000a      non-commercial underground music and art to an English speaking audience.\u000a      Some of the bands and performers participating in the research were\u000a      invited to project workshops where they were able to perform their music\u000a      and to discuss it with British peers, journalists and other interested\u000a      people. This had not previously happened and was the first time the voices\u000a      of Russian punk musicians were heard by an English speaking audience. One\u000a      of the workshops led to much wider coverage of the group, Zverstvo. The\u000a      project invited Zverstvo, a provincial avant-punk band from Krasnodar,\u000a      Russia, to London in May 2011 to take part in a workshop, `RottenBeat:\u000a      Academic and Music Dialogue with New Russian Punk', organised in\u000a      collaboration with Pushkin House. As a result of this visit the band\u000a      attracted substantial media attention in Russia. In 2012 they were\u000a      reviewed by Artemiy Troitsky, the most prominent musical critic in Russia\u000a      (http:\/\/finam.fm\/archive-view\/5766\/),\u000a      and one of their songs, which had been recorded live in London, was\u000a      included as one of the best songs in the official `playlist of 2012' by\u000a      Afisha.ru, the central Russian internet portal devoted to contemporary\u000a      Russian popular culture. It was referred to as the `refrain of the year &#8212;\u000a      as illogical, absurd, straightforward and unavoidable as the last 12\u000a      months' (http:\/\/www.afisha.ru\/article\/best2012_songs\/).\u000a      The project also contributed to an exhibition of politically engaged\u000a      artists in London such as Nikolai Kopeikin, the leader of the\u000a      art-collective KOLKHUi (http:\/\/www.pushkinhouse.org\/single-\u000a      exhibition\/items\/kopeikin-meets-london). Gololobov was a member of the\u000a      organising committee and the project team organised an introductory\u000a      workshop on the day of the official opening. These activities give\u000a      additional credibility and status to artists' and musicians' work at home,\u000a      and more space and security to create where they live.\u000a    Impact through media profile\u000a    On the basis of the experience and expertise gained during the project,\u000a      Gololobov was invited to be a freelance author and content supplier for\u000a      the new Calvert Journal, A Guide to Creative Russia, to be published in\u000a      London from 2013 onwards. This online magazine attracts over 1000 readers\u000a      per day, from across the UK, the US, Europe and the world, appealing to\u000a      those interested in Russian art and culture (see section 5). His article\u000a      considers the provisional phenomenon of Russian punk, in particular\u000a      relation to Zverstvo, a provincial band that produces its own version of\u000a      punk. Since its publication in mid-July, the article has been read over\u000a      300 times.\u000a    In 2012 Gololobov was consulted in the aftermath of the Pussy Riot\u000a      protest in Russia when two members of the female punk band, Pussy Riot,\u000a      were arrested. The expertise of the researchers has been drawn on in media\u000a      discussion of Pussy Riot, their relation to the underground music scene\u000a      and the human rights issues raised by their detention. Gololobov\u000a      contributed to the debate on human rights issues in Russia, being\u000a      interviewed for various Russian media programmes. He was also interviewed\u000a      and prepared a fact sheet for Nature on the case of a Russian\u000a      chemist who was imprisoned for her scientific views and who shared a cell\u000a      with a member of Pussy Riot. The article which resulted (see section 5)\u000a      followed the publication of an online interview with Gololobov which was\u000a      extensively cited by the Russian media. By raising the profile of the\u000a      Russian chemist's case, this coverage helped to secure her release on\u000a      bail, and significantly contributed to raising awareness of the human\u000a      rights situation in Russia.\u000a    The research has attracted considerable media attention (see section 5);\u000a      it has engaged the public by means of public lectures, a series of talks\u000a      on Post-Socialist Punk published on iTunes, and has an entry in Wikipedia.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This research explored the political significance of punk in\u000a      post-socialist Eastern Europe.

It consisted of a\u000a      multi-sited ethnography across 5 field sites in post-socialist Europe: St\u000a      Petersburg, Krasnodar, Vorkuta (Russia), Halle (Germany), and Pula\u000a      (Croatia). Members of the research team included Benjamin Perasovic\u000a      (Croatia) and Yngvar Steinholt (Norway &#8212; visiting fellow Warwick 2010).\u000a    Post-socialist punk is an important contemporary cultural phenomenon with\u000a      significant social and political implications, as became globally evident\u000a      with the Pussy Riot protests. The research explored what leads people to\u000a      get involved with radical, non-commercial and politically unsafe music and\u000a      what this involvement means to them as individuals, to the society they\u000a      live in, and for punk as a global scene.\u000a    The study found that punk is differentiated from other subcultures by its\u000a      active challenging of the norms and social rules governing everyday life.\u000a      This challenge is a key element of its identity and is enacted differently\u000a      according to social location and shifting forms of political engagement.\u000a      In Russia, punk tends to symbolise aesthetic and artistic challenges. Its\u000a      opponents are the state, police, and territorial gangs while other\u000a      subcultural groups are considered allies in its confrontation with the\u000a      oppressive mainstream. In Germany it addresses the construction of\u000a      alternative economies and opposes itself to the state and mainstream\u000a      society. In Croatia it is associated with alternative social spaces; punk\u000a      is an attitude and way of life which challenges the normativity of\u000a      dominant nationalist discourses. Motivations for joining the subcultural\u000a      punk scene are complex and reflect these different contexts.\u000a    Researchers found an element of imitation and mimicry in all the punk\u000a      scenes studied, however its meaning differs according to changing\u000a      perceptions of and relations to the `West'. In Germany Anglophone punk is\u000a      understood as a sign of a progressive alternative; in Croatia it is seen\u000a      as a language of radical opposition and, in Russia, the aesthetics of\u000a      Western punk are generally adopted as an artistic alternative but, at the\u000a      same time, they are reworked to provide a connection to the local and\u000a      national context, and to secure the artistic independence of the\u000a      musicians. There are also different degrees of group cohesion and\u000a      different attitudes towards the political, commercial and cultural\u000a      mainstream in the different research sites: in Croatia and Germany punk\u000a      tends to be explicitly political and visible in its stylistic and\u000a      subcultural attributes while in Russia the identity of the group as a\u000a      whole tends to be fluid and circumstantial, constructed around events\u000a      rather than intra-group affiliations.\u000a    Punk in the post-socialist context re-arranges the scale of reference\u000a      used in Western punk and attaches different meanings to the practices and\u000a      symbols used in the West. All this not only extends our understanding of\u000a      punk but also enriches our understanding of a cultural practice of\u000a      protest, resistance, and revolt, which is often aesthetic, symbolic and\u000a      ironic, and its relation to direct action and structural opposition in the\u000a      context of post-socialist Europe.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3482","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"146669","Name":"Cyprus"},{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Influencing British policy: The initiatives Dr. Robinson subjected\u000a      to empirical scrutiny have become the common framework for how services\u000a      are delivered across the UK, and are informing the development of services\u000a      across Europe. Notably, three of the seven policy objectives listed in the\u000a      2008 Government report Saving Lives, Reducing Harm, Protecting the\u000a        Public [5-1] use evidence from Dr. Robinson's research. For example,\u000a      referring to the Home Office funded research on IDVAs and ISVAs on which\u000a      Dr. Robinson was the PI, the report commits the Government to support the\u000a      national roll-out of IDVAs, ISVAs and MARACs and to double the number of\u000a      SDVCs in order \"to enable all victims of sexual and domestic violence to\u000a      access their services\", stating explicitly that they will be guided in\u000a      this by the results of the evaluation being carried at that time by Dr.\u000a      Robinson [5-1: p. 47]. A few months later the case for developing these\u000a      services was further strengthened by the Home Affairs Committee enquiry Domestic\u000a        Violence, Forced Marriage and \"Honour\" Based Violence, which drew\u000a      extensively on Dr. Robinson's research, with citations to various of her\u000a      studies [5-2: pp 73, 91, 98, and 115-118].\u000a    More recently, the Government's Call to End Violence Against Women\u000a        and Girls (2010) discusses a platform of interventions (IDVAs,\u000a      ISVAs, MARACs) as \"effective frontline services\" [5- 3: p. 8, 15] and\u000a      committed &#163;28m of funding to facilitate their implementation. To date, the\u000a      Government has funded more than 1500 IDVAs and ISVAs posts and MARAC\u000a      coordinators to support 266 MARACs across the UK. Likewise, the Stern\u000a      Review (2010) drawing upon Dr. Robinson's research [5-4: p.103, footnote\u000a      17] recommended that ISVAs \"be seen as an intrinsic part of the way rape\u000a      complainants are dealt with\" [5.4: pp 22,106,123]. All of these\u000a      initiatives are now fully embedded in the British response to domestic and\u000a      sexual violence, where as prior to Dr. Robinson's research, they did not\u000a      exist. For example, each year 266 MARACs respond to more than 58,000\u000a      high-risk cases of domestic violence with an associated 75,000 children.\u000a    Influencing European policy: Dr. Robinson's research has assisted\u000a      practitioners across Europe in understanding how to they can work more\u000a      effectively in partnership to improve victims' safety. For example, the\u000a      2008 Council of Europe Task Force on Violence Against Women\u000a      clearly draws upon the research Robinson conducted in Cardiff and\u000a      elsewhere in the UK [5-5: p. 47, 55, 60]. Building on the impact her work\u000a      has had before 2008 - for example two keynote speeches at a 2007\u000a      international conference in Vienna disseminating her ideas to an audience\u000a      of nearly 300 practitioners, policy-makers and academics - she was invited\u000a      to participate in two Council of Europe funded DAPHNE III projects on\u000a      protecting victims of gender-based violence (Project PROTECT I in 2010 and\u000a      PROTECT II, 2011-12). These multi-country collaborative projects have\u000a      necessitated her speaking at high-profile conferences (Vienna in March and\u000a      Madrid in May, 2010), opened by government officials (e.g., Federal\u000a      Minister for Women and Civil Service), and attended by senior\u000a      representatives from agencies across Europe. Evidence-based training\u000a      manuals in 8 European languages have been produced from these\u000a      dissemination events, and indicate the important contribution of her\u000a      research, particularly on multi-agency approaches to high-risk victims\u000a      [5-6: pp. 17-19]. Consequently, Dr. Robinson's research along with her\u000a      involvement in the Daphne projects have led to a change in the response\u000a      provided to victims of violence in Europe, as MARACs are now operational\u000a      in parts of Austria and Finland, with more countries considering\u000a      implementation. The impact of Dr. Robinson's research is also apparent\u000a      from her invitation to speak at other European events (not part of the\u000a      Daphne projects), such as the CEPOL (the European Police College, which\u000a      provides training materials and courses to police in all EU member states)\u000a      Presidency conference in Cyprus (July 2012) and Switzerland's National\u000a      Domestic Violence Conference (Nov 2012). In both events Dr. Robinson\u000a      delivered keynote addresses on her research into the British response to\u000a      domestic and sexual violence. Consequently, CEPOL has recommended that\u000a      MARACs be established in their recently published handbook on domestic\u000a      violence [5-7: p. 14] and in Switzerland a new legislative initiative is\u000a      being considered by parliament to enable information-sharing for the\u000a      purposes of multi-agency management of high-risk domestic violence cases.\u000a    Finally, the impact of her research can be observed in the most\u000a      significant pan-European policy document to come out on this topic for\u000a      decades: the 2011 Convention for Preventing and Combating Violence\u000a        Against Women and Domestic Violence [5-8]. This document sets out\u000a      obligations for member states which are clearly underpinned by Dr.\u000a      Robinson's research on the value of multi-agency approaches (Article 18),\u000a      the provision of specialist support to victims of domestic violence\u000a      (Article 22), support for victims of sexual violence and SARCs (Article\u000a      25) and multi-agency risk management for high risk victims (Article\u000a      51).Notably, all of these articles employ the same terminology and make\u000a      reference to the main messages produced by Dr. Robinson's research over\u000a      the past decade. Article 51, in particular, could not have been conceived\u000a      without information about the efficacy of Cardiff's MARAC model being\u000a      widely disseminated via Dr. Robinson's research and speaking engagements.\u000a    Developing professional standards, guidelines or training: Dr.\u000a      Robinson has been asked to serve as an expert advisor on several national\u000a      committees and working groups that have played a key role in shaping\u000a      professional practice in both the public and voluntary sector. Building on\u000a      her 2005-07 membership of the Victims of Violence and Abuse Prevention\u000a      Programme (VVAPP) Expert Group on Domestic Violence, she served, in 2008,\u000a      on the ACPO (Association of Chief Police Officers) Risk Expert Panel which\u000a      synthesized evidence (including Dr. Robinson's research in Cardiff) to\u000a      develop the common risk assessment tool for use in cases of domestic\u000a      violence, now used nationally by British police forces.\u000a    Further evidence of Dr. Robinson's impact is provided by her appointment\u000a      in 2012 to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)\u000a      Public Health Programme Development Group [5-9, p.75], charged with\u000a      formulating evidence-based guidelines for health practitioners for\u000a      preventing domestic violence. Dr. Robinson's research features prominently\u000a      in the evidence statements used in the guidelines to underpin 12 of the 17\u000a      recommendations (which went out for public consultation in August\u000a      2013)[5-9; see section 5 for details]. She also served as a member of the\u000a      Task and Finish Group within the Welsh Government, advising on the\u000a      Violence Against Women and Domestic Abuse (Wales) Bill (2012-13). She\u000a      played a key role within this group; for example, as the lead author of a\u000a      substantial report that provided recommendations to WG which have clearly\u000a      shaped both the scope and content of WG's legislative and policy\u000a      priorities. This report is extensively cited in the Welsh Government White\u000a      Paper and specific proposals, such as the need for WG to `place a duty on\u000a      relevant devolved public sector bodies to contribute to multiagency fora'\u000a      such as MARACs [5-10: p. 21] flow directly from Robinson's research. In\u000a      effect, this involves putting MARACs on statutory footing in Wales. The\u000a      Minister described the Task and Finish Group as `instrumental in\u000a      developing the proposals' in the Foreword to the White Paper.\u000a    In conclusion, the landscape of service provision for victims of domestic\u000a      and sexual violence has changed quite considerably in Wales, the UK and\u000a      the EU during the past decade, and the evidence produced by Dr. Robinson's\u000a      research has played a key role in these developments.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    A series of inter-related research projects, conducted over the last\u000a      decade by Amanda Robinson, has contributed to significant changes in the\u000a      services afforded to victims of domestic and sexual violence. Dr.\u000a      Robinson's research has produced identifiable national and international\u000a      policy impacts as organizations and governments have used findings from\u000a      her work to inform their decision-making about the development,\u000a      implementation and funding of services for these victims of crime.\u000a      Consequently, service delivery for victims of domestic and sexual violence\u000a      is becoming more holistic, efficient, and effective, both in the UK and\u000a      beyond.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    Cardiff University\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Cardiff University","InstitutionName":"Cardiff University","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Wales","UKPRN":10007814}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"3117735","Name":"Madrid"},{"GeoNamesId":"2761369","Name":"Vienna"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a[3-1] Robinson, A.

Yet, prior to 2002, the UK\u000a      evidence base on `what works' for victims of domestic and sexual violence\u000a      was limited, mainly consisting of small qualitative studies describing the\u000a      process of service delivery. In contrast, Dr. Robinson (Reader in\u000a      Criminology, from 1st March 2001 - current) has employed both\u000a      qualitative and quantitative approaches to identify not only the\u000a      components of effective working practices, but also the beneficial\u000a      outcomes they produce, often using a multi-site design. Over this period\u000a      she has obtained &#163;235,000 in `government and related' research contracts\u000a      and has acquired an international reputation for methodological rigour in\u000a      combination with an ability to produce `digestible' practice-based\u000a      messages for practitioners and policy-makers. Her research has been\u000a      published in international peer reviewed journals as well as by the\u000a      government departments responsible for funding it. Collectively, this\u000a      research has provided the following key insights into how to best respond\u000a      to victims of domestic and sexual violence:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aMulti-agency partnerships are essential for improved service\u000a          provision. Dr. Robinson conducted two collaborative projects\u000a        during 2003-05 - both funded by the Crown Prosecution Service - which\u000a        remain the most comprehensive pieces of independent academic research on\u000a        British Specialist Domestic Violence Courts (SDVCs) [3-1]. This research\u000a        indicated that SDVCs enabled domestic violence to be tackled within a\u000a        multi-agency framework designed with the safety and support needs of\u000a        victims and children in mind. The benefits of multi-agency partnership\u000a        approaches were also identified from two projects Robinson conducted on\u000a        services for victims of sexual violence, including Sexual Assault\u000a        Referral Centres (SARCs) [3-2].\u000a      \u000aVictims require independent support from specialist providers.\u000a        In addition to the SDVC research, five other studies conducted into\u000a        services for victims of domestic violence in Cardiff and Glasgow (e.g.,\u000a        [3-3]) contributed to a robust evidence base about the value of these\u000a        types of services - both to individual victims (including men, see\u000a        [3-4]) and to partner agencies such as the police. Two national\u000a        multi-site evaluations - one funded by the Home Office on Independent\u000a        Domestic Violence Advisors (IDVAs) and Independent Sexual Violence\u000a        Advisors (ISVAs) on which Dr. Robinson was PI [3-2], the other on seven\u000a        IDVA services (the Safety in Numbers project, [3-5]) -\u000a        solidified the view that these specialist workers were the `glue' that\u000a        held multi-agency initiatives such as SDVCs and MARACs (see below)\u000a        together and that success by any measure would be impossible without\u000a        them.\u000a      \u000aHigh-risk victims require a distinctive form of service provision.\u000a        Multi-agency risk assessment conferences (MARACs) were piloted in\u000a        Cardiff in 2003 to provide a more targeted and intensive form of help to\u000a        those deemed most at risk of further escalating abuse or homicide. Dr.\u000a        Robinson's process and outcome evaluation into MARACs revealed they\u000a        provide an effective blueprint for how to help the most at-risk victims\u000a        [3-6]. This research drew upon multiple sources of data (e.g.,\u000a        observation, practitioner and victim interviews, police data) and -\u000a        despite the proliferation of MARACs in more than 260 areas across the UK\u000a        - remains the only academic study of their effectiveness, as indicated\u000a        by a recent national review of MARACs (see Home\u000aOffice\u000a          Research Report 55, 2011, p. 5).\u000a    \u000a    Thus, the underpinning research consists of 12 separate research\u000a      projects. For the majority of these (9 of the 12), Dr. Robinson was PI and\u000a      led all elements of the research and publications. Of the remaining three\u000a      projects, the two studies of SDVCs involved collaborations with\u000a      researchers at Wolverhampton University; on these mixed methods projects\u000a      Dr. Robinson was the lead team member responsible for the quantitative\u000a      elements of the research (the principal data source for both projects),\u000a      supervised fieldworkers based at CU, and co-authored all publications. For\u000a      the third collaboration, Dr. Robinson was invited to become an expert\u000a      advisor on the Safety in Numbers project, making substantial\u000a      inputs into the research design and analysis and co-authoring all\u000a      publications.

Drawing on our research, the team produced the Work Fit\u000d\u000a        For All report in 2008, which was published by the Equality and\u000d\u000a      Human Rights Commission, and cited in the EHRC submission under the\u000d\u000a      International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, a\u000d\u000a      multilateral treaty adopted by the United Nations General Assembly [5.1]\u000d\u000a      It is also cited by the EHRC as proof that they are fulfilling their duty\u000d\u000a      to `work to eliminate prejudice, hatred and hostility' under the UN\u000d\u000a      Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities [5.2]. The EHRC has\u000d\u000a      relied extensively on our research to demonstrate that it is fulfilling\u000d\u000a      its own statutory role in respect of people with disabilities. For\u000d\u000a      example, in January 2009, our research was used by the UK minister for\u000d\u000a      disabled people to defend the EHRC's record on disability rights; while\u000d\u000a      the Minister conceded \"that it has taken time for the EHRC to find its\u000d\u000a      feet\" he states that \"a report on the bullying of disabled people in the\u000d\u000a      workplace is an example of its [i.e. the EHRC's] valuable work\" [5.3]. In\u000d\u000a      October 2010, the EHRC published their Triennial Review How fair is\u000d\u000a        Britain? Equality, Human Rights and Good Relations in 2010. The\u000d\u000a      chapter on employment made extensive use of the 2009 report on the FTWS\u000d\u000a      [3.2] to highlight the problems faced by disabled workers and the\u000d\u000a      challenges of better policies on disability discrimination [5.4]\u000d\u000a    The Fair Treatment at Work Survey has played a broader role underpinning\u000d\u000a      much policy work in this area. In a letter of support the Principal\u000d\u000a      Research Officer, Labour Market Directorate, Department for Business,\u000d\u000a      Innovation and Skills notes that the FTWS has \"formed part of the evidence\u000d\u000a      base collated here across most aspects of labour market policy; on issues\u000d\u000a      ranging from work-life balance to workplace dispute resolution. The survey\u000d\u000a      thus contributes to the conventional wisdom on these issues, which forms a\u000d\u000a      fundamental part of the policy development process. For example, the\u000d\u000a      survey has been used as one measure of the scale and nature of workplace\u000d\u000a      conflict feeding into recent changes in relation to dispute resolution,\u000d\u000a      whilst its measures of employee awareness of employment rights have fed\u000d\u000a      into policy development on flexible working.\" [5.10]\u000d\u000a    The FTWS finding that 19 per cent of employees with disabilities\u000d\u000a      experience unfair treatment at work (compared to 13 per cent of those\u000d\u000a      without disabilities) provides one of the UK's Equality Performance\u000d\u000a      Indicators, used to monitor both the Government's Independent Living\u000d\u000a      Strategy in England and by a wide range of public bodies - including local\u000d\u000a      authorities (e.g. Islington, The Highlands), NHS Trusts (e.g. Papworth,\u000d\u000a      Derby and Walsall) and the Welsh Government - to measure improvements in\u000d\u000a      the treatment people with disabilities receive [5.5]. The same measure is\u000d\u000a      included in the Equality Measurement Framework developed by the EHRC and\u000d\u000a      the Government Equality Office. It also features widely in the\u000d\u000a      policy-responses of public sector employers to the public-sector equality\u000d\u000a      duty, who make considerable use of other aspects of our research\u000d\u000a      demonstrating the considerable reach of this work amongst public-sector\u000d\u000a      employers, including government departments. For example, our FTWS\u000d\u000a      research has led the Welsh Government to make reducing the bullying of\u000d\u000a      disabled people one of its five equality objectives. In commenting on the\u000d\u000a      evidence base for its 2012 document Working for Equality in Wales:\u000d\u000a        Equality Objectives and Strategic Equality Plan, the Welsh\u000d\u000a      Government acknowledged that its research was \"structured around the\u000d\u000a      themes used by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) in their\u000d\u000a      Triennial reviews `How Fair is Britain' - which drew directly on our work\u000d\u000a      (see above) - and that these \"reviews provide a comprehensive picture of\u000d\u000a      the range and type of inequalities experienced by people with protected\u000d\u000a      characteristics...[and that]... Using the EHRC reviews as the basis for\u000d\u000a      our evidence review will allow ongoing comparison of progress on equality\u000d\u000a      issues between Wales and the rest of the UK.\" [5.6, p.106].\u000d\u000a    Perhaps most significantly, recommendations from analysis of the BWBS\u000d\u000a      [found in 3.3] informed the 2010 Equality Act. Our recommendations were\u000d\u000a      drawn on for those sections concerned with Adjustments \"where a provision,\u000d\u000a      criterion or practice ... puts a disabled person at a substantial\u000d\u000a      disadvantage\" and the Advancement of Equality in the public sector where\u000d\u000a      non-pay discrimination against disabled employees was shown to be a\u000d\u000a      particular problem [5.7, section 20 (p.10)] as well as the public sector\u000d\u000a      equality duty which requires a public authority to have \"due regard to the\u000d\u000a      need to eliminate discrimination, harassment, victimisation and any other\u000d\u000a      conduct that is prohibited\" [5.7, section 149 (p.96)]. Our recommendations\u000d\u000a      in respect of employer liability for ill-treatment from clients and\u000d\u000a      customers and the general public - \"it makes obvious sense to extend the\u000d\u000a      employers' liability for harassment (by third parties, including clients\u000d\u000a      and customers) to this category of employee\" [3.3, p.14] - influenced\u000d\u000a      parts of the Act concerned with `third-party harassment' [5.7, Section 40\u000d\u000a      (p.23)].\u000d\u000a    Our research was extensively drawn on in subsequent debates around\u000d\u000a      changes to the Act. For example, in its opposition to the proposed 2012\u000d\u000a      repeal of employer liability for harassment of employees by third parties,\u000d\u000a      the Disability Charities Consortium makes direct reference to our Fair\u000d\u000a        treatment at work report [3.2], noting that \"According to a survey\u000d\u000a      by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, `the disabled and\u000d\u000a      those with a long standing condition were 96 per cent more likely to have\u000d\u000a      employment problems' and `those who were disabled were more than twice as\u000d\u000a      likely to report bullying and harassment'\" [5.8].\u000d\u000a    Shaping employers' behaviour: In recognition of its role in the\u000d\u000a      legislation, our research - particularly through our two reports on the\u000d\u000a      British Workplace Behaviour Survey: Work Fit For All [3.3] and Insight\u000a        into Ill-treatment in the Workplace (Fevre et al 2011, Cardiff:\u000d\u000a      Cardiff School of Social Sciences) - has received considerable attention\u000d\u000a      from the providers of advice to employers and employees (such as\u000d\u000a      specialist legal firms) helping employers comply with the law and to\u000d\u000a      promote better treatment for employees with disabilities more generally.\u000d\u000a      Our research is also used by trade unions like Unison to advise members on\u000d\u000a      the best way to negotiate policies which prevent, tackle and deal with\u000d\u000a      harassment and bullying in the workplace [5.9] For example, Unison uses\u000d\u000a      our research: to help reach a working definition of harassment and\u000d\u000a      bullying (p.5); to make the point that disabled employees and employees\u000d\u000a      with long-term illnesses experience disproportionate negative treatment in\u000d\u000a      the workplace (p.8); to emphasise the costs to employers of workplace ill\u000d\u000a      treatment (p.15); and to highlight the need for managers and supervisors\u000d\u000a      to be trained to detect and handle harassment and bullying (p.21).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This research into treatment for employees with disabilities provides one\u000d\u000a      of the UK's Equality Performance Indicators and recommendations from it\u000d\u000a      have been incorporated into UK legislation.

These findings were established by two separate\u000d\u000a      surveys using face-to-face interviews with representative groups of\u000d\u000a      British employees: the British Workplace Behaviour Survey (BWBS)[3.3] and\u000d\u000a      the second Fair Treatment at Work Survey (FTWS) [3.2]. Qualitative\u000d\u000a      elements of the research confirmed the major causes of the patterns\u000d\u000a      revealed by these surveys, for example the ill-treatment associated with\u000d\u000a      the management of sickness absences amongst those with long-term health\u000d\u000a      problems, and some of their remedies [3.1]. Cardiff staff gathered almost\u000d\u000a      all the qualitative data, were responsible for most questionnaire design\u000d\u000a      and conducted all statistical analyses on the BWBS [3.4, 3.5].\u000d\u000a    Planning for the research began in 2006 and led to an ESRC award in the\u000d\u000a      following year, which included the British Workplace Behaviour Survey\u000d\u000a      (BWBS), the largest representative study of workplace ill-treatment so far\u000d\u000a      conducted anywhere in the world [3.4].\u000d\u000a    Partnerships with colleagues from the Department of Trade and Industry\u000d\u000a      (subsequently the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills), and the\u000d\u000a      research company TNS (subsequently TNS-BMRB) also date from this period.\u000d\u000a      TNS were responsible for the fieldwork on the BWBS and in the following\u000d\u000a      year Fevre was the lead academic in a successful bid with TNS-BMRB to\u000d\u000a      undertake the UK Government's second Fair Treatment at Work Survey (FTWS)\u000d\u000a      for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. Fevre and Nichols\u000d\u000a      authored the Fair Treatment at Work Report along with Gillian\u000d\u000a      Prior of TNS and Ian Rutherford of the Department for Business, Innovation\u000d\u000a      and Skills [3.2]. This very well-resourced survey allowed the repetition\u000d\u000a      of some questions asked in the BWBS, using a random rather than quota\u000d\u000a      sample, which increased confidence in the robustness of the earlier\u000d\u000a      results. It also allowed for the collection of more detailed information,\u000d\u000a      for example on different types of disability.\u000d\u000a    By the time analysis of the FTWS was underway, the qualitative phase of\u000d\u000a      the ESRC project was well-advanced. The emerging findings on disability\u000d\u000a      from the BWBS also shaped the data collection strategy in our qualitative\u000d\u000a      research. The case studies we conducted pin-pointed the major causes of\u000d\u000a      the ill-treatment of employees with disabilities and the actions that\u000d\u000a      organisations could take to bring about better treatment. For instance,\u000d\u000a      the research established that conventional solutions to problems of\u000d\u000a      ill-treatment, as codified in dignity at work policies for example, were\u000d\u000a      either ineffective or made things worse [3.1]. Similar conclusions were\u000d\u000a      reached in respect of other common organisational policies including\u000d\u000a      approaches to the management of employees with protected characteristics\u000d\u000a      and the management of sickness absence [3.6]. The remedies identified by\u000d\u000a      the underpinning research centre on the need for organisations to deliver\u000d\u000a      on promises of an individualised approach to relations between employers\u000d\u000a      and employees [3.1]. The active commitment of senior leaders is critical\u000d\u000a      to this process 3].\u000d\u000a    Ralph Fevre was the PI for the BWBS project and the co-investigators were\u000d\u000a      Trevor Jones and Amanda Robinson (all of Cardiff School of Social\u000d\u000a      Sciences) and Duncan Lewis (Glamorgan University until 2010 then Plymouth\u000d\u000a      University).

Reflecting these findings, eight police forces trialled\u000d\u000a      new processes and systems, with the resulting Home Office assessment\u000d\u000a      supporting a shift to the focus on harm and victims originating in the\u000d\u000a      UPSI study [5-2]. In 2012 Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary\u000d\u000a      re-assessed all forces in England and Wales to determine the progress they\u000d\u000a      had made in implementing reforms based upon the research. They found\u000d\u000a      \"...there is no doubt that the police service has improved its\u000d\u000a      responsiveness to victims of ASB since HMIC last reported on this issue in\u000d\u000a      2010, with progress made in every forces. The survey results confirm that\u000d\u000a      victims have noticed these improvements\" [5-3].\u000d\u000a    Further national policing policy influence resulted from the ACPO study\u000d\u000a      assessing the effectiveness of `prevent' policing, and in particular\u000d\u000a      harnessing and applying aspects of community policing practice to the\u000d\u000a      prevention of terrorism This had an explicit impact upon the Coalition\u000d\u000a      government's revisions to the national CONTEST counter-terrorism strategy\u000d\u000a      [5-4 &amp; 5-5]. This policy influence was reinforced `on the ground'\u000d\u000a      through a series of UPSI training events for regional counter-terrorist\u000d\u000a      units across the country and presentations to the majority of police Basic\u000d\u000a      Command Unit leads in England and Wales. The research was afforded\u000d\u000a      international reach by an invitation to present at the ACPO International\u000d\u000a      Prevent Conference in 2011 attended by counter- terrorism professionals\u000d\u000a      from North America, Asia and Europe. Additionally, these events were\u000d\u000a      important in enabling the findings of the research to re-shape local\u000d\u000a      delivery.\u000d\u000a    The influence of the Institute's research on UK policing has provided a\u000d\u000a      platform for increasing international reach. Commissions for work from a\u000d\u000a      number of international agencies over the past five years, have included:\u000d\u000a      the Police Academy of the Netherlands; the Scottish Institute for Policing\u000d\u000a      Research; and Victoria Police, Australia. In respect of the latter, during\u000d\u000a      the summer of 2011 Innes was invited to be a Visiting Fellow at the Centre\u000d\u000a      of Excellence for Policing and Security, Australia. During this period he:\u000d\u000a    - lectured at the Australian Federal Police's HQ on UPSI's\u000d\u000a      counter-terrorism research and its shaping of the UK's approach;\u000d\u000a    - ran a training event on community impact assessment of major crimes for\u000d\u000a      the New South Wales Homicide Command;\u000d\u000a    - and gave two lectures and private briefing to the Commissioner and\u000d\u000a      Deputy Commissioner, Victoria Police.\u000d\u000a    These are examples of how the engagement work undertaken by the Institute\u000d\u000a      has shaped international debates on policing policy, especially around\u000d\u000a      being responsive to community needs.\u000d\u000a    Impacts on practitioners and professional services\u000d\u000a      A significant impact of UPSI's research has been improving the efficacy of\u000d\u000a      Neighbourhood Policing. In 2008, a pilot study using the UPSI community\u000d\u000a      engagement methodology (outlined in 3.2 above) was conducted in Cardiff\u000d\u000a      that evidenced an increase in community engagement of around 73% compared\u000d\u000a      with SWP's established approach, and less of a bias towards older and more\u000d\u000a      affluent citizens. The pilot's results led to the approach being\u000d\u000a      progressively extended across the whole of South Wales and integrated\u000d\u000a      within SWP's corporate strategy for improving public confidence. According\u000d\u000a      to official Home Office figures, in the year to September 2011 there was a\u000d\u000a      9% increase in the number of people in South Wales stating they were\u000d\u000a      confident in the police to deal with local concerns. This reflects how,\u000d\u000a      starting in 2009, a rolling programme of face-to-face interviews with the\u000d\u000a      public conducted by Neighbourhood Policing officers using the UPSI method\u000d\u000a      was initiated [5-6].\u000d\u000a    A notable success of this work was Operation Michigan. The UPSI\u000d\u000a      methodology generated `community intelligence' about a drugs market police\u000d\u000a      were unaware of, ultimately resulting in: 184 arrests for Class A drug\u000d\u000a      supply; Prison sentences totalling 200 years set by the courts; Six kilos\u000d\u000a      of heroin, crack and cocaine seized; A 36% reduction in serious\u000d\u000a      acquisitive crime in the target areas and 25% reduction in ASB. When the\u000d\u000a      approach was mainstreamed within SWP in 2011 similar results involving 8\u000d\u000a      arrests, and sizeable drug and cash seizures were obtained [5-6].\u000d\u000a    In London, UPSI has been working with the Safer Sutton Partnership\u000d\u000a      throughout the REF period using the engagement method to inform\u000d\u000a      Neighbourhood Policing and borough-wide Strategic Assessments. The work is\u000d\u000a      credited with: reducing the number of public priorities by about a third;\u000d\u000a      and, in a MORI Tracker poll community safety issues dropped to number\u000d\u000a      three from one in the list of public concerns. This collaboration and its\u000d\u000a      results have been praised by the Audit Commission [5-7], and featured as a\u000d\u000a      case study in a 2012 Liberal Democrat Policy Paper on policing [5-8].\u000d\u000a    Participation on public policy advisory committees\u000d\u000a      Reflecting the Institute's growing reputation for helping to improve\u000d\u000a      police practice, Innes provided oral evidence to the Scottish Parliament's\u000d\u000a      2008 enquiry into Community Policing [5-9] as well as The Home Affairs\u000d\u000a      Select Committee in 2011 and The Silk Commission on devolving policing to\u000d\u000a      Wales in 2013. He has also been directly involved in the Home Office\u000d\u000a      Working Group that established the new national College of Policing, for\u000d\u000a      which UPSI has been cited as a possible model for linking with the\u000d\u000a      academy. Innes is also a panel member of the Independent Commission on\u000d\u000a      Policing established by the Labour Party. The research on ASB and\u000d\u000a      counter-terrorism resulted in Innes being appointed to Cardiff's `Safer\u000d\u000a      and Cohesive Communities' and `CONTEST' boards. These positions provide an\u000d\u000a      opportunity to feed research evidence into local interventions on an\u000d\u000a      ongoing basis.\u000d\u000a    In sum, UPSI can evidence a significant track record of impacting upon\u000d\u000a      police innovation and reform. The former Chief Constable of West Yorkshire\u000d\u000a      and ACPO Lead for Prevent has stated [5-5] \"In Neighbourhood Policing and\u000d\u000a      Preventing Violent Extremism, the UPSI have influenced two of the most\u000d\u000a      significant developments in police policy in the last decade.\"\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Pioneering research by the Universities' Police Science Institute (UPSI)\u000d\u000a      has made police more effective at understanding and responding to crime\u000d\u000a      and disorder.

This refines and significantly\u000d\u000a      extends the work that members of the UPSI team conducted before arrival at\u000d\u000a      Cardiff as part of the National Reassurance Policing Programme (2003-5),\u000d\u000a      the quasi-experimental forerunner of the roll-out of Neighbourhood\u000d\u000a      Policing across England and Wales.\u000d\u000a    Since, 2007, UPSI's research at Cardiff has been based upon a series of\u000d\u000a      linked empirical projects that have collectively afforded new insights\u000d\u000a      into public perceptions and experiences of crime, disorder and policing.\u000d\u000a      This involved the design of an applied research tool, integrating\u000d\u000a      principles from cognitive interviewing method into a qualitative\u000d\u000a      Geographic Information System platform to detect signal crimes and\u000d\u000a      disorders [3-1]. By interviewing structured samples of members of the\u000d\u000a      public about their neighbourhoods, the methodology enables police to\u000d\u000a      identify precisely what problems, in which locations, are having most\u000d\u000a      influence upon community safety. For example, identifying social disorder\u000d\u000a      as the key issue for residents in one street, whilst graffiti is the focus\u000d\u000a      of concern two streets away [3-2].\u000d\u000a    By targeting their operational interventions on those issues and places\u000d\u000a      where most collective harm is occurring, police can deliver a `smarter'\u000d\u000a      response that is more directly focused upon public priorities. Compared\u000d\u000a      with traditional Community Policing methods, the policing model derived\u000d\u000a      provides a more systematic framework for police engaging with communities,\u000d\u000a      and renders policing more directly responsive to citizen concerns [3-3].\u000d\u000a      In 2010 the methodology was adopted by South Wales Police (SWP) and the\u000d\u000a      Safer Sutton Partnership as integral to their delivery of Neighbourhood\u000d\u000a      Policing. It has also been used by: Victoria Police, Australia; The Police\u000d\u000a      Academy of the Netherlands; Lancashire Constabulary and ten other UK\u000d\u000a      police agencies. These projects have extended the empirical base of the\u000d\u000a      research programme and facilitated further methodological innovations\u000d\u000a    Building upon insights derived from these studies, UPSI's research has\u000d\u000a      expanded to cover allied topics. For example, research commissioned by Her\u000d\u000a      Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) in 2010 using secondary\u000d\u000a      analysis of the British Crime Survey, a survey of 5000 anti-social\u000d\u000a      behaviour (ASB) victims, and police data, identified repeat and vulnerable\u000d\u000a      victims of ASB were especially vulnerable to being harmed [3-4]. In 2012\u000d\u000a      HMIC asked the Institute to assist in assessing the progress made by all\u000d\u000a      police forces in England and Wales in using the research evidence from the\u000d\u000a      2010 study in driving improvements in the management of ASB [3-5].\u000d\u000a    In addition, UPSI's research examining the impacts of the Prevent\u000d\u000a      programme in reducing the risks of terrorist attacks has had national\u000d\u000a      policy influence. This includes, in 2011, a study for the Association of\u000d\u000a      Chief Police Officers (ACPO) based upon quantitative analysis of several\u000d\u000a      sweeps from the British Crime Survey and qualitative analysis of in-depth\u000d\u000a      interviews with counter-terrorism police and local community\u000d\u000a      representatives. It is one of the most comprehensive studies of the\u000d\u000a      impacts of counter-terrorism policing upon local communities ever\u000d\u000a      conducted, demonstrating that effective citizen engagement delivered\u000d\u000a      within a Neighbourhood Policing type framework, provides the most robust\u000d\u000a      platform for understanding and responding to the risks of violent\u000d\u000a      extremism within and across UK communities [3-6].\u000d\u000a    Key collaborators on these projects (Dr C.

In a letter of\u000a      support, the first Director General of SOCA notes that \"With SOCA, we\u000a      looked at work he had done around harm reduction, which led to the\u000a      inclusion of that approach within the strategy of SOCA which was published\u000a      in the first Annual report of the agency. It guided much of the\u000a      development of the Serious Organised Crime Threat Assessment, which led to\u000a      the Serious Organised Crime Control Strategy, which allowed many\u000a      government agencies, police and intelligence services to work together in\u000a      coordination to address the threats posed to the UK\", concluding that\u000a      Levi's \"work has definitively shaped much of the underpinning strategy and\u000a      thinking within law enforcement and the government, particularly the Home\u000a      Office\"[5.3]. Levi adapted an e-crimes harm framework for the Police\u000a      eCrime Unit of the Metropolitan Police, which they use for their annual\u000a      reporting. As the former head of this unit states, this framework helped\u000a      provide \"a true reflection of the impact police operations have when\u000a      deployed to combat cyber crime.\" As a result, the Unit was able to put\u000a      together a \"business case which subsequently secured &#163;30m treasury funding\u000a      over a four year period and based on the 1:21 return on investment\u000a      evidenced an end of year four Harm Reduction target of &#163;504m\". The former\u000a      head of unit notes Levi's \"significant assistance in creating the Harm\u000a      reduction process (which is now being utilized in several other areas of\u000a      policing in addition to cyber), and your ongoing support which has been\u000a      instrumental in helping policing deliver these impressive results and in\u000a      reducing harm to the UK\" [5.4].\u000a    The influence of Levi's work on organised crime policy has continued with\u000a      his unpublished internal literature review on organised crime for the Home\u000a      Office, and in-house seminar to policy-makers there, which underpinned\u000a      \"the organised crime research strategy subsequently published by the Home\u000a      Office in late 2010\" [5.5]. Levi's work on organised crime prevention and\u000a      the costs of fraud was used extensively in a Home Office economic study, The\u000a        impact of organised crime in the UK: revenues and economic and social\u000a        costs, and fed into the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit paper Extending\u000a          our Reach, to which he was appointed to an internal review\u000a      team. The deputy director of the strategy unit at the time notes that\u000a      \"Michael was recommended to me by senior practitioners in both the Serious\u000a      Organised Crime Agency and the police and I can confirm that his research\u000a      was invaluable in the development of the final report...In particular, his\u000a      research on the importance of prevention was highly influential and\u000a      impactful\" [5.6].\u000a    In terms of international policy making, Levi's analysis of\u000a      e-gambling and money laundering [see 3.3] provided the evidential basis\u000a      for the Council of Europe's Moneyval committee to conduct a\u000a      money-laundering typologies exercise on that subject, to which he was\u000a      adviser; it was also used and cited explicitly in the German government's\u000a      revision of its money laundering legislation in 2013 to include online\u000a      gambling. His research on proceeds of crime enforcement was a key part of\u000a      the DG-Home proposal for a 2012 directive on the confiscation of proceeds\u000a      of crime. In addition to advising on the background report published with\u000a      the proposed directive [5.7], Levi's work was used in the Directive\u000a      explanatory document to make the case for the need to incentivise asset\u000a      recovery.[5.8]\u000a    His reformulation of organised crime as networked crime has subsequently\u000a      become conventional wisdom: see, e.g. the Europol Serious and Organised\u000a      Crime Threat Assessment (2013), on which he was an adviser\/critical\u000a      friend. In a letter of appreciation, the Director of Europol singles out\u000a      Levi's work: \"of all the help we received, yours was especially useful\".\u000a      [5.9] This is the foundation for the EU Policy Cycle and its\u000a      prioritisation of different crimes within the Union and its Member States.\u000a      Finally, his work on the costs of cybercrime as part of a team asked by\u000a      the UK Ministry of Defence to do a critical overview of evidence has been\u000a      refined and submitted to the CRIM committee of the European Parliament at\u000a      their request, and fed into his project for them on the cost and impact of\u000a      organised crime in Europe. It is one of several of Levi's works cited in\u000a      the World Economic Forum Global Agenda Council on Organized Crime's 2012\u000a      report on organized crime enablers.[5.10] His involvement as one of the\u000a      founding members of that committee - now merged into the Illicit Trade and\u000a      Organised Crime Global Agenda Council - helped to shape its orientation\u000a      towards a strategic focus on intervening against key enablers rather than\u000a      against more frontline criminal actors, and to his participation in its\u000a      2013-14 project on measuring the impact of illicit trade and organised\u000a      crime globally.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Since the 1980s, there has been a wave of global activity seeking\u000a      improved control of money laundering and confiscation of crime proceeds.\u000a      This set of research studies, based around the work of Professor Mike\u000a      Levi, constitutes core empirical analysis of the scale of financial\u000a      crimes, and what can be properly said about the impacts of social\u000a      and formal control measures against them.

Mike\u000a      Levi (Professor of Criminology at Cardiff University, 1991 - Present)'s\u000a      research uses a combination of elite ethnography, interviews with private\u000a      and public sector internationally, and statistical analysis to provide one\u000a      of the first rigorous empirical analyses of the scale of financial crimes.\u000a      It also explores how business, regulatory and criminal justice controls\u000a      actually operate against transnational crimes, for example showing that\u000a      verified frauds cost the UK at least &#163;11.9 billion in 2005. This work has\u000a      highlighted the lack of evidence that money laundering controls have led\u000a      to less crime or altered criminal careers, proving that while that shaming\u000a      and informal settlement may be appropriate for tax offenders with a stake\u000a      in respectability, they have no measured effect on sociopathic loners or\u000a      professional criminal networks.\u000a    Early examples of Levi's work [3.1] conceptually and empirically\u000a      revealed: how bankers and others identified (or not) `suspicious\u000a      transactions' by their customers and filtered these suspicions to the\u000a      Financial Intelligence Unit; how the police and courts investigated (or\u000a      not) proceeds of crime; how prosecutors and defence counsel dealt with\u000a      these issues in court, and deficiencies in the follow up of confiscation\u000a      orders, illuminating the limits of enforcement in ways still valid today.\u000a      This work included the first (and still almost the only) study of the\u000a      policing `yield' of money laundering controls, constructively challenging\u000a      and refining standard senior police and political assertions about their\u000a      effectiveness.\u000a    This work diversified into research analysing the legal and practical\u000a      problems involved in investigating and recovering proceeds of Grand\u000a      Corruption for the World Bank [3.2] and an analysis confounding\u000a      conventional wisdom around e-gambling risks, showing how money laundering\u000a      might occur but concluding that unless gambling firms were themselves\u000a      controlled by criminals, internet gambling was unattractive as a\u000a      laundering method and was of modest scale [3.3].\u000a    An EC\/Home Office-funded study of the prevention of organised crime in\u000a      Europe showed that most European Member State `strategies' were merely\u000a      reactive and highlighted the need for a shift away from seizures and\u000a      arrests as performance indicators of organised crime reduction [3.4]. It\u000a      showed that we did not yet have (or collect) meaningful evidence of impact\u000a      for most organised crime strategies. Levi carried out the first empirical\u000a      study of how lawyers were used to enable fraud and money laundering and\u000a      how regulators combatted this as part of a four-country EC-funded study of\u000a      the regulation of the legal professions [3.5]. Levi led a Rapid Evidence\u000a      Assessment study of the cost of fraud commissioned by the Association of\u000a      Chief Police Officers, which for the first time developed criteria for\u000a      data quality and a typology of fraud, breaking data into different victim\u000a      and method categories, which has served as a baseline for further work\u000a      [3.6] This was developed for the Financial Services Authority into a clear\u000a      analysis of what roles the FSA does and could play in financial crime\u000a      reduction [3.6].\u000a    Professor Levi was a member of staff at Cardiff University while he\u000a      carried out this research.

In response, the Labour Government\u000d\u000acommissioned the Cantle Report (2001), established an independent Commission for Integration\u000d\u000aand Cohesion (reporting in 2007), and asked Lord Goldsmith to review British citizenship (reporting\u000d\u000ain 2008).\u000d\u000aWithin this context, Laurence and Heath's report [R4] was recognized to be the most important\u000d\u000apiece of research underpinning the Government's policy on cohesion, as evidenced by the\u000d\u000aDepartment for Communities and Local Government's Cohesion Delivery Framework: Overview,\u000d\u000awhich acknowledged `a heavy reliance on Laurence and Heath's multi-level modelling of the 2005\u000d\u000aCitizenship Survey [R4], as this is the most robust, nationally representative evidence we have on\u000d\u000acommunity cohesion in England' [Section 5: C1, p.23]. The Department's Director of Analysis and\u000d\u000aInnovation can confirm the importance of this research in shaping policy [C10].\u000d\u000aOne impact of the research is difficult to document but nonetheless worth emphasizing. The finding\u000d\u000athat ethnic diversity does not reduce social cohesion made it impossible for informed policy-makers\u000d\u000ato deflect blame on to immigration. This finding was cited by the then Secretary of State, Hazel\u000d\u000aBlears MP when debating with the American social scientist Robert Putnam (at the Conference\u000d\u000a`Healthy, Wealthy and Wise', 23 June 2008) [C2, p.15].\u000d\u000aThe positive lessons from the research were embodied in a number of policy documents issued by\u000d\u000athe Department for Communities and Local Government:\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aJustifying this policy emphasis within government, The Economic Case for Cohesion Report\u000d\u000a[C3, pp.4, 10] uses their research [R4] to argue that enhanced cohesion will have tangible\u000d\u000aeconomic benefits, including reduced crime levels and better health.\u000d\u000aIn implementing policies to enhance cohesion, the Department issued a slew of documents for\u000d\u000alocal authorities, funders of local projects, and community activists [C4, C5, C6]. These\u000d\u000adocuments translated Laurence and Heath's research into practical guidance. For example:\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a&#8212; Inter-ethnic friendships increase social cohesion: this finding led to the recommendation\u000d\u000athat agencies should fund local projects that build relationships among different groups,\u000d\u000arather than projects catering to particular ethnic groups;\u000d\u000a&#8212; Perceived unfairness in the allocation of social housing reduces social cohesion: this\u000d\u000afinding led to the recommendation that local authorities refine allocation procedures\u000d\u000a(through `choice-based lettings', for example), and also make strenuous efforts to dispel\u000d\u000apopular myths that certain groups (like asylum seekers) are privileged over others.\u000d\u000aBeyond central and local government, multiple organizations have incorporated Laurence and\u000d\u000aHeath's research into their policies and practices. The newly formed Equality and Human Rights\u000d\u000aCommission commissioned a report on how to measure what they conceived as `good relations'\u000d\u000a[C7]. The report drew heavily on Laurence and Heath's research [R4]. For instance, one especially\u000d\u000ainfluential finding was the strong negative effect of economic deprivation. The report argued that\u000d\u000athe Equality and Human Rights Commission should collect measurements going beyond its\u000d\u000astatutory equality groups, in order to recognize how economic deprivation undermined `good\u000d\u000arelations' [C7, pp.18-20, 24].\u000d\u000aConsultants also regularly draw on Laurence and Heath's research.

Leading\u000d\u000aa team of researchers (see below), Heath produced a substantial body of research on British\u000d\u000aidentities funded by two ESRC grants (&#163;129,537, 2001-4; &#163;36,460, 2003-6, both rated outstanding)\u000d\u000aand by the Ministry of Justice (&#163;20,000, 2007).\u000d\u000aThe team's key research findings, outlined in the following sample of publications [Section 3],\u000d\u000awere that:\u000d\u000a&#8212; Although, there has been no major crisis of national identity and social cohesion, there has\u000d\u000abeen a gradual long-term decline in national pride, probably due to generational change\u000d\u000a[Section 3, R1];\u000d\u000a&#8212; Most ethnic minority groups show similar levels of attachment to Britain as does the white\u000d\u000aBritish majority group and do not therefore constitute a major threat to social cohesion [R2];\u000d\u000a&#8212; Major ethnic penalties with respect to unemployment persist for all ethnic minority groups in\u000d\u000aBritain [R5];\u000d\u000a&#8212; The social characteristics of an area, and in particular area levels of economic\u000d\u000adisadvantage, have powerful effects (using multilevel models for analysing contextual\u000d\u000aeffects) on political behaviour [R3].\u000d\u000aIn 2008, this research led the Department for Communities and Local Government to commission\u000d\u000aHeath and his team to undertake an original analysis of factors affecting community social\u000d\u000acohesion, and in particular to explore the impact of ethnic diversity and the growing minority\u000d\u000apopulation in some areas. Heath invited his then doctoral student, James Laurence, to collaborate\u000d\u000aon this report.\u000d\u000aAlthough built on the body of research listed above, this case study focuses on the impact of the\u000d\u000aLaurence and Heath report [R4]. This publication analyzed the 2005 Citizenship Survey for\u000d\u000aEngland and Wales, conducted by the Department for Communities and Local Government. The\u000d\u000asurvey asked 14,000 respondents whether their local area `is a place where people from different\u000d\u000abackgrounds get on well together'. This survey was especially valuable for its `ethnic boost' &#8212;\u000d\u000a4,400 in addition to the representative sample of 9,600 &#8212; which enabled valid statistical inference\u000d\u000afor minority populations. Multilevel modeling was then used to investigate the effects both of\u000d\u000aindividual and of contextual community characteristics on this measure of social cohesion.\u000d\u000aA particular focus of the research was to test Robert Putnam's finding, from the United States\u000d\u000a(2007), that ethnic diversity undermined community cohesion. This American finding had been\u000d\u000awidely publicized in British academic and policy circles. Most significantly, Lawrence and Heath\u000d\u000acontradicted Putnam's conclusions, determining that ethnic diversity enhanced community\u000d\u000acohesion, the opposite effect to that found in the United States. In contrast, Laurence and Heath\u000d\u000afound that one of the mechanisms linking diversity and cohesion is the presence of bridging\u000d\u000arelationships: inter-ethnic friendships increased social cohesion. They identified that social\u000d\u000acohesion is reduced not by diversity but rather by economic disadvantage, at both the individual\u000d\u000aand community level. Other findings included the fact that social cohesion is also influenced by\u000d\u000avarious subjective beliefs, is lower where people perceive the allocation of social housing is unfair,\u000d\u000aand where people fear crime, and that formal volunteering increases social cohesion.\u000d\u000aTeam involved in the research:\u000d\u000aAnthony Heath (at Oxford since 1970, Professor of Sociology since 1999) led the team until his\u000d\u000aretirement in 2010. James Laurence was his doctoral student from 2006 to 2011. At the time of\u000d\u000atheir collaborative research with Heath, Andersen was Senior Research Fellow at Oxford (2000-02),\u000d\u000aRoberts was Data Services Manager at Oxford's Nuffield College (2007-08), and Tilley (a\u000d\u000aformer doctoral student of Heath's) was University Lecturer at Oxford (2005-07).

The BBC\u000d\u000aemployed him for a total of seventy days to provide prediction and analysis for elections to the\u000d\u000aWestminster Parliament in 2010, the Scottish Parliament in 2011, the Welsh Assembly in 2011, the\u000d\u000aEuropean Parliament in 2009, the Greater London Authority and London mayoralty in 2012, for the\u000d\u000aAlternative Vote referendum in 2011, and for local elections every year. As the BBC's Election\u000d\u000aResults Editor summarizes, Fisher `provides the statistical computing that produces the exit poll\u000d\u000aprediction on the day and also the constituency results based forecast overnight. His research is\u000d\u000aimportant not just in providing the data and figures, but also in informing the preparation work for\u000d\u000ahow the exit poll should be conducted and what [can be said about it], and when it is possible to\u000d\u000adraw conclusions from it.' [C2].\u000d\u000aThe 2010 General Election is the focus of this case study. BBC, ITV, and Sky News placed such\u000d\u000aimportance on forecasting the election that they unusually commissioned 18,000 interviews with\u000d\u000avoters at 130 polling sites. This must have cost well in excess of &#163;100K, though the actual financial\u000d\u000acost of the exercise is confidential. Based on these interviews, Fisher applied the methods\u000d\u000adeveloped through his research with Curtice and Kuha [R4] to produce a forecast as the polls\u000d\u000aclosed at 10pm. As most of the data from exit polls arrived in the evening, this analysis had to be\u000d\u000aproduced speedily, 15 minutes after the final batch of data arrived. After 10pm, the BBC deployed\u000d\u000aFisher to provide results-based prediction and analysis.\u000d\u000aThe forecast was broadcast by all three news channels at the close of polls. The prediction that the\u000d\u000aLiberal Democrats would end up with fewer seats than in 2005 was immediately controversial.\u000d\u000aMost commentators dismissed it as implausible, given the party's momentum in the weeks before\u000d\u000athe election. Paddy Ashdown (former leader of the Liberal Democrats) referred to `fairyland figures'\u000d\u000a[C3], while Iain Dale (prominent political commentator) promised to `run naked down Whitehall if\u000d\u000athat turns out to be true' [C4]. These quotations reveal how strongly entrenched mistaken opinion-poll-based\u000d\u000aexpectations were, and so how shocking the exit poll prediction was. The remarkable\u000d\u000aaccuracy of the exit poll prediction was fully clear approaching breakfast time the next day: the\u000d\u000anumber of Conservative seats was predicted perfectly, while overall the forecast was just three\u000d\u000aseats out.\u000d\u000aThe key beneficiaries of this research were:\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000aThe media, who, as a result, were able to report in both an accurate and timely fashion on the\u000d\u000aoutcomes of the election, improving the quality of their programmes and their reputation among\u000d\u000atheir competitors.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aAccording to the BBC's Head of Political Programmes, `the reputation of all three broadcasters,\u000d\u000aparticularly the BBC, rests on producing an accurate exit poll result' [C1]. Predictions about the\u000d\u000afinal outcome set the agenda for broadcasters to discuss the election and its political\u000d\u000aimplications; this dominates programming after 10pm on election night. Thus, thanks to Fisher's\u000d\u000aexit poll analysis, interviewers were able to accurately query guests from the Liberal Democrats\u000d\u000aas to why they had not improved on their 2005 performance rather than mistakenly\u000d\u000acongratulating them in anticipation based on opinion-poll predictions. In addition, Fisher's\u000d\u000astatistical analysis enabled broadcasters to discuss the electorate's political choices in a more\u000d\u000adetailed and authoritative way. For example, the exit poll showed that Labour was particularly\u000d\u000asuccessful where it had an incumbent MP and where ethnic minorities were concentrated.\u000d\u000aThanks to the nuances revealed by the research, broadcasters were able to describe these\u000d\u000adetailed patterns and invite various interviewees to explain them.\u000d\u000aThese detailed patterns are also important for understanding whether the early results, which\u000d\u000amainly come from urban northern Labour constituencies, are in line with the exit poll predictions\u000d\u000afor that kind of seat despite being atypical of the average constituency. This enables the\u000d\u000abroadcasters to retain confidence in the exit poll prediction despite popular but na&#239;ve\u000d\u000a`swingometer' predictions suggesting a different outcome based on a biased set of early results.\u000d\u000aThe exit poll continues to inform early results based forecasts until a wide variety of different\u000d\u000akinds of seats have been declared, which happens as late as 4am the morning after. Thus the\u000d\u000aexit poll is valuable to the media not only before results are declared but also well after.\u000d\u000a`One of the BBC's core public purposes is to sustain democracy and civil society', as the Head\u000d\u000aof Political Programmes emphasizes. `Reporting of politics and elections, and the election\u000d\u000aresults programmes particularly, are a key part of fulfilling this public purpose.' [C1]. The\u000d\u000aOxford-based research played a `vital' part in contributing to this mission [C2].\u000d\u000aThe election forecast reached an audience of several million. ITV1's election programme\u000d\u000aattracted a total of 1.3 million viewers, while Sky News averaged 0.4 million [C5]. BBC One's\u000d\u000aprogramme Election 2010 was watched by 6.6 million at its peak, and the BBC's overall\u000d\u000atelevision coverage of the election reached a total of 17.7 million [C6]. The election forecast\u000d\u000awas the headline news at 10pm on BBC Radio and on the BBC News website, which was\u000d\u000avisited by 4 million UK users on election day [C6]. Attention was also paid by still more people,\u000d\u000ainternationally. These figures show widespread interest in the election outcome immediately\u000d\u000aafter the close of polls, demonstrating that election night programmes are extremely important\u000d\u000afor broadcasters, highlighting their need for the provision of timely and accurate information,\u000d\u000aespecially before the election results come in. They also show that the exit poll analysis reached\u000d\u000alarge numbers of people who would not normally watch political programming.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000aThe Public, who, as a direct result of the programmes that were based on the research, became\u000d\u000abetter informed about the mechanics of the electoral process and the contours of public opinion.\u000d\u000aThis is especially significant for people who are not regular consumers of political news, as\u000d\u000asuggested by viewer numbers above. The validation of the exit poll forecast allowed people to\u000d\u000asee the power of social scientific methods, and may have helped them to establish a level of\u000d\u000atrust in evidence-based information. Those who rightly felt they could place a reasonable\u000d\u000adegree of trust in the exit poll could go to bed earlier! As the Research Strategy Manager from\u000d\u000athe Electoral Commission notes, \"The nature of overnight counting of ballot papers (and,\u000d\u000aincreasingly, the move to daytime counting) results in a delay in the announcement of any\u000d\u000aelection result.\" [C7]. In 2010 most results were not declared until after 4am the morning after.\u000d\u000aSo, \"it is important [for the democratic process] not to lose the excitement of election night and\u000d\u000athe drama of the close of poll. Consequently, having the exit poll contributes enormously to the\u000d\u000aexcitement of the evening ... the exit poll [is] a notable achievement and a valuable contribution\u000d\u000ato electoral politics.\" [C7]\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aBuilding on innovative statistical models developed at Oxford, initially conducted by Dr Clive Payne\u000d\u000aand Prof David Firth, Dr Stephen Fisher's research facilitates quick generation of predictions for\u000d\u000athe share of seats won by each party from exit poll data.

Data from exit polls pose\u000d\u000aparticular methodological problems, which Oxford researchers have gone some way to resolving.\u000d\u000aMany voters have no time or inclination to reveal their choice to interviewers waiting outside the\u000d\u000apolling station, generating bias when supporters of some parties are more reluctant than others.\u000d\u000aSuch problems led to a famous error in the 1992 general election: exit polls conducted separately\u000d\u000afor the BBC and ITV misled forecasters into predicting a hung parliament, whereas in fact the\u000d\u000aConservatives won by a significant margin.\u000d\u000aThis dramatic failure led Clive Payne (Research Lecturer, Nuffield College, Oxford (retired 2002))\u000d\u000aand David Firth (Professor of Social Statistics at the University of Oxford (moved to Warwick\u000d\u000a2003)) to develop more robust statistical models. Their key methodological insight, laid out in a\u000d\u000apath-breaking article [Section 3: R1], was that the analysis of change since the last election and a\u000d\u000afocus on differences in (rather than levels of) swing in different kinds of seats could both reduce\u000d\u000abias and increase efficiency when using the exit poll to inform early results based forecasts. John\u000d\u000aCurtice (University of Strathclyde) and David Firth (University of Warwick since 2003) took this\u000d\u000aresearch a step further (2008) and demonstrated that it was preferable to measure change\u000d\u000abetween two exit polls at the same polling stations in consecutive elections, cancelling out much of\u000d\u000athe bias. Stephen Fisher first became involved with this research in 1997, continuing after\u000d\u000abecoming Lecturer in Political Sociology at Oxford (in 2002) and since 2007 he has played the\u000d\u000aleading role in developing this statistical methodology.\u000d\u000aMost recently for the 2010 election, as well as improving the speed, diagnostics and reporting\u000d\u000afunctions of the forecasting process [R2, R4], Fisher developed and evaluated methods for\u000d\u000apredicting constituency victories from vote shares [R3, R4], for sampling new locations for exit\u000d\u000apolls [R4], for the selection of forecasting models [R2, R4], and for adjusting for postal voting and\u000d\u000anon-response bias [R4]. In particular, Fisher showed that probabilistic prediction of seat outcomes\u000d\u000ais relatively insensitive to distributional assumptions and tuning parameters [R3, R4], and also\u000d\u000adeveloped a stratification strategy and balance checking for the random selection of a very small\u000d\u000anumber of new exit poll locations [R4]. While substantial numbers of electors are registered to vote\u000d\u000aby post, and so fall outside the sampling frame for the exit poll, the stability of the rates of postal\u000d\u000avoting between 2005 and 2010, together with the absence of a differential postal voting effect on\u000d\u000achange in vote choice, meant that the exit poll forecast was best left unadjusted in 2010 unlike in\u000d\u000a2005 [R4]. This recent work shows that the accumulation of small methodological choices has a\u000d\u000asubstantial aggregate effect on the forecast [R4].\u000d\u000aUnusually in sociology, Fisher's methods have been tested under difficult time pressure and in the\u000d\u000afull glare of publicity via live international television, radio and online coverage.

As one of two academics on the review, he shared the insights\u000a      from his research on the factors enabling mafias to migrate across\u000a      borders, ensuring that his research contributed directly to the panel`s\u000a      recommendations [C1]. In particular, Varese`s research confirming\u000a      the localized nature of organized crime led to recognition that a national\u000a      agency devoid of links to local policing units would be less effective.\u000a      Recommendations based on Varese`s research [culminating in R2]\u000a      were implemented after the 2010 election, when the new government\u000a      announced that the Serious and Organized Crime Agency would be merged into\u000a      a newly created organization, the National Crime Agency, much more\u000a      embedded in local policing.\u000a    As a consequence of several analysts attending one of Varese`s lectures\u000a      in the United States, Public Safety Canada (equivalent to the UK`s Home\u000a      Office) commissioned a paper on Varese`s work (written by Ottawa\u000a      University Professor of Criminology R. Hastings (2006)), and then employed\u000a      Varese as a consultant in 2010 to discuss the implications of his research\u000a      for migration and the risks of organized crime. He addressed the chief\u000a      civil servant in each ministry dealing with crime and migration [C2].\u000a      Varese`s analysis [R2] informed the government`s review of\u000a      priorities, emphasizing that crime was not caused by migration, but rather\u000a      by the sudden expansion of unregulated markets, and the development of a\u000a      demand for informal or criminal protection. As demonstrated in Varese`s\u000a      research [R2], undocumented migrants might seek protection from\u000a      mafia-like organizations when criminalized.\u000a    Varese`s research also held particular relevancy for policymakers in\u000a      Italy. Two prosecutors from the Anti-Mafia Parliamentary Commission,\u000a      reporting to the Parliament`s Joint Committee on the Mafia in 2011, cited\u000a      Mafias on the Move as `extremely significant' [C3]. A\u000a      Member of Parliament then quizzed the prosecutors on Varese`s explanation\u000a      for which cities are more vulnerable to penetration by the mafia. In\u000a      addition, the book was cited in proceedings to remove one Member of\u000a      Parliament`s immunity from criminal prosecution. The Member who initiated\u000a      the proceedings described Varese`s research on the mafia`s mechanisms of\u000a      penetration of the legal economy as `the most up-to-date and scrupulous\u000a      analysis' [C4].\u000a    Practitioners &#8212; police and prosecutors:\u000a    The widest impact on the practices of police and prosecutors has occurred\u000a      within two European institutions, Europol and Eurojust.\u000a    Europol helps police forces fight against serious international\u000a      crime and terrorism. When Europol hosted a training symposium for 120\u000a      crime analysts from Europe and the United States (organized by the\u000a      International Association of Crime Analysts) in April 2012, they invited\u000a      Varese (based on their awareness of his research) to give a keynote\u000a      lecture on techniques for the quantitative analysis of telephone\u000a      intercepts. Europol then invited Varese`s co-researcher, Campana, to\u000a      provide a two-day hands-on workshop at the Hague in September 2012. He\u000a      taught 25 crime analysts how to apply network and correspondence analysis\u000a      techniques developed by Varese [R3, R4, R5] to the evidence\u000a      already collected by their police forces. A letter from a Senior Analyst\u000a      at Europol confirms the value of Campana`s training of Europol`s strategic\u000a      analysts [C6]. In addition, Varese and Campana advised on the way\u000a      Europol collects data for its biennial Organised Crime Threat\u000a        Assessment [C6]. This advice led to a major restructuring of\u000a      Europol data collection strategy. Relationships initiated through Europol\u000a      have now developed between the two researchers and national police forces.\u000a      One such force (which cannot be identified because its investigation is\u000a      ongoing) sent two police analysts to Oxford in May 2013 to spend two days\u000a      learning network analysis from Campana.\u000a    Eurojust helps judicial systems investigate serious cross-border\u000a      and organized crime. After an initial meeting with Varese and Campana, the\u000a      organization`s Case Management Analyst invited Campana to the Hague in May\u000a      2012 to improve data collection on the prosecution of transnational crime.\u000a      He recommended augmenting the data to include the outcome of each case\u000a      prosecuted: whether the accused was convicted and, if convicted, the\u000a      sentence imposed. This enabled Eurojust to evaluate whether transnational\u000a      crimes should be prosecuted in a single country or in multiple countries,\u000a      depending on the type of crime and the type of judicial system. Eurojust\u000a      incorporated Campana`s advice into the organization`s strategic plan [C7].\u000a    Furthermore, Italian prosecutors operating in the areas studied by Varese\u000a      have stated that his research is `particularly relevant' in identifying\u000a      conditions that lead to mafia penetration [C5].\u000a    Beyond policy and practices, Varese`s research on the Russian\u000a      mafia`s migration to Western Europe informs the plot of John le Carr&#233;`s\u000a      novel, Our Kind of Traitor. The author acknowledges him:\u000a      `heartfelt thanks ... for his creative and ever-patient counsel' [C8].\u000a      The novel sold 132,000 copies in the United Kingdom in 2011, making it the\u000a      89th bestselling book.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Federico Varese`s research has redirected thinking on the (mainly local)\u000a      nature of organized crime. Varese has shown that a significant factor\u000a      accounting for the spread of organized crime is the efforts of individuals\u000a      to escape arrest in their home country. His research, as well as his role\u000a      on the Strategic Review (2010), has made substantial contributions to the\u000a      restructuring of the UK`s Serious Organized Crime Agency (SOCA).

From 2003 onwards, he\u000a      explored an under-theorised aspect within criminology, namely the reasons\u000a      that account for the migration of crime groups outside of their territory\u000a      of origin. More broadly, this work addresses the relationship between\u000a      globalization and crime.\u000a    The research &#8212; culminating in a major book [R2] &#8212; is based on\u000a      extensive field interviews and data collection in Italy, the United\u000a      States, Russia, Hungary, and China. Matched comparisons are deployed to\u000a      explain why mafias sometimes succeed at conquering new territories, while\u000a      at other times they fail. An example is the movement of the Calabrese\u000a      `Ndrangheta clan in the 1960s to both Bardonecchia (Piedmont) and Verona\u000a      (Veneto). The `Ndrangheta achieved long-term success in the former, but\u000a      failed to become established in the latter.\u000a    The book concludes that mafias do not move outside their territories in\u000a      order to take advantage of globalization, as the literature has claimed.\u000a      Instead, mafiosi are forced out either by internal conflict, by police\u000a      action, or occasionally to escape poverty. They succeed in creating\u000a      established outposts where their arrival coincides with significant\u000a      expansions in local markets (such as construction) that are not properly\u000a      governed by legitimate institutions of authority. These findings vindicate\u000a      the insight that mafias are a form of governance of local markets, using\u000a      violence for the benefit of market incumbents, yet they account for the\u000a      fact that mafias do exist outside of their territory, an outcome denied by\u000a      previous researchers (e.g. Gambetta, 1993).\u000a    Research for the book unearthed transcripts of wiretaps produced during\u000a      an Italian investigation into a Russian mafia group. These transcripts\u000a      recorded 758 conversations among 164 people, providing unprecedented\u000a      insights into their routine activities. While similar transcripts have\u000a      been read selectively by scholars in the past, Varese spelled out general\u000a      validity and reliability issues related to these data, and applied\u000a      advanced quantitative techniques to the entire corpus of transcripts [R3].\u000a    In the Trends in Organized Crime paper [R3] Varese and\u000a      Campana outline the general criteria for using this kind of data, while,\u000a      in his book and two further papers, Varese [R2, R4 and R5] uses\u000a      quantitative content analysis, multiple correspondence analysis, and\u000a      network analysis to analyze these data. This innovative combination of\u000a      techniques enables Varese to link the content of the conversations to the\u000a      attributes of the speakers, and to the structure of the network. In\u000a      further work with Campana [R6], Varese uses statistical modelling\u000a      techniques developed among others by Tom Snijders, to trace the evolution\u000a      of the network through time and test hypotheses on tie formation.\u000a    Using these techniques, Varese showed that this Russian mafia group in\u000a      Italy had a well-developed hierarchical organization, with an internal\u000a      division of labour, and that women played a significant role in managing\u000a      the group [R4]. The group`s core business activities remained in\u000a      Russia, while the Italian branch was primarily concerned with laundering\u000a      money and monitoring its investments [R3]. This work is the first\u000a      to reconstruct the internal structure of a crime group on the basis of\u000a      what people do, and more generally it shows that crime groups are\u000a      functionally diversified.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"11755","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Below we provide evidence of three distinct, though interlinked, impacts\u000a      driven by our research:\u000a    1) Advancing policy and public understandings of bisexuality\u000a    The Open University and BiUK published The Bisexuality Report,\u000a      which summarises key national\u000a      and international research and advances recommendations for policy and\u000a      practice.

Research from countries where euthanasia is legal show that\u000a      approximately 2% of deaths are by euthanasia, which would translate to\u000a      about 12,000 deaths annually. In January 2012 the Daily Telegraph\u000a      reported that up until that date 182 British people had travelled to\u000a      Dignitas in Switzerland for an assisted suicide. British Social Attitudes\u000a      surveys have, for some years, shown UK public support for permissive\u000a      legislation on assisted dying to stand at approximately 80%. The Nexis\u000a      newspaper database of all national newspapers showed that in the five\u000a      years to March 2013 there were 1816 newspaper articles containing three or\u000a      more mentions of terms describing assisted dying. This is therefore an\u000a      issue of considerable public significance, where research relevant to\u000a      debates about the topic has considerable reach.\u000a    Attempts to change the law to allow assisted dying are periodically made\u000a      in the UK, the most recent of these being a Bill in the House of Lords\u000a      sponsored by Lord Joffe and accompanied by a select committee report,\u000a      which was defeated (or talked out) in 2006. Evidence given to the Select\u000a      Committee by the National Council of Palliative Care indicated the need\u000a      for better information about, for example, the extent to which assisted\u000a      dying was currently being practiced in the UK, and the state of medical\u000a      opinion about the desirability of legislation. The surveys reported in\u000a      this impact case study have subsequently provided this information, and\u000a      this has fed into debates in a variety of forums involving legislators,\u000a      policy makers and lobby groups associated with renewed attempts (and\u000a      opposing efforts) to get permissive legislation passed.\u000a    At the time of the Joffe Bill, the British Medical Association briefly\u000a      changed its stance on the desirability of legalising assisted dying from\u000a      one of opposition to one of neutrality. This has now changed back to\u000a      opposition, but it prompted a great deal of debate about the true state of\u000a      medical opinion. The select committee commissioned a report into the\u000a      evidence about medical opinion and this revealed a collection of rather\u000a      poorly conducted studies, with uncertain response rates and question\u000a      wordings that did not allow trends over time, or comparisons with surveys\u000a      of general public opinion, to be reliably made. The second 2008 survey, by\u000a      remedying the methodological problems of earlier surveys, established this\u000a      conclusively so that it is now well understood that the UK medical\u000a      profession and the UK general public differ markedly in their levels of\u000a      support for such legislation, with doctors being largely opposed. This is\u000a      an important finding, as UK parliamentarians have, historically, been\u000a      highly influenced by medical opinions on this matter.\u000a    Further to this, the relevance of the research for guidelines issued by\u000a      the Director of Public Prosecutions following the Diane Pretty case and\u000a      the ongoing experience of UK citizens travelling to Switzerland to avail\u000a      themselves of the services of Dignitas, concerning the conditions under\u000a      which a prosecution would and would not be pursued against a person for\u000a      assisting in a suicide, have been brought out in the pages of the British\u000a      Medical Journal and subsequent correspondence, and in evidence given in\u000a      2010 to the Commission on Assisted Dying, chaired by Lord Falconer at\u000a      Demos, where Seale gave evidence in a session to which the Director of\u000a      Public Prosecutions also contributed evidence.\u000a    In addition, some of the results, particularly those concerning the high\u000a      rate at which sedative drugs are used in UK end-of-life care and the role\u000a      played by doctors' personal religious beliefs, have excited the attention\u000a      of journalists, professional regulatory bodies, and professional groups.\u000a    On sedation, the Daily Telegraph in 2010 ran a number of stories,\u000a      influenced by the study results, expressing concern about the over-use of\u000a      sedation said to be associated with the roll-out of the Liverpool Care\u000a      Pathway (LCP), a scheme or checklist aimed at guiding the professional\u000a      practice of health care providers in end-of-life care. A BBC Radio 4\u000a      report involving an interview with Seale also fuelled this concern, and\u000a      Seale has been invited to discuss his findings on sedation at meetings of\u000a      professional groups concerned with the Liverpool Care Pathway and the use\u000a      of sedatives. Recently, the LCP has been disbanded because of public\u000a      concerns about its use in health care settings. Further qualitative and\u000a      observational research on the use of sedation involving Seale in\u000a      collaboration with researchers in Nottingham (UK), Rotterdam (Netherlands)\u000a      and Ghent (Belgium) is continuing into this subject, and this will\u000a      elucidate the complex relationship between the use of continuous deep\u000a      sedation until death, and euthanasia, as this applies in different\u000a      legislative environments.\u000a    On religious beliefs, mass media coverage of the research has highlighted\u000a      the implications of the findings for debates about the place of doctors'\u000a      personal religious beliefs in their clinical practice. This has\u000a      implications for General Medical Council guidance to doctors. Again, this\u000a      element of the findings has received coverage in national and\u000a      international mass media (for example, participation in a debate on BBC\u000a      World Service).\u000a    Evidence of impact from 2008 onwards includes the following:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aUK newspaper coverage: Express (leader), Sunday Express\u000a        (leader), Times, Guardian, Glasgow Herald, Daily Telegraph, Sunday\u000a        Herald, Daily Mail.\u000a      \u000aUK broadcast media coverage: Interviews on BBC4 Today\u000a        programme, BBC World Service, BBC local radio; reports on BBC News\u000a        website.\u000a      \u000aInternet coverage: The research findings have been reported and\u000a        their implications discussed on many websites.

It was funded by the Nuffield\u000a      Foundation and the National Council for Palliative Care and Seale was the\u000a      sole researcher. The research, involving postal surveys of nationally\u000a      representative samples of doctors done in 2004 and 2008, established that:\u000a    \u000a      Euthanasia is rare in the UK, although it happens. Physician-assisted\u000a        suicide does not occur.\u000a      UK doctors are particularly concerned to discuss end-of-life decisions\u000a        with patients, but not as much as doctors in countries where assisted\u000a        dying is permitted.\u000a      UK doctors frequently make other end-of-life decisions that are\u000a        allowable under UK law, which they believe have an impact on length of\u000a        life.\u000a      UK doctors are, on the whole, opposed to the legalisation of assisted\u000a        dying (euthanasia and assisted suicide) unlike the British general\u000a        public.\u000a      One in ten dying patients make requests for a hastened death and these\u000a        sometimes persist in spite of the care provided. A high rate of such\u000a        requests occurs in palliative care.\u000a      Doctors' with religious or faith beliefs are less willing to carry out\u000a        (or to say they carried out) actions that were partly intended to end\u000a        life, or to provide continuous deep sedation until death.\u000a      There is a relatively high rate of use of continuous deep sedation\u000a        until death in UK medical practice.\u000a      `Vulnerable' people (for example, older people in care homes or with\u000a        dementia dementia) are no more likely than other patients to be subject\u000a        to decisions that doctors think will have shortened their lives, or to\u000a        receive continuous deep sedation until death (so that a `slippery slope'\u000a        does not appear to exist).\u000a    \u000a    These studies are significant in providing for the first time reliable\u000a      nationwide data on doctors' attitudes and practices. They remedy a gap in\u000a      knowledge about UK medical practices, a field that in other European\u000a      countries &#8212; such as Belgium and The Netherlands &#8212; has been more\u000a      extensively studied. Due to Seale's contacts and research collaborations\u000a      with researchers in these countries, results are directly comparable with\u000a      studies in these other countries, enabling international trends and\u000a      comparisons to be made.\u000a    The results are directly relevant to issues that were previously debated\u000a      by UK legislators in the absence of good evidence. In this respect, the\u000a      survey results play a similar role to findings produced by Seale and\u000a      colleagues in studies based on survey research going back to the early\u000a      1990s. Claims and counter claims about the extent of euthanasia in the UK\u000a      (finding 1), about the state of medical opinion and how it compares with\u000a      general public opinion regarding the legalisation of assisted dying\u000a      (finding 4), about the extent to which dying people request an assisted\u000a      death (finding 5), and claims about the impact of death-hastening\u000a      practices on `vulnerable' groups have been addressed by the research.\u000a      Other matters such as the influence of religious beliefs on medical\u000a      decision-making, and the high rate of sedative drug use (findings 6 and 7)\u000a      have raised new issues that are of concern to professional groups,\u000a      professional regulatory authorities and the general public.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14050","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Noise of the Past produced two principal artistic outputs: (i) a film Unravelling\u000d\u000a      (2008, 17mins, DVD); and (ii) a Live musical performance Post-Colonial\u000d\u000a        War Requiem (22mins, 2008). Project Investigators: Dr Nirmal Puwar\u000d\u000a      (Senior Lecturer, Goldsmiths, Univ. of London); Dr Sanjay Sharma (Senior\u000d\u000a      Lecturer, Brunel University) &#8212; his role was central to innovating a\u000d\u000a      call-and-response practice by developing a collaborative methodology.\u000d\u000a    Noise of the Past project enhanced the public understanding of war\u000d\u000a      and memory by creating opportunities to imagine an inclusive multicultural\u000d\u000a      nation. By engaging with diverse publics through the creative production\u000d\u000a      of art and transformative multicultural dialogue, the project offered\u000d\u000a      alternative representations of the nation outside of militaristic and\u000d\u000a      exclusionary narratives of belonging. The established norms of national\u000d\u000a      belonging was challenged by the project. Moreover, the project facilitated\u000d\u000a      raising an awareness towards how public understanding and attitudes\u000d\u000a      towards ethnic minority groups belonging to nation are formed, to able to\u000d\u000a      question the political grounds upon which minorities are included.\u000d\u000a      Creative artistic practice was deployed as a primary means to engage\u000d\u000a      publics.\u000d\u000a    Noise of the Past has impacted on the public engagements with\u000d\u000a      race, ethnicity and nationalism. Building on current debates in this area\u000d\u000a      concerning inclusive multicultural societies, the project was significant\u000d\u000a      for rethinking how we engage with complex and contested notions of\u000d\u000a      belonging, identity, memory and war, by conversing with different groups\u000d\u000a      through a series of public events and pedagogic engagements.\u000d\u000a    The challenge of postcolonial representation was investigated with\u000d\u000a      practitioners through co- production of public art, innovating methods of\u000d\u000a      collaboration using the dialogic mode of `call-and- response'. Noise\u000d\u000a        of the Past publicly conversed with multi-sensory modalities of\u000d\u000a      poetry, histories, music and visual art through the two key outputs. Both\u000d\u000a      cultural productions were premiered at an inaugural event in Coventry\u000d\u000a      Cathedral on 8th November 2008, as a major public intervention in accepted\u000d\u000a      codes of national remembrance.[Source A] This location was selected as a\u000d\u000a      symbolic site for war and remembrance in the UK, and the Cathedral has an\u000d\u000a      international reputation for its work in peace and reconciliation. The\u000d\u000a      event also offered an example of how the Cathedral can do multicultural\u000d\u000a      memory work and include minority audiences. The site offered a public\u000d\u000a      arena to both experience and discuss how we belong to a multicultural\u000d\u000a      national.\u000d\u000a    The project researchers worked with the Cathedral organising committee\u000d\u000a      and the Coventry Peace Festival, and launched the Noise of the Past\u000d\u000a      project as part of the Peace Festival's activities during the time of\u000d\u000a      national remembrance in November 2008. For the Cathedral, Noise of the\u000d\u000a        Past was a free public event, opened by Martin Bell (OBE, UNICEF\u000d\u000a      ambassador). Over 450 people were in attendance, and new visitors,\u000d\u000a      including those from minority groups, were brought to the Cathedral. The\u000d\u000a      inaugural event was a gathering of ethnically diverse communities from the\u000d\u000a      Coventry region and beyond, consisting of members of the local community\u000d\u000a      recruited from Libraries, places of worship, Coventry Council, community\u000d\u000a      centres, poetry groups, former WWII soldiers and their families and the\u000d\u000a      local media. In addition, Arts programmers and Curators from diverse\u000d\u000a      locations attended the launch event in the Cathedral.\u000d\u000a    At the Cathedral launch event a Q&amp;A session also enabled audience\u000d\u000a      members to respond to the event, which demonstrated its public impact. It\u000d\u000a      was evident that the film and musical performance brought together and\u000d\u000a      promoted dialogue between different communities. For example, an audience\u000d\u000a      member involved with the Cathedral stated:\u000d\u000a    ...As a member of the cathedral community here, how moved I felt this\u000d\u000a        evening was.

Ten feedback `vox-pop' interviews evidenced how\u000d\u000a      the multi-sensory experience of the event publicly engaged with the\u000d\u000a      resident narratives of war and memory, and contributed to an inclusive\u000d\u000a      multicultural imagination of the of the nation for both minority and\u000d\u000a      majority groups.

The Gallery has a peace and reconciliation section, which the film\u000d\u000a      was part of. One visitor responded :\u000d\u000a    Congratulations it is absolutely brilliant.

The film Unravelling has been included\u000d\u000a      in significant conferences involving third sector groups, including\u000d\u000a      Galleries, Museums and festivals. The film was part of the Black\u000d\u000a        Screen Heritage Conference (31 July 2009, Source D) organised by the\u000d\u000a      Imperial War Museum (in partnership with Yorkshire Film Archive and\u000d\u000a      Skillset). The event influenced strategy for creating accessible\u000d\u000a      collections relating to Black British heritage and knowledge sharing for\u000d\u000a      wider communities. It involved black cultural organisations, archivists,\u000d\u000a      film curators, community arts workers and audience development managers. Unravelling\u000d\u000a      screenings with a Q&amp;A were also featured in `third sector' arts-based\u000d\u000a      conferences including Taking Part (29 - 30 Oct 2010), Southbank,\u000d\u000a      London (Source E), and Visuality\/Materialityi conference, Royal\u000d\u000a      Institute of British Architects, London (July 2009) (Source F). These\u000d\u000a      public events with over 100 audience members stimulated the creation of\u000d\u000a      new contexts for debates in arts practice, and strengthened links between\u000d\u000a      third sector organisations, diverse publics and academic institutions.\u000d\u000a    Unravelling has also circulated in international arts events with\u000d\u000a      audiences ranging from 50 - 200. For example, Re-Orient festival,\u000d\u000a      Stockholm (Oct 2008; audience size 200, Source G) and international film\u000d\u000a      festivals (e.g. USA and Germany). The film's cultural impact is been\u000d\u000a      acknowledged via winning three `best short film' international awards:\u000d\u000a      Spinning Wheel Film Festival, USA (2008; audience size 200) and the Sikh\u000a        International Film Festival, USA, (2009; audience size 100), and the\u000d\u000a      London Asian Film Festival (2011; audience size: 80) (Source H).\u000d\u000a      Additionally, it has won an Amsterdam Film Festival, Van Gough Award\u000d\u000a      (2011), (Souce I) In addition, a series of workshops screening Unravelling\u000d\u000a      featured as part of the ESRC Festival of Social Science (Nov 2013, Source\u000d\u000a      J). Working from four different community based locations, the events\u000d\u000a      offered a form of public sociology exploring with audiences how forms of\u000d\u000a      remembrance can genuinely engage with multicultural diversity.

Its key aim was to explore how a contested\u000d\u000a      multicultural nation can be experienced otherwise, outside of racial\u000d\u000a      exclusions. The project responded to how an inclusive nation can be\u000d\u000a      imagined by productively engaging with the contested representations of\u000d\u000a      Britain's imperial past.\u000d\u000a    The project explored the problem of postcolonial representation. That is,\u000d\u000a      how the differential inclusion of migrant memories and experiences in the\u000d\u000a      collective history and identity of a multicultural nation can be\u000d\u000a      collaboratively investigated with practitioners (film-makers, artists and\u000d\u000a      musicians), through co-production of public art.\u000d\u000a    The project highlighted the role of (post)colonial soldiers from the\u000d\u000a      Indian-subcontinent in World Wars I &amp; II, and how their contribution\u000d\u000a      was integral to the democratic development of European societies. This\u000d\u000a      focus, via the production of public art, brought together both ethnic\u000d\u000a      minority and majority groups into a productive multicultural dialogue. The\u000d\u000a      research made it possible for diverse publics to constructively explore\u000d\u000a      together how a multicultural nation can be represented and experienced\u000d\u000a      from an `ethnic minority' perspective.\u000d\u000a    One of the core achievements of the project was the development of\u000d\u000a      innovative methodologies for collaboration between different academic and\u000d\u000a      non-academic communities. Modes for `dialogic exchange' &#8212; a process which\u000d\u000a      mobilises knowledge transfer across intellectual and aesthetic formations\u000d\u000a      between academics, artists and publics &#8212; were developed and successfully\u000d\u000a      employed. This dialogic approach was realised as a `call-and-response'\u000d\u000a      method, which both investigates and reflexively intervenes in the very\u000d\u000a      process of the production of knowledge and public art. The method\u000d\u000a      facilitates engagement with the social world by creating the conditions\u000d\u000a      for collaboration and interaction between academics, practitioners and\u000d\u000a      publics. The call-and-response method enabled practitioners to transform\u000d\u000a      complex academic ideas, contested histories and political issues, and\u000d\u000a      engage the public sphere. The project developed an iterative research\u000d\u000a      process, which generated a series of cultural artefacts &#8212; principally a\u000d\u000a      film and a live musical performance &#8212; that responded to the problem of\u000d\u000a      postcolonial remembrance and representation. The method activated a chain\u000d\u000a      of reflexive responses between the researchers, the creative practitioners\u000d\u000a      and their cultural productions. Call-and-response is premised upon a\u000d\u000a      process of exchange that involves stages whereby research ideas, concepts,\u000d\u000a      materials and artefacts are passed and returned, transformed, only to be\u000d\u000a      carried over to the next practitioner involved in the relay of\u000d\u000a      co-production. A key stage involved the researchers gathering and\u000d\u000a      producing materials which mapped the terrain of national remembrance and\u000d\u000a      postcolonial memory. These materials were generated from academic texts,\u000d\u000a      colonial film and sound archives, migrant soldier documents, letters and\u000d\u000a      photographs. The research process facilitated a critical space of\u000d\u000a      investigation for producing the final aesthetic outputs.\u000d\u000a    In addition to the cultural productions of the film and musical\u000d\u000a      performance, outputs include a special edited collection for The\u000d\u000a        Senses &amp; Society journal, and an article developing a curatorial\u000d\u000a      sociological practice has been published in The Sociological Review.[2]\u000a      The text-based outputs enhance our understanding of how artistic practices\u000d\u000a      can be deployed for intervening in how an inclusive multicultural nation\u000d\u000a      can be re-imagined.\u000d\u000a    The achievements of the Noise of the Past are transferable to\u000d\u000a      other projects; for example, the artists involved in the project have\u000d\u000a      subsequently deployed the call-and-response method in their other work.\u000d\u000a      The method encourages collaboration and crossing boundaries between the\u000d\u000a      academy and different publics, and addresses the challenge of working with\u000d\u000a      minority communities beyond merely as an `add-on' to research.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"15527","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3439705","Name":"Uruguay"},{"GeoNamesId":"3686110","Name":"Colombia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"2464461","Name":"Tunisia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The two phases of Payne`s research discussed above have led to high\u000a      demand for her\u000a      involvement in policy making around the world. Most significant among\u000a      these are presentations to\u000a      policymakers in Brazil, Colombia, Uruguay, and at global fora.\u000a    Brazil: In 2009, Brazil`s government was deliberating whether to\u000a      establish a commission to\u000a      investigate crimes committed under military rule (then shielded by an\u000a      Amnesty Law). At this crucial\u000a      juncture, thanks to the team`s established networks and the\u000a      appropriateness and relevance of the\u000a      research, Payne was identified as one of only a handful of international\u000a      experts on transitional\u000a      justice to present her findings and influence the policy debate at three\u000a      venues. First, a seminar\u000a      sponsored by the Brazilian Ministry of Justice and organized by the\u000a      President of the Amnesty\u000a      Commission (`When Transitional Justice Works`, Rio de Janeiro, September\u000a      2009), which was\u000a      attended by the Minister of Justice along with other Ministry staff.\u000a      Second, a conference sponsored\u000a      by the National Association of Human Rights (`Human Rights, Democracy and\u000a      Diversity`, Bel&#233;m,\u000a      September 2009), which was attended by policy-makers including the\u000a      Minister of Human Rights.\u000a      Third, an International Conference on the Right to Truth, sponsored by the\u000a      Ministry of Justice and\u000a      the N&#250;cleo de Estudos da Viol&#234;ncia (S&#227;o Paulo, October 2009). Payne spoke\u000a      of the findings of her\u000a      research [R1-R3] indicating that Brazilian democracy and human\u000a      rights would be enhanced by\u000a      adding trials to the mix of transitional justice mechanisms currently\u000a      debated in the country.\u000a      Although the country has resisted any justice for past human rights\u000a      violations, Payne`s research\u000a      reinforces the findings by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights that\u000a      have condemned the\u000a      blanket amnesty law and reinforce the claims made by victims` groups.\u000a      Indeed, as the Chairman of\u000a      the Amnesty Commission recalls, Payne`s research reinforced and amplified\u000a      the domestic and\u000a      international pressure for trials [Section 5: C1] to complement\u000a      the amnesty law and truth\u000a      commission. He notes that the victim groups at the truth commission\u000a      meeting added \"and Justice\"\u000a      to the nametags that had previously read \"The Right to Truth.\" [C1].\u000a      They thus used Payne`s\u000a      team`s finding that truth, justice, and amnesties in Brazil would likely\u000a      lead to stronger results for\u000a      democracy and human rights as a way to promote their demand that the\u000a      government not limit the\u000a      process to an amnesty plus truth commission, but also considered the\u000a      possibility of human rights\u000a      trials [R1-R3]. Payne et al. have written about this event and its\u000a      impact [R5].\u000a    Colombia: Payne presented her research [R4] at an\u000a      international seminar in Colombia, on\u000a      `Negotiation with the Guerillas: Between Peace and Justice' (Bogota,\u000a      November 2010). As part of\u000a      this visit, Payne was also asked by the Ideas of Peace Foundation and the\u000a      International Centre for\u000a      Transitional Justice-Colombia to discuss her work in private meetings with\u000a      all sections of the\u000a      judicial and political establishment concerned with the peace process:\u000a      thirty public prosecutors\u000a      involved with paramilitary cases, twenty clerks of the Supreme Court,\u000a      three Justices of the\u000a      Supreme Court, and the Chair of the Congressional Committee on Peace [C2].\u000a      According to a\u000a      member of the National Commission of Reparation and Reconciliation,\u000a      Payne`s `comparative\u000a      empirical analyses of the balance between justice, amnesty and other\u000a      mechanisms of transitional\u000a      justice have had an enormous impact on introducing a sense of reality into\u000a      the debates about the\u000a      justice policies that should be adopted to guarantee the success of the\u000a      transition' [C3]. Payne was\u000a      also invited to present her research in a conference aimed at adapting the\u000a      \"Colombian model\" for\u000a      Tunisia, \"Rule of Law and Transitional Justice\" sponsored by the German\u000a      government agency GIZ,\u000a      European Inter-University Centre for Human Rights and Democratisation\u000a      (EIUC), Venice Lido, 11-15\u000a      November 2012.\u000a    Uruguay: Payne`s team used the findings on amnesties [R4]\u000a      to successfully influence Uruguay`s\u000a      policymakers. In May 2011, Uruguay`s Supreme Court of Justice had\u000a      determined that enforced\u000a      disappearance was an ordinary crime rather than an international crime\u000a      against humanity. The\u000a      Court`s reasoning, when applied generally, made it impossible to prosecute\u000a      retrospectively any of\u000a      the crimes committed during the previous dictatorship, because they were\u000a      immune under the\u000a      statute of limitations stipulated by the criminal code. In response to\u000a      this decision, Lessa contacted\u000a      Amnesty International`s legal adviser in Buenos Aires and offered the\u000a      resources of Oxford`s\u000a      Transitional Justice Database. Using evidence from the research [R4],\u000a      Amnesty International`s\u000a      report (Sept. 2011) argued that international crimes are not subject to\u000a      statutes of limitations [C4].\u000a      The report was launched at a press conference in Montevideo that attracted\u000a      widespread public\u000a      attention. This led Amnesty International to meet with the President of\u000a      the Supreme Court, with the\u000a      association of prosecutors, and with victims` lawyers, to lobby for\u000a      change. Bowing to public\u000a      pressure, the government passed a law in October 2011 that overrode the\u000a      statute of limitations,\u000a      and redefined these crimes as crimes against humanity. According to a\u000a      Member of Parliament in\u000a      Uruguay, Lessa and the team`s research `had an important impact on\u000a      discussions on how to come\u000a      to terms with the past ..., by offering her expertise on the topic and\u000a      directly contributing to debates'\u000a      [C5].\u000a    Payne`s research [R6] also informs international efforts to\u000a      foster peace. The Royal United Services\u000a      Institute invited her to discuss her research at a workshop for\u000a      policy-makers in Whitehall (`Ending\u000a      Colombia`s Internal Conflict', January 2013). She was also included in the\u000a      International Expert\u000a      Forum (IEF) on Peacebuilding and Post-Conflict Recovery on 23 May 2013 to\u000a      discuss her findings\u000a      [R4]. The IEF is a collaborative initiative of the Folke Bernadotte\u000a      Academy (FBA), the International\u000a      Peace Institute (IPI), the SecDev Group, and the Center for International\u000a      Peace Operations (ZIF),\u000a      and brought UN and NGO practitioners together with 60-70 scholars to\u000a      discuss peacebuilding. One\u000a      of the comments after Payne`s talk emphasized how her research [R1-R6]\u000a      had overcome the\u000a      simplistic arguments `between those who advocate the use of war crimes\u000a      tribunals to punish evil to\u000a      deter such acts in the future versus those who argue for amnesty in order\u000a      to persuade all sides to\u000a      end the war in a negotiated settlement.' This participant went on to say\u000a      that the value of Payne`s\u000a      research is that it provides `real data on the consequences...of\u000a      tribunals, truth commissions, and\u000a      amnesties rather than anecdotes about particular cases.' [C6] The\u000a      chief organizer of the IEF\u000a      added that Payne`s presentation offered \"policy-makers and\u000a      practitioners...the \"big picture\" instead\u000a      of case specific and selective anecdotes (which they usually come\u000a      across).`\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    New democracies face the critical challenge of dealing with past abuses\u000a      of human rights. Professor\u000a      Leigh Payne`s empirical research on transitional justice concludes that\u000a      while no single mechanism\u000a      successfully achieves the strengthening of democracy, human rights, and\u000a      peace, combinations of\u000a      prosecutions and amnesties (with or without `truth commissions') increase\u000a      the likelihood of\u000a      improved democracy and human rights measures. These findings have not only\u000a      shaped the debate\u000a      over transitional justice; they have played a key role in constructing and\u000a      endorsing the policy\u000a      decisions made by a range of political actors: victims` groups, NGOs,\u000a      INGOs, policymakers,\u000a      politicians, judges, and prosecutors.

However, there\u000a      is complex discussion among scholars, policymakers, and practitioners\u000a      regarding the relative\u000a      effectiveness of transitional justice mechanisms. Payne`s research tackles\u000a      the much-debated\u000a      questions of whether fledgling democracies should take perpetrators of\u000a      past atrocities to trial to\u000a      strengthen democracy and rule of law, whether they should grant amnesties\u000a      to preserve political\u000a      stability, or whether they should advance stability and restorative\u000a      justice through truth\u000a      commissions. In 2005, Payne created with her doctoral students at the\u000a      University of Wisconsin\u000a      (Tricia D. Olsen, now Assistant Professor of Business and Legal Ethics,\u000a      University of Denver`s\u000a      Daniels College of Business, and Andrew G. Reiter, now Assistant Professor\u000a      of Politics at Mount\u000a      Holyoke College) the first-ever Transitional Justice Database, covering\u000a      five mechanisms of\u000a      transitional justice&#8212;criminal trials, truth commissions, amnesties,\u000a      reparations, and lustration&#8212;for\u000a      all countries in the world from 1970 to 2007 [www.tjdbproject.com]. The\u000a      project then developed\u000a      through two further phases after Payne assumed her post at the University\u000a      of Oxford as Professor\u000a      of Sociology and Latin America in January 2009.\u000a    Phase I: Transitional Justice in Balance\u000a    Beginning in January 2009, Payne`s team analysed the existing\u000a      Transitional Justice Database,\u000a      developing broadly comparative, cross-regional, generalizable, and\u000a      empirically grounded claims\u000a      about the impact of transitional justice [Section 3: R1], and\u000a      developing policy implications for Latin\u000a      American transitional countries [R2, R3, R5 (Spanish\/Portuguese)]\u000a      and countries emerging from\u000a      civil war [R6]. The multivariate analysis showed that the use of\u000a      some kind of transitional justice\u000a      mechanism was more likely, than no action being taken regarding past\u000a      atrocities, and that this\u000a      would strengthen democracy and human rights. But Payne`s team found that\u000a      no single mechanism\u000a      by itself produced these positive results, and that truth commissions,\u000a      used in isolation, were likely\u000a      to produce negative results for human rights goals. However, certain\u000a      combinations of mechanisms\u000a      increased the likelihood of positive outcomes for democracy and human\u000a      rights. These\u000a      combinations of mechanisms included (1) trials and amnesties; and (2)\u000a      trials, amnesties, and truth\u000a      commissions. The project`s multivariate analysis further revealed the\u000a      specific set of factors (i.e. the\u000a      country`s GDP per capita, the timing of its transition to democracy, the\u000a      degree of repression before\u000a      the transition, and additional regional characteristics) likely to\u000a      influence the adoption of the\u000a      transitional justice mechanisms that lead to positive outcomes for\u000a      democracy and human rights.\u000a    Phase II: Overcoming Impunity\u000a    In October 2009, from a preliminary reconsideration of the team`s\u000a      findings, Payne developed a\u000a      second larger research project to consider what types of trials, truth\u000a      commissions, amnesty laws,\u000a      and country contexts explained the positive and negative outcomes from the\u000a      previous study. The\u000a      research team was expanded to include a post-doctoral researcher at the\u000a      University of Oxford, Dr\u000a      Francesca Lessa and a DPhil researcher, Gabriel Pereira.\u000a    The new project updated the transitional justice data, adding entries for\u000a      2007-10. This version of\u000a      the database included 95 transitional countries, and the transitional\u000a      justice mechanisms included:\u000a      481 domestic prosecutions in 59 countries with 57% having guilty verdicts;\u000a      70 truth commissions in\u000a      35 countries; and 192 amnesties in 55 countries. Payne`s team employed new\u000a      statistical models to\u000a      analyse these data. A study was undertaken of every amnesty law in the\u000a      database, examining type\u000a      (partial or blanket) and relevant domestic and international challenges,\u000a      to explore when and how\u000a      they could be successfully combined with trials to produce positive\u000a      outcomes. The project further\u000a      investigated each truth commission (i.e. its composition, mandate,\u000a      recommendations,\u000a      implementation) and trial (i.e. rank of those tried, level of court,\u000a      verdict, reversal), for human rights\u000a      abuses [R4]. Payne`s team found that increasingly, countries have\u000a      adopted more partial amnesty\u000a      laws that allow for trials, but that some blanket amnesty laws continue to\u000a      persist and block\u000a      prosecutions. However, even where amnesty laws persist, governments have\u000a      found ways to\u000a      circumvent them, through a combination of civil society mobilization,\u000a      judicial leadership, and\u000a      international pressure. Where strong and powerful supporters of amnesty\u000a      remain in place, even\u000a      efforts by those three political actors are likely to be blocked [R7].\u000a      The researchers further found\u000a      that amnesty laws are not the only impediment to accountability. In\u000a      several cases, a de facto\u000a      amnesty prevails blocking all efforts to prosecute past human rights\u000a      violations.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"17496","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Callender's research informed the policy debate about financial support\u000a      for part-time undergraduates. It fed into the policy-making process in two\u000a      stages. In stage 1, she used it (refs. 1, 4) to raise awareness and\u000a      understanding about the case for reform, directly influencing the policy\u000a      agendas of government, think-tanks, HE stakeholders, HEIs and others, who\u000a      then endorsed and promoted changes to the financing of part-time study.\u000a      She modelled and disseminated policy options to policymakers, think-tanks,\u000a      and stakeholders. In stage 2, once the government announced the\u000a      introduction of part-time student loans in 2010, Callender utilized her\u000a      research (refs. 2, 5) to recommend changes, leading directly to improved\u000a      provision. Policymakers, HE stakeholders, HEIs and part-time students in\u000a      England have benefitted from this, with an estimated one-third of\u000a      part-time undergraduates (N=175,000), studying at about 120 English HEIs,\u000a      receiving the new loans, double the proportion awarded fee grants prior to\u000a      the reforms.\u000a    Stage 1: Putting part-time student funding issues on the policy agenda\u000a        and informing the case for reform\u000a    Professor Christine King (VC, Staffordshire University) consulted\u000a      Callender extensively and cited her research as part of John Denham's\u000a      (Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills, Department\u000a      for Innovation, Universities and Skills, DIUS) review of the future of HE\u000a      (9\/08). David Lammy (Minister of State for HE and Intellectual Property)\u000a      invited Callender to meet to discuss flexibility in HE delivery and\u000a      improving the student experience (27\/2\/09). Between autumn 2008 and the\u000a      2010 general election, Callender had six private meetings with David\u000a      Willetts (Shadow Minister for HE) and his Special Adviser about part-time\u000a      student funding, and she modelled policy options for them. The Special\u000a      Adviser confirms `that the impact of her work was influential on the\u000a        Conservative Party... the resources of any opposition\u000a        party...that can be devoted to policymaking are necessarily relatively\u000a        small and, without the civil service to call upon, accessible academic\u000a        work can take on an additional importance' (source 1).\u000a      Callender advocated student funding changes and outlined policy choices in\u000a      a book for think-tank, IPPR (source 6), and in a pamphlet for\u000a      think-tank Policy Exchange (source 7). Willetts used this in a\u000a      speech at the CBI's HE Summit (20\/10\/09) to argue for the inclusion of\u000a      part-time students in the Browne Review: `I have been struck by the\u000a        inability of part-time students to access fair funding for teaching and\u000a        maintenance. A recent Policy Exchange report by Professor Claire\u000a        Callender of Birkbeck rightly described this as \"One of the greatest and\u000a        most glossed-over injustices in the English higher education system.\"\u000a        And that's why we think part-time support should be considered in the\u000a        student finance review' (source 8).\u000a    There were concerns that the Independent Review of Higher Education\u000a      Funding and Student Finance, chaired by Lord Browne &#8212; set up in November\u000a      2009 to review fees policy and financial support &#8212; would focus exclusively\u000a      on full-time students. Drawing on her research (refs.1, 4), Callender\u000a      responded personally to the Review's `call for evidence'\u000a      (7\/12\/09-31\/1\/10), and co-authored the Birkbeck-Open University joint\u000a      submission to the Review (source 9). She was invited to brief\u000a      Universities UK, the 1994 Mission group, Million +, the National Union of\u000a      Students and Universities and Colleges Union. She demonstrated the\u000a      limitations of the current financial arrangements, highlighting the need\u000a      for reform, and advised on policy options. This had a direct impact on\u000a      these organisations' submissions to the Browne Review, all of which\u000a      expressed support for changes to part-time student funding (e.g. sources\u000a        2 and 3). Her research (refs. 1, 6) was the focus of a Times Higher\u000a      Education feature on part-time student funding, and she was frequently\u000a      cited in the national press (source 8).\u000a    The Deputy Director, Higher Education Analysis, at the Department for\u000a      Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) testifies that Callender's `evidence\u000a        contributed strongly to the case for reform of funding for part-time\u000a        students' (source 4). Her expertise was sought by other UK\u000a      policymakers, including DIUS\/BIS; HEFCE, the Treasury, and the CBI, as\u000a      well as by international policy advisers from the OECD, Japan and the\u000a      Netherlands. She gave keynotes at numerous stakeholder conferences\u000a      including: the Association for University Administrators; British\u000a      Universities Finance Directors Group; Consumer Financial Education Body;\u000a      Guardian Summit on HE; National Association of Student Money Advisers;\u000a      National Institute of Adult Continuing Education; NUS; Parliamentary\u000a      Universities Group; Student Loans Company; and Universities Association\u000a      for Lifelong Learning.\u000a    Browne's overview of the first `call for evidence' echoed Callender's\u000a      arguments in confirming the Review's intention to recommend funding\u000a      changes, which had been the focus of her awareness raising activities, and\u000a      is testament to her research's impact.\u000a    Stage 2: Influencing and modifying the new funding arrangements and\u000a        loans for part-time undergraduates\u000a    Following the Browne Review's `call for proposals' for future funding\u000a      (15\/3\/10-14\/5\/10), Callender co-authored the Birkbeck-Open University\u000a      joint submission calling for grants and loans for part-time students, and\u000a      she submitted, in confidence, alternative costed policy options (source\u000a        9). She was one of the few academics (as against HE stakeholders) to\u000a      give evidence at the Review's public hearings and had private meetings\u000a      with its secretariat. A Review member says she was `a phenomenal\u000a        source of data, expertise and insight...Her evidence has shifted our\u000a        higher education system in the direction of flexibility, access and\u000a        choice for all' (source 5).\u000a    She was invited to advise the new Coalition government's HE Strategy\u000a      Group (Vince Cable, Secretary of State for BIS; David Willetts, Minister\u000a      for Universities and Science; and Departmental officials). Willett's\u000a      Special Parliamentary Adviser verifies that Callender's research `was\u000a        influential throughout the Coalition's recent higher education\u000a        policy-making ... [A]mong those who do focus on higher education there\u000a        are a tiny handful whose work is fit for direct application to the\u000a        policymaking process. Professor Callender is at the forefront of this\u000a        small group and the only one I am aware of who focuses above all on the\u000a        under-researched area of part-time study. She has displayed a good\u000a        understanding of the policymaking process without ever veering from\u000a        academic excellence in the way that pure policymakers are often forced\u000a        to' (sources 1, 10).\u000a    When, in November 2010, the government announced its student funding\u000a      reforms including, for the first time, loans for part-time students to\u000a      cover increased tuition fees, Callender discussed with Willetts' Special\u000a      Parliamentary Adviser the limitations of these loans and proposed changes\u000a      to extend their eligibility criteria, including reducing students'\u000a      intensity of study from 33% of the full-time equivalent to 25%. This\u000a      change was introduced on 8 December 2010. She recommended to him and\u000a      Baroness Britton (who was leading a Lords debate) that part-time students\u000a      should start to repay their loans 4&#189; years instead of 3&#189; years after\u000a      commencing a course, so that fewer would make repayments while still\u000a      studying. This change was introduced on 26 November 2011. The Special\u000a      Parliamentary Adviser confirms Callender's role in bringing about these\u000a      policy changes saying, `After the initial announcement of extending\u000a        loans to part-time students, the details of the loans were\u000a        altered....Professor Callender was also influential in this partial\u000a        u-turn by Government' (source 1).\u000a    The impact of Callender's research is further substantiated by HE\u000a      stakeholders, such as the Assistant Policy Director of NUS who asserts: `Professor\u000a        Callender's research made a significant and lasting impact on the\u000a        development of public policy in this area by raising awareness of the\u000a        limitations of the existing student support offer for part-time\u000a        students. ... I think I could count on the fingers of two hands the\u000a        people who genuinely \"make waves\" in the debate on part-time students...\u000a        and Professor Callender is one of them' (source 3). The\u000a      Director of Policy, Universities UK, discussing the reach of Callender's\u000a      research, states `she promotes it to a very wide audience, including\u000a        UUK officers, UUK members, staff in UUK institutions and government\u000a        officials' (source 2).\u000a    Callender's research continues to contribute significantly to discussions\u000a      of part-time student funding (source 10). Since HEFCE announced\u000a      (14\/3\/13) the fall in part-time enrolments following the 2012 reforms\u000a      (which Callender had predicted, source 8), she has met with:\u000a      Willetts and his Special Parliamentary Adviser (14\/3\/13; 17\/7\/13);\u000a      Universities UUK, HEFCE; OFFA; BIS officials; the Parliamentary\u000a      Universities Group and IPPR. At these meetings she proposed further\u000a      changes to the restrictive loan eligibility criteria, in particular,\u000a      extending the availability of loans to part-time students who already hold\u000a      a degree in a different discipline. Willetts has accepted this idea, but\u000a      he only announced the policy change after the REF impact deadline,\u000a      publically attributing it to Callender's influence at the launch of a UUK\u000a      report on part-time students (16\/10\/13) &#8212; a report which also draws\u000a      heavily on her research.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Claire Callender's timely research has informed the policy\u000a      debate about financial support for part-time undergraduates in England.\u000a      Her research significantly raised awareness and understanding within\u000a      government, and more widely, about the case for reform by highlighting the\u000a      deleterious effects of the pre-2012\/13 funding system on the supply of,\u000a      and demand for, part-time study.

She\u000a      started in 1997 with research on the `student experience' for Dearing's\u000a      National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education. In parallel, she\u000a      conducted studies of student finance, bringing together both topics in a\u000a      Universities UK study (2006) while at London South Bank University. Since\u000a      joining Birkbeck in 2008, Callender has developed these research areas\u000a      significantly through three studies that underpin the impact discussed\u000a      here. All were interdisciplinary collaborations with economists, David\u000a      Wilkinson and Geoff Mason (National Institute of Economic and Social\u000a      Research), with Callender as Principal Investigator:\u000a    \u000a      A unique longitudinal multi-method study (Futuretrack) that\u000a        involved a nationally representative sample of 3,704 part-time UK\u000a        undergraduates, half of whom were in their first year of study when\u000a        first surveyed in 2008 and half in their final year, and who were\u000a        re-surveyed two years later. Futuretrack followed these\u000a        students' career development, how they funded their studies, their\u000a        experience of study and its outcomes. Findings were disseminated widely\u000a        to stakeholders, including David Willetts, Minister for Universities and\u000a        Science, before their publication in three reports (refs. 1, 2, 3 &amp;\u000a        6).\u000a      Callender et al's (ref. 4) study exploring factors affecting\u000a        the supply and future growth of part-time undergraduate HE included a\u000a        statistical review of part-time students and provision, bringing\u000a        together various datasets, and 17 case studies of universities.\u000a      Callender and Wilkinson's (ref. 5) analysis of HESA's Longitudinal\u000a        Destination of Leavers from Higher Education compared the labour market\u000a        outcomes for graduates of part- and full-time study &#8212; the first time\u000a        such an analysis had been undertaken.\u000a    \u000a    This body of research demonstrates the nature and consequences of the\u000a      inadequacies of part-time undergraduate financial support and its adverse\u000a      effects on the supply of, and demand for, part-time study. It provided the\u000a      following evidence for reforming part-time undergraduate finances:\u000a    \u000a      Skill acquisition through part-time study enhances employability,\u000a        earnings, labour market progression and brings other economic and wider\u000a        social returns, contributing to the government's HE and skills agendas.\u000a        However, enrolments nationally have declined.\u000a      Key determinants of part-time provision and demand for it are funding\u000a        (including HEFCE's funding model), tuition fee levels, and student\u000a        financial support. Government policies favour full-time HE and\u000a        school-leavers at the expense of part-time study and mature students,\u000a        and are based on two flawed assumptions: a) employers pay their\u000a        employees' HE tuition fees; b) because most part-time students (81%) are\u000a        employed, HE is affordable.\u000a      Most part-time students pay their up-front tuition fees themselves.\u000a        Two in five received employer support but employers favoured those least\u000a        in need of funding. Only a minority qualified for the inadequate\u000a        government-funded fee grants (14%) and course grants (19%).\u000a      Government funding arrangements hampered access, deterred\u000a        participation, depressed the fee levels universities charged, and\u000a        inhibited innovation in courses combining work and study.\u000a      These perverse incentives encouraged students to study full-time\u000a        (where feasible) to access support, and institutions to focus on\u000a        full-time undergraduate programmes while reducing part-time provision,\u000a        limiting part-time opportunities and contributing to declining\u000a        enrolment.\u000a    \u000a    In sum, the research suggested that funding policies need to acknowledge\u000a      the distinctive characteristics of the part-time undergraduate population,\u000a      and the differing employment and wage effects of part- and full-time\u000a      study.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18597","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The phase 1 research established Roseneil's reputation as the leading\u000d\u000a      sociological expert on the\u000d\u000a      women's peace movement of the late Cold War era, and more widely on\u000d\u000a      feminist, lesbian and anti-nuclear\u000d\u000a      politics.

Roseneil collaborated with archaeologist Yvonne Marshall, artist\u000d\u000a      Lucy Orta, military heritage\u000d\u000a      specialist John Schofield (English Heritage) and curator Duncan Brown\u000d\u000a      (Southampton City\u000d\u000a      Museum) as The Common Ground Research Group, which came together\u000d\u000a      to investigate the\u000d\u000a      material practices and legacies of Greenham, and to feed into policy\u000d\u000a      debate about the\u000d\u000a      conservation of Cold War historical sites, arguing for the historical and\u000d\u000a      cultural importance of\u000d\u000a      Greenham as a gendered Cold War protest site, and intervening to \"queer\u000d\u000a      archaeology\".\u000d\u000a      Roseneil's research provided the knowledge base for the Group's\u000d\u000a      archaeological and artistic\u000d\u000a      investigations, which involved an intensive excavation and survey of the\u000d\u000a      Turquoise Gate camp site,\u000d\u000a      and topographical mapping and interpretation of the site, its visible\u000d\u000a      cultural features and artefacts,\u000d\u000a      using a range of archaeological, anthropological and GIS methodologies.\u000d\u000a      Roseneil was central to\u000d\u000a      the design and conduct of the investigations, and led the cultural\u000d\u000a      analysis of the recovered\u000d\u000a      artefacts and the legacy of the material culture of the Camp (ref.3).\u000d\u000a      During this phase, she also\u000d\u000a      wrote about the cultural legacies of the feminist peace politics of\u000d\u000a      Greenham (ref.4)\u000d\u000a    Phase 3 was research carried out as part of the EU FP6 FEMCIT\u000d\u000a      project, Remaking Citizenship in\u000d\u000a        Multicultural Europe: the impact of contemporary women's movements\u000d\u000a      (2007-2011), of which\u000d\u000a      Roseneil was Deputy Scientific Director. In this Roseneil broadened her\u000d\u000a      social movement research\u000d\u000a      to encompass the investigation of the impacts of women's movements and\u000d\u000a      LGBT movements\u000d\u000a      across Europe from 1968-2008. She led a four-country comparative study\u000d\u000a      (the UK, Norway,\u000d\u000a      Portugal and Bulgaria) that mapped the movements' claims and demands\u000d\u000a      around issues of\u000d\u000a      intimate citizenship, and then analysed their impacts on law, policy, and\u000d\u000a      everyday intimate life\u000d\u000a      experiences. The research found that the movements have had a radically\u000d\u000a      transformative effect on\u000d\u000a      lived experiences of intimate citizenship (ref. 5), and on the legal and\u000d\u000a      social organisation of\u000d\u000a      heteronormativity (ref. 6).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18598","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3595528","Name":"Guatemala"},{"GeoNamesId":"3658394","Name":"Ecuador"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"3923057","Name":"Bolivia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3595528","Name":"Guatemala"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Sullivan's research has effectively challenged the increasing consensus\u000d\u000a      that the `financialisation of nature' is a way of addressing environmental\u000d\u000a      problems, and has provided a widely used source of information and\u000d\u000a      argument for critics campaigning against this approach. Sullivan's\u000d\u000a      conference presentation at Lund University, Sweden in May 2010, published\u000d\u000a      on the conference website and subsequently as `Banking nature?'\u000d\u000a      (ref. 1), was quickly syndicated to environmental policy and advocacy\u000d\u000a      websites. On Sullivan's own website alone it has been viewed 1,195 times\u000d\u000a      since June 2010.\u000d\u000a    Since the Lund conference, Sullivan's research has steadily filtered\u000d\u000a      into, and informed discussions on, `the financialisation of nature' among\u000d\u000a      campaigners and policy advisers, as evidenced in links to the conference\u000d\u000a      paper from a number of policy and advocacy websites (source 1). The\u000d\u000a      paper became a focus for online discussion facilitated by the Capital\u000d\u000a      Institute on the theme `Can nature be monetized?'. Participants\u000d\u000a      included renowned policy advisors on market-based approaches to\u000d\u000a      environmental management, such as: the head of the EU\/UN programme on The\u000d\u000a      Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB), Pavan Sukhdev; ecological\u000d\u000a      economist, Robert Costanza; and the President and CEO of Ethical Markets\u000d\u000a      Media, economist Hazel Henderson (source 2). In addition, the\u000d\u000a      campaign website Just Conservation, which Sullivan helped set up,\u000d\u000a      is cited by policy and popular forums, including International Union for\u000d\u000a      Conservation of Nature, Samburuwatch, and Stop Thomson Safaris (source\u000d\u000a        3). The research-based site for students of environmentalism,\u000d\u000a      biodiversity and conservation, Studying Green, established by\u000d\u000a      Sullivan and colleagues in October 2011, has received 17,451 views, with\u000d\u000a      an essay by Sullivan, `Going Beyond `the Money Shot' receiving one\u000d\u000a      of the highest number of views (933) (source 4).\u000d\u000a    Sullivan's work is increasingly used as a source of material for critical\u000d\u000a      thinking about the `financialisation of nature' as a form of environmental\u000d\u000a      management. In March 2012, she was one of a small number of academics to\u000d\u000a      be invited to participate in a high-level policy Dialogue Seminar on\u000d\u000a      `Biodiversity and Finance' in Quito, Ecuador, run by the Secretariat for\u000d\u000a      the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and partners and involving\u000d\u000a      several hundred policy makers from around the world. Organised to inform\u000d\u000a      the international policy process for the CBD, the seminar brought together\u000d\u000a      a range of international participants including: government negotiators;\u000d\u000a      representatives of key financial organisations such as the World Bank; and\u000d\u000a      representatives of international advocacy organisations, including the\u000d\u000a      Third World Network (TWN). Sullivan's Banking Nature? article\u000d\u000a      (ref. 1) and other academic work, were amongst the texts selected by the\u000d\u000a      conference organisers to inform policy debate and awareness in this area (source\u000d\u000a        5).\u000d\u000a    The TWN then invited Sullivan to write a booklet, `Financialisation,\u000d\u000a        biodiversity conservation and equity' about financing mechanisms in\u000d\u000a      environmental policy (source 6). This has been available online\u000d\u000a      since June 2012 and downloaded 1,891 times (as of 31 July 2013), and the\u000d\u000a      TWN has also translated a summary of the booklet into Spanish to make it\u000d\u000a      available to South American audiences. Some 480 copies have been\u000d\u000a      distributed by the TWN at international environmental policy-making\u000d\u000a      meetings including:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      to stakeholders at major international environmental meetings leading\u000d\u000a        up to the Rio+20 Earth Summit in June 2012;\u000d\u000a      at working group meetings of the United Nations Framework\u000d\u000a          Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (e.g. the Bonn UNFCCC\u000d\u000a          Climate Change Conference, May 2012);\u000d\u000a      at UN CBD meetings (including at the 4th Ad Hoc Open-Ended\u000d\u000a          Working Group on Review of Implementation of the Convention (WGRI)\u000d\u000a        in Montreal, May 2012);\u000d\u000a      and at NGO strategy meetings on finance and development.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Subsequently, the booklet has been referred to in a United Nations CBD\u000d\u000a      Discussion Paper, Safeguards for Scaling-up Biodiversity Finance and\u000d\u000a        Possible Guiding Principles, for the 11th Conference of Parties to\u000d\u000a      the UN CBD in Hyderabad, October 2012. It is also listed as one of four\u000d\u000a      sources of `knowledge and reflections on the subject of the\u000d\u000a      financialization of nature' in a special issue (#181, August 2012) of the\u000d\u000a      World Rainforest Movement newsletter on the `financialisation of nature'\u000d\u000a      (reproduced at Climate Connections, the blog of the Global Ecology\u000d\u000a      Justice Project) (source 7).\u000d\u000a    Sullivan's contribution to the understanding of market-based approaches\u000d\u000a      to biodiversity conservation has also been recognised and reinforced by\u000d\u000a      the environmental think-tank, the Green House, which commissioned her to\u000d\u000a      write a policy report (co-authored with Dr Mike Hannis, editor of The\u000d\u000a        Land Magazine) on DEFRA's biodiversity offsetting policy: Offsetting\u000a        Nature? Habitat Banking and Biodiversity Offsets in the English Land Use\u000d\u000a        Planning System (Dorset: Green House 2012) (source 8). This\u000d\u000a      report has received many media citations, including as the first item of\u000d\u000a      the `Conservation News' section of British Wildlife Magazine\u000d\u000a      (24(1) 10\/2012) and in The ENDS Report (the online professional\u000d\u000a      journal for environmental policy and business, no 459, May 2013).\u000d\u000a      Consequently, Sullivan was interviewed as an expert informant in the\u000d\u000a      preparation of a UK Parliamentary Office for Science and Technology policy\u000d\u000a      briefing POSTnote on biodiversity offsetting and planning (October\u000d\u000a      2012) which references her work (source 9).\u000d\u000a    Recognition of Sullivan's expertise in relation to the development of new\u000d\u000a      markets in units of biodiversity conservation is evident in the interest\u000d\u000a      in her research among broadcast and press journalists, including in British\u000d\u000a        Wildlife Magazine, The Ends Report and Yale Environment\u000d\u000a        360.

This\u000d\u000a      invitation-only event was directed at policymakers and experts in\u000d\u000a      biodiversity and economic planning. As an indication of the standing of\u000d\u000a      this invitation, other panel members included Sir Robert Watson, Co-Chair\u000d\u000a      of the UK National Ecosystem Assessment, Pavan Sukhdev, leader of the UN\u000d\u000a      programme on The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity, and senior\u000d\u000a      officials from the World Bank, UNDP, OECD and the environmental ministries\u000d\u000a      of Bolivia and Guatemala. Since then, and following publication of a blog\u000d\u000a      piece for the academic Public Political Ecology Lab (March 2013),\u000d\u000a      the continuation of Sullivan's research impact is demonstrated by an\u000d\u000a      invitation to write for the public blog of the international policy\u000d\u000a      network, the Green Economy Coalition (with 36 tweets from this site since\u000d\u000a      publication in July 2013) (source 11).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Dr Sian Sullivan's research, which challenges neoliberal approaches to\u000d\u000a      biodiversity conservation policies, has been used by environmental\u000d\u000a      policy-makers and advocacy groups internationally to show that\u000d\u000a      contemporary trends in environmental policy development may intensify\u000d\u000a      socio-economic inequality and increase the loss of biological diversity\u000d\u000a      arising from economic development and commercial enterprises.

In the paper, she argued that constructions of nature as\u000d\u000a      `natural capital' and as the provider of `ecosystem services', which are\u000d\u000a      becoming part of biodiversity and conservation discourses, are enabling\u000d\u000a      commercial and financial companies to make problematic `green grabs' for\u000d\u000a      newly created `values' associated with non-human nature. As such,\u000d\u000a      market-based approaches to biodiversity conservation may be increasing\u000d\u000a      social and economic displacement and inequality, and may also contribute\u000d\u000a      to development-led biodiversity loss. Her analysis has drawn on approaches\u000d\u000a      in economic sociology that engage with the ways that new calculative\u000d\u000a      devices transform previously uncommodified elements of `nature' into new\u000d\u000a      tradable commodities such as `species credits', carbon credits and\u000d\u000a      `biodiversity offsets' (refs. 1, 2, 3 and 5).\u000d\u000a    Sullivan's research in this area began with her PhD at University College\u000d\u000a      London in 1993, and has continued at Birkbeck since 2007. It is rooted in\u000d\u000a      a longstanding critical interest in:\u000d\u000a    1) neoliberal approaches to environmental conservation, which tend to\u000d\u000a      focus on privatisation strategies, forms of de- and re-regulation, and the\u000d\u000a      creation of new tradable `commodities';\u000d\u000a    2) the ways that local communities in the developing world, and civil\u000d\u000a      society organisations generally, respond to and remake conservation\u000d\u000a      initiatives based on neoliberal priorities.\u000d\u000a    Through theoretical work, fieldwork, and discourse analysis of policy\u000d\u000a      texts produced by NGOs, governments, and business and financial\u000d\u000a      organisations, she has exposed how discourses in biodiversity conservation\u000d\u000a      management are increasingly dominated by financial terms, categories and\u000d\u000a      assumptions. She has pointed to the potential of these changes to\u000d\u000a      intensify inequities through turning the natural environment into new\u000d\u000a      forms of alienable property that may be taken over by elites. In\u000d\u000a      particular, she has shown that the dominance of market economics in\u000d\u000a      frameworks for determining value has resulted in the subjugation of other,\u000d\u000a      non-economic, ways of defining value, particularly those associated with\u000d\u000a      indigenous peoples and specific place-based use and value practices.\u000d\u000a    Sullivan has established research networks aimed at enhancing\u000d\u000a      understandings of the socio- economic displacements that are occurring\u000d\u000a      through these conservation strategies. Through a workshop in May 2008,\u000d\u000a      funded by the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research\u000d\u000a      and on which she was a Co-Investigator, she set up a network of\u000d\u000a      researchers, practitioners and activists concerned with the environmental\u000d\u000a      justice implications of biodiversity conservation policy and practice (see\u000d\u000a      source 3). With colleagues in an AHRC-funded international research\u000d\u000a      network on Spectacular Environmentalisms (2010-11), she developed\u000d\u000a      a website to enhance public engagement with media representations of\u000d\u000a      wildlife and `nature' (source 4). She has been part of an international\u000d\u000a      group of scholars pioneering the analysis of `neoliberal conservation' -\u000d\u000a      the conservation of nature conducted through the expansion of capitalist\u000d\u000a      market forms of value &#8212; a distinct form of what has become known in\u000d\u000a      sociology, geography, political science and environmental anthropology as\u000d\u000a      the `neoliberalisation of nature' (ref. 4).\u000d\u000a    Sullivan's expanding base of critical research on neoliberal conservation\u000d\u000a      policy and its impact on local communities has, since her conference paper\u000d\u000a      in 2010, become an important and authoritative resource for environmental\u000d\u000a      activists and policy advisers.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18599","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research has raised awareness about, and sensitized policymakers,\u000a      journalists, researchers, activists and civil society organisations to,\u000a      the circumstances of the older urban poor, leading to changes in state\u000a      policy on pensions in Tamil Nadu, and to more effective campaigns for\u000a      older people's pensions, livelihoods and rights within India and\u000a      internationally. By demonstrating how social discrimination impinges on\u000a      older people's livelihoods, rights and well-being the research highlighted\u000a      the need for a major shift in programmes addressing old age poverty.\u000a      Specifically, as a consequence of the widespread dissemination of the\u000a      findings of the research: 1) pensions in Tamil Nadu were increased by 25\u000a      per cent in 2010 and 100 per cent in 2011; 2) a new campaign network, the\u000a      Pension Parishad (PP), was set up and pensions rights became a key issue\u000a      in Indian national politics in 2012; 3) HelpAge International developed a\u000a      new livelihood security agenda between 2010 and 2012.\u000a    From the beginning, the research was embedded in partnerships with\u000a      research users, including HelpAge International (HAI) and HelpAge India\u000a      and, from 2010, with the Right to Food and Work Campaign (RTF), an\u000a      influential national coalition of food security activists and campaign\u000a      groups. HAI, HelpAge India and PP provided additional funding in cash and\u000a      kind for the research projects. Vera-Sanso, together with the project\u000a      partners, disseminated evidence as it emerged to policymakers and in\u000a      public forums, which steadily expanded interest in, and recognition of,\u000a      the issues highlighted. The research challenged common assumptions and\u000a      proposed alternative approaches to policy development which stimulated\u000a      debate among opinion-formers, activists and journalists, catalysing new\u000a      policy initiatives.\u000a    During the project Vera-Sanso, the research team and project partners\u000a      organised a series of events and participated in public hearings, policy\u000a      briefings, campaign conferences and rallies in India. These included a\u000a      two-day international conference in Chennai in 2010, a photographic\u000a      exhibition\/ essay, `We too contribute!', and a series of public\u000a      meetings in Chennai (November 2009 &#8212; March 2010) involving eminent public\u000a      figures (including the Member Secretary of the Chennai Metropolitan\u000a      Development Authority and the Supreme Court-appointed National\u000a      Commissioner on Food Security: sources 1, 2, 3). Vera-Sanso also\u000a      presented the research findings to conferences between 2010 and 2013\u000a      attended by NGOs, policy advisers and academics in Chennai, London,\u000a      Dublin, Paris, Barcelona, and Maastricht. The photographic\u000a      exhibition\/essay has toured widely in Tamil Nadu (2009-13), Delhi (March\u000a      2013) (sources 1, 2) and internationally (London, 2010, and Dublin,\u000a      2012).\u000a    At the project's international conference in Chennai, The Hidden\u000a        Contribution of Older People: Rethinking Age, Poverty, Opportunity and\u000a        Livelihoods (19-20 March 2010), the research findings and the\u000a      photographic exhibition were presented to academics, campaigners and\u000a      policymakers (sources 1, 2, 3). The research team were subsequently\u000a      invited to the Fourth National Convention of the Right to Food and Work\u000a      Campaign (Rourkela, Orissa, India 6-8\/08\/2010) where &#8212; after hearing the\u000a      research findings &#8212; 2,000 representatives from across India passed a\u000a      unanimous resolution demanding a universal, index-linked, up-lifted social\u000a      pension (sources 2, 6). The team drafted two policy notes &#8212; one\u000a      presented to the government of the State of Tamil Nadu and parties\u000a      contesting the 2011 state elections (2010) and one for the National\u000a      Advisory Committee, Government of India, Prime Minister's Office (2011) (sources\u000a        1, 7).\u000a    All project events were widely reported in the Tamil and English language\u000a      press, on television news and in digital media, and the team was highly\u000a      effective in getting newspapers such as The Hindu and the New\u000a        Indian Express to publish stories that presented older people as\u000a      workers, contributors and rights holders (source 8).\u000a    By raising awareness among the public and policy makers the research led\u000a      to a significant shift in thinking about older people in Tamil Nadu and,\u000a      more broadly, in India. As an ESRC research user evaluator wrote: `This\u000a        study has had impact at a number of levels. In Chennai and Tamil Nadu it\u000a        has directly contributed to both enhanced understanding of and action to\u000a        support economic security for older people. The study and related\u000a        dissemination have played a key role in the campaign for a universal\u000a        basic pension in Tamil Nadu state' (source 4). This was also\u000a      evidenced when the India-wide campaign network Pension Parishad (PP) was\u000a      established in August 2011 by members of the Steering Group of the RTF\u000a      2010 Convention (mentioned above), including the influential social\u000a      activists Aruna Roy and Kavita Srivastava, HelpAge India and others, to\u000a      campaign for a universal, index-linked, uplifted social pension (source\u000a        1, 2).\u000a    The research led to a number of policy changes. During the 2011 election\u000a      in Tamil Nadu, an enhanced pension became a key electoral promise across\u000a      the main parties, and in April 2011 the Tamil Nadu government raised the\u000a      social pension (for people aged 65 and over, widows and disabled people)\u000a      from Rs500 per month to Rs1000 per month, benefiting over 2.3 million\u000a      pensioners (sources 1, 7). More widely, in India, for the first\u000a      time, the idea that older people have a right to a universal index-linked\u000a      non-contributory old age pension gained acceptance among influential\u000a      activists and MPs as a consequence of the PP's campaigning. The PP\u000a      continues to campaign for a significantly increased, universal pension\u000a      using the `We too contribute!' exhibition during its five day rally\u000a      in Delhi 4-8 March 2013 to raise awareness about the position of older\u000a      people in the Indian economy and society (source 2). In March 2013,\u000a      the PP won acceptance from Central Government of the principal of index\u000a      linked universal pensions and proposed a 50% increase in the pension to be\u000a      put in place in two years' time (sources 1, 2, 8); however this\u000a      falls below the PP's demands and their campaign continues.\u000a    That the research outcomes continue to capture attention and influence\u000a      thinking in India is evidenced by the agreement of The Hindu, one\u000a      of India's most widely read English language newspapers, to support The\u000a        Hindu National Photographic Competition on the Working Elderly,\u000a      launched in June 2013. By 31 July 2013, The Hindu had created an\u000a      online gallery of nearly 3,000 photographs taken across India, attracting\u000a      34,000 votes and judged by Aruna Roy of the Pension Parishad (source 9).\u000a    Finally, the research influenced international perspectives on ageing,\u000a      leading HelpAge International, the most significant international NGO\u000a      working on ageing and development, to undertake a major review of its\u000a      global work on livelihoods and to establish a new livelihood\/income\u000a      security agenda (source 3). The organisation invited her to join\u000a      its team to present her research to the Human Development Report Office of\u000a      the UNDP, New York (February 2011) and to discuss her work with UK\u000a      parliamentarians at an informal event on the Post-Millennium Development\u000a      Goals agenda hosted by their sister organisation Age International in\u000a      December 2012 (source 3). As an ESRC research user evaluation\u000a      states: `At a global level the study has provided important evidence in\u000a        dialogues with a number of UN entities. In particular I am aware of its\u000a        role in discussions with UNDP on their inclusion of an ageing theme in\u000a        future HDRs' (source 4).\u000a    To sum up, in the words of the Supreme Court-appointed Special\u000a      Commissioner on Food Security, Member of the National Advisory Council\u000a      (Government of India, Prime Minister's Office) (2010-12), and Member of\u000a      the National Social Assistance Committee on Pensions Task Force (2012-13),\u000a      the research of Vera-Sanso and colleagues sparked `a paradigm shift\u000a        regarding old age poverty' in India, igniting `an acknowledgement\u000a        of the economic contribution made by older people to the Indian economy\u000a        and an acceptance that enforced dependence on family, or on body and\u000a        soul destroying work, corrodes dignity and wellbeing' (source 1).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Dr Penny Vera-Sanso's two research projects, Ageing, Poverty and\u000a        Neoliberalism in Urban South India (2007-10) and Ageing and\u000a        Poverty: the working lives of older people in India (2012-13), have\u000a      had significant impacts on public debate and public policy in relation to\u000a      the rights and well-being of people aged 60 and over.

As Principal Investigator of an international interdisciplinary\u000a      project (2007-10), she conducted research in five low-income settlements\u000a      of Chennai, the capital of the State of Tamil Nadu, India. This project,\u000a      part of the UK New Dynamics of Ageing programme, was undertaken\u000a      with Dr V Suresh and others from the Centre for Law, Policy and Human\u000a      Rights Studies, Chennai, and with inputs from Professor Barbara\u000a      Harriss-White, Oxford University, and Dr Wendy Olsen, Manchester\u000a      University. Vera- Sanso then received ESRC Follow-on Funding (2012-13) to\u000a      extend the research and its impact using innovative engagement and\u000a      dissemination strategies.\u000a    The research demonstrated that two assumptions about old age and\u000a      intergenerational relations in India which inform policy and academic\u000a      analysis are ill-founded in relation to people living on low incomes:\u000a    Assumption 1: Older people are unproductive dependents and a looming\u000a        social and economic burden. Before the research began the economic\u000a      and social importance of older people's contribution to the Indian economy\u000a      was unrecognized. The research challenged this by tracing backward\u000a      and forward linkages of older people's paid and unpaid work in\u000a      production and reproduction across economic sectors (refs. 1, 4, 5, 6).\u000a      For example, as vendors distributing agricultural produce across the city\u000a      older people link back to the agricultural economy, which employs\u000a      50% of India's people, and forwards to India's IT sector and to\u000a      manufacturing for the national and global market. The research\u000a      demonstrated that dominant conceptualisations of `the economy', `working\u000a      generation' and `old age' divest older people of rights and hinder the\u000a      development of effective economic and social policies (refs. 1, 2, 4, 5).\u000a    Assumption 2: In India families look after their aged. The\u000a      research demonstrated that the `tradition' of family (economic) support\u000a      for elderly relatives is class dependent (primarily middle class). In a\u000a      context in which nearly 90% of workers are employed in the informal\u000a      economy, the growing demand for competitive advantage (through an\u000a      increasingly educated, low cost labour force) is widening the rights and\u000a      needs gap between generations. In poorer families, which require a high\u000a      worker-to-dependent ratio, a child's education increases the burden of\u000a      family poverty shouldered by elderly family members (refs. 1, 2, 3, 4).\u000a      Inscribing the middle-class norm of filial dependence into legislation and\u000a      policy actively threatens and undermines the livelihoods, income security\u000a      and rights of older people (refs. 1, 3). Most notable is the national old\u000a      age social pension (known as the IGNOAPS) which fails to meet needs due to\u000a      its low value (currently &#163;2 per month), its limited coverage and lack of\u000a      implementation (ref. 2).\u000a    Drawing on these insights the project provided arguments and evidence\u000a      for: a) replacing the social pension with a significantly raised\u000a      index-linked universal pension (ref. 1); and b) the need to recognise\u000a      older people as workers with rights, and to provide them with the means to\u000a      strengthen their position within the family and tailor their hours and\u000a      intensity of work to their capacities (refs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\u000a    From inception Vera-Sanso devised innovative interlinked research,\u000a      dissemination and engagement methods including: an international\u000a      conference in Chennai, involving researchers, academics and research\u000a      users; a photographic essay, `We too contribute!', presenting the\u000a      research findings to academics and non-academics (ref. 6); a project\u000a      briefing document (ref. 1) and Policy Notes (2010 and 2011). A central\u000a      feature of the second project was a national awareness-raising photo\u000a      competition, initiated in April 2013 and launched as The Hindu\u000a        National Photographic Competition on the Working Elderly in June\u000a      2013, which complemented a series of joint small research projects with\u000a      NGOs and the making of two documentaries.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"20461","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"},{"GeoNamesId":"732800","Name":"Bulgaria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Research undertaken at Roehampton on migration from South Asia and\u000a      Eastern and Central\u000a      Europe has had a significant impact on policy and practice. Given the\u000a      scale of new migration as a\u000a      result of EU enlargement since 2004, the research has been a timely\u000a      response to the needs of\u000a      policy makers. The reach and impact of the research can be demonstrated on\u000a      three interrelated\u000a      levels:\u000a    \u000a      The communication of research findings to wider public and\u000a        policy audiences, in particular,\u000a        through the media and intermediary organisations has shaped public\u000a        discourse. The research on\u000a        patterns of new migration to the UK was reported in The Guardian,\u000a        Economist, Daily Telegraph,\u000a        Reuters, Datum (Austrian daily) and widely in the Polish media,\u000a        and through work commissioned\u000a        for BBC Newsnight and the Institute for Public Policy Research. The\u000a        researchers have also worked\u000a        closely with the Polish Embassy to disseminate research findings from a\u000a        special issue of Przeglad\u000a          Polonijny &#8212; Studia Migracyjne to a policy-making audience in\u000a        London (November 2011).\u000a      \u000aConsultation between researchers and external users through\u000a        commissioned research and in\u000a        advisory capacities, leading to a range of policy changes. The research\u000a        team at Roehampton have\u000a        been commissioned to carry out research on the social and economic\u000a        impact of migration by\u000a        London boroughs of Redbridge, Hammersmith and Fulham, Lewisham,\u000a        Greenwich and Waltham\u000a        Forest, as well as for the Southland Methodist Trust. This body of work\u000a        has had an impact on\u000a        policy decisions on service provision by local government and other\u000a        statutory providers in the\u000a        health and education sectors; and on the work of advice and homeless\u000a        agencies (e.g. West\u000a        London Day Centre, Upper Room, Barka, Club 999 and HomelessLink); and\u000a        ethnic\/migrant\u000a        associations (e.g. Polish Psychologists Association, Jagonari,\u000a        Bangladeshi Workers Association,\u000a        Migrants Rights Network).\u000a      \u000aCollaboration to develop and enrich the impact of research\u000a        though longer-term partnerships,\u000a        has influenced practitioners. Working with university and NGO partners\u000a        in Vienna, Paris, Sophia\u000a        and Burgos with funding from the European Commission's Leonardo da Vinci\u000a        programme, the\u000a        research team at Roehampton has helped to develop a policy `toolkit'\u000a        (`Migrapass') to empower\u000a        disadvantaged migrants in labour markets across Europe groups, thereby\u000a        promoting social\u000a        inclusion.\u000a    \u000a    The impact of the research in greater detail:\u000a    \u000a      The research on the migration strategies and the use of public\u000a        services by new migrant groups\u000a        raised the awareness of new migrant social needs among local authorities\u000a        and other statutory\u000a        authorities. By providing up-to-date data on the use of public services\u000a        by new migrant groups,\u000a        the research team contributed to strategic and longer term planning by\u000a        local government in the\u000a        areas of schooling, health, employment services, housing and transport\u000a        in the years between\u000a        2005 and 2010 (Corroborator 1).\u000a      The research on patterns of social integration and exclusion led to\u000a        changing policy measures to\u000a        ensure that service providers adapted to a changing demographic\u000a        environment. For example,\u000a        the research assisted the London Borough of Redbridge in addressing the\u000a        needs of Romanian\u000a        Roma, whose social habits had led some to congregate in public spaces\u000a        resulting in\u000a        community tensions. The research stressed the need to provide space\u000a        where this group could\u000a        socialise, and the London Borough of Redbridge successfully lobbied\u000a        central government in\u000a        2009 for additional funds from the Home Office to run the Migration\u000a        Impact Fund to address the\u000a        needs of Romanian Roma (Corroborator 1). The study commissioned\u000a        by the London Borough\u000a        of Hammersmith and Fulham included an evaluation of the policy of\u000a        `reconnecting' homeless\u000a        Polish migrants run by Barka funded by Hammersmith and Fulham. This\u000a        research showed no\u000a        evidence that this policy created a local `magnet' effect. The research\u000a        team advised the council\u000a        that funding of Barka should continue since it significantly reduced the\u000a        number of rough\u000a        sleepers and thereby minimised the potential of health hazards, injuries\u000a        or deaths, especially\u000a        during winter. On the basis of this research, Hammersmith and Fulham\u000a        extended Barka's\u000a        contract to provide support to new migrant groups and to address health\u000a        and public safety\u000a        issues in the community. The research also allowed Barka to extend its\u000a        work with homeless\u000a        migrants across London and abroad (Testimonial 2).\u000a      The research on patterns of social integration and ethnic inter-group\u000a        relationships enhanced\u000a        the knowledge and understanding of local policy-makers and supported\u000a        changes to how local\u000a        government and other statutory authorities communicated with new migrant\u000a        communities.\u000a        Research commissioned by the London Borough of Lewisham provided\u000a        policy-makers with an\u000a        account of the negative effects of the undocumented status of some\u000a        migrants. This\u000a        strengthened Lewisham's support for the `Strangers into Citizens'\u000a        campaign (i.e. the\u000a        regularisation of undocumented migrants). The study for the London\u000a        Borough of Redbridge\u000a        was used to establish and implement the Redbridge Social Cohesion\u000a        Strategy, a strategy\u000a        essential for forward resource allocation (Reference: Ward).\u000a        Research for both Lewisham and\u000a        Redbridge councils identified ethnic tensions between groups of\u000a        migrants, and subsequently\u000a        informed the work of both local governments to promote inter-community\u000a        dialogue and\u000a        understanding through working with local migrant communities (Corroborator\u000a          1. Social\u000a          cohesion in Redbridge 2009; New communities in Lewisham 2009.)\u000a      Research on the anti-institutional attitudes and practices of homeless\u000a        migrants helped staff at\u000a        day centres to understand the value of the bonds among the homeless and\u000a        the intimidating\u000a        power of bureaucratic arrangements that fostered hostility from homeless\u000a        migrants\u000a        (Testimonial 2, Corroborator 5). This helped centre staff to\u000a        devise new ways of engaging\u000a        migrants to improve their situation and health demonstrating the\u000a        harm-reducing impact of the\u000a        research. Centre managers, as well as the umbrella organisation Homeless\u000a        Link, drew on\u000a        Roehampton's research to plan workloads in anticipation of the\u000a        increasing numbers of\u000a        homeless migrants (which did occur in line with the research findings).\u000a        Homeless migrants\u000a        were also helped to voice their concerns about service provision, which\u000a        strengthened the\u000a        knowledge of centre staff and built mutual understanding between staff\u000a        and service users\u000a        (Corroborator 5. LB Waltham Forest 2010; LB Waltham Forest 2011.)\u000a      The research on economic and social integration among South Asian and\u000a        Eastern European\u000a        migrants led to the development of concrete policy tools to ensure\u000a        better labour market\u000a        integration. The research on migrations from Poland and Bangladesh\u000a        resulted in the team\u000a        receiving funding from the Leonardo da Vinci Programme for the Migrapass\u000a        project. This\u000a        research was a partnership with Autremonde; The Vienna Institute for\u000a        Urban Sustainability\u000a        `Oikodrom'; the Institute of Research and Information on Volunteering\u000a        `Iriv'; the New Bulgarian\u000a        University; and the University of Burgos. This action research project\u000a        sought to empower\u000a        disadvantaged groups by giving them the skills to be more successful in\u000a        the labour market. The\u000a        tested tool &#8212; the Migrapass Portfolio &#8212; has been taken up by three\u000a        organisations; the Polish\u000a        Psychologists' Association; the Jagonari women's educational resource\u000a        centre; and the\u000a        Bangladeshi Worker's Association, and is now being used as part of their\u000a        standard services.\u000a        Through several workshops and sessions with disadvantaged migrants, the\u000a        project worked with\u000a        50 individuals of Polish and Bangladeshi origin. This has improved the\u000a        day-to-day practices of\u000a        NGOs in this field, in particular, in relation to outreach work with\u000a        hard to reach populations and\u000a        individual migrant communities (Testimonial 3 &amp; 4. `Migrapass'\u000a          2011-2013.)\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study focuses on the impact of ethnographic research on\u000a      migration to the UK from South\u000a      Asia and Eastern and Central Europe by a team of researchers in sociology\u000a      at Roehampton.

The research explores the\u000a      impact of migration\u000a      from both South Asia and Eastern and Central Europe on contemporary urban\u000a      life in Britain. The\u000a      research has been supported by, among others, the ESRC and the European\u000a      Commission (for\u000a      details of funding, see section 3).\u000a    The research has underpinned significant insights into the processes of\u000a      economic, cultural and\u000a      social adaptation of migrants to British society over two decades. The\u000a      research on migration to the\u000a      UK from Eastern and Central Europe focused on:\u000a    \u000a      Migration strategies and resulting patterns of social integration: the\u000a        research showed that a high\u000a        proportion of families remain in the UK but there is also a cluster of\u000a        male seasonal migrants with\u000a        different patterns of integration and social needs;\u000a      The use of public and other services by new migrants in education,\u000a        health, political\u000a        representation and religious space: the research showed a need for\u000a        better communication\u000a        strategies between local government and migrants or their\u000a        representatives;\u000a      The economic activity of new migrants: the research showed that\u000a        migrants' use of advice, job\u000a        search, integration modes and support relies almost exclusively on\u000a        informal networks of family,\u000a        friends and acquaintances rather than formal service support;\u000a      Migrants' attitudes towards racial and ethnic diversity in UK: the\u000a        research highlighted a potential\u000a        for racial tensions between migrants from Eastern Europe and more\u000a        established groups of Black\u000a        Britons;\u000a      The relationship between migration, homelessness and social exclusion:\u000a        the research showed\u000a        that the size of the migrant homeless population is likely to grow and\u000a        become more entrenched;\u000a        and that the anti-institutional practices of the homeless themselves\u000a        hamper successful\u000a        engagement with service users.\u000a    \u000a    Similar ethnographic theoretical and methodological approaches informed\u000a      research on\u000a      Bangladeshi Muslims, a more established minority, in the UK.

Gill provided advice and expertise on national policies on HBV, FM\u000d\u000a        and domestic violence to national policy-makers in government, the Crown\u000d\u000a        Prosecution Service and IPCC, contributing to enhanced service\u000d\u000a        provision.\u000d\u000a    Gill's research has been used in the development of national policy\u000d\u000a      relating to VAW, FM and HBV, including the Forced Marriage (Civil\u000d\u000a      Protection) Act (2007) and the National Police Honour-Based Strategy and\u000d\u000a      two-year action plan (2008-2010). On 26 May 2011, Gill was invited by the\u000d\u000a      steering committee of the Forced Marriage Unit to produce an independent\u000d\u000a      report on whether FM should be criminalised. Based in part on her\u000d\u000a      recommendations, the Forced Marriage Unit concluded that criminalisation\u000d\u000a      would be counterproductive: Gill's research demonstrates that the Crown\u000d\u000a      Prosecution Service can already prosecute cases of FM under existing\u000d\u000a      criminal offences, including rape, kidnap and assault. Instead, Gill\u000d\u000a      argues that there is a far more urgent need for better training for\u000d\u000a      professionals dealing with FM cases. She also recommended a comprehensive\u000d\u000a      awareness-raising campaign aimed at affected communities and the wider\u000d\u000a      population as a far more effective way to combat the problem. The Forced\u000d\u000a      Marriage Unit used these key findings on behalf of the UK Coalition\u000d\u000a      Government in their response to the Eighth Report of the Home Affairs\u000d\u000a      Committee (Session 2010, 12 HC 880) (Evidence 5a).\u000d\u000a    Gill's research has significantly contributed to the range of policies\u000d\u000a      aimed at prevention of HBV and FM. The broad range of beneficiaries\u000d\u000a      include the police, Crown Prosecution Service, local and national\u000d\u000a      government bodies, programmes working with victims of violence,\u000d\u000a      commissioners and funders of services, service referrers, children, and\u000d\u000a      victims. In February 2009, a public meeting was held between the\u000d\u000a      Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) and the Iranian and\u000d\u000a      Kurdish Women's Rights Organisation to discuss police failures to protect\u000d\u000a      a young Kurdish woman, Banaz Mahmod, who had been murdered in a so-called\u000d\u000a      `honour' killing in January 2006. In July 2009, the IPCC adopted a number\u000d\u000a      of the preventative strategies recommended in Gill's research publications\u000d\u000a      (see Reference 3). As a result, the IPCC designed new preventative\u000d\u000a      strategies to encourage informal, proactive community responses to HBV.\u000d\u000a      Gill's research also highlights the need for a better understanding of the\u000d\u000a      ways in which `honour'-based communities interface with public\u000d\u000a      institutions in order for support agencies to effectively confront\u000d\u000a      perpetrators and also support and protect victims. Gill also recommended\u000d\u000a      that expert panels be introduced to scrutinise IPCC inquiry reports in\u000d\u000a      cases of police failures to protect victims of domestic violence and\u000d\u000a      `honour' killings. The IPCC introduced such panels in 2009.\u000d\u000a    Gill's research on `honour' killings also led to positive collaborations\u000d\u000a      with a number of individual IPCC Commissioners in connection with the\u000d\u000a      policing failures that failed to prevent the murders of a number of women.\u000d\u000a      In October 2012, Gill drew on her research when delivering IPCC training\u000d\u000a      seminars for operational staff and investigators across England and Wales:\u000d\u000a      this fostered an ongoing exchange of knowledge on domestic violence, HBV\u000d\u000a      and FM as part of IPCC Continuous Professional Development days. In turn,\u000d\u000a      in May 2013 this led to an invitation to join the small reference group\u000d\u000a      assisting an IPCC Commissioner by providing recommendations regarding a\u000d\u000a      case of domestic violence homicide where the victim (Mrs Susan Forster\u000d\u000a      from Durham) was unwilling to press charges or co-operate with police\u000d\u000a      action. Tragically, 27 days after this, Susan was attacked again by her\u000d\u000a      husband and died. In this case Gill advised the IPCC against the use of\u000d\u000a      restorative justice intervention in domestic violence cases. In July 2013,\u000d\u000a      the IPCC recommended that Gill's position on restorative justice be\u000d\u000a      codified and included in the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO)\u000d\u000a      `Guidelines on the use of Community Resolutions incorporating Restorative\u000d\u000a      Justice'.\u000d\u000a    Gill's research also offers perspectives for understanding VAW and FM to\u000d\u000a      the police and the criminal justice system, aiding them in serving the\u000d\u000a      victims and to prosecute perpetrators more effectively. For example, in\u000d\u000a      October 2011, Gill was asked by the Crown Prosecution Service to provide\u000d\u000a      expert evidence about so-called `honour' killings and forced marriage in\u000d\u000a      the Shafilea Ahmed case (R v Ahmed and Ahmed 2012). This\u000d\u000a      contributed to the successful conviction of her parents for her murder in\u000d\u000a      August 2012.\u000d\u000a    Gill's research findings about the problems of criminalisation of forced\u000d\u000a      marriage were used by Helen Grant MP in the 8 March 2012 parliamentary\u000d\u000a      debate on violence against women and girls in the House of Commons\u000d\u000a      (Evidence 5b). Subsequently, Gill was asked to attend a meeting on 27th\u000d\u000a      June 2013 with the Shadow Minister for Equalities, Kate Green MP. She\u000d\u000a      discussed how the current legislation on FM is working and how the\u000d\u000a      Government might increase the effectiveness of existing civil responses,\u000d\u000a      before new forced marriage legislation is adopted in autumn 2013, that may\u000d\u000a      make it harder to protect victims and prosecute perpetrators.\u000d\u000a    2. Gill produced reports and other documents for NGOs, service\u000d\u000a        providers and policy makers, that have informed good practice guidelines\u000d\u000a        for supporting victims of HBV and FM.\u000d\u000a    The NHS, the Department for Education, and a range of third sector\u000d\u000a      organisations have used Gill's research to produce good practice\u000d\u000a      guidelines for supporting victims of HBV and FM. Professionals and\u000d\u000a      voluntary sector workers have drawn upon this research for improving their\u000d\u000a      engagement with perpetrators, victims and their families. For instance,\u000d\u000a      between November 2012 and July 2013 Gill was commissioned to develop a\u000d\u000a      safeguarding toolkit for Birmingham Women's Aid to help relevant\u000d\u000a      professionals both to identify FM and to better assess risk factors in\u000d\u000a      individual cases. The guide sets out the legal parameters of Forced\u000d\u000a      Marriage Protection Orders in simple terms to enable victims to make more\u000d\u000a      informed choices. Gill also delivered a number of training days about FM\u000d\u000a      to teachers, police officers, lawyers and social workers in Birmingham to\u000d\u000a      discuss the toolkit. In addition, she ran training events with staff from\u000d\u000a      Birmingham Women's Aid focused around sharing information about how best\u000d\u000a      to meet the diverse needs of victims: these sessions explored existing\u000d\u000a      legal provisions, measures, campaigns and initiatives from across the UK.\u000d\u000a    In May 2009, the United Nations Division for the Advancement of Women and\u000d\u000a      the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa invited her to\u000d\u000a      contribute to an Expert Group Meeting on developing legislation to address\u000d\u000a      harmful cultural practices, she offered recommendations and commentary on\u000d\u000a      examples of good practice in the UK and Europe regarding the design of\u000d\u000a      effective legislative frameworks for addressing VAW committed in the name\u000d\u000a      of `honour'. In December 2011, Gill was part of a delegation of\u000d\u000a      twenty-five international experts who met at the first international\u000d\u000a      `honour' killings conference in Canberra (Australia) to share and\u000d\u000a      disseminate expertise about FM and HBV.\u000d\u000a    3. Gill's research has contributed to public discourse, and has raised\u000d\u000a        awareness of VAW, HBV and FM amongst public audiences.\u000d\u000a    Gill has communicated her research to broad public audiences through both\u000d\u000a      traditional and social media outlets, contributing to and shaping public\u000d\u000a      discourse. She has appeared on Sky News, Al Jazeera and the BBC (including\u000d\u000a      Crimewatch, Radio 4 Today, Breakfast, World Tonight, World Service, BBC\u000d\u000a      Asian Network and the Politics Show) to present her work. This\u000d\u000a      contribution to public discourse has impacted on the approach of different\u000d\u000a      campaigns and individuals towards VAW and HBV. For example, the `Ending\u000d\u000a      Victimisation and Blame' campaign draws on Gill's media work. Gill has\u000d\u000a      also taken part in a special Australian radio debate about researching\u000d\u000a      `honour' killings (see `The Law Report': Evidence 5e), and in November\u000d\u000a      2012, contributed to a BBC Crimewatch documentary about the murder of\u000d\u000a      Shafilea Ahmed (Evidence 5f).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    This case study focuses on Aisha Gill's ground-breaking research on\u000d\u000a      violence against women (VAW) in the UK, Iraqi Kurdistan and India as part\u000d\u000a      of the Crucible Centre for Human Rights Research.

Using an\u000d\u000a      innovative intersectional approach, she has advanced current\u000d\u000a      understandings of these forms of VAW. Collectively, her body of work\u000d\u000a      offers a detailed critical understanding of the rationale behind various\u000d\u000a      national and international attempts to address HBV and FM while\u000d\u000a      simultaneously upholding constitutional commitments to multiculturalism.\u000d\u000a      Gill's rigorous scholarly research and practical insights, based on her\u000d\u000a      experience on the frontline of efforts to tackle VAW, offer a unique\u000d\u000a      perspective on tackling HBV and FM as forms of VAW. This action-oriented\u000d\u000a      combination of theoretical and practice-based research provides a solid\u000d\u000a      platform for developing proposals for how governments might respond more\u000d\u000a      effectively to VAW across Europe, Iraqi Kurdistan and the Indian\u000d\u000a      sub-continent in order to better support victims and prosecute\u000d\u000a      perpetrators.\u000d\u000a    For example, a major international study on `\"honour\" killings and\u000d\u000a      \"honour\" based violence research in the UK Kurdish community and Iraqi\u000d\u000a      Kurdistan', which drew on Gill's decade of expertise in the field, was\u000d\u000a      conducted between September 2008 and November 2010 by Professor Gill Hague\u000d\u000a      (PI), Dr Aisha Gill (JI), and Dr Nazand Begikhani (JI). The research\u000d\u000a      investigated:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      the nature and extent of HBV in Kurdish communities,\u000d\u000a      current HBV policy and practice,\u000d\u000a      how NGOs respond to HBV,\u000d\u000a      the experiences of victims and their families, and\u000d\u000a      media coverage of HBV.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    In both Iraqi Kurdistan and the UK, there was a clear need for the\u000d\u000a      government, the police and the criminal justice system to respond more\u000d\u000a      effectively to HBV. The study found that policy discussions often fail to\u000d\u000a      progress beyond abstract debates, ignoring core practical issues. For\u000d\u000a      instance, insufficient recognition has been devoted to the fact that\u000d\u000a      police protection is conditional: the nature and extent of the protection\u000d\u000a      offered to victims depends on individual police officers' perception of\u000d\u000a      the incident(s) reported. Similarly, a longstanding criticism raised by\u000d\u000a      prosecutors, women's groups and victims alike, concerns the fact that\u000d\u000a      officers routinely dismiss HBV as part of the culture of black and\u000d\u000a      minority ethnic communities, stereotyping both victims and abusers.\u000d\u000a      Consequently, some police officers do not take HBV seriously and so fail\u000d\u000a      to protect victims from further abuse.\u000d\u000a    Thus, one of the biggest areas of concern identified relates to\u000d\u000a      variations in how effectively HBV and other forms of VAW are dealt with\u000d\u000a      across &#8212; and even within &#8212; police forces. Inconsistencies between policy\u000d\u000a      and practice complicate the issue. Many of the participants in the study\u000d\u000a      linked these variations and inconsistencies to retrogressive\u000d\u000a      understandings of the role of cultural factors. This problem was\u000d\u000a      compounded by widespread `reverse racism' among the police and other\u000d\u000a      statutory agencies, leading to cultural rights being granted precedence\u000d\u000a      over women's rights. Awareness-raising activities (including Gill's\u000d\u000a      efforts, described in Evidence 5a) have helped to address these issues and\u000d\u000a      advance initiatives to support victims and prosecute perpetrators.\u000d\u000a    The study also found that HBV remains prevalent in Kurdish communities in\u000d\u000a      Britain and Iraqi Kurdistan. In both contexts individual cases exhibit\u000d\u000a      similar parameters, similar underlying causal factors (e.g. in terms of\u000d\u000a      patriarchal beliefs), and similar outcomes for victims, perpetrators and\u000d\u000a      their families. These findings indicate that best practice guidelines and\u000d\u000a      effective initiatives are broadly generalisable across diverse national\u000d\u000a      settings. The UK-based part of the study, conducted by Gill, resulted in\u000d\u000a      the creation of a number of best practice recommendations emphasising:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      the lack of efficient information systems and consequent failures to\u000d\u000a        record sufficient, accurate data on various types of VAW,\u000d\u000a      ineffective working relationships between the police and specialist\u000d\u000a        VAW and HBV organisations in black and minority ethnic communities,\u000d\u000a      inconsistencies in police officers' knowledge and understanding of HBV\u000d\u000a        and related issues, resulting in inconsistencies in police responses,\u000d\u000a        and\u000d\u000a      the lack of specialist services in the UK, including safe shelters.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21137","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Grattan's work is evidence of an on-going dynamic of research and its\u000a      impact. Grattan's earlier work led to collaborations with the University\u000a      of Ulster as well as with a leading policy, research and training\u000a      voluntary sector organisation, Youth Action Northern Ireland (YANI). These\u000a      collaborations opened up further research possibilities as well as\u000a      impacting on policy and practice.\u000a    YANI are in the forefront of working with young people in contested and\u000a      conflict communities as well as training future youth workers and\u000a      designing policies and processes to influence future work in such\u000a      situations. Close collaboration with both the University of Ulster and\u000a      YANI enabled the further development of ideas relating to this area of\u000a      work that would make a contribution to policy and practice. Through YANI,\u000a      Grattan's work reached a much wider circle of academics, policy makers and\u000a      professional practitioners working in the area of radicalisation,\u000a      alienation and conflict relating to young people. The Deputy Director of\u000a      YANI has argued in written testimony:\u000a    \"From 2003\/2004 Dr Alan Grattan (Senior Lecturer at University of\u000a        Ulster; later University of Southampton and later again University of\u000a        Winchester) has aided the practice and research base at Youth Action\u000a        Northern Ireland. The contribution Alan has made has been varied and\u000a        incorporated a range of thematic ideologies and interventions\".\u000a    Two direct results of this work and cooperation with the voluntary and\u000a      community sector were forthcoming. First, Grattan was invited to the\u000a      Ditchley Foundation, Oxford (February 2010) to address the issue of\u000a      `Countering Radicalisation in Local Communities'. As mentioned in the\u000a      Ditchley Conference website; \"the Ditchley Foundation was established\u000a        to advance international learning and to bring transatlantic and other\u000a        experts together to discuss international issues...Since then Ditchley\u000a        conferences have broadened to include the concerns and participation of\u000a        nations all over the globe.\"\u000a    Attendance at the Ditchley Conference is by invitation only and was\u000a      attended by senior national government and opposition politicians,\u000a      national and international representatives of police, security services\u000a      and intelligent agencies, national and international academics,\u000a      policy-makers and professional practitioners.\u000a    Following two days of discussion a final report was written by the\u000a      director of the Ditchley Foundation and delivered to government and the\u000a      participants. The report testified to the direct impact that discussion of\u000a      research into alienation had on practical and policy initiatives and is\u000a      provided in the evidence section below.\u000a    The second outcome (or `impact') from this body of work was an invitation\u000a      to work with YANI on the project `The Role of Youth Work in Supporting\u000a      Inter-culturalism' funded and promoted by the Northern Ireland Assembly\u000a      through the `Office of the First Minister and Deputy First Minister'\u000a      (OFMDFM) in November 2010.\u000a    Following the signing of the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and the\u000a      instigation of the Northern Ireland Peace Process, the province for the\u000a      first time had experienced a growth in a migrant work population and\u000a      families. This however brought increased tensions in relation to Hate\u000a      Crime, community relations, discrimination and violence against a growing\u000a      diverse population. Recognising the problems associated with a fast\u000a      changing Northern Ireland, YANI, supported by the OFMDFM, instigated a\u000a      research project aimed to inform government policy and thinking on working\u000a      with young people in their respective communities on the issue of\u000a      `inter-culturalism'. Based on the body of work previously mentioned\u000a      Grattan was invited by YANI to oversee and consult on this initiative;\u000a      this culminated in presenting the findings at a conference\/workshop and a\u000a      co- authored report aimed at professional practitioners, organisations and\u000a      policy-makers.\u000a    The impact of this report is the on-going `Intercultural youth work\u000a      initiative' which was part of the YANI Area Based Strategy which seeks to\u000a      engage young people to support their understanding of a shared future,\u000a      mutual understanding, and to explore their attitudes towards differences\u000a      and to work with the wider community and with other key (agency, statutory\u000a      or community\/voluntary) stakeholders to increase dialogue, action and\u000a      strategic plans.\u000a    Taken together this work (and previous work leading to publications and\u000a      conference presentations) demonstrates `impact' relating to young people,\u000a      radicalisation, alienation, conflict and identity. The national and\u000a      international publications, conference and workshop reports and\u000a      presentations combine academic and practitioner focused work thereby\u000a      reinforcing the essential relationship between academia and the wider\u000a      community.\u000a    Furthermore, aspects of these publications have led directly and\u000a      indirectly to working with influential government departments, individuals\u000a      and agencies, as well as statutory, voluntary and community organisations\u000a      charged with addressing difficult and complex issues within the community.\u000a      In this respect the listed work has made an on-going contribution in\u000a      attempting to address some of the current social issues and problems faced\u000a      by contemporary society.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Alan Grattan's research has had a number of impacts informing policy and\u000a      practice around the inter-connected theme of `young people,\u000a      radicalisation, and alienation'.

To cover both the domestic and the\u000a      international aspects of extreme radicalisation was an ambitious\u000a      undertaking for a two-day debate, but we managed to cover a great deal of\u000a      ground. We were helped by the broad variety of backgrounds and\u000a      professional experience at the table, although snow storms on the East\u000a      Coast deprived us of part of our US input. We had an extensive discussion\u000a      of the possible causes of the radicalisation of an individual or small\u000a      group to the point of violence, in which we had to recognise a wide\u000a      variety of rationales at the global, regional, local and individual\u000a      levels.\u000a    When we came to look at the catchment area for radicalisation, we were\u000a      reminded of a significant statistic that, almost without exception,\u000a      individuals or small groups prepared to go all the way to violence came\u000a      from the age group between 18 and 29. It seemed that this was the age\u000a      where deep discontent, a willingness to fight and a capacity to be\u000a      influenced came together in the strongest forms. Malign influences within\u000a      society and disaffection amongst young people manifested themselves in\u000a      different types of criminal or violent activity and could be harnessed in\u000a      support of a cause. This conference may have been ambitious in connecting\u000a      the micro and the macro within such a complex subject. It is a tribute to\u000a      the frankness and perceptiveness of our participants that so much momentum\u000a      was achieved in the discussion, with even the most experienced\u000a      practitioners recognising that there were things to be learnt. We owed a\u000a      great deal to our Chairman for the care and discipline with which she kept\u000a      the debate focussed.

Grattan has attempted to\u000a      identify the potential causes that lead young people to take more extreme\u000a      actions within their community and society as a response to feelings of\u000a      alienation, challenges to culture and identity, as well as a means of\u000a      attaining `standing' and status within community and amongst peers.\u000a    Grattan's research has been an inter-related combination of empirical\u000a      based research and theoretical construction. His theoretical work emanates\u000a      from previous experiences of working with and advising professional\u000a      practitioners who engage with disenfranchised and alienated young people\u000a      in the community.\u000a    The lines between research and impact are blurred in this case study, as\u000a      much of Grattan's work has been done in conjunction with and informed by\u000a      policy makers and professional practitioners. The three year project\u000a      `Youth Work in Contested Spaces', for example explored the experiences,\u000a      practices and issues of both young people and practitioners living and\u000a      working in (post) conflict environments. An article published in the International\u000a        Journal of Interdisciplinary Social Sciences, for example, explored\u000a      ways in which those who work with young people might be influential at\u000a      various levels of society in challenging conflict and advancing the\u000a      processes of peace-building.\u000a    Much of Grattan's research is therefore the result of collaborations\u000a      between universities and community NGO's working with young people in\u000a      national and international contexts. Research such as that published by\u000a      Youth Action Northern Ireland (YANI) is an example of the impact Grattan's\u000a      work has had on the understanding and knowledge base of those who engage\u000a      with young people in addressing issues of hate, alienation and\u000a      radicalisation at community level.\u000a    Grattan has also published further theoretical discussions about the\u000a      possible causes for the `alienation' and `radicalisation' of young people\u000a      in contemporary society and looked to highlight various aspects of\u000a      alienation with both socio-economic and religio-political explanations,\u000a      published in journals such as Youth and Policy.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21138","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The book resulting from this research, The Monogamy Gap is both\u000a      the evidence of the research underpinning this case study and the primary\u000a      vehicle for its impact.

However, it is clear from the tens of thousands\u000a      of comments on the hundred plus webpages in which The Monogamy Gap\u000a      is discussed that Anderson's research has impacted both the volume and the\u000a      nature of public conversation about monogamy and the nature of\u000a      relationships.\u000a    This public discourse suggests that norms, modes of thought or practice\u000a      concerning the supposed value of monogamy are being challenged by\u000a      Anderson's research. This is not to say that Anderson's research findings\u000a      have been universally welcomed. Quite the contrary, many of the reactions\u000a      amount to aggressive denunciations of Anderson and his work. His research,\u000a      conclusions, and personhood have been subjected to a great deal of\u000a      anonymous internet attacks. Such reactions both seem to demonstrate the\u000a      hegemonic position of what Anderson calls `monogamism' but also the degree\u000a      to which Anderson is challenging such norms.\u000a    Alternatively, many of the public reactions to Anderson's research\u000a      welcome his findings as both legitimating individuals' own\u000a      non-conventional relationships and as liberating the public realm in which\u000a      such relationships are discussed.\u000a    It is not possible to quantify the impact of this qualitative data.\u000a      Ultimately it is hoped that Anderson's research may go on to practically\u000a      impact on the levels of social inclusion around, for example, alternative\u000a      routes to romantic relationships; namely, those in open sexual\u000a      relationships. In using empirically driven data to highlight the\u000a      relationship benefit to pursuing extra-dyadic sex, this research has the\u000a      power to destigmatize sexual activity outside the primary relationship.\u000a    Those impacts are however much more long term. At this stage it is clear\u000a      that The Monogamy Gap has helped open up a public space, often in\u000a      new media, in which monogamy, cheating, and non- monogomous relationships\u000a      are discussed and debated in ways that do not conform to existing\u000a      orthodoxies.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Public and political discussion identifies monogamy as serving a litmus\u000a      test of relationships - where cheating is deemed a violation of\u000a      relationship expectations.

Data for this research\u000a      was collected between 2008 and 2011.\u000a    It principally utilizes 120 in-depth interviews of straight and gay males\u000a      from a cross-national sample of undergraduate men in multiple universities\u000a      to examine the influence of monogamy on their lives. The sample included\u000a      athletes and non-athletes, examining for the influence of masculine\u000a      capital on cheating rates as well. Data was analysed using\u000a      grounded-theory, and theorized with hegemony and cognitive dissonance\u000a      theory. Transcripts were coded and 10% co-verified with another\u000a      researcher. In addition to his empirical contribution, Professor Anderson\u000a      augments this book with literature from multiple other academic\u000a      disciplines: biology, endocrinology, psychology and evolutionary\u000a      psychology, using 800 different references to make this a compelling,\u000a      multi-disciplinary argument.\u000a    In this research Professor Anderson highlights that a resilient cultural\u000a      myth equates monogamy with a test of true love. Yet, despite this\u000a      strongly-held cultural ideal, cheating is rampant. Whereas most books seek\u000a      to cure men from their cheating malaise, The Monogamy Gap offers a\u000a      far more radical idea: that men cheat because they love. In this\u000a      ground-breaking research, instead of entering his research with a\u000a      condemnation of cheating, he examines the purpose of cheating. The\u000a        Monogamy Gap shows how, after the intense and passionate sex of the\u000a      early relationship fades, cheating functions to keep monogamous couples\u000a      together. Thus, Professor Anderson finds that men cheat not because they\u000a      fail to love their partners, but in order to satisfy their sexual desires\u000a      without desiring to disrupt their emotional relationship. Rather than\u000a      break up with their lovers so they can have meaningless erotic sex, men\u000a      cheat as a rational solution to the irrational expectations of monogamy.\u000a      However, these men still want the cultural capital given to monogamous\u000a      relationships, and they therefore find themselves living with competing\u000a      emotional and sexual desires: wanting monogamy, but also wanting\u000a      recreational sex.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21705","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1218197","Name":"Turkmenistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1282988","Name":"Nepal"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    1) Influencing Policy Development and Debate\u000a    The sexualities equalities project's findings advanced\u000a      understanding of organisational resistance to implementing policies\u000a      granting new citizenship rights to sexual and gender minorities, which has\u000a      fed into policy debate and implementation in the UK (IMP1) and in\u000a      EU member states (IMP2).

The\u000a      project has also influenced policies at regional and local levels. A key\u000a      finding was the importance of leadership to champion the equalities agenda\u000a      and bring others on board. This directly informed Newcastle Hospitals\u000a      Equality Delivery System which recommended that `people in senior\u000a        management positions... give a clear message about the importance of the\u000a        sexualities\/trans equalities agenda in relation to employment\u000a        opportunities and all areas of service provision' (IMP3).\u000a    The post-trafficking research findings and participatory\u000a      methodology brought trafficked women's perspectives into policy\u000a      development and debates.\u000a    i) In Kathmandu, in February 2011, an Activist Workshop set up and led by\u000a      the research team brought together NGOs, donors, trafficked women and\u000a      high-level government representatives (80+). Preliminary research findings\u000a      were used to review NGO programming and led directly to the following\u000a      policy debate and political lobbying.\u000a    \u000a      Shakti Samuha, supported by the research team, drafted demands on\u000a        citizenship rights\/livelihoods which were submitted to political parties\u000a        and elected government and Constituent Assembly (CA) core committees,\u000a        including the Fundamental Rights Committee (FRC). Six specific\u000a        recommendations that were raised from the Activist Workshop are listed\u000a        in this document regarding citizenship provision to women and children\u000a        in general, plus a number pertaining to trafficked women and children\u000a        whose mothers were sexually exploited abroad (IMP4).\u000a      This led to the FRC Chair soliciting case studies of post-trafficked\u000a        women and their children's exclusion from citizenship from Shakti\u000a        Samuha.\u000a      Case studies co-selected by Shakti Samuha and the research team were\u000a        then presented by the FRC to the CA recommending that `children\u000a          without having a father's known identity should be granted rights of\u000a          citizenship'. This demand was adopted in March 2012, and is\u000a        registered by the CA Secretariat to be ratified as part of the new\u000a        Constitution when the Secretariat and CA are re-elected (currently\u000a        scheduled for November 2013) (IMP5).\u000a    \u000a    ii) As a technical expert to the National Committee in Controlling Human\u000a      Trafficking, the research team directly influenced recommendations on\u000a      access to social rights of citizenship for women post-trafficking (e.g.\u000a      housing, healthcare, victim support fund, education, livelihoods), later\u000a      endorsed by Cabinet in the National Plan of Action in May 2012 (IMP6).\u000a    iii) The American Bar Association used research findings to formulate\u000a      policy on witness protection and support services moving to ensure a `more\u000a        nuanced and survivor-centric framework for assessing survivors needs and\u000a        how justice actors should address those' (IMP7), citing the\u000a      collaboration between Shakti Samuha and Newcastle University in the\u000a      post-trafficking study as an example of best practice in their Human\u000a      Trafficking Assessment Tool Report (2011: 80-81).\u000a    iv) DFID's Asia social development agenda was directly informed by the\u000a      research team's input into the development, monitoring and evaluation\u000a      (M&amp;E) of DFID's large anti-trafficking regional programme (&#163;9.75\u000a      million: 2011-18). DFID's Senior Social Development Advisor for Asia\u000a      states `[y]our research helped us understand the complexity of\u000a        trafficking and how it works and how it interacts and who to listen to',\u000a      and that the research team's input into the M&amp;E tender selection\u000a      process (Dec. 2011-Jan 2012) `gave professionalism, rigour and\u000a        expertise to our selection panel' (IMP8).\u000a    v) The research team influenced wider debates on post-trafficking through\u000a      extensive engagement with the Nepal media, including: over 11 TV and 25\u000a      radio interviews (some web-streamed internationally), 8 print media\u000a      articles (half in the major English daily, Kathmandu Post), and\u000a      conceptual input into the anti-trafficking documentary The Color of\u000a        Brave (made by Film Himalaya). Metrics on research project website\u000a      visits indicate impact on a large readership (51,932 visitors, January\u000a      2010-October 2013). Figures for the last year show 75% new visits, with\u000a      visitors from 10 countries (Google Analytics).\u000a    2) Capacity Building\u000a    The sexualities equalities research included Action Learning Sets\u000a      (ALS), groups which met four times, over six months in each of the four\u000a      case study areas of the UK. This had a direct influence on capacity\u000a      building networks for the 33 local government and voluntary\/community\u000a      workers who took part. In each ALS members shared examples of good\u000a      practice and identified action points which were then reviewed at\u000a      subsequent ALS meetings, where the next steps for implementing action were\u000a      decided. For example, identifying LGBT equalities training available in\u000a      Northern Ireland (NI) was a key action point for the NI ALS. The next step\u000a      was to design and plan training, which resulted in a joint capacity\u000a      building event with the NI Equalities Commission in April 2010. In some\u000a      cases the ALS continued after the project ended; for example the Southern\u000a      England ALS organised a training workshop with a regional Equalities\u000a      Network. The underpinning research has also informed practice guidelines\u000a      in Local Authorities, housing associations, the voluntary and community\u000a      sector, and healthcare. For example, the Social Care Institute for\u000a      Excellence At a Glance Report cited the research findings in its\u000a      recommendations for the development of training programmes (IMP9).\u000a    The post-trafficking research generated impact through capacity\u000a      building to enhance survivors' input into lobbying for citizenship rights.\u000a      At the local level in Nepal, drawing on the research team's expertise, a\u000a      modular training programme in action-research methodologies was put\u000a      together. This was delivered to the Shakti Samuha leadership, which\u000a      consisted of 12 post-trafficked women, between 2010 and 2012. The\u000a      importance of this training was emphasised in their presentation `Trafficking\u000a        Survivors to Social Researchers: Reflections on a Journey' to the\u000a      `Making Livelihoods: Sexuality, Citizenship and Stigma' Conference\u000a      (Kathmandu, November 2011; co-hosted by IOM, Newcastle University and\u000a      Shakti Samuha; the conference attracted 100+ participants including CA\u000a      members and senior policy-makers): `Research conducted by survivors\u000a        themselves would be more effective and would help to identify the real\u000a        status of trafficking survivors, identify their needs and make\u000a        recommendations to stakeholders in order to fulfil their actual needs'\u000a      (IMP10).

Specifically, it establishes how citizenship is connected to\u000a      sexuality, as well as to gender, race and class (1, 2). This\u000a      theoretical work underpinned two major ESRC funded empirical studies, in\u000a      different global contexts, concerned with the rights demands of different\u000a      minority groups. This research has significantly advanced understandings\u000a      of how stigma associated with being outwith sexual\/gender norms can make\u000a      accessing rights of citizenship difficult or even impossible in some\u000a      circumstances (3).\u000a    The first project (2007-2010) examined the implementation of sexual and\u000a      gender minorities' equalities initiatives in local government in England,\u000a      Wales and Northern Ireland (NI) (http:\/\/research.ncl.ac.uk\/selg),\u000a      carried out with Dr. Monro at Huddersfield University. It highlighted the\u000a      importance of implementation mechanisms in driving forward the equalities\u000a      agenda for sexual and gender minorities, and identified barriers and\u000a      patterns of resistance to such work that affect implementation and access\u000a      to citizenship (4). A key research finding was that despite recent\u000a      legislative and policy shifts extending rights to sexual and gender\u000a      minority communities, sexualities equalities work is unevenly spread and\u000a      far from becoming normalised. Rurality, political hostility, lack of local\u000a      authority interest and associated stigma are limiting factors (5).\u000a      In particular, this research showed the importance of understanding\u000a      implementation processes and barriers for professional training and\u000a      practice, and for policy debates about the delivery of equality measures.\u000a    The second project (2009-2012), an interdisciplinary collaboration\u000a      undertaken with colleagues from Newcastle in Sociology (Poudel) and\u000a      Geography (Laurie, Townsend), is the first to systematically analyse\u000a      women's post-trafficking experiences (www.posttraffickingnepal.co.uk).\u000a      Most work on trafficking addresses its causes and characteristics, feeding\u000a      into policy frameworks targeting the `rescue' of those experiencing\u000a      diverse trafficking situations. Post-trafficking starts when these\u000a      scenarios end and describes the processes and practices associated with\u000a      leaving trafficking situations. Richardson's involvement in the team\u000a      brought conceptual expertise on sexuality and citizenship, and specific\u000a      skills in the empirical exploration of these issues. The research was\u000a      carried out through an innovative collaborative partnership with the\u000a      International Organization for Migration (IOM) and Shakti Samuha, one of\u000a      the first anti-trafficking NGOs, globally, to be founded by\u000a      post-trafficked women. It brought trafficked women's voices into policy\u000a      development and implementation in relation to human rights, which is\u000a      significant because post-trafficking issues intersect with access to\u000a      citizenship. The underpinning research shows that trafficked women are\u000a      typically stigmatised (labelled as prostitutes and\/or `HIV carriers'), and\u000a      experience social rejection from their families and communities (6).\u000a      Lacking family support makes it difficult for them to access citizenship\u000a      and ensuing rights, as citizenship is typically conferred after the age of\u000a      16 through a male relative, usually a girl's father or husband. This can\u000a      result in post-trafficked women being unable to confer citizenship on\u000a      their children, either because they lack citizenship themselves or their\u000a      children were born in trafficking situations (and lack a known father).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21707","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3865483","Name":"Argentina"},{"GeoNamesId":"3439705","Name":"Uruguay"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"3617476","Name":"Nicaragua"},{"GeoNamesId":"3585968","Name":"El Salvador"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research has had impact on public policy design and implementation,\u000d\u000a      and on civil society\u000d\u000a      initiatives that challenged and proposed alternatives to neoliberal WSS\u000d\u000a      policies in Latin America\u000d\u000a      and Europe.

The SNSA invited Castro to make a key contribution to a\u000d\u000a      seven-volume Overview\u000d\u000a      (Panorama) of PLANSAB, prepared to support the public consultation.\u000d\u000a      His chapter is cited by the\u000d\u000a      editor and most co-authors, who also cite 15 additional publications by\u000d\u000a      Castro (IMP4). The author\u000d\u000a      of Chapter 3 of the study dealing with the `fundamental principles [...]\u000d\u000a      to understand the future of\u000d\u000a      basic sanitation in Brazil' recognizes Castro's contribution as one of\u000d\u000a      their main sources (IMP4).\u000d\u000a      The SNSA officer in charge of PLANSAB stated:\u000d\u000a    `[the study] has been used during the process of public consultation\u000d\u000a        over the Plan's contents,\u000d\u000a        which involves discussion and approval of the Plan by different\u000d\u000a        platforms of social participation and\u000d\u000a        government entities at all levels in the whole country. The publication\u000d\u000a        has been a key instrument in\u000d\u000a        this process, providing conceptual clarification, becoming a reference,\u000d\u000a        and helping to raise the\u000d\u000a        quality of the public debate about both the new Law and the Plan. Prof.\u000d\u000a        Castro's research has\u000d\u000a        been one of the central references in the process' (IMP2).\u000d\u000a      See also (IMP3).\u000d\u000a    (3) Training, raising awareness, and enhancing public debate in Brazil\u000d\u000a      The research has contributed to the training of public servants and\u000d\u000a      members of civil society\u000d\u000a      organizations, and thus to the enhancement of understanding and public\u000d\u000a      debate about privatisation\u000d\u000a      and re-publicisation. The research introduced an international dimension\u000d\u000a      into national debates in\u000d\u000a      Brazil on essential public services, bringing lessons of policy failure\u000d\u000a      and success that were\u000d\u000a      unknown to the participants. This included lessons about the negative\u000d\u000a      impact of privatization (such\u000d\u000a      as increasing tariffs with little or no improvement in service quality or\u000d\u000a      extension of coverage, lack of\u000d\u000a      compliance with contractual arrangements, heavy costs involving the\u000d\u000a      cancellation of privatization\u000d\u000a      contracts) and evidence that in most European countries and the US most\u000d\u000a      WSS are successfully\u000d\u000a      run by public, not private companies. The Director of International\u000d\u000a      Affairs of the National Association of Municipal Water\u000d\u000a        and Sanitation Services (ASSEMAE) in Brazil noted how Castro's\u000d\u000a      research `has been a key and invaluable reference for our activities.\u000d\u000a        [...] I promoted the regular\u000d\u000a        participation of Prof. Castro in ASSEMAE's activities, particularly in\u000d\u000a        the annual assemblies that are\u000d\u000a        attended by thousands of municipal public managers from around the\u000d\u000a        country and also from\u000d\u000a        neighbouring countries [...] to develop the capacities of municipal\u000d\u000a        public workers through training\u000d\u000a        activities and informed debate' (IMP5). ASSEMAE represents\u000d\u000a      the public water utilities of around\u000d\u000a      2,000 municipalities in Brazil, where training and debates tend to focus\u000d\u000a      mostly on technical\u000d\u000a      management aspects. The research has made a major contribution to\u000d\u000a      achieving a more complex\u000d\u000a      understanding of the relationship between technical and socio-political\u000d\u000a      aspects of utility\u000d\u000a      management.

Their fundamental tenet was that privatization\u000d\u000a      would attract private funding\u000d\u000a      to extend services to the unserved population, but this has not happened.\u000d\u000a      Instead, where WSS\u000d\u000a      have been privatized, the poor and very poor have either been left\u000d\u000a      unserved or have been severely\u000d\u000a      affected by increased tariffs. Also, whilst these policies were supposed\u000d\u000a      to free the public sector\u000d\u000a      from financial responsibility for WSS, in most privatization cases the\u000d\u000a      state had to step in to fund\u000d\u000a      private operators or even rescue bankrupted private companies, providing a\u000d\u000a      de facto public sector\u000d\u000a      subsidy to private investors rather than users (1, 3, 4).\u000d\u000a    (2) Too often, the stated objectives of these policies, such as enhancing\u000d\u000a      transparency, ending\u000d\u000a      monopoly provision or improving service efficiency, ended in failure.\u000d\u000a      These reforms were supposed\u000d\u000a      to empower consumers and break down (public) power monopolies. However,\u000d\u000a      not only have they\u000d\u000a      failed to protect consumers but they have also created private monopolies\u000d\u000a      to deliver WSS that are\u000d\u000a      opaque to citizen scrutiny and control and are often marred by corruption.\u000d\u000a      In addition, they have\u000d\u000a      privileged the interests of private monopolies over those of users and\u000d\u000a      citizens, who have little say\u000d\u000a      on substantive questions such as tariff levels, investment needs, or\u000d\u000a      ownership and management\u000d\u000a      arrangements (2, 6).\u000d\u000a    (3) Although neoliberal WSS policies have failed, international financial\u000d\u000a      institutions, OECD\u000d\u000a      governments, aid agencies and other actors continue to promote them (and\u000d\u000a      not just in poorer\u000d\u000a      countries) as the only solution available to the crisis of WSS. The\u000d\u000a      underpinning research explored\u000d\u000a      the enduring influence of these policies in eroding the principle that\u000d\u000a      access to life-sustaining\u000d\u000a      services is a public good and a social right (these being the principles\u000d\u000a      driving the democratization\u000d\u000a      of WSS in developed countries), not a commodity. These policies have:\u000d\u000a      weakened the capacity of\u000d\u000a      the public sector to monitor, regulate, and deliver safe WSS; led to\u000d\u000a      radical changes in priorities,\u000d\u000a      with governments and providers of essential public services now\u000d\u000a      prioritizing financial and\u000d\u000a      commercial criteria over the provision of safe and universal access to\u000d\u000a      WSS; and worsened on-going\u000d\u000a      social conflicts by curtailing the rights of ordinary citizens to exercise\u000d\u000a      democratic control over\u000d\u000a      service providers (2, 5).\u000d\u000a    (4) The underpinning research concluded that neoliberal policies and\u000d\u000a      their long-lasting influence\u000d\u000a      are major obstacles to the democratization process. Evidence shows that\u000d\u000a      countries which\u000d\u000a      succeeded in achieving universal provision of essential WSS relied on\u000d\u000a      heavy state involvement\u000d\u000a      and public funding. WSS must be under public control, with strict\u000d\u000a      regulation, and supported by\u000d\u000a      institutions guaranteeing democratic monitoring and accountability (1,\u000d\u000a        5).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21708","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The underpinning research demonstrated that providers' voices bring\u000a      important new perspectives to the design of ethical protections in the\u000a      conduct of clinical research.

This Group wrote, from scratch, the\u000a      Ethics and Governance Framework (IMP2), a set of principles to\u000a      guide UK Biobank's relationship with tissue providers including the\u000a      establishment of an Ethics and Governance Council to oversee UK Biobank.\u000a      Individuals' contributions to the Interim Advisory Group's deliberations\u000a      were not minuted (IMP3); however, as the only social scientist and\u000a      the only person who had conducted research with tissue providers, Haimes\u000a      clearly enhanced the Group's capacity to develop effective guidelines.\u000a      This was confirmed by a fellow Group member who then became Chair of the\u000a      Ethics and Governance Council:\u000a    `During the deliberations of the Interim Advisory Group Professor\u000a        Haimes drew extensively on findings from her research with tissue donors\u000a        to the North Cumbrian Community genetic database to alert the rest of\u000a        the Group to considerations and experiences that donors themselves\u000a        brought to the process of deciding whether to provide tissue to clinical\u000a        research. This evidence closely informed our drafting of the section of\u000a        the Ethics and Governance Framework that addressed the relationship of\u000a        UK Biobank to its tissue donors...' (IMP4).\u000a    Impact: UK Biobank recruited participants between 2007-10\u000a      and its data and samples were made available to researchers in late 2011.\u000a      Throughout this time the Ethics and Governance Framework has been used `to\u000a        set standards...and to ensure that safeguards are in place for\u000a        scientifically and ethically approved research'. The Ethics and\u000a      Governance Council is used `to oversee UK Biobank's adherence to the\u000a        Framework' (IMP2). Haimes was appointed to the Ethics and\u000a      Governance Council (Jan 2007-Dec 2009), which benefited from Newcastle\u000a      research as noted by the then Chair:\u000a    `[Haimes] brought her research findings from three related\u000a      projects directly to bear on, and informed and enriched our understandings\u000a      of, a number of different topics. ... As the only social scientist on the\u000a      EGC conducting relevant empirical studies, Professor Haimes played a\u000a      central role... [in providing insights into potential participants' views\u000a      on]... questions of third party access to the biobank, the\u000a      commercialisation of results... and the possibility of \"benefit sharing\"\u000a      by participants...' (IMP4).\u000a    In terms of significance and reach, the underpinning research from\u000a      Newcastle University has made a major contribution to reducing the risks\u000a      of participation in UK Biobank for over 500,000 tissue donors and\u000a      continues to influence decisions on access to samples and data.\u000a    (2) Contributions to Nuffield Council on Bioethics' policy advice on\u000a        the ethics of encouraging donations of human tissue to research: The\u000a      Nuffield Council on Bioethics (NCoB) is a highly influential, independent\u000a      body that examines and reports on ethical issues in the life sciences; it\u000a      has an international reputation for advising policy makers. The NCoB has\u000a      made active use of Newcastle's research on tissue providers in its Working\u000a      Party's deliberations on the ethics of encouraging people to donate human\u000a      tissue for clinical research and treatment. In December 2008 they invited\u000a      Haimes to present to a closed workshop on `Volunteering, donation and\u000a      payment in the clinical context' to stimulate discussion on the social\u000a      aspects that should be taken into consideration. The Director of the NCoB\u000a      reports: `This presentation raised, for the first time in our\u000a        considerations of this subject, a number of issues that were to prove\u000a        significant in the later work of the Working Party' (IMP5).\u000a    In November 2010, Haimes was invited to contribute further to the Working\u000a      Party's deliberations, through participation in a six-person forum on `The\u000a      conflict between public and private \"good\" in the donation of tissue to\u000a      research and therapy'. Study 3 was at the centre of her presentation and\u000a      hand-out, examples from which were featured in the Final Report on pages\u000a      123 and 221. The Final Report also cites the Newcastle research on pages\u000a      112 and 182 (IMP6). Further evidence of the benefit gained by, and\u000a      influence on, the NCoB from Haimes' research comes from her appointment as\u000a      a full Council member in 2013.\u000a    (3) Writing a Position Statement for a global organisation of\u000a        practising scientists: Haimes' worldwide dissemination of the\u000a      underpinning research led to an invitation in 2009 to join the\u000a      international Ethics and Public Policy Committee of the International\u000a      Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) (IMP7). The ISSCR is an\u000a      independent, non-profit organization with 3,500 members worldwide; it is\u000a      recognised as the voice of the stem cell research community. Using the\u000a      underpinning research, Haimes is enhancing the Ethics Committee's\u000a      considerations of the best ways to protect the interests of individuals\u000a      providing tissue for stem cell research.\u000a    In particular, throughout 2011-12 Haimes led the Committee's discussions,\u000a      and the drafting of a report, on ethical approaches to recruiting egg\u000a      donors for stem cell research. The then Chair of the Ethics and Public\u000a      Policy Committee says, `Haimes' membership of the Committee transformed\u000a        our general discussions... into a focused strategy for bringing the\u000a        ethical issues around egg providers' interests to the attention of the\u000a        practising scientists who form the membership of the ISSCR' (IMP8).\u000a      The Chair notes `the leading role' played by Haimes in the adoption\u000a      of that report as a formal Position Statement by the ISSCR as a whole (IMP9),\u000a      meaning that this will now act as a socio-ethical guideline to which all\u000a      ISSCR scientists will be expected to adhere.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Clinical research is heavily dependent on individuals providing tissues\u000a      for experimentation and therapeutic developments. Since the Declaration of\u000a      Helsinki (1964) the ethical protection of tissue providers has been a\u000a      central concern. However, tissue providers have rarely been included in\u000a      designing those protections.

However, biobanks raise profound concerns about `informed\u000a      consent' and privacy. Scientists have tended to assume that tissue\u000a      providers are simply altruistic donors. This same assumption has been made\u000a      about women who provide eggs and embryos for stem cell research.\u000a      Celebrated as one of the most promising means of tackling currently\u000a      incurable diseases, stem cell science requires human eggs and embryos for\u000a      its development and this has led to heated ethical and public debate. Such\u000a      debates have largely been conducted in abstract and rarely include the\u000a      perspectives of the women who provide that tissue. Research in Newcastle\u000a      aimed to change and improve these ethical debates through empirical\u000a      investigations of tissue providers' views (1).\u000a    Research\u000a    Study 1 (2001-3) investigated pregnant women's considerations when\u000a      deciding whether to contribute afterbirth to the North Cumbria Community\u000a      Genetics research biobank. Analysis of interviews with women who did, and\u000a      did not, provide tissue demonstrated (2) that:\u000a    \u000a      preoccupation with the imminent birth meant women did not realize they\u000a        had consented to provide tissue;\u000a      women thought the afterbirth was waste material, not realizing it\u000a        contained genetic information about their child;\u000a      `consent' and `altruism' were therefore superficial descriptions of\u000a        women's actions and motivations.\u000a    \u000a    Study 2 (2004-12) was the world's first investigation of IVF patients'\u000a      experiences of providing embryos for stem cell research, at a time when\u000a      ethical and political debates focused on the moral status of human\u000a      embryos. The study revealed (3) that:\u000a    \u000a      patients imbued embryos with highly variable social and moral\u000a        significance, depending on their usefulness for achieving a much-desired\u000a        pregnancy;\u000a      patients' views of embryos changed as they progressed through IVF;\u000a      therefore better informed consent to giving embryos to research\u000a        depended on previous IVF experience rather than standard informed\u000a        consent procedures;\u000a      embryo providers require as much ethical protection as, if not more\u000a        than, embryos.\u000a    \u000a    Study 3 (2008-11) was another `world first', a socio-ethical\u000a      investigation of a scheme in which private IVF patients were offered\u000a      reduced fees if they gave eggs to stem cell-related research. The global\u000a      demand for human eggs for research has raised concerns about undue\u000a      inducements and exploitation of poorer women. This project demonstrated\u000a      that (4, 5):\u000a    \u000a      patients struggled to access sufficient IVF treatment because of\u000a        expensive private fees and scarcity of NHS provision;\u000a      they therefore welcomed the scheme, while also proving capable of\u000a        resisting inducement and avoiding exploitation;\u000a      a willingness to provide eggs for research has to be understood within\u000a        the local context of funding and provision of, and demand for, IVF\u000a        treatment;\u000a      caution therefore needs to be exercised before extending such schemes\u000a        globally.\u000a    \u000a    These pioneering projects demonstrate that:\u000a    i. tissue providers' perspectives should be included in designing ethical\u000a      frameworks for the conduct of science;\u000a    ii. the social contexts of requests for tissue influence potential\u000a      providers' evaluations of the significance of, and responses to, those\u000a      requests;\u000a    iii. the moral significance of human tissue varies according to social\u000a      context;\u000a    iv. applied sociological research enhances understandings of core ethical\u000a      concepts such as `altruism', `consent', `inducement' and `exploitation' (6).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23986","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Our group has achieved its impact through three main mechanisms: (1) Via\u000a      the University of Edinburgh's Institute of Governance, co-directed\u000a      by McCrone and now Rosie, which has been both an engine of research (eg\u000a      the Leverhulme work was based there) and a platform for consultation and\u000a      briefing for wider public audiences. It is committed to informing wider\u000a      public, policy and political debate, and has a strong track record of\u000a      liaising and working with the Scottish Government, the Scottish\u000a      Parliament, MSPs and parliamentary staff, Scottish and UK civil servants,\u000a      business, the media and others. (2) Via the long-running journal Scottish\u000a          Affairs, which publishes work which spans academia, journalism\u000a      and commentary from professional life (freely available online since May\u000a      2009). It has become the leading publication forum for discussion of\u000a      Scottish current affairs and serious debate about the country's future,\u000a      and from 2014 will be published by Edinburgh University Press. Bond,\u000a      McCrone and Rosie are all Associate Editors. (3) Via High-profile ad\u000a        hoc events such as the 2009 Institute of Governance conference, Ten\u000a        Years of the Scottish Parliament (which included a recorded debate\u000a      broadcast on BBC Radio Scotland), and a Bilbao meeting in 2013 in which\u000a      McCrone gave the keynote speech and shared the platform with the Prime\u000a      Minister of Euskadi (the Basque country) and the Speaker of the Basque\u000a      Parliament.\u000a    For example, for around 15 years, McCrone and colleagues (often in\u000a      conjunction with the Scottish Centre for Social Research) have provided\u000a      around three to four annual `Chatham House rule' round-table research\u000a      briefings\/discussions at the Institute of Governance [5.1]. Each of these\u000a      briefings typically involves around 20 delegates, for example from\u000a      organisations such as government bodies, the Scottish Parliament, private\u000a      companies, NGOs (eg the Electoral Reform Society and the Scottish Council\u000a      for Voluntary Organisations), etc. The briefings provide a non- partisan\u000a      environment for knowledge exchange, including on controversial matters\u000a      such as national identity and attitudes to independence. For instance,\u000a      they have been attended by personnel from both sides of the independence\u000a      debate: the 'Better Together' and 'Yes Scotland' campaigns.\u000a    Activities such as these briefings (and also, eg, an international\u000a      interns programme linking the Institute of Governance with the Scottish\u000a      Parliament) have had the effect of making our research well known in\u000a      Scottish political\/policy and media circles. Ad hoc events, international\u000a      visitors to our group and its publications have also brought this research\u000a      into the public domain in other countries, especially those in which\u000a      similar issues of sub-state nationalism are important. Evidence of this\u000a      impact includes:\u000a    \u000a      Multiple invitations to brief political figures (eg the Premier of\u000a        Qu&#233;bec in January 2013) and to address or brief public\/policy bodies (eg\u000a        the House of Commons' Welsh Affairs Committee, Royal College of Defence\u000a        Studies, the Scottish Human Rights Commission, Sardinian\u000a        parliamentarians and civil servants, Danish civil servants). Examples of\u000a        public bodies that regularly seek to be briefed by us include the UK\u000a        Delegation of the Government of Catalonia and the UK D&#233;l&#233;gation G&#233;n&#233;rale\u000a        of Qu&#233;bec.\u000a      Group members are frequently approached by the press to give their\u000a        views on current events, or their research is quoted in newspaper\u000a        articles, both in the UK (eg Daily Telegraph, Sunday Post,\u000a        Scotsman, Herald) and internationally (eg the Melbourne Age,\u000a        Ireland's Sunday Business Post, the Spanish press agency, Europa\u000a          Press). For an indicative set of examples, see an analysis of the\u000a        press coverage of the work of David McCrone, prepared with the help of\u000a        the University of Edinburgh Press and Public Relations Office [5.2].\u000a        Group members are also asked, eg, to be interviewed on or otherwise\u000a        advise TV and radio programmes (eg on ITV, Spain's RTVE network, the\u000a        South African Broadcasting Commission and Radio 4).\u000a    \u000a    Three indicative examples of our group's impact on the `public\u000a      conversations' concerning nationalism and national identity are:\u000a    (1) McCrone's research being sought out by Gordon Brown and the\u000a        Cabinet Office; testimony to the impact of his research on Scottish\u000a        politics and the Scottish media.\u000a      McCrone's Chatham House rule briefings have made him prominent in Scottish\u000a      political life. In 2008, triggered by an article written with Bechhofer\u000a      for the 24th British Social Attitudes report (see\u000a      section 3), McCrone was sought out, via a Minister in the Scottish\u000a      Government, by then Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who has a strong interest\u000a      in questions of national identity in Britain. McCrone was asked by Brown\u000a      to throw light on various issues about social and geographic mobility in\u000a      Scotland and the distribution of kin relations across the Scottish\/English\u000a      border; the result was an exchange of handwritten letters between McCrone\u000a      and Brown. In April 2013, McCrone was asked to provide a detailed briefing\u000a      on questions of national identity and constitutional change to the\u000a      Coalition Government's Cabinet Office, which he did in a two-hour session\u000a      with top civil servants in June 2013 [5.3].\u000a    In November 2008, McCrone was named in the Scotsman as one of 12\u000a      'academics [who] are helping to shape our political future' [5.4]. [text\u000a      removed for publication] commented in August 2013 on the impact on Scottish politics and\u000a      the Scottish media of McCrone's research: `Academics have many goals. One,\u000a      perhaps, is to sustain intellectual rigour while attaining relevance in\u000a      wider society. Professor David McCrone has consistently achieved both. His\u000a      research provides acute, insightful analysis which reflects society and\u000a      politics back to all of us. It has been widely cited and deployed by\u000a      leading political figures and the media' [5.5].\u000a    (2) Rosie appointed to Scottish Government's Advisory Group\u000a          on Tackling Sectarianism.\u000a      In response to continuing concerns over Protestant-Catholic sectarian\u000a      conflict, the Scottish Government set up this group in 2012 to advise\u000a      Ministers on all issues bearing on sectarianism in Scotland. Among the\u000a      tasks given to the group is to identify appropriate ways of combating\u000a      sectarianism at a community level, and it makes decisions on the funding\u000a      of proposed projects from community groups and other bodies, with &#163;3m of\u000a      funding allocated by June 2013 [5.6]. It also commissions original\u000a      research, for instance a &#163;100k project on the community impact of marches\u000a      and parades in Scotland, commissioned in January 2013 [5.7]. Rosie was\u000a      appointed to help `ensure evidence is rigorously challenged before it is\u000a      accepted' because of his `longstanding research interest in sectarianism'\u000a      (see section 3) [5.8]. His role includes briefing Scotland's Cabinet\u000a      Ministers and senior civil servants. According to [text removed for publication] the\u000a      Advisory Group plays `a vital role in shaping our future policy on\u000a      sectarianism by assessing evidence, evaluating current and future projects\u000a      and providing advice to [...] Ministers on sectarian matters'. [text\u000a      removed for publication] notes Rosie's `considerable knowledge and experience' in the\u000a      field of sectarianism [5.9]. Rosie has, eg, also been invited to chair the\u000a      official launch event of the Scottish Government's Action on Sectarianism\u000a      web portal.\u000a    (3) Bond's research discussed at First Minister's Questions, Scottish\u000a        Parliament.\u000a      In a context of public concern about demographic trends in Scotland\u000a      (population decline, `brain drain', etc.), the Scottish Executive and ESRC\u000a      funded six research projects on these topics, including a case study of\u000a      graduate migration and retention led by Ross Bond. A resulting 2010\u000a      publication in the Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies (see\u000a      section 3) was picked up by the Sunday Times Scotland and then\u000a      repeated in the Scotsman in April 2010. Both stories chose to\u000a      focus narrowly on the observation in the article that anti-English\u000a      sentiments expressed toward undergraduates from England could weaken the\u000a      capacity of Scotland to retain highly skilled English undergraduates. This\u000a      was presented in the newspapers as evidence of a problem of anti- English\u000a      racism in Scottish universities. Bond promptly wrote a letter, published\u000a      in the Scotsman the next day, correcting misrepresentations of the\u000a      research, and making clear that while the research identified some\u000a      anti-English sentiments, these did not appear to be significant factors in\u000a      English students' decisions about where to settle after graduation, and\u000a      that many English students came to feel an affinity with Scotland. The\u000a      following day the whole issue was raised in the Scottish Parliament at\u000a      First Minister's Questions, by MSP Ian McKee. In the ensuing exchange,\u000a      First Minister Alex Salmond discussed the original research article and\u000a      referred in detail to Bond's letter to the Scotsman dispelling the\u000a      errors in the press coverage [5.10].\u000a    Note re testimony: Bonney (author of the Scotsman article), [text\u000a      removed for publication] are reporters on the impact, not involved in the process of its\u000a      delivery (except via [text removed for publication] role as a Minister advised by Rosie).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The members of the Nationalism and National Identity group at the\u000a      University of Edinburgh have successfully brought their research into the\u000a      public domain in Scotland, the UK and internationally, influencing the\u000a      `public conversations' concerning nationalism and national identity.

The\u000a      Edinburgh group aims to produce impartial and evidence-based knowledge,\u000a      which is publicly available but produced on its own terms. The study of\u000a      nationalism and national identity has long been framed by debates about\u000a      how ancient or recent these phenomena are, and whether they express\u000a      enduring aspects of human nature, or historically contingent\u000a      configurations of social life. Our research centres on the idea that\u000a      nationalism and national identity are not fixed properties of social\u000a      groups, but rather ways of making claims on and about the world: people\u000a      lay claim to an array of identities, institutions and ideas in national\u000a      ways. This perspective lets us get around intractable theoretical puzzles,\u000a      and instead focus on how nationalism gets done: we examine empirically the\u000a      complex and variable ways in which people lay claim to nations and\u000a      national identities.\u000a    In two large research projects funded by the Leverhulme Trust (see\u000a      section 3), we explored this issue in the `natural laboratory' formed by\u000a      the part-fragmented multinational state that is the United Kingdom.\u000a      Bechhofer &amp; McCrone (eds) (2009) brings together the key findings of\u000a      this research, also disseminated in many other publications. These\u000a      findings include:\u000a      (1) That there is minimal ideological and policy preference divergence\u000a      between Scotland and England, and that connections between national\u000a      identity, party support, and constitutional preferences are relatively\u000a      loose in Scotland.\u000a      (2) That Scots tend to be able to take Scottish identity for granted,\u000a      while English identity tends to be more problematic for the English.\u000a      (3) That national identity can be understood as a mode of perception and\u000a      interaction conditioned by situational cues.\u000a      (4) That key institutions such as universities and banks play an important\u000a      role in mediating and focusing national identity.\u000a      (5) That news coverage in the UK appears to be fragmenting along national\u000a      lines.\u000a      Findings such as these have generated multiple international speaking\u000a      invitations and international visitors to our group, especially from\u000a      places in which the issues being researched are particularly pertinent,\u000a      such as Catalonia, Euskadi (the Basque Country), Flanders and Canada.\u000a    Around this core are a range of mutually reinforcing research projects\u000a      among the wider group, inter alia: Stanley's (University of\u000a      Edinburgh [UoE] since 2005) current ESRC Professorial Fellowship, 'Whites\u000a      Writing Whiteness'; Kennedy's (UoE since 2000) and Riga's (UoE 2008-10 and\u000a      2011 onwards) ongoing research into the influence of domestic ethnic\u000a      politics in the US on a century of US foreign policy in central and\u000a      eastern Europe; and Hearn's (UoE since 1998) work on theories of\u000a      nationalism and on the role of national identity in an embattled Scottish\u000a      banking sector.\u000a    The research underpinning the three specific impacts focussed on in\u000a      section 4 below is:\u000a\u0009  (1) McCrone's (UoE since 1975) research on the\u000a      Leverhulme projects, which he directed. Much of this research was joint\u000a      with Frank Bechhofer (UoE since 1965; now Emeritus).\u000a      (2) Rosie's (UoE since 2002) long-running work on religious\u000a      identities and sectarianism reflected in his monograph (next section) and\u000a      co-authored Sectarianism in Scotland (2004) with Steve Bruce and\u000a      others. He argues that far from being a matter of 'structural inequality',\u000a      sectarianism in Scotland has retreated into a matter of residual prejudice\u000a      and bigotry &#8212; and can be effectively tackled as such.\u000a      (3) Bond's (UoE since 2004) ESRC-funded research into graduate\u000a      migration and retention, which reveals the complex ways in which\u000a      intra-state national boundaries are significant for the migration and\u000a      identities of graduates.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23987","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Research Councils UK","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Royal Academy of Engineering"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    4.1 Impacts on creativity, culture and society\u000a    Building on her research that demonstrated the importance of\u000a      interdisciplinary collaborations in synthetic biology (Calvert and\u000a      Fujimura 2011, Frow and Calvert 2013b) and the potentially profound\u000a      significance of designing living things (Calvert 2010), Calvert initiated\u000a      and led a project to bring together six synthetic biologists with six\u000a      professional artists and designers from Europe, the US, Japan and\u000a      Australia in paired exchanges. This EPSRC\/NSF project, called `Synthetic\u000a      Aesthetics', was developed in collaboration with two engineers at a\u000a      `Sandpit' event held in Washington DC (30th March &#8212; 3rd April 2009).\u000a    The project has led to the production of cultural artefacts that would\u000a      not have existed otherwise, such as: human cheese made from bacteria\u000a      collected from body parts including feet, noses and armpits (winner of the\u000a      UdK Award for Interdisciplinary Art and Science from the Universit&#228;t der\u000a      K&#252;nste, Berlin in 2012: see Figure 1); a `design fiction' future packaging\u000a      that creates a probiotic drink with the addition of water (recipient of a\u000a      notable mention in the Core77 2012 Design Awards: see 5.3 and Figure 2);\u000a      and cyanobacteria that digest computer circuit boards (see Figure 3). Such\u000a      unconventional uses of synthetic biology have stimulated debate among\u000a      stakeholders and publics, building on arguments we make in our\u000a      underpinning research about the importance of increasing the diversity of\u000a      voices that are able to contribute effectively to discussions of synthetic\u000a      biology.\u000a    \u000a    Figure 1\u000a    \u000a\u0009\u000a    Figure 2\u000a    \u000a    \u000a   Figure 3\u000a   \u000a   The project has reached a broad range of international audiences, and the\u000a      artefacts have been exhibited in France, Austria, the Republic of Ireland,\u000a      the USA and Japan. The Synthetic Aesthetics website has attracted over\u000a      28,000 unique visitors, and the project has over 1500 Twitter followers.\u000a      The work has been discussed in journals with wide readership such as Science\u000a      (see item 5.6), Nature (5.5) and Cell (5.2), and\u000a      newspapers such as the Toronto Standard (5.4) and Der\u000a        Tagesspiegel (5.1). The project team members have given over 50\u000a      talks on the project across the world, including a dedicated event at the\u000a      Edinburgh International Science Festival in 2012, with an audience of 66.\u000a      Additionally, a popular book with over 100 images is in production with\u000a      MIT Press, and it will be launched at an event at the Museum of Modern Art\u000a      in New York in early 2014. Most significantly, in the book the artists and\u000a      designers co-authored chapters with their paired scientists and engineers.\u000a      This was something none of project's participants had done before, and it\u000a      required them all to modify their practices and re-think their\u000a      assumptions.\u000a    In 2010, Calvert and colleagues received follow-on funding from the\u000a      Wellcome Trust and the Royal Academy of Engineering to collaborate with\u000a      the Arts Catalyst, a not-for-profit arts\/science organisation. Together\u000a      they organised a week-long art\/science workshop with 28 participants, a\u000a      film night with 70 attendees and a public debate with 52 attendees.\u000a      Evaluation interviews were carried out with participants after the\u000a      workshop, and they noted how the art\/science work stimulated creativity\u000a      and promoted mutual understanding across disciplines. For example, one\u000a      artist participant commented: \"it was really enlightening and somewhat\u000a        revealing of the way that we talk about each other's disciplines and the\u000a        way we do our work. I definitely left feeling like everybody's\u000a        inadequately educated\".\u000a    In sum, the unusual interdisciplinary collaborations instigated by the\u000a      Synthetic Aesthetics project have given rise to new cultural artefacts and\u000a      to new opportunities for public discussion about synthetic biology and the\u000a      hopes and concerns provoked by attempts to design living things.\u000a    4.2 Impacts on public policy\u000a    Calvert and Frow's published research on (and close engagement with) the\u000a      synthetic biology community has led to invitations to join national and\u000a      international policy advisory committees including: the Royal Academy of\u000a      Engineering Working Party on Synthetic Biology, the BBSRC Bioscience for\u000a      Society Strategy Panel, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics Working Party on\u000a      Emerging Biotechnologies, the EU-US Task Force on Biotechnology Working\u000a      Party on Synthetic Biology, and the Hastings Center Working Group on\u000a      Ethical Issues in Synthetic Biology, US. In addition, Frow has been\u000a      working with the British Standards Institute and the US National Institute\u000a      of Standards and Technology to inform national standards development\u000a      initiatives in synthetic biology. For this case study, however, we focus\u000a      on one key example of policy impact: the UK's Synthetic Biology Roadmap\u000a      (item 5.10).\u000a    In early 2012, Calvert (along with Claire Marris and Nikolas Rose) was\u000a      invited to join the Synthetic Biology Roadmap Coordination Group (RCG),\u000a      established by David Willetts, Minister of State for Universities and\u000a      Science, and chaired by Lionel Clarke of Shell. Calvert's, Marris's and\u000a      Rose's research findings on the importance of the involvement of the\u000a      social sciences in synthetic biology, specifically in respect to\u000a      `responsible innovation', were taken up in the Roadmap, which has as one\u000a      of its recommendations that \"Public sector investment in synthetic biology\u000a      should take into account social, ethical and regulatory issues and\u000a      increase awareness of responsible innovation\" (item 5.10, p.31).\u000a      Calvert's, Marris's and Rose's arguments for widening disciplinary\u000a      engagement in scientific governance also contributed to the recommendation\u000a      that social scientists should be members of a Synthetic Biology Leadership\u000a      Council (p.32), and that one meeting per year should be held in public.\u000a      This recommendation aims to facilitate democratic participation in the\u000a      field, and it differentiates the work of the Synthetic Biology Leadership\u000a      Council from all existing leadership councils. As a direct result of these\u000a      recommendations, in late 2012 the Synthetic Biology Leadership Council\u000a      (jointly chaired by Willetts and Clarke) appointed a social science member\u000a      (Prof Joyce Tait: see Case Study 4, Life Sciences Innovation).\u000a    The significance of the involvement of Calvert, Marris and Rose in the\u000a      Roadmap Coordination Group was demonstrated in a symposium on synthetic\u000a      biology in Washington, DC (jointly organised by the National Academies of\u000a      the US, the UK and China), where a senior representative from the\u000a      Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills publicly stated how the\u000a      involvement of social scientists (Calvert, Marris and Rose) in the\u000a      roadmapping exercise had challenged and reshaped thinking within the UK\u000a      government:\u000a    \"something we've done that is perhaps slightly different from what\u000a        we've done in the past is to be more involved with social scientists in\u000a        the process right from the outset. That's made a real difference to\u000a        actually how we're thinking as a group, and how we've begun to think\u000a        within government itself, and that's been, for me, as part of the\u000a        journey we've gone on, a real revelation actually\" (item 5.9).\u000a    The impact of social scientific involvement in this work has reached\u000a      beyond the Synthetic Biology Roadmap. This is shown in an email from the\u000a      Technology Strategy Board's representative on the RCG on its &#163;6.5 million\u000a      funding competition for Feasibility Studies in synthetic biology:\u000a    \"You will note that `responsible innovation' figures large in the\u000a        competition, and that we plan to carry out an ethical, societal and\u000a        regulatory assessment on every project funded through it before awarding\u000a        the grants. The work of the RCG [Roadmap Coordination Group], with input\u000a        from the workshops, has been highly influential in shaping this &#8212; the\u000a        first time that any Technology Strategy Board competition has taken this\u000a        approach. Many thanks, especially to social science colleagues, for\u000a        helping to shape the thinking\" (email from Head of Development,\u000a      Technology Strategy Board, 10th May 2012, on file at the University of\u000a      Edinburgh).\u000a    Since the publication of the Roadmap, the idea of `Embedding Responsible\u000a      Research and Innovation' has been taken up by a &#163;10M call for an\u000a      Innovation and Knowledge Centre by the EPSRC, the Technology Strategy\u000a      Board and the BBSRC (5.8), and an &#163;80M call for six Synthetic Biology\u000a      Research Centres by the BBSRC and the EPSRC, demonstrating the\u000a      significance of this work for ongoing policy initiatives (5.7). Calvert\u000a      and Frow have also been invited to contribute to the development of the\u000a      Technology Strategy Board's `Responsible Innovation Framework', which will\u000a      be used in future decisions about funding in the area of synthetic\u000a      biology. Note re testimony: other than the artist quoted (who was a\u000a      participant in the workshop), none of those quoted were participants in\u000a      the process of impact delivery.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Work on synthetic biology carried out by Calvert and Frow at the Univ. of\u000a      Edinburgh since 2007 has led to two different types of impact: on\u000a      creativity, culture and society; and on public policy. Their research on\u000a      design in synthetic biology involved artists and designers from across the\u000a      world.

Calvert (University of Edinburgh since 2007)\u000a      and Frow (University of Edinburgh since 2006) have been carrying out\u000a      research into the nature and implications of this emerging field for the\u000a      last five years.\u000a    Calvert and Fujimura (2011) and Frow and Calvert (2013b) draw attention\u000a      to the challenges of interdisciplinary collaborations across disciplines\u000a      such as biology, engineering, computer science, physics and mathematics,\u000a      which have different assumptions and objectives. They also point to the\u000a      unexpected insights about the biological world that such collaborations\u000a      can bring. Extending the discussion of interdisciplinarity a step further,\u000a      Calvert has argued for the valuable contributions that social scientists\u000a      can make to emerging fields such as synthetic biology, by becoming\u000a      involved at an early stage as collaborators in the production of\u000a      scientific knowledge (Calvert and Martin 2009).\u000a    Calvert and Frow have taken these arguments forward in research into the\u000a      `anticipatory governance' of synthetic biology (Wiek et al. 2012). This\u000a      work concludes that two key features of successful anticipatory governance\u000a      are a) engagement with a variety of lay publics and stakeholder groups\u000a      (who often have divergent preferences, expectations and concerns), and b)\u000a      the close integration of the natural sciences and engineering with the\u000a      social sciences, arts and humanities. Such engagement and integration\u000a      enables discussion about what `responsible innovation' might look like\u000a      across different disciplinary fields, and across different communities of\u000a      knowledge and practice.\u000a    Frow and Calvert (2013a) have developed these ideas in a study focused on\u000a      the future of synthetic biology, where they have shown that it is possible\u000a      to generate a diversity of possible futures of synthetic biology that\u000a      challenge familiar narratives, by involving a broader range of\u000a      stakeholders and perspectives than is usually the case.\u000a    Finally, Calvert (2010) has found that notions of `design' are central to\u000a      synthetic biology, and draws attention to the pressing social and ethical\u000a      issues that arise when living things are themselves the object of design.\u000a    Occasional collaborators in the above research include Joan Fujimura,\u000a      University of Wisconsin, and Dave Guston and Arnim Wiek, Arizona State\u000a      University.

These studies by CHSJ have\u000d\u000a        been acknowledged\u000d\u000a        by the Planning Commission of India and the Ministry of Health and\u000d\u000a        Family Welfare as\u000d\u000a        sources of independent feedback for improving the health system\u000d\u000a        performance.

SAHAYOG took the issue of quality of\u000d\u000a        maternal health\u000d\u000a        services forward, from the oxytocin component of study into a process of\u000d\u000a        collaborative\u000d\u000a        research and advocacy. SAHAYOG received support from Prof Patricia\u000d\u000a        Jeffery in\u000d\u000a        designing a collaborative study of quality of care of institutional\u000d\u000a        delivery. This study has\u000d\u000a        been widely presented and reported in global circles. The collaboration\u000d\u000a        has led to the\u000d\u000a        formation of national network &#8212; National Alliance on Maternal Health and\u000d\u000a        Human Rights &#8212; which\u000d\u000a        continues to advocate for better quality services with the Ministry of\u000d\u000a        Health and\u000d\u000a        Family Welfare, Government of India. The issue of poor quality maternal\u000d\u000a        health as a\u000d\u000a        serious concern has now been mainstreamed in the global policy arena and\u000d\u000a        SAHAYOG is\u000d\u000a        intimately connected with the global advocacy around the region through\u000d\u000a        its involvement in\u000d\u000a        the International Initiative on Maternal Mortality and Human Rights, and\u000d\u000a        with the Office of\u000d\u000a        the High Commissioner of Human Rights at the UN.

Her main involvement has been through Seattle-based PATH\u000d\u000a        (Program for Appropriate\u000d\u000a        Technology in Health). PATH is a hugely-influential global health\u000d\u000a      NGO (it funded, for instance,\u000d\u000a      the world's first successful malaria vaccine), and it has a Gates\u000d\u000a      Foundation-funded project to\u000d\u000a      develop UnijectTM, \"an easy-to-use, injection-ready tool\u000d\u000a      that ensures an accurate dose in a non-reusable,\u000d\u000a      sterile device with minimal preparation and minimum waste\", containing\u000d\u000a      heat-stable\u000d\u000a      oxytocin.

Post-partum\u000d\u000a      haemorrhage [PPH] is a major contributor to maternal mortality. Currently,\u000d\u000a      oxytocin is\u000d\u000a      advocated as a key life-saving drug for arresting\/preventing PPH when\u000d\u000a      administered immediately\u000d\u000a      after birth. Edinburgh University research on home\u000d\u000a      deliveries in India exposed one important but\u000d\u000a      largely unacknowledged and unquantified risk-factor for maternal\u000d\u000a      mortality: widespread misuse of\u000d\u000a      oxytocin during labour to speed up the process. These and\u000d\u000a      other findings in relation to the supply\u000d\u000a      and unregulated use of pharmaceuticals in South Asia have been brought to\u000d\u000a      the attention of\u000d\u000a      advocacy groups and international donors, thus helping frame\u000d\u000a      pharmaceuticals policy debate, e.g.\u000d\u000a      by highlighting the need to reduce the diversion of oxytocin for dangerous\u000d\u000a      use during labour.

According to\u000d\u000a      international protocols,\u000d\u000a      oxytocin should be used intra-partum only under specified circumstances:\u000d\u000a      including monitored\u000d\u000a      intra-venous administration and continual monitoring of the mother\u000d\u000a      and unborn infant by trained\u000d\u000a      staff within institutions capable of providing emergency obstetric care.\u000d\u000a      None of these requirements\u000d\u000a      obtains in rural home deliveries.

In respect to\u000a      regulation, for example, `allogenic' stem-cell therapies, in which a\u000a      patient is treated with human\u000a      cells derived from a single carefully selected donor, clearly require\u000a      regulation, but currently in both\u000a      the US and Europe they are regulated mainly under the same regime as new\u000a      drugs. Some aspects\u000a      of that regime &#8212; for example, the requirement for early stage trials on\u000a      animals and the difficulty of\u000a      deriving data relevant to human efficacy and safety from such trials &#8212; are\u000a      ill-designed for these\u000a      therapies. Moreover, the protracted, extensive procedures demanded by the\u000a      drug-regulatory\u000a      regime are too expensive for small and medium-sized stem-cell enterprises,\u000a      while the culture of the\u000a      big pharmaceuticals companies may not mesh well with the demands of this\u000a      new field.\u000a    In our view, achieving progress in these difficult areas requires action\u000a      research in which academics\u000a      such as our team (Tait, University of Edinburgh [UoE] since 1998;\u000a      Rosiello, UoE since 2003; Mittra,\u000a      UoE since 2003; and Mastroeni, UoE since 2009) collaborate directly with\u000a      policy-makers in\u000a      government and companies, rather than simply studying innovation processes\u000a      as external\u000a      observers. We have developed three systematic frameworks for conducting\u000a      this action research.\u000a      All of them involve structured sets of questions to elicit from\u000a      policy-makers the features of the\u000a      situation they face and to help them reflect on that situation in a way\u000a      that is informed by the results\u000a      of our previous research, for example with actors in similar situations.\u000a    2.1 Targeted R&amp;D Policy (TARGET) is designed to support\u000a      policy-makers in Europe's regions\u000a      and smaller countries, who face increasing pressure to be selective in\u000a      their funding of R&amp;D rather\u000a      than spread funds too thinly (this is the European Commission's `Smart\u000a      Specialisation' approach),\u000a      but with little existing effective guidance or resources to help them do\u000a      this wisely. TARGET is a\u000a      systematic methodology for mapping a) the strengths and weaknesses of the\u000a      existing innovation\u000a      system in a given region\/country and sector (so far, we have concentrated\u000a      on biotechnology), and\u000a      b) the stages of the innovation process that key developments within that\u000a      sector have reached.\u000a      TARGET then helps policy-makers identify both the strategic and the\u000a      tactical decisions that need to\u000a      be taken to give those innovation processes a realistic chance of\u000a      successfully coming to fruition.\u000a    TARGET was developed and tested by applying it in retrospective case\u000a      studies of the development\u000a      of biotechnology in five regions\/small countries, which have had varying\u000a      degrees of success in\u000a      biotech (Israel, North Carolina, the &#216;resund `region' of Denmark\/Sweden,\u000a      Scotland and Singapore)\u000a      and then applied `in real time' in collaboration with policy makers in\u000a      Galicia, Lithuania and Slovenia,\u000a      and in France's Direction g&#233;n&#233;rale de la comp&#233;titivit&#233; (Rosiello et al.,\u000a      2011a, b).\u000a    2.2 Adaptive Governance of Innovative Technology (AGIT) is based\u000a      on extensive longitudinal\u000a      research on innovation in a number of areas of the life sciences\u000a      (pharmaceuticals, agro-biotechnology,\u000a      biofuels, human stem-cell therapies). This research has eg revealed the\u000a      crucial role\u000a      of decisions taken in early stages of product development (eg the decision\u000a      referred to above to\u000a      subject allogenic stem-cell therapies to the full drug-testing regime)\u000a      that then have unforeseen\u000a      outcomes (see, eg, Mittra and Tait, 2012; Mittra, Tait and Wield, 2011).\u000a      For example, AGIT:\u000a      i) helps policy-makers identify the potential enabling and\/or constraining\u000a      roles of their decisions;\u000a      ii) encourages policy-makers to retain the scope for future modification\u000a      of policies and regulations\u000a      as more is learned about the benefits and risks of a technology, product\u000a      or process;\u000a      iii) encourages them to consider new, more critical approaches to\u000a      stakeholder engagement.\u000a    2.3 Analysis of Life-Science Innovation Systems (ALSIS),\u000a      implemented using Banxia's\u000a      Decision Explorer software, is a method that allows managers in companies\u000a      systematically to work\u000a      through the decisions that will need to be made as they move innovations\u000a      towards practical use. It\u000a      allows them to examine a variety of scenarios (for example, in which\u000a      demand for the product in\u000a      question suddenly rises or falls, or regulatory\/production difficulties\u000a      emerge). In particular, ALSIS is\u000a      informed by the results of our detailed AGIT research on regulation and\u000a      its likely medium-term\u000a      changes (it can be hard even for experienced industry personnel to keep\u000a      abreast of changing,\u000a      dauntingly complex regulatory frameworks and practices). ALSIS was\u000a      developed and tested in\u000a      action research with early stage companies involved in developing\u000a      regenerative medicine products\u000a      based on human embryonic stem-cell lines (Mastroeni et al., 2012).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23990","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"798549","Name":"Romania"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    We have prioritised reaching out to user groups and wider audiences in\u000a      clear and accessible\u000a      terms through short articles and web pieces (listed in Section 5) and at\u000a      workshops, training\u000a      sessions and CPD courses. The significance of, and value attached to, our\u000a      work is seen in the\u000a      invitation to write-up our research for the practitioner-focused Policing\u000a      journal. The editors wrote:\u000a      `We believe that your article contained much that would be of direct value\u000a      to senior public order\u000a      commanders', and one of the reviewers noted: 'This is a very useful paper\u000a      that may help USA\u000a      police move beyond the current situation' (4 January 2013, on file at\u000a      University of Edinburgh).\u000a      Other examples include:\u000a    Public Order Policing workshop, May 2010 (corroboration sources:\u000a      sections 5.1, 5.2 &amp; 5.3)\u000a      Our research (item 5 in section 3) highlighted the desire for, but also a\u000a      lack of awareness about,\u000a      liaison-based policing styles. We therefore organised an academic and\u000a      practitioner workshop\u000a      discussing current trends in public order policing and identifying lessons\u000a      to be learned from\u000a      existing research. Over 50 delegates attended from eight police forces,\u000a      the Scottish Police\u000a      College, and nine UK universities, highlighting the reach of our research.\u000a      Presentations from\u000a      police officers &#8212; from command, public order and negotiator perspectives &#8212;\u000a      and academics\u000a      generated lively discussion on these issues and how best to implement the\u000a      more `facilitative'\u000a      approaches. A workshop participant from Sweden's dialogue police was\u000a      subsequently invited to\u000a      Lothian &amp; Borders Police's negotiator training course. The workshop\u000a      was funded by University of\u000a      Edinburgh's Public Policy Network (see REF3a) and the Scottish Institute\u000a      for Policing Research\u000a      (SIPR). SIPR collated feedback on the event, including the following\u000a      comments on Gorringe &amp;\u000a      Rosie's presentation and the workshop as a whole: `I would like to\u000a        work with these individuals at\u000a        our forthcoming events &#8212; clear overlap in our aims &#8212; we could assist\u000a        with demonstrating practical\u000a        issues in dealing with protest from a Policing perspective and allow\u000a        them to draw independent\u000a        conclusions.' `A thought provoking seminar on how we move forward in\u000a        public order policing.\u000a        Having a combination of academics, public order and negotiators brought\u000a        healthy debate' (see\u000a      section 5.1 below).\u000a    Advising police operations before an event\u000a      (corroboration sources: section 5.3)\u000a      The workshop facilitated greater access to policing operations, and its\u000a      significance was clear when\u000a      we were invited to advise Lothian &amp; Borders Police during the\u000a      preparation, planning and debriefing\u000a      of a `liaison operation' which helped facilitate a largely peaceful\u000a      Climate Camp in 2010 (item 3.5 in\u000a      section 3). We advised on the policing approach, the leaflet to be\u000a      distributed to protestors and the\u000a      clothing to be worn by liaison officers (in our earlier research, we\u000a      encountered liaison officers\u000a      wearing plain clothes, meaning protestors were unable to identify them and\u000a      saw them as spies).\u000a      We stressed that liaison officers should be clearly identifiable\u000a      (recommending that they wear their\u000a      police uniforms, but also high-visibility vests with the words `Liaison\u000a      Officer' prominent on them)\u000a      and maintain lines of communication with protestors and also be able to\u000a      respond to demands:\u000a      `Safe to say your input has been hugely valuable not least the comments\u000a        you make below &#8212; all of\u000a        which we'll take on board.

Afterward we provided\u000a      feedback on the operation\u000a      and suggested possible ways to improve for future events. Subsequently, in\u000a      2013, we were\u000a      consulted by officers seeking to establish a liaison unit with student\u000a      activists in South Edinburgh.\u000a    Debriefing commanders during and after an event (corroboration\u000a      sources: section 5.3)\u000a      In 2009 we debriefed key police liaison officers after the NATO\u000a      Parliamentary Assembly and\u000a      provided feedback on dialogue-based models of policing; in 2010 we were\u000a      invited to observe (and\u000a      comment upon) key stages from planning to post-event briefing of\u000a      Strathclyde Police's handling of\u000a      the Papal Mass in Glasgow, submitting a formal report. In 2011 we studied\u000a      the policing of protests\u000a      at the Liberal Democrat Spring Conference in Sheffield, including the\u000a      planning stages. We\u000a      provided dynamic on-the-day discussion and briefing with both South\u000a      Yorkshire's `Police Liaison\u000a      Team' and their Silver Commander (who has since co-authored an account of\u000a      the event with Stott\u000a      and Gorringe). On the day we drew Silver's attention to the dangers of\u000a      relying on CCTV for\u000a      information and discussed with him how to improve the safety of liaison\u000a      officers in the crowds.\u000a    Contributing to police public order training (corroboration\u000a      sources: sections 5.2 &amp; 5.3)\u000a      In 2011 we provided several sessions to Public Order Commanders in Lothian\u000a      &amp; Borders Police\u000a      and Strathclyde Police and to Lothian &amp; Border's Police's newly formed\u000a      Public Order Working\u000a      Group. About 25 Public Order Bronze Commanders attended the session in\u000a      Edinburgh, about\u000a      75% of relevant staff. In Strathclyde we addressed two training sessions\u000a      totalling around 40\u000a      commanders, about 80% of relevant Strathclyde Police staff. In September\u000a      2011, the Assistant\u000a      Chief Constable of Strathclyde Police wrote: `The universal feedback\u000a        from the Commanders was\u000a        very positive, with much comment made of the engaging style of the\u000a        presentations, which made\u000a        the Commanders think about alternative viewpoints and the potential\u000a        impacts of their actions upon\u000a        protestors in various situations ... I look forward to further\u000a        collaboration opportunities' (On file at\u000a      University of Edinburgh). The training course organiser has summarised our\u000a      contribution as\u000a      ranging from an overview of `the latest crowd dynamics theories to\u000a        demonstrating the practical\u000a        application of them in a most pragmatic and objective manner. Such\u000a        inputs have been imparted to\u000a        Public Order Commanders in the past as valued updates in the field of\u000a        working with crowds in\u000a        Command refresher courses that I have run and I am very keen to continue\u000a        with this relationship'\u000a      (On file at University of Edinburgh).\u000a    We also addressed rank and file public order officers in Lothian &amp;\u000a      Borders Police at their annual\u000a      training refresher session attended by 80 officers, and contributed to a\u000a      course aimed at police\u000a      professionals run by the University of Liverpool. Around fourteen of the\u000a      participants (almost all of\u000a      whom were operational police officers) took the module as part of a degree\u000a      and five police officers\u000a      (mostly at or above Superintendent rank, and all with extensive\u000a      operational experience) took the\u000a      course as CPD. This session led to an invitation to observe and offer\u000a      feedback on the policing of\u000a      the Liberal Democrat Conference in Sheffield in 2011.\u000a    Contributing to wider debates (corroboration: articles cited in\u000a      this paragraph and section 5.1;\u000a      section 5.3)\u000a      Finally, our research has informed both practitioner and wider debates. In\u000a      2011 our analysis of the\u000a      challenges to protest policing after the Millbank disturbances appeared in\u000a      Police Professional, a\u000a      key resource for senior officers across the UK. In 2013 Gorringe, Kominou\u000a      and Rosie briefed the\u000a      UN Special Rapporteur on rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and\u000a      association. Item 3.5 in\u000a      section 3, together with a paper by Stott, Scothern and Gorringe, appeared\u000a      in a special `liaison'\u000a      issue of Policing, and item 3.6 featured in the companion volume\u000a      to the Stevens Commission on\u000a      the Future of Policing.

More recently,\u000a      research on police culture and knowledge has contributed to an emerging\u000a      sociology of policing.\u000a      Gorringe and Rosie's contributions to this field (see publications 3.1-3.5\u000a      in section 3) hinge on\u000a      empirical, ethnographic analyses of event dynamics and the way in which\u000a      institutional norms and\u000a      discourses can shape political encounters. Much of their work has offered\u000a      a rapid analysis of\u000a      protest events to maximise the possibilities for dissemination and\u000a      learning (see especially items\u000a      3.3, 3.5 &amp; 3.6).\u000a    Gorringe and Rosie argue for a more localised understanding of protest\u000a      policing and demonstrate\u000a      that policing operations occur within particular local contexts that\u000a      influence both protest and\u000a      policing styles (see items 3.1, 3.3 &amp; 3.5). They also highlight the\u000a      move from forceful and\u000a      aggressive policing styles, through negotiated management to more\u000a      dialogue-based models\u000a      (items 3.1, 3.3-3.6). Their research provides some of the first\u000a      social-scientific analysis of current\u000a      dialogue-based models in the United Kingdom (e.g., item 3.5 is a\u000a      user-friendly paper on their 2009\u000a      research surrounding the NATO Assembly, commissioned by Policing\u000a      due to its topicality and\u000a      importance) and has contributed to ongoing debates about how to manage\u000a      crowds peacefully\u000a      through dialogue and negotiation (see items 3.4, 3.5 &amp; 3.6).\u000a    Whilst much social-scientific research tends to focus on the immediate\u000a      encounter between police\u000a      and protestors (i.e. the protest `event'), Gorringe and Rosie's work\u000a      emphasises the wider and\u000a      mediated context within which such encounters\/events occur and are\u000a      understood (e.g., items 3.1\u000a      &amp; 3.2). They bring work on police culture, protest and media to bear\u000a      in their analysis. Their focus\u000a      on the media, for example, suggests that police commanders' emphasis on\u000a      liaison and dialogue\u000a      can be undermined by media scare stories (item 3.2). There is, therefore,\u000a      a need for police to\u000a      engage systematically with, and indeed seek to manage, both the media and\u000a      broader public\u000a      knowledge of protest events.\u000a    On the basis of this research, they were well placed to offer some of the\u000a      first sociological analyses\u000a      of the `English Riots' of 2011. Their piece on the policing of the riots\u000a      (item 3.3) featured in\u000a      Sociological Research Online's rapid response issue on the\u000a      disturbances, and they also had a\u000a      paper in the first issue of Scottish Affairs after the events.\u000a      Both were consulted by, and reported\u000a      within, press and television coverage of and analysis after the\u000a      disturbances.\u000a    The underpinning research was primarily conducted by Gorringe (University\u000a      of Edinburgh since\u000a      2001) and Rosie (University of Edinburgh since 2002). David Waddington\u000a      (Professor of\u000a      Communication at Sheffield Hallam University) and Margarita Kominou (a\u000a      part-time PhD student\u000a      at the University of Edinburgh 2008- ) were invited to collaborate on a\u000a      project focussing on\u000a      Edinburgh's NATO Parliamentary Assembly in 2009. Professor Clifford Stott\u000a      (Visiting Professor at\u000a      University of Leeds) subsequently invited us to participate in research on\u000a      the policing of the\u000a      protests at the Liberal Democrat conference in Sheffield in 2011.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23991","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    In this section, we first outline how this work has been brought into the\u000d\u000a      public domain, and then we lay out the evidence of its impact.

From 2003 onwards, this\u000d\u000a      Edinburgh research has focussed strongly on the processes of knowledge\u000d\u000a      construction in financial markets, the organisational bases of those\u000d\u000a      processes, and their relationship to financial crises. (\"Knowledge\" is\u000d\u000a      used here in the sociology-of-knowledge sense of shared belief, not\u000d\u000a      justified belief.)\u000d\u000a    Amongst the findings of this research are:\u000d\u000a    i. Mathematical models in finance can be both performative (alter market\u000d\u000a      processes in such a way to make them \"more like\" the postulates of the\u000d\u000a      model) and counterperformative (make market processes less like the\u000d\u000a      postulates of the model). See MacKenzie and Millo (2003) and MacKenzie\u000d\u000a      (2006).\u000d\u000a    ii. In the financial crisis of 2007-8, models played a specific\u000d\u000a      counterperformative role: the models of complex structured products used\u000d\u000a      by the credit rating agencies (to award ratings such as AAA, etc) were\u000d\u000a      arbitraged widely by market participants, who would quite deliberately set\u000d\u000a      out to create the most high-yielding (and therefore most risky) products\u000d\u000a      that would nevertheless gain the desired credit ratings. See MacKenzie\u000d\u000a      (2011).\u000d\u000a    iii. This process was fuelled by the organisational division of labour in\u000d\u000a      credit rating agencies, which each had a group evaluating asset-backed\u000d\u000a      securities (ABSs, such as mortgage-backed securities) and a separate group\u000d\u000a      evaluating collateralised debt obligations (CDOs), despite the similarity\u000d\u000a      in structure between ABSs and CDOs (again, see MacKenzie 2011).\u000d\u000a      Communication between the groups was poor, and they employed different\u000d\u000a      models. The result was that it was possible to package together tranches\u000d\u000a      of ABSs with low credit ratings into a CDO most of which would\u000d\u000a      nevertheless receive the top credit rating, AAA. This was a lucrative\u000d\u000a      arbitrage opportunity that was exploited widely with disastrous results.\u000d\u000a      The resultant heavy demand from ABS CDOs for mortgage-backed securities\u000d\u000a      sidelined previously important gatekeepers (experienced, specialist,\u000d\u000a      risk-sensitive investors in the lower tranches of these securities) and in\u000d\u000a      so doing helped make possible the increased recklessness of mortgage\u000d\u000a      lending in the US. Enormous losses were incurred on those ABS CDOs, and\u000d\u000a      those losses were concentrated at the pinnacle of the financial system, in\u000d\u000a      globally important banks and insurers.\u000d\u000a    iv. The \"facticity\" (factual status) of numbers &#8212; prices, interest rates\u000d\u000a      and other metrics &#8212; is crucial to the markets in financial derivatives:\u000d\u000a      that is, products whose value depends on those prices or rates. See\u000d\u000a      MacKenzie (2007) which, for example, examined the construction of LIBOR\u000d\u000a      (London Interbank Offered Rate), well before the controversy over this\u000d\u000a      crucial interest-rate benchmark erupted into the public domain in 2012\u000d\u000a      following the attempted rate fixing by Barclays and other banks. (To our\u000d\u000a      knowledge, LRB article b, listed in section 5.3, was the first\u000d\u000a      article outside of the specialist financial press to report doubts re\u000d\u000a      LIBOR's facticity.)\u000d\u000a    The underpinning research was conducted at the University of Edinburgh by\u000d\u000a      Donald MacKenzie (Prof. of Sociology since 1992) and his students Yuval\u000d\u000a      Millo (PhD student at Edinburgh 1999-2002; now Prof. of Accounting at\u000d\u000a      Leicester) and Iain Hardie (MRes\/PhD student at Edinburgh 2003-7; Lecturer\u000d\u000a      in Politics [UoA 21] at Edinburgh since 2007).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23992","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"},{"GeoNamesId":"149590","Name":"Tanzania"},{"GeoNamesId":"1227603","Name":"Sri Lanka"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    If the global community is to meet the UN Secretary General's goal of\u000a      providing `Sustainable Energy for All by 2030', then bioenergy &#8212; whether\u000a      from natural biomass, bioresidues or purpose- grown biofuels &#8212; will need\u000a      to be part of the solution. PISCES has contributed to that solution;\u000a      Molony's research on energy markets in East Africa has helped inform the\u000a      improvement of energy delivery and policy in the region.\u000a    Collective impact of PISCES (corroboration sources: section 5.1)\u000a    Although precise measurement in Global South conditions is very\u000a      difficult, PISCES estimates that it has improved clean energy access and\u000a      livelihoods via bioenergy for approximately 250,000 people in Kenya,\u000a      India, Sri Lanka and Tanzania. It has improved energy access for ~220,000\u000a      people, many of whom were previously reliant on energy-inefficient\u000a      three-stone cooking stoves that burn firewood. The majority of the\u000a      beneficiaries are in Tanzania, where UDSM subcontracted the production of\u000a      gasifier stoves to Kiwia &amp; Laustsen Company Ltd., which distributed\u000a      stoves to 30,000 households in the Arusha region and central regions of\u000a      Tanzania. Assuming an average household size of six members in Tanzania,\u000a      the total beneficiaries for this activity are 180,000 individuals. To this\u000a      figure we add 600 people who were involved in the production and\u000a      distribution of the gasifier stoves. Smaller interventions also took place\u000a      with `Uhai' and `TERI' stoves in Kenya, and with wood gasifier and ethanol\u000a      cook stoves in Sri Lanka, bringing the total number of people with\u000a      improved energy access to ~220,000 people. PISCES has contributed\u000a      collectively to: ~30,000 people with reduced smoke-related health\u000a      problems; improved and more equitable livelihoods via bioenergy for\u000a      350,000 people (benefitting from additional initiatives that build on the\u000a      ~220,000 figure); and enhanced adaptive capacity of ~10,000 households in\u000a      vulnerable communities. This final figure refers to the Community-based\u000a      Adaptation Programme implemented in Kisumu, Kenya by ACTS, involving the\u000a      establishment of woodlots and the piloting of energy-saving stoves.\u000a    Molony's research has contributed to these collective outcomes via three\u000a      routes: The Kenya Charcoal Policy Handbook; the uptake of\u000a      bioresidue gasifier stoves in Tanzania; and the bioenergy Policy Working\u000a      Groups in Kenya and Tanzania.\u000a    The Kenya Charcoal Policy Handbook (corroboration sources:\u000a      section 5.2)\u000a    The findings of Molony's baseline socio-economic survey were applied to\u000a      the production of this Handbook, which the author (wa Gathui) asked Molony\u000a      to edit. Charcoal regulation is an opaque process in Kenya, and the\u000a      imposition of illegal taxes is widespread throughout the charcoal market\u000a      chain, which supplies charcoal to 82% of the urban population and the 34%\u000a      of rural households. The Handbook uses simple language to sensitise\u000a      farmers, producers, transporters, vendors and buyers on charcoal\u000a      regulations. It has been received well by local stakeholders (farmers,\u000a      vendors) and national stakeholders (Ministry of Energy, Ministry of\u000a      Forestry and Wildlife) and is being used by local officials (especially in\u000a      the Kenya Forest Service) to guide their work. A simpler Swahili version\u000a      was produced and is being disseminated to relevant stakeholders including\u000a      farmers, vendors, police officers. An abridged pocketbook has also been\u000a      produced. Together they have contributed towards the empowerment of\u000a      communities relying on charcoal for their livelihoods, and some members\u000a      are now able to stand firm against the payment of illegal taxes. As [text removed for publication]\u000a\u0009  of the Kenya Forestry Research Institute puts it, `vulnerable\u000a      charcoal traders at the mercy of ignorant or unscrupulous officials can\u000a      now demonstrate to officials their rights to operate freely in the\u000a      charcoal business.... while [with the introduction of the handbook some]\u000a      officials now know what the law says, and they are better placed to\u000a      operate within the law.' (email, 13 May 2013)\u000a    The uptake of bioresidue gasifier stoves (corroboration sources:\u000a      section 5.3)\u000a    In Tanzania, Molony's research on the biogas value chain informed an\u000a      assessment and economic analysis of the bioresidue gasifier market that\u000a      contributed to the uptake of bioresidue gasifier stoves in institutions\u000a      (such as fish markets) and households. As the gasifier project leader,\u000a      [text removed for publication], puts it: \"Molony's research highlighted some of the less\u000a      celebrated examples of biogas use in Tanzania ... helping me to understand\u000a      how these users overcome some of the problems they encountered. This was\u000a      important in allowing me to suggest to the Government how the bioresidue\u000a      gasifier value chain could be made more efficient &#8212; something that is\u000a      crucial to supporting the sector at the national level. The market is now\u000a      growing, thereby contributing to reduced fuelwood consumption and\u000a      smoke-related health problems.\" (email, 14 February 2013)\u000a    Molony's contribution to the baseline information on appliances,\u000a      feedstock and biocrops was used in the testing of modifiers that informed\u000a      the development of delivery models &#8212; and later a market &#8212; for modified\u000a      plant oils to operate rural stationary engines. From the R&amp;D work of\u000a      UDSM and Kiwia &amp; Laustsen Co., the gasifier stoves have now entered\u000a      the market and have received a grant for production of 30,000 units under\u000a      the trade name of `Jiko Bomba'. Jiko Bomba uses pellets\u000a      made of rice husks and jatropha cake, which were identified in Molony's\u000a      baseline research with [text removed for publication] at the Department of Mechanical and\u000a      Mining Engineering, UDSM. As [text removed for publication] puts it, \"Molony's initial\u000a      research contributions on bioenergy feedstocks and appliances in various\u000a      regions in Tanzania was crucial in helping the research team to locate\u000a      various materials for testing. Without this research we would not have\u000a      been able to identify locally-available materials, narrow down on the rice\u000a      husks and jatropha cake, and make the appropriate design modifications to\u000a      the Jiko Bomba stove.\" (letter, 5 February 2013) The World Bank\u000a      has now funded collaboration between ACTS and UDSM to promote the market\u000a      development of the stove.\u000a    Bioenergy Policy Working Groups in Kenya and Tanzania\u000a      (corroboration sources: section 5.4)\u000a    Molony worked with Muok (ACTS and PISCES manager) in creating a bioenergy\u000a      Policy Working Group (PWG) in Kenya (chaired by the Permanent Secretary at\u000a      Kenya's Ministry of Energy, with membership from government, NGOs,\u000a      bilateral donors, and business) and a bioenergy PWG in Tanzania (with\u000a      membership from the Ministry of Energy and Minerals, NGOs and farmers'\u000a      associations) with Minja and Mwakaje (UDSM). PWGs seek to develop a\u000a      consultative and participatory policy methodology to discuss policy issues\u000a      and guide bioenergy policy statements. In the most advanced case, members\u000a      of the Kenya Policy Working Group were instrumental in the writing of the\u000a      country's National Biofuel Policy, approved by the Ministry of Energy.\u000a      Muok was tasked with coordinating the draft policy, and asked Molony to\u000a      act as reviewer. Under the new Kenya constitution promulgated in 2011, the\u000a      draft Kenya National Biofuel Policy was integrated into the draft Kenya\u000a      Energy Policy 2013, to go for approval by the new Parliament when it\u000a      reconvenes. Molony chaired the second (March 2010) Tanzania national\u000a      Bioenergy PWG, comprising government policymakers, academics, the private\u000a      sector, and NGOs. Based on Molony's argument that PWGs could have an\u000a      important role in helping ensure that gender issues are mainstreamed into\u000a      bioenergy policy, representatives with a gender perspective were appointed\u000a      to the group. To date, gender mainstreaming in bioenergy policy has had\u000a      limited success in Tanzania &#8212; owing, in part, to constraints that Molony\u000a      (2011) discusses. A significant positive step, however, is the\u000a      establishment of a dedicated Gender Working Group (GWG).\u000a    Contributions to critical public debate about biofuels\u000a      (corroboration sources: section 5.5)\u000a    The wider impact of Molony's work on critical public debate is evidenced\u000a      by a succession of invitations to him. For example:\u000a    - following publications with Smith (2009, 2010a, 2010b and 2010c),\u000a      Molony and he were invited to provide input to the Nuffield Council for\u000a      Bioethics report `New Approaches to Biofuels: Ethical Issues'. Molony,\u000a      Smith and PISCES are all cited in the report.\u000a    - following the April 2011 publication of the Nuffield Report, Molony was\u000a      invited to present at a seminar convened by Practical Action Consulting UK\u000a      (13 June 2011).

On current trends, 3\u000a      billion people will by 2030 still cook using traditional fuels (such as\u000a      firewood) and appliances. Without improved appliances or fuel, over 30\u000a      million people will have died due to smoke-related diseases as a result.\u000a      PISCES is a consortium linking Edinburgh University to partners (listed in\u000a      section 3) in Kenya, India, Sri Lanka and Tanzania. The consortium is\u000a      working to provide policymakers in those countries with new information\u000a      and approaches to unlock the potential of bioenergy to improve energy\u000a      access and livelihoods in poor communities. PISCES is multidisciplinary\u000a      and includes other researchers at the University of Edinburgh, eg Smith's\u000a      and Pradhan's (UoA 24) work on South Africa and India respectively.\u000a    The research of Molony (Research Fellow then Lecturer at the University\u000a      of Edinburgh since 2005) has concentrated on baseline socio-economic\u000a      issues, and principally the use of bioenergy resources and technologies in\u000a      East Africa. He draws on his accumulated knowledge of and expertise about\u000a      East African societies gained through extensive ethnographic research in\u000a      the region. His work on mobile phones in Africa (cited multiple times, for\u000a      example, in UNCTAD's Information Economy Report 2010) has strongly\u000a      influenced his approach to data collection concerning the use of\u000a      technologies in East Africa. It has also informed his understanding of the\u000a      complexities of policymaking at the interface of technology and society\u000a      and thus fed into his work on bioenergy. Since 2007, Molony's work has\u000a      focussed on two streams:\u000a    1. Gathering of baseline data on bioenergy in East Africa\u000a    2. Influencing national bioenergy policy in Kenya and Tanzania. Molony's\u000a      field research has shown both how various bioenergy technologies are used\u000a      and how existing policy processes influence those who use them. As a\u000a      member of a consortium working with policymakers, Molony has at times made\u000a      the strategic decision not to wait for his research to be published but\u000a      instead to put his energies &#8212; informed by research findings &#8212; into\u000a      influencing practice more directly (see Section 4).\u000a    Baseline field research\u000a    As part of an FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United\u000a      Nations) and PISCES study on small-scale bioenergy initiatives in\u000a      developing countries, Molony (2009) conducted research in Tanzania on\u000a      FELISA Ltd, a company that produces crude palm oil and biodiesel in\u000a      Kigoma. This involved the production of a `market map' (an assessment of\u000a      the balance of rights, responsibilities and revenue between market actors)\u000a      and an evaluation of the company's impact on livelihood assets. Also in\u000a      Tanzania, Molony collected baseline information on appliances and biocrops\u000a      in Morogoro, Iringa and Mbeya regions, and took part in field research on\u000a      the `value chain' connecting biogas producers and consumers in Arusha and\u000a      Kilimanjaro regions. That field research revealed that wider uptake of\u000a      biogas is hampered by weaknesses in the processes and linkages among the\u000a      actors. The biogas market has been distorted by interventions from public\u000a      institutions and donor projects whose beneficiaries, accustomed to their\u000a      free support, are reluctant to pay for after-sale services. Many potential\u000a      users are not aware of the technology and a large section of the market\u000a      remains unexploited. All these, along with an inadequate policy\u000a      environment, lack of stakeholder development, missing linkages to finance,\u000a      and few technicians, render the market unattractive to entrepreneurs who\u000a      would otherwise have invested in the dissemination of the technology.\u000a    Gender and bioenergy policy\u000a      Molony has undertaken fieldwork in Kisumu, Kenya as part of a baseline\u000a      study on gender issues in the bioenergy arena. Building on his systematic\u000a      review of research by others, the first-hand research acted as a\u000a      foundation in his (2011) case for mainstreaming gender into African\u000a      countries' bioenergy policies. This comes at a time when many developing\u000a      countries are updating their existing energy strategies and formulating\u000a      their bioenergy policies to accommodate rises in domestic and external\u000a      supply and demand for biofuels. He suggests that in the integrated global\u000a      context of biofuels, the conditions that generate inequality between rich\u000a      and poor remain unchanged, and he highlights national bioenergy Policy\u000a      Working Groups (PWGs) as having an important role to play in helping\u000a      ensure that gender issues are mainstreamed into bioenergy policy within\u000a      the context of the increasing focus on biofuels.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"27173","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1168579","Name":"Pakistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"895949","Name":"Zambia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"},{"GeoNamesId":"2363686","Name":"Togo"},{"GeoNamesId":"69543","Name":"Yemen"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Developing educational resources for teachers and students\u000d\u000a    The richness and significance of the oral histories generated through the\u000d\u000a      underpinning research\u000d\u000a      led the research team to seek additional ways to disseminate the stories,\u000d\u000a      the methodology and the\u000d\u000a      findings to a broader audience.

The project therefore established Making Histories as an\u000d\u000a      effective model for\u000d\u000a      responding to Ofsted findings that diversity and multiculturalism is\u000d\u000a      taught poorly in British schools,\u000d\u000a      as well as addressing the Ofsted recommendation that personal, family and\u000d\u000a      local history should be\u000d\u000a      taught in UK schools, a recommendation supported by Education Secretary\u000d\u000a      Michael Gove.\u000d\u000a    In terms of community impact, the project was a catalyst for\u000d\u000a      collaboration amongst a number of\u000d\u000a      community and national organisations, including Runnymede Trust, The\u000d\u000a      Swadhinata Trust (the\u000d\u000a      Bengali community history and campaigning organisation), local Race\u000d\u000a      Equality Councils, local and\u000d\u000a      national museums (Museum of Wales, the Cardiff Story Museum, Museum of\u000d\u000a      London), universities\u000d\u000a      and other organisations (e.g. the Somali Community and Parents\u000d\u000a      Association). Several national\u000d\u000a      organisations &#8212; Runnymede, Swadhinata and the `Making History' charity led\u000d\u000a      by actor Colin\u000d\u000a      McFarlane &#8212; were able to extend their reach to new and often hard-to-reach\u000d\u000a      audiences, create\u000d\u000a      lasting links with schools and community organisations and even raise new\u000d\u000a      funding to expand\u000d\u000a      project coverage [G]. The collaboration also became a model for the AHRC\u000d\u000a      and Runnymede. The\u000d\u000a      AHRC views it as a new template for research and knowledge transfer and an\u000d\u000a      example of a `high\u000d\u000a      impact' case study. For Runnymede it \"has led to additional interest from\u000d\u000a      other academics to\u000d\u000a      replicate the high levels of dissemination to non-academic groups that we\u000d\u000a      have achieved on both\u000d\u000a      projects\", and has already resulted in a second successful collaboration\u000d\u000a      that has produced another\u000d\u000a      educational website resource focused on diversity issues called Romans\u000d\u000a      Revealed.\u000d\u000a    In terms of broader impact, \"The projects conducted by the young people\u000d\u000a      on the Making Histories\u000d\u000a      project provided much needed insight into the migration journeys and\u000d\u000a      hidden histories of the very\u000d\u000a      diverse communities that have settled across the UK, including those of\u000d\u000a      Yemeni, Somali,\u000d\u000a      Togolese, Pakistani, Caribbean, Zambian, Indian, Irish and Italian\u000d\u000a      backgrounds among others.\" [G]\u000d\u000a      The website has had nearly 900 visits to date, the majority from the UK,\u000d\u000a      but some from North\u000d\u000a      America, mainland Europe, Australia, Brazil, South Africa and the UAE.\u000d\u000a    Influencing policy around history teaching and the National Curriculum\u000d\u000a    Based on the underpinning research and the development and testing of a\u000d\u000a      new approach for\u000d\u000a      teaching history, Alexander, Chatterji and Weekes-Bernard (from Runnymede)\u000d\u000a      wrote a paper to\u000d\u000a      influence policy and practice called Making British Histories:\u000d\u000a        Diversity and the National Curriculum\u000d\u000a      [H] as part of the Runnymede Perspectives series. The paper suggested\u000d\u000a      reform of the National\u000d\u000a      Curriculum to redraw the boundaries between British and World Histories,\u000d\u000a      to give schools the\u000d\u000a      resources to develop courses that engage students in living history, and\u000d\u000a      to include family and\u000d\u000a      community research as part of the curriculum. It was launched at a\u000d\u000a      high-profile roundtable of\u000d\u000a      policymakers, teachers, historians and community representatives at the\u000d\u000a      Museum of London, held\u000d\u000a      as part of the ESRC Festival of Social Science, where prominent historians\u000d\u000a      engaged in a debate\u000d\u000a      about the role and purpose of history drawing upon the findings described\u000d\u000a      in the paper.\u000d\u000a    The paper and the underpinning research have proved influential in\u000d\u000a      discussions and debates about\u000d\u000a      policy and practice in both Britain and Asia. They have been presented to\u000d\u000a      a range of non-governmental\u000d\u000a      organisations and community groups in the UK, India and Bangladesh. They\u000d\u000a      have\u000d\u000a      informed the thinking of religious authorities, including the Archbishop\u000d\u000a      of Canterbury's Office and\u000d\u000a      the North Herts Interfaith Forum, which believes that the history\u000d\u000a      curriculum is causing social\u000d\u000a      division because \"the Asian story is missing\" and that \"the making history\u000d\u000a      project is finding a gentle\u000d\u000a      way through a fraught subject\" [I]. They have fed into discussions with\u000d\u000a      policymakers from the UK\u000d\u000a      Department of Education in terms of how to make history teaching more\u000d\u000a      inclusive, and Dr Chatterji\u000d\u000a      has been invited to policy discussions regarding future curriculum\u000d\u000a      development.\u000d\u000a    The report also had a more direct influence on the National Curriculum.\u000d\u000a      In early 2013 the\u000d\u000a      Department of Education proposed to remove key historical figures from\u000d\u000a      minority ethnic\u000d\u000a      backgrounds (Mary Seacole and Olaudah Equiano) from the history curriculum\u000d\u000a      for ages 5-14. This\u000d\u000a      spurred Runnymede, Operation Black Vote (OBV) and race equality\u000d\u000a      organisations to respond with\u000d\u000a      an online petition that gathered 40,000 signatures (including 72 MPs), and\u000d\u000a      Runnymede produced a\u000d\u000a      policy briefing paper based on the Making British Histories research that\u000d\u000a      was shared with\u000d\u000a      Education Secretary Michael Gove in an invited briefing and that was used\u000d\u000a      to influence\u000d\u000a      parliamentarians and policy advisors. The briefing paper proved to be\u000d\u000a      \"significant in influencing the\u000d\u000a      revised school history curriculum in which both historical figures were\u000d\u000a      retained\" and was used \"to\u000d\u000a      make a strong and ultimately convincing case to also ensure that African\u000d\u000a      and other world histories\u000d\u000a      were part of the pre eleven National Curriculum\" [J].

The\u000a      value of the POPGROUP software derives from its flexible framework which\u000a      can be tailored to each user's own environment, with impact delivered\u000a      through:\u000a    \u000a      The widespread adoption of the POPGROUP software by government and\u000a        commercial planning agencies.\u000a      The recognition of POPGROUP as the industry standard for local\u000a        planning.\u000a    \u000a    Users include local and national governments, health agencies, commercial\u000a      planning companies and universities, with the number of organisations\u000a      using the software increasing from 40 in 2008, to 111 by July 2013 (when\u000a      the most recent survey took place) [1][6]. In October 2012 two-year\u000a      teaching licences were issued for the first time [1]. The software\u000a      continues to develop, with the addition of the generalised Derived\u000a      Forecast facility in 2010, immediately utilised to implement forecasts of\u000a      long-term illness and disability in 2011 [2]. Additionally, since 2010\u000a      Data Modules have been provided to fill demographic models with Government\u000a      (DCLG) &#8212; and other authoritative projections from within the UK &#8212; from\u000a      which users can develop in-house `alternative scenarios'. These\u000a      developments have led to a range of impacts:\u000a    1. POPGROUP has become the industry standard. Now \"recognised\u000a        as the `industry standard' population forecasting model\" [8], the\u000a      Head of Population Statistics at the Welsh Assembly notes how it has \"contributed\u000a        to the development of the demographic knowledge base within local\u000a        authorities\" [5]. It was adopted in 2010 by the LGA, through an\u000a      agreement with the Steering Committee of software users, and is presently\u000a      used by 81 Local Authorities [1][6]. Simpson, in collaboration with these\u000a      users, has taken the lead in designing each subsequent software\u000a      development, and is now technical manager to the Steering Committee.\u000a    2. POPGROUP has facilitated the implementation of policy in socially\u000a        dynamic contexts. In particular, POPGROUP addresses the UK\u000a      Government's `National Planning Policy Framework' (2012) that requires\u000a      every local authority to make a `Strategic Housing Market Assessment',\u000a      supported by robust demographic projections. This is exceptionally\u000a      important, as the co-ordination of such assessments by regional bodies was\u000a      scrapped in 2010, as part of the UK Government's `localism' agenda. As the\u000a      co-chair of Local Authorities on the Central and Local Information\u000a      Partnership notes:\u000a    \"POPGROUP allows Local Government demographers the flexibility to\u000a        examine population, household and labour force projections at a level\u000a        appropriate to their needs... alternative scenarios can be quickly\u000a        generated, by manipulating any of the components, and compared with\u000a        previous sets. This facility is particularly useful when looking at\u000a        alternative Planning scenarios for House Building as required by Local\u000a        Spatial Strategies; with the abolition of Regional Spatial Strategies,\u000a        this has become a key requirement for Local Authorities\" [4].\u000a    The success of POPGROUP in providing an accessible technical framework\u000a      for local planning has emerged directly from the underpinning research\u000a      cited, with its algorithms and understanding of common local needs across\u000a      diverse circumstances providing an accessible and user-controlled planning\u000a      tool.\u000a    3. POPGROUP has been used throughout the nations of the UK in\u000a        socio-geographically diverse situations. The national statistical\u000a      agencies of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have made use of POPGROUP\u000a      for their production of sub-national demographic forecasts. The Welsh\u000a      Assembly Government used the software for their council area population\u000a      forecasts (2010 and 2013); noting that \"POPGROUP has proved to be a\u000a        useful tool in enabling government bodies such as the Welsh Government\u000a        to produce demographic projections at a local authority level &#8212; this\u000a        includes Unitary Authorities and National Parks\" [5]. National\u000a      Records Scotland also used the software for national park population\u000a      forecasts (2011), working with Simpson and Lomax to develop local ward\u000a      projections. Their Head of Population and Migration Statistics confirms\u000a      the value of this work:\u000a    \"The project was in two phases the first of which was the production\u000a        of projections for multimember wards for Fife Council area and the\u000a        second phase was to work with National Records of Scotland (then General\u000a        Register Office for Scotland) to develop the same projections in-house\u000a        and to compare different methods using more detailed data. Comprehensive\u000a        recommendations and guidance was produced to allow others to more easily\u000a        produce their own projections for small areas. Feedback from Councils on\u000a        the project and on the guidance has been very favourable. Subsequent\u000a        recent follow-up work to produce user guidance for the derived forecast\u000a        model was also produced to very short deadlines and within budget.\"\u000a      [7]\u000a    4. POPGROUP is increasingly used by commercial planning agencies.\u000a      As of July 2013, six commercial organisations have purchased POPGROUP\u000a      (Barton Willmore, Ecorys UK, GVA Grimley, Nathaniel Lichfield and\u000a      Partners, ORS and Regeneris Consulting Ltd.) These organisations advise\u000a      local authorities and housing development companies in Britain, and have\u000a      turned to POPGROUP software as a `standard' since 2010. GVA, a large\u000a      consultancy firm working both for local authorities and private\u000a      development agencies, underlines this recognition:\u000a    \"POPGROUP is becoming increasingly recognised as the Industry standard\u000a        population forecasting model. This is evident through the requirement to\u000a        have POPGROUP expertise in a majority of the recent public sector tender\u000a        opportunities we have worked on. This requirement has also stimulated\u000a        the commercial sector's use of the model to interrogate and challenge\u000a        published projections elsewhere. From our own experience we have used\u000a        POPGROUP both to define local housing requirements as well as challenge\u000a        those previously set. Our work using POPGROUP has been used to\u000a        successfully justify an increase in local housing requirement in support\u000a        of major housing development, by demonstrating a range of scenarios\u000a        where higher housing numbers would be required.\" [8]\u000a    In large part, it is POPGROUP's accessible Excel platform that has\u000a      assisted wider uptake.\u000a    Ongoing engagement: In addition to these impacts, UoM's annual\u000a      training course in POPGROUP &#8212; in addition to self-training POPGROUP\u000a      practical modules &#8212; reflects breadth of impact. In 2013, the 18\u000a      participants came from: local authorities (9), Universities (4), national\u000a      statistical agencies (3) and commercial companies (2) [9]. Moreover,\u000a      international interest has been reflected in users in the United States\u000a      (U.S. Census Bureau), Finland, Singapore and Malaysia, and the inclusion\u000a      of POPGROUP in a 2011 review of three demographic software packages\u000a      commissioned by the Latin American Population Association [10]. The\u000a      influence of POPGROUP is ongoing, as upon the retirement of Simpson in\u000a      2009, Edge Analytics Ltd won a tendering process to support users and to\u000a      develop, distribute and market the software. According to Edge Analytics'\u000a      Managing Director, \"the contract helped the company to develop and\u000a        enlarge from one to five staff by 2013, each of whom have had\u000a        significant workloads related to POPGROUP\" [3]. Simpson remains the\u000a      technical manager.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research on demographic projection methods, undertaken at the University\u000a      of Manchester (UoM), provided the basis for POPGROUP, a software package\u000a      recognised as the industry standard for local demographic planning in\u000a      Great Britain and adopted by the Local Government Association (LGA) in\u000a      2010. Three impacts emerge from POPGROUP. Firstly, in estimating how\u000a      migration will be restricted or stimulated according to the provision of\u000a      housing, the software permits local government to assess a range of\u000a      house-building scenarios, enabling the effective implementation of, most\u000a      recently, the `National Planning Policy Framework' (2012). Secondly, by\u000a      extending demographic projections to areas other than local authority\u000a      boundaries, it enables national statistical agencies to project\u000a      demographic demand (e.g. in National Parks). Thirdly, the ubiquity of\u000a      POPGROUP has led to the increasing use of demographic tools within the\u000a      commercial sector.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Technological","Institution":"\u000a    The University of Manchester\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Manchester (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Manchester","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"North West","UKPRN":10007798}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2643123","Name":"Manchester"},{"GeoNamesId":"1880252","Name":"Singapore"}],"References":"\u000a    (all references available upon request &#8212; AUR)\u000a    In addition to academic articles, a dissertation and a book, a range of\u000a      software manuals were also produced between 2002 and 2011 and are\u000a      available via the CCSR website\u000a      (http:\/\/www.ccsr.ac.uk\/popgroup\/).\u000a    \u000a[A] (2011) Simpson, L. and Snowling, H. \"Estimation of Local Demographic\u000a      Variation in a Flexible Framework for Population Projections\" Journal\u000a        of Population Research 28(2) 109-127 (Special issue on small area\u000a      projections) doi:10.1007\/s12546-011-9060-7\u000a    \u000a\u000a[B] (2009) Marshall, A. &amp; Simpson, L. \"Population Sustainability in\u000a      Rural Communities: the Case of Two British National Parks\" Applied\u000a        Spatial Analysis and Policy 2(1) 107-127\u000a      doi:10.1007\/s12061-008-9017-1\u000a    \u000a\u000a[C] (2009) Finney, N. and L.

At UoM the research\u000a      has been led by Simpson, with contributions from Dr Christian Brand\u000a      (Research Associate, 2003-2006, 2007-2012), Susan Lomax (Research\u000a      Assistant, 2007-2009) and Dr Alan Marshall (Research Associate, 2010-2011,\u000a      2012-).\u000a    Research on demographic projection methods underpins the POPGROUP\u000a        software; developed to forecast population, households and the labour\u000a        force, for areas and social groups. Demographic projections\u000a      calculate future population size and structure based on assumptions about\u000a      future trends in fertility, mortality and migration. The distinctive\u000a      nature of the research contribution rests on the improved use of\u000a        cohort component models (which use information on fertility,\u000a      migration and mortality trends within age-sex cohorts) for strategic\u000a      planning, through better integration of population estimates within\u000a      demographic projections. POPGROUP was designed by Simpson in 2000 to\u000a      implement a cohort component projection model underwritten by six local\u000a      authorities. It has been updated twice (v.2 in 2002; v.3 in 2005), with a\u000a      further generalised Derived Forecast model issued in 2010, accommodating\u000a      forecasts of any population characteristic related to age and sex,\u000a      including households and the labour force. A fourth version of POPGROUP is\u000a      due in 2014.\u000a    Emerging from a consideration of complex forecasting strategies, the\u000a        research aimed to produce software of sufficient rigour that would\u000a        convince advanced users, yet be practical and functional for\u000a        non-specialist staff. Based on Excel, it builds upon users' existing\u000a      spreadsheet skills, with alternative assumptions developed as scenarios.\u000a      The user remains in control of the area to be forecast, of data inputs,\u000a      and of analytical outputs additional to the software's own flexible\u000a      reporting and graphical routines. Additionally, software development to\u000a      improve quantitative training in POPGROUP methods was supported by the\u000a      ESRC (2003-2008). This training recognised that previous software packages\u000a      had attempted to fill the same requirements yet had either been focused on\u000a      temporary needs, or had become inaccessible through inadequate support.\u000a    POPGROUP's methodological innovations include incorporating the\u000a        mathematical equivalence of social groups and geographical areas,\u000a        thereby satisfying both a longstanding need for local area forecasting\u000a        and a growing interest in the social dimensions of population dynamics\u000a        as they relate to ethnic diversity. The first version of the\u000a      software facilitated user input of base populations, births, deaths and\u000a      migrants, and assumptions about future rates of fertility, mortality and\u000a      migration, providing tabular and graphical outputs of population structure\u000a      and demographic indicators [D]. Subsequent research incorporated\u000a      into the software integrated forecasts of population, housing and the\u000a      labour force [E], with further methodological innovations implementing\u000a      improved algorithms for expectation of life, decomposition of population\u000a      and household change, dynamic population pyramids and comparison of\u000a      forecast scenarios.\u000a    Housing provision and economic development impose constraints on\u000a      populations which are also resolved through migration; hence the\u000a        translation of migrants into households is a key algorithm in the\u000a        POPGROUP approach.

She prepared one of three background research papers &#8212; the\u000a        others addressing\u000a        health and safety, and productivity &#8212; with \"the TME\u000a            unanimously adopting a set of\u000a            conclusions, `Working Time in the Twenty-first Century', that was\u000a            endorsed by the ILO\u000a            Governing Body in March 2012 and now forms the basis of all of the\u000a            ILO's work on\u000a            working time. These Conclusions are currently being\u000a          implemented in the `Global Product of\u000a          Working Time in the Twenty-first Century', designed to strengthen both\u000a          the ILO's research on\u000a          working time, and its policy advice and technical assistance to\u000a          constituents on developing better\u000a          working time arrangements... the positive evaluation of\u000a          Professor Fagan's TME background\u000a          report led to her invitation, under selective tender, to prepare one\u000a          of the six major outputs for the\u000a          `Global Product...' during the ILO's 2012-2013 Biennium, a research\u000a          paper on international\u000a          trends in part-time working conditions\" [1].\u000a      Fagan was commissioned by the EC to prepare an `awareness-raising'\u000a          briefing [2] about the\u000a          policies and institutional factors which are conducive to increasing\u000a          men's involvement in\u000a          care work. Previously, Fagan authored or co-authored seven\u000a        influential Eurofound reports that\u000a        analysed gender differences in working-time and working conditions,\u000a        using specially designed\u000a        surveys commissioned to stimulate policy debate and to inform\u000a        Eurofound's written and verbal\u000a        policy briefings to their European tripartite constituency [3].\u000a      Fagan's working-time and work-family reconciliation research is\u000a          also cited in support of\u000a          policy recommendations made in high-level official documents and\u000a        reports by the ILO,\u000a        Eurofound and similar organisations engaged with European employment\u000a        policy formation [4].\u000a      Fagan's profile has led to numerous follow-up invitations, to\u000a        provide advice on working-time\u000a        policy and gender equality to national\/federal governments in Spain,\u000a        Austria and Finland, and\u000a        prepared briefing papers for trade union associations (ETUI, TUC) and\u000a        employers' associations\u000a        (e.g. the European Chemical Industry).\u000a    \u000a    Impact 2: Shaping the orientation of European policy design and\u000a        monitoring, in relation to\u000a        gender inequalities in employment and job quality:\u000a    \u000a      Through over a decade of research and advisory work for Eurofound,\u000a        Fagan has helped to\u000a        strengthen the gender perspective in the monitoring of working\u000a          conditions, and steer and\u000a        re-invigorate debates about conceptualising and measuring job quality\u000a        dimensions. As\u000a        Eurofound confirm: \"recommendations for working-time and work-life\u000a          balance policies designed\u000a          to advance gender equality... have informed and shaped the direction\u000a          of Eurofound's reporting\u000a          and policy recommendations... and policies to advance gender equality\u000a          in employment and the\u000a          labour market...

In June 2013 Fagan accepted an invitation to join\u000a        the Eurofound Advisory\u000a        Committee on Working Conditions [3].\u000a      Via collaboration in the EC `Network of European Academic Experts\u000a          on Gender and\u000a          Employment', Fagan has helped shape the orientation of the EC's\u000a        gender equality and gender\u000a        mainstreaming approach for employment policy, collaborating in the\u000a        network (2004-), and as\u000a        the UK academic expert (2008-). As the Head of the EC Equality Unit\u000a        notes, this contribution:\u000a        \"included the design and execution of a programme of national and\u000a          international comparative\u000a          research across EU member states and EFTA countries in order to inform\u000a          the Commission's\u000a          gender quality and employment policies, and evaluations of national\u000a          policy developments and\u000a          labour market trends... [and] the analytical institutional\u000a          framework which they have applied to\u000a          the analysis of gender inequality has continued to underpin and inform\u000a          the European\u000a          Commission's gender equality and gender mainstreaming work with the\u000a          Member States in\u000a          policy developments and assessments of the subsequent stages of the\u000a          EES, including under\u000a          the present `Europe 2020' strategy\" [5].\u000a      Since 2004, Fagan's research has provided the basis for over\u000a          twenty reports and briefings\u000a          on gender inequalities and policy developments in the UK, prepared\u000a        by the network for the\u000a        EC's internal use, as well as invited contributions to high level policy\u000a        workshops initiated by the\u000a        EC and European Presidency conferences. The EC uses these documents to\u000a        monitor\u000a        developments and to inform bilateral dialogue and recommendations made\u000a        to the UK\u000a        government, through the annual round of reporting on national policy\u000a        (the National Reform\u000a        Programmes for Employment) under the `Open Method of Coordination'\u000a        (OMC). These are, in\u000a        turn, used as a basis for the gender equality assessments included in\u000a        the employment and\u000a        social inclusion reports presented to the annual EC Presidency Summits.\u000a      Alongside EWERC colleagues, Fagan directly assisted the EC to\u000a          develop employment\u000a          policy indicators and gender mainstreaming tools which are\u000a        fundamental features of the\u000a        EC's approach to employment policy coordination. This has included\u000a        preparing a background\u000a        report for the EC which informed the development of the official gender\u000a        equality employment\u000a        statistical indicators for monitoring European Employment Policy [6],\u000a        which remain in use to this\u000a        day. As a member of the Bureau of European Policy Advisors (and previous\u000a        head of the EC\u000a        Equality Unit) confirms: \"the coordination reports and associated\u000a          academic publications written\u000a          by Rubery, Fagan, Grimshaw developed an international comparative\u000a          analysis of gender\u000a          inequalities that attended to the varying institutional configurations\u000a          found in different national\u000a          settings, through a focus on how labour markets, welfare states and\u000a          family systems interact to\u000a          shape gender relations and inequalities\" [7]. The Head of the EC\u000a        Equality Unit similarly notes\u000a        that Fagan and EWERC colleagues: \"helped to broaden the European\u000a          Commission's\u000a          perspective with respect both to gender equality and to employment\u000a          policy... [and] were\u000a          centrally involved in the development of frameworks for gender\u000a          mainstreaming employment\u000a          policy and in actively monitoring its implementation through their\u000a          assessments of the member\u000a          states' National Action Plans (and subsequently the National Reform\u000a          Programmes) from a\u000a          gender perspective. This led to the development in 2008 by the\u000a          European Commission of a\u000a          manual on gender mainstreaming based on the work of the EGGE network\u000a          and issued as a\u000a          guide for member states which is still widely used today and remains\u000a          the key gender\u000a          mainstreaming tool promoted on our web site\" [5]. Notably, Fagan's\u000a        own research is referenced\u000a        in the manual [8].\u000a      \u000aFagan's research on quotas as a tool for improving gender diversity\u000a          at corporate board\u000a          level has been used to maintain the momentum in the political debate\u000a          on this topic [A]. It\u000a        was referenced in policy documents prepared by the EC and by the Women's\u000a        Rights'\u000a        Committee of the European Parliament, and is one of ten listed resources\u000a        on the European\u000a        Parliament Libraries recommended reading list on this topic for MEPs. In\u000a        March 2013, Fagan\u000a        was invited to present her research and policy recommendations to a\u000a        workshop organised for\u000a        the European Parliament by the Women's Rights' Committee and the Legal\u000a        Committee, as part\u000a        of the ongoing debate about the potential introduction of quota\u000a        legislation. This was\u000a        subsequently published as a European Parliament policy briefing [9]. It\u000a        has been used by the\u000a        Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) as a key evidence base for\u000a        its policy on\u000a        quotas. As their research and policy managers corroborate: \"The EHRC\u000a          has engaged with\u000a          Fagan about her research and its policy implications [and] used\u000a          the research evidence in [A] to\u000a          inform our position on gender issues in management, including in\u000a          responding to government\u000a          consultations and dealing with internal and external inquiries on this\u000a          subject\" [10].\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research on gender inequalities at the University of Manchester (UoM) has\u000a      informed and shaped\u000a      the development of employment policies advocated by key national and\u000a      international bodies &#8212; such\u000a      as the United Nations' International Labour Organization (ILO), the\u000a      European Commission (EC),\u000a      Eurofound and the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) &#8212; in their\u000a      role as advisors of\u000a      national governments and regulators.

Insights\u000a      on gender equality in employment were generated in two academically\u000a      distinct areas:\u000a    (1) A more differentiated conceptualisation of part-time work and\u000a        working-time\u000a        arrangements, through an in-depth consideration of working-time and\u000a      `work-life balance' policies:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aDemonstrating a widespread mismatch in working-time preferences and\u000a          practices for\u000a          both sexes across all countries, and challenging the stereotyped\u000a        gender assumptions which\u000a        have prevailed in working-time policy debates. Many men as well as women\u000a        would like to work\u000a        substantial part-time hours working hours (e.g. 75% of a full-time\u000a        position) at points in their life\u000a        course, while many part-timers would like to increase their hours [C].\u000a      \u000aIdentifying important distinctions between `marginal' and\u000a          `integrated' part-time\u000a          employment which are key to monitoring the quality of part-time\u000a        work. This redirects policy\u000a        debate towards the conditions under which (integrated) part-time work\u000a        can both enhance work-family\u000a        reconciliation options, and advance gender equality in employment.\u000a        International\u000a        comparisons provide evidence of the policies necessary to generate\u000a        integrated rather than\u000a        marginal forms of part-time working [C][E].\u000a      \u000aProviding a multi-dimensional analysis of working-time arrangements\u000a          &#8212; volume,\u000a          schedule, predictability, personal autonomy, etc. This extends\u000a        policy understandings in\u000a        several areas: job quality for both part-time and full-time workers; how\u000a        to best design working-time\u000a        arrangements which improve the alignment between workers' needs and\u000a        organizational\u000a        requirements; and the salient indicators required for policy monitoring\u000a        purposes [B][C].\u000a    \u000a    (2) By promoting an international comparative analysis, the research\u000a        demonstrates that:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aThe design and evaluation of gender equality and gender\u000a          mainstreaming policies must\u000a          take into account the national context. Moreover, the nature of\u000a        gender inequalities in\u000a        employment is connected to the national configuration of employment,\u000a        family and social\u000a        protection policies &#8212; so called `gender regimes' [D][E].\u000a      \u000aWomen's jobs are inferior on many, but not all, dimensions of job\u000a          quality. Some\u000a        indicators of job quality need updating to properly capture working\u000a        conditions in female-dominated\u000a        service jobs; and a more nuanced assessment of job quality (addressing\u000a        different\u000a        dimensions of job quality) is necessary to monitor trends in gender\u000a        inequalities [B].\u000a    \u000a    Quotas are an effective means of increasing women's representation at\u000a        corporate board\u000a        level providing they are well-designed. However, there is no clear\u000a      evidence that gender diversity at\u000a      board level improves business performance, and many women in the\u000a      recruitment pool for these\u000a      posts are opposed to quotas [A].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28162","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The impact of the research has been achieved through three main pathways:\u000a    \u000a      \u000achallenging conventional wisdom and improving public\u000a        understanding of sustainable consumption and behaviour change;\u000a      \u000ahelping to reframe policy debate on these issues, with ideas\u000a        and evidence adopted by national and international policy fora\u000a        and non-governmental organisations;\u000a      \u000acontributing directly to policy innovation through\u000a        incorporation into the development of frameworks for devising and\u000a        assessing policy recommendations, and associated policy toolkits.\u000a    \u000a    A wide range of public engagement activities was adopted to\u000a      influence public discourse and help open up a space for debate. Examples\u000a      include Southerton's public lectures for the Cheltenham Science Festival\u000a      (2010) and British Library (2012), with additional lectures and debates\u000a      (to audiences in excess of 100) delivered on ten occasions, in six\u000a      countries. Significantly, the research has been covered by several media\u000a      outlets, with appearances such as that by Evans on the BBC Breakfast\u000a      programme (21st September 2011), highlighting scope for ongoing\u000a      diffusion and impact.\u000a    The field of sustainable consumption is a broad one, ranging from energy\u000a      policy through to transport and food policy. Nonetheless, this research\u000a      has had a particularly wide influence and reach, as indicated by the\u000a      National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) who note that\u000a      the practices approach \"offers us the possibility of a genuine\u000a        paradigm shift in the world of behaviour change and disease prevention\u000a        in ways that have for the most part to date been unexplored. It also\u000a        offers theoretical purchase in a field dominated by psychological models\u000a        with only the most cursory consideration of social context\" [1].\u000a      Moreover, the potential for ongoing impact is clear, and it is confirmed\u000a      that: \"The team at Manchester... have been involved in a number of\u000a        very important theoretical and empirical projects using the sociological\u000a        conception of social practices as a way of describing health related\u000a        behaviour change. This is a very significant departure... NICE will be\u000a        exploring with [UoM] the possibilities of developing these ideas\u000a        further\" [1]. Specific partnerships with policymakers (seeking to\u000a      tackle the `value-action gap') are outlined below, offering `proof of\u000a      principle' for the ISM approach.\u000a    Public Policy: Practice approaches to consumption and behaviour\u000a      change appear within UK Government reports from 2008 &#8212; and are emphasised\u000a      at the launch of the SCI in 2009 &#8212; but it is the 2011 Scottish Government\u000a      (`SG') Report that forms the basis of this case [B]. The Report put in\u000a      place a conceptual framework &#8212; the ISM approach &#8212; that was further\u000a      refined into an applied toolkit, co-created by Evans and Southerton, and\u000a      launched on 5th June 2013. Together the approach and toolkit\u000a      critiqued existing policy initiatives (focused extensively on information\u000a      campaigns and financial incentives) and, as the Principal Research Officer\u000a      of the SG notes, have \"gained considerable currency within the\u000a        environmental behaviour change field in Scotland, which is only likely\u000a        to grow given the publication of the ISM user and technical guides\"\u000a      [2].\u000a    The 2011 launch of the SG Report was attended by c.100 stakeholders; a\u000a      third policy makers, and a similar percentage academic staff. In noting\u000a      that the SG has both `drawn extensively' on the report and `adapted' it\u000a      within presentations, the SG's Principal Research Officer, confirms that\u000a      both the Report and ISM model that emerged from it \"has had a direct\u000a        impact on the development of the Scottish Government's approach to\u000a        influencing low carbon behaviours\" [2] The Report was picked up in\u000a      several ways:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aKey documents: The SG Report was referenced by the Scottish\u000a          Environment Minister in the Scottish Parliament as written\u000a        evidence for consideration by the `Transport Infrastructure And Climate\u000a        Change Committee'; used as evidence in the report `Regulation of Energy\u000a        Efficiency in Housing'; and cited within the `Low Carbon Scotland:\u000a        Meeting our Emissions Reduction Targets 2013-2027' document [3].\u000a      \u000aAdditional uptake: The Scottish Government's Environment\u000a          Research team included substantial reference to the SG Report's\u000a        theoretical framework in a number of internal and external presentations\u000a        [2], with independent researchers AD Research and Analysis (ADRA)\u000a        utilising the SG Report as a framework for devising and assessing policy\u000a        recommendations in the report `The Impact of Workplace Initiatives on\u000a        Low Carbon Behaviours' [4]. More specifically, ADRA made significant use\u000a        of the ISM model to explain critical success factors, leading to best\u000a        practice guidance (published separately for internal use) that adopted\u000a        `built-in' principles established in the SG report, as ADRA note \"ISM\u000a          again proved its worth, not simply as an evaluative or analytical\u000a          framework, but also a practical way of thinking about policies and\u000a          interventions, and one which practitioners and publics seemed to find\u000a          intuitive\" [5]. Following this engagement, the Scottish Government\u000a        drew extensively on the SG Report in `Research Findings from the Climate\u000a        Change Behaviours Research Programme' which sets out findings from\u000a        across its wider `behaviours programme'. This document focused on the\u000a        need for integrated approaches, moments of change and robust evaluation,\u000a        which were all key findings from the SG report [2][6].\u000a      \u000aStakeholder focused: In April 2012 the Scottish Government\u000a        adapted the SG Report into a presentation for stakeholders on their approach\u000a          to behaviour change policy, with its Principal Research Officer\u000a        noting that: \"This represented an important moment in disseminating\u000a          published insights into the practices of policy makers and provided\u000a          the `impetus' for the commissioning of an ISM toolkit\" [2]. The\u000a        subsequent project, entitled `The ISM Model: User Guide', aimed to\u000a        provide concrete guidance to policy makers and stakeholders on how to\u000a        pragmatically rethink intervention planning. In applying the ISM\u000a        approach set out in the SG report, Evans co-wrote the toolkit with ADRA,\u000a        and \"Southerton and colleagues then reviewed this draft Technical\u000a          Guide.\" As ADRA recognised throughout: \"ISM provides a way of\u000a          thinking and talking about behaviour and practices which policy makers\u000a          find instantly easy to grasp, and yet which goes on to challenge the\u000a          common assumptions of their profession (e.g. that information and\u000a          incentives are sufficient for lasting change)\" [5].\u000a      \u000aFurther afield: It is notable that the reach of the ISM\u000a        approach is increasing. In June 2012 an enquiry was made to the Scottish\u000a        Government from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to discuss the SG Report,\u000a        with officials meeting to discuss the toolkit [2]. Additionally, the\u000a        work has been utilised: by ADRA on a project tackling obesity for the UK\u000a        Department for Health \"... used as an explanatory device, to analyse\u000a          the elements of effective interventions, but also to organise the\u000a          complex evidence on the determinants of obesity. Armed with the\u000a          observation that most of the factors influencing weight among young\u000a          people fall into the `Social' context, DH are now working up ideas for\u000a          pilot interventions, as part of the Change4Life campaign\" [5]. The\u000a        European Commission `Science for Environmental Policy Future Brief' has\u000a        employed the SG Report to summarise key approaches to behaviour change,\u000a        borrowing key recommendations for its `policy implications' section [7].\u000a        Finally, the work has been cited: in a World Economic Forum report; in\u000a        Australia, and by the Queensland Department of Transport [8].\u000a    \u000a    Expert advice: As suggested by the engagement with NICE,\u000a      summarised at the outset, UoM researchers have purposely sought additional\u000a      avenues for the ISM approach, taking up expert advisory roles when\u000a      appropriate, and consistently seeking to influence the framing and\u000a      development of future policy and research strategy. Excluding\u000a      general advice or consultancy roles, the following engagements foreground\u000a      the application of research findings and the `practices' approach'\u000a      developed by the researchers:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aWarde: member of the 2008 European Environment Agency panel\u000a        advising on sustainable consumption and behaviour change; appointed to\u000a        the International Scientific Committee for the Institut National de\u000a          la Recherche Agronomique (INRA) instructing on food research\u000a        strategy in France.\u000a      \u000aEvans: ongoing role with the Waste and Resources Action\u000a        Programme (WRAP), where he \"advised on the implications of `social\u000a          practices'... and thinking about possible interventions for waste\u000a          reduction.

Part of the `practice turn' in social theory\u000a      [C], the research has significantly influenced the study of consumption,\u000a      shifting attention to how the usage of goods and services is embedded\u000a      within, and constitutive of, the changing dynamics of daily life. Key\u000a      findings include:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aHabits and routines undermine the extent to which consumers' have\u000a          free choice.\u000a        Challenging notions of the `sovereign consumer', the research suggests\u000a        that consumer choice is constrained by socio-cultural factors, with the\u000a        act of selecting goods or services just one, relatively marginal, aspect\u000a        of wider processes of consumption. [C][D]\u000a      \u000aResearchers should renew focus on the ordinary and mundane, as\u000a          opposed to `conspicuous', forms of consumption. The research\u000a        reveals that processes of `normalization', which create and hold stable\u000a        routines and habits, lock social groups into environmentally problematic\u000a        everyday practices. [A][D]\u000a      \u000aThe manner by which different social groups consume &#8212; and what they\u000a          consume &#8212; is closely connected to temporal organisation: to the\u000a          schedules of everyday life.\u000a        Accordingly, a key mechanism for understanding &#8212; and changing &#8212;\u000a        consumption behaviour rests in the scheduling and coordination of\u000a        practices (as in, for example, changing the scheduling of recycling\u000a        kerbside collections relative to other household rubbish to establish\u000a        kerbside recycling as 'everyday' behaviour). [A][E]\u000a      \u000aA focus on `practices' presents a more progressive approach to\u000a          tackling problematic trajectories of consumption. Standing in\u000a        opposition to `portfolio models' of action (which dominate economics and\u000a        psychology), the research has reshaped understandings in the field by\u000a        arguing that radical shifts in behaviour cannot be achieved by\u000a        concentrating attention solely on the attitudes and choices of\u000a        individuals, but must rather take fuller account of the material,\u000a        cultural and temporal factors that shape patterns of everyday life.\u000a        [A][B]\u000a    \u000a    Taken together, the social practices framework that emerges\u000a      represents a fundamental challenge to orthodox theories within the fields\u000a      of sustainable consumption and behaviour change. Policies geared towards\u000a      attitude change have had limited success in changing actual behaviour. By\u000a      affording a more nuanced understanding of ordinary consumption, the social\u000a      practices approach provides the basis for targeted interventions in\u000a      specific policy areas, permitting the research to be translated into\u000a      tailored expert advice. These impacts are illustrated most vividly through\u000a      the widespread policy adoption of what has come to be known as the ISM\u000a      (Individual, Social, Material) model for understanding behaviour change,\u000a      first developed in [B].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28163","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    1. The key impact of this body of research is the reduction of likelihood\u000a        of personal information disclosures from research data. The immediate\u000a        beneficiaries are national and international data stewardship\u000a        organisations (DSOs), who have responsibility for disseminating data\u000a      whilst at the same time maintaining confidentiality. The reach of this\u000a      impact has increased in recent years from national statistical agencies\u000a      (UK and overseas) to include government departments &#8212; such as the\u000a      Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and the Department for Communities\u000a      and Local Government (DCLG) who are under increasing pressure to release\u000a      administrative data as part of a wider `open data' agenda.\u000a    Impact has been delivered through collaborative research partnerships\u000a        with practitioners and professional services in data stewardship.\u000a      This research, consultancy and advisory work in relation to data\u000a      management and confidentiality has helped to shape professional best\u000a      practice in the field. The body of work described here is impact-embedded\u000a      research. An example of this is [B], which describes an algorithm\u000a      developed whilst analysing the risk inherent in the Neighbourhood\u000a      Statistics &#8212; work carried out for ONS several years earlier. Overall,\u000a      impact has been delivered through a variety of pathways:    \u000a      Impact through DSOs adopting methods into their practice. The\u000a        Canadian firm Privacy Analytics Inc. has utilised [D]: \"as part of\u000a          the general heuristic for re-identification risk assessment in our\u000a          software, [with Elliot's] work on scenarios of attack (1999)\u000a          and SAR data (2001, 2007) helping shape the methodology that is being\u000a          used by the company. Privacy Analytics, Inc.'s solutions have been\u000a          leveraged by approximately 70 organizations in the US and Canada to\u000a          control their disclosure risk, including: the American Society of\u000a          Clinical Oncology, Heritage Provider Network, Icahn School of Medicine\u000a          at Mount Sinai, Department of Preventative Medicine, State of\u000a          Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, Alberta Healthcare,\u000a          Cancer Care Ontario, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, College\u000a          of Family Physicians of Canada, Public Health Agency of Canada, TELUS\u000a          Health, and Vancouver Costal Health\" [1]. Likewise, after reading\u000a        articles and presentations of the research at meetings, the Australian\u000a        Bureau of Statistics noted that: \"Your work helped shape ABS's\u000a          current thinking on confidentiality protection for microdata...\u000a        [and has] assisted the ABS to produce high quality statistics while\u000a          maintaining provider trust\" [2]. Specifically on [D]: Statistics\u000a        Canada say: \"The Skinner-Elliot measure, adapted for survey weights\u000a          by Skinner &amp; Carter, is often used by our surveys to provide an\u000a          indication of the risk inherent in certain combinations of their\u000a          variables. The measure has been incorporated in our in-house\u000a          disclosure risk generalized program\" [3].\u000a      On documents [C] and [E] ONS say: \"Previous work carried out by Dr\u000a          Elliot continues to have an impact on the way we conduct our\u000a          assessment of risk at ONS [and] ONS occasionally use the\u000a          Skinner and Elliot (2002) metric to assess microdata releases which\u000a          come to us for approval via our Microdata Release Panel and in\u000a          particular a significant contribution consistently used is Dr Elliot's\u000a          concept of special uniqueness involving the identification of uniques\u000a          that stand out regardless of geography. Many of his research ideas\u000a          have been fundamental in informing GSS Disclosure Control Policy for\u000a          Social Survey Microdata\" [4]. Further afield, the US Census Bureau\u000a        contends that the research has \"had a significant impact on the way\u000a          in which disclosure control is carried out in our organisation\",\u000a        and that they have adopted the concept of special uniques in their\u000a        reidentification studies which: \"has helped us to identify public use\u000a          microdata records that are at risk of disclosure. We are then able to\u000a          slightly distort those records so that we can release them while\u000a          preserving the statistical properties of the data\" [5].\u000a      2. Based on the principles developed in [A] and [E], Elliot set up the\u000a          Data Environment Analysis Service (DEAS) with funding from ONS, to\u000a        guide the specifications of the 2011 Census outputs. This informed ONS's\u000a        own disclosure risk analyses and policy, with their Head of Statistical\u000a        Disclosure confirming that it: \"greatly assisted ONS in performing\u000a          day-to-day disclosure risk assessments of our microdata and knowing\u000a          under what conditions they should be released. It also informed the\u000a          specification of the Sample of Anonymised Records (microdata from the\u000a          2011 Census)\" [4].\u000a      3. The provision of consultancy reports to DSOs, evaluating the\u000a          disclosure risks from specific datasets (to be disseminated) or\u000a          analysing the risk impact of particular policy decisions.\u000a        Commissioned on the basis of the expertise and track record of Dr Elliot\u000a        and his team, these evaluations (`Report on the Disclosure Risk\u000a        associated with Fire and Rescue Incident Datasets', `Report on the\u000a        Disclosure Risk associated with Supporting People Datasets', `Disclosure\u000a        Risk Audit of the Smart Steps Data Service') directly apply the research\u000a        reported above. For example, the report to Telefonica\u000a        (`Disclosure Risk Audit of the Smart Steps Data Service') highlighted\u000a        the potential risks of providing information at multiple units of\u000a        geography, and the need to suppress small counts in remote areas to\u000a        ensure individuals cannot be identified through reverse engineering [6].\u000a        These reports have enabled DSOs to make better decisions about the data\u000a        in question, resulting in safe and usable data. For example, DCLG\u000a        confirms that: \"[the] work showed that the database which I provided\u000a          was far from anonymised in practice\" and in turn this:\u000a          \"...showed that we needed to proceed with access to the database in a\u000a          secure setting and\/or under data access conditions\" [7].\u000a        Similarly, ONS note that: \"The outcome of [`EUL to OGD: A Risk\u000a        Analysis'] will have significant implications on the way ONS will\u000a          provide data to its customers in the future, and helps ONS to meet\u000a          government strategic aims in proactively supporting the Open Data\u000a          Agenda\" [4].\u000a      4. The provision of dedicated SUDA software to DSOs to help them\u000a        carry out of their own disclosure risk analyses [8]. Several DSOs, such\u000a        as the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Singapore Department of\u000a        Statistics, have incorporated the software into their data dissemination\u000a        practice. For example, the Australian Bureau of Statistics confirms\u000a        that: \"Since 2007 SUDA has been a part of the standard assessment\u000a          process for all CURFS [Confidentialised Unit Record Files]\u000a          released by the ABS. In particular SUDA is used to help identify risky\u000a          records. Generally, as a result of the SUDA analysis, a number of\u000a          records on each CURF are given additional confidentiality treatment to\u000a          mitigate the identification risk\" [2].\u000a      5. The provision of certificated safe researcher training\u000a        delivered via the Administrative Data Liaison Service (ADLS), a service\u000a        set up to support research using administrative data (www.adls.ac.uk).\u000a        The primary goal of the training is to educate participants in dealing\u000a        with data safely, and is attended by DSO staff as well as researchers.\u000a        The course is part of the Safe Researcher Training Programme and is\u000a        endorsed by major administrative data holding organisations in the UK\u000a        and the Information Commissioner's Office. By the end of 2013 this\u000a        course will have run 14 times, each attended by 20-50 participants. The\u000a        research is embedded throughout the course and is the basis of the most\u000a        important module of the course. The course is an approved method for\u000a          access to administrative data held by the Scottish government and NHS\u000a          Scotland.\u000a      6. The development of the UK Anonymisation Network (UKAN), set\u000a          up to establish best practice in anonymisation. Led by Elliot and\u000a        funded by the UK Information Commissioner, UKAN offers practical advice\u000a        and information to anyone who handles personal data and needs to share\u000a        it (www.ukanon.net). The network\u000a        provides a range of resources to private and public sector data holders\u000a        in the UK, including anonymisation clinics (where individual\u000a        DSOs attend to receive guidance on specific data anonymisation\u000a        problems), and a web site providing case studies of disclosure\u000a          control in practice, including several derived from UoM research.\u000a        In a joint press release, the UK Information Commissioner, said: \"The\u000a          work of UKAN will help build on the recommendations laid down in the\u000a          ICO's data protection code of practice on managing the risks related\u000a          to anonymisation which we published last year\" [9].\u000a    The information economy requires the free flow of data, but privacy\u000a      breaches lead to a breakdown of trust, respondent non-co-operation and DSO\u000a      over-cautiousness. Armed with the tools and methods developed from this\u000a      research, DSOs can proceed with greater confidence, and make more informed\u000a      data release decisions. As ONS state: \"The long-term impact of the\u000a        reports above and ongoing collaborative work with Dr Elliot has meant\u000a        that ONS can demonstrate a rigorous and considered approach to data\u000a        dissemination given a fuller understanding of the potential disclosure\u000a        risk. This helps ONS to achieve its vision to produce high quality\u000a        trusted statistics that meet user needs.\" [4] Similarly, the US\u000a      Census Bureau agrees that: \"The broader impact of this work is to help\u000a        ensure that we can disseminate high quality data products whilst\u000a        maintaining the confidentiality of respondents\" [5].\u000a    In sum, without this work delivery of the open data agenda would be\u000a      significantly hampered.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research at the University of Manchester (UoM) has developed new\u000a      approaches, methods and algorithms to improve the statistical\u000a      confidentiality practices of data stewardship organisations (DSOs), such\u000a      as the UK's Office for National Statistics.

The Manchester team also includes: Dr Kingsley Purdam (Research\u000a      Fellow, 2003-), Dr Elaine Mackey (Research Associate, 2010-), Dr Duncan\u000a      Smith (2003-2008, now Honorary Research Fellow), and Susan Lomax (Research\u000a      Assistant, 2006-2009).\u000a    `Statistical disclosure' occurs when, through statistical matching, a\u000a      population unit is identified within an anonymised dataset and\/or new\u000a      information about them is revealed. This compromises the privacy of the\u000a      individuals within the data, breaks data protection legislation and\u000a      results in reputational and other damage for those responsible for the\u000a      data. Statistical Disclosure Control (SDC) concerns the prevention of such\u000a      events. Research at UoM has helped to remodel the way that disclosure\u000a        risk analysis is carried out, delivering innovations in both statistical\u000a        methods, and in the whole framing of the problem.\u000a    The distinctive nature of the research contribution flows from the\u000a      insight that the SDC field was data-centric (focusing on the\u000a      statistical properties of the data to be disseminated) when it needed to\u000a      be intruder-centric, focusing on the means, motives and\u000a      opportunities (MMO) of individuals or organisations who might wish to\u000a      attack the data. This led to a body of work developing the notion of\u000a      scenario analysis [E]. By creating pragmatically based MMO\u000a      models for any given dataset it is possible to look at what the intruder\u000a      would be trying to achieve, and then generate metrics which measure the\u000a      risk of them achieving it. This framework is now widely regarded by\u000a      DSOs as an important part of disclosure risk assessment. This\u000a      scenario-based framework led in turn to significant methodological\u000a        innovations:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aDevelopment of the Data Intrusion Simulation (DIS) measure of risk\u000a          for microdata [D] and of SUIM (the Special Unique\u000a          Identification Method) [C]. The two metrics were embodied in\u000a          software called SUDA, developed in collaboration with colleagues\u000a        in computer science, with EPSRC funding. The software has been adapted\u000a        for use by several statistical agencies in the UK, the US, Australia,\u000a        New Zealand and Singapore, in determining outputs from census and\u000a        surveys.\u000a      Parallel to this, the research has extended the notion of scenario\u000a          analysis [E]. This extended framework proposes that disclosure\u000a        risk arises from the relationship between the data and its environment\u000a        (taking into account the additional, external information that might be\u000a        available to a would-be intruder), raising the issue of how to\u000a        capture\/measure the environmental facet of the risk. This led to the\u000a          framework of Data Environment Analysis (DEA), a set of methods for\u000a        measuring the environmental aspects of the risk including `key variable\u000a        mapping' [A]. Until this work, assessment of disclosure risk was only\u000a        measuring one side of the problem. The new framework now enables these\u000a        additional risks to be formally principled. On the basis of this work,\u000a        the Office for National Statistics (ONS) commissioned and funded the\u000a        Data Environment Analysis Service, (DEAS, 2008-2012 at UoM), to guide\u000a        the specifications of the 2011 Census outputs (2012 Annual Report,\u000a        available upon request).\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28164","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a      Pathways: Taken together, the impacts documented below have\u000d\u000a        developed with respect to UoM's\u000d\u000a        reputation as a centre of research excellence in the area of class and\u000d\u000a        cultural participation,\u000d\u000a        resulting in a series of collaborative research relationships and\u000d\u000a        consultancies with stakeholders.\u000d\u000a        There are three main sets of engagement:\u000d\u000a      \u000d\u000a        A cooperative partnership with the BBC, framed both to\u000d\u000a          challenge and extend public\u000d\u000a          understandings of `class' (and of how class inequalities work), as\u000d\u000a          well as to augment the\u000d\u000a          corporation's public service remit.\u000d\u000a        A reworking of class measurement within mainstream market\u000d\u000a            research.\u000d\u000a        A range of engagements with governmental and third sector bodies,\u000d\u000a          developing and refining\u000d\u000a          organisational, public and policy understandings of how class\u000d\u000a          inequalities are bound up with\u000d\u000a          cultural participation.\u000d\u000a      \u000d\u000a      As one collaborator observes: \"CRESC's work has been responsible\u000d\u000a          for the widespread\u000d\u000a          deployment of a more sophisticated approach to evidence-based policy\u000d\u000a          in the cultural sector\" [1].\u000d\u000a        The CRESC approach is able to unpack the ways in which survey methods\u000d\u000a        construct particular\u000d\u000a        and limited understandings of `class' and `participation', with the\u000d\u000a        partnerships outlined below each\u000d\u000a        utilising the conceptual innovation and methodological strengths of the\u000d\u000a        CCA approach.\u000d\u000a      1: The BBC and Public Sociology: CRESC's work on culture and\u000d\u000a        stratification led to a public\u000d\u000a        sociology partnership with the BBC in the `Great British Class Survey'.\u000d\u000a        Its success resulted in an\u000d\u000a        unprecedented public interest in class and inequality, and has had a\u000d\u000a        major impact on the BBC's\u000d\u000a        public engagement and network data journalism work.

He concludes that:\u000d\u000a        \"The research was of particular interest to the BBC, because it\u000d\u000a          allowed the BBC audience to reflect\u000d\u000a          on their own position in the new seven part class system and think\u000d\u000a          about the way class has\u000d\u000a          changed since the industrial revolution and the social changes of\u000d\u000a          post-war Britain...

A large proportion of\u000d\u000a        these 6.9 million visits were to\u000d\u000a        the `Great British Class Calculator', an interactive web device drawing\u000d\u000a        on the GBCS which allowed\u000d\u000a        users to find out to which of the new social classes they were most\u000d\u000a        closely matched. The research\u000d\u000a        also featured prominently on frontline TV and radio programmes\u000d\u000a        (28 outlets in total) ranging from\u000d\u000a        Radio 4's `Today' programme to `The One Show' on BBC 1. The story was\u000d\u000a        also taken up across\u000d\u000a        the national and regional print media (36 titles on 3rd\u000d\u000a        April alone), as well as internationally &#8212; it was\u000d\u000a        the most emailed New York Times `World News' story of the year. As the\u000d\u000a        BBC GBCS producer\u000d\u000a        recognises: \"Occurring at a time of increasing concern about the\u000d\u000a          intensifying effects of the recent\u000d\u000a          economic crisis on social cohesion, the GBCS has encouraged a more\u000d\u000a          nuanced discussion around\u000d\u000a          the themes of class and mobility... the GBCS presents numerous\u000d\u000a          prospects for future\u000d\u000a          collaboration, and this collaboration has also represented excellent\u000d\u000a          value for the licence-fee payer\" [2].\u000d\u000a      The resulting public discussion continues in print and on social media,\u000d\u000a        including a special edition of\u000d\u000a        Radio 4's `Thinking Allowed' (1st May 2013). The research\u000d\u000a        team have also been approached by\u000d\u000a        groups, such as The Hindu Association, wanting to find out more about\u000d\u000a        specific aspects of the new\u000d\u000a        class model. Indeed, in the wake of publicity garnered, an additional\u000d\u000a        200,000 individuals have\u000d\u000a        completed the online survey, more than doubling the sample size to\u000d\u000a        366,000. Moreover, the GBCS\u000d\u000a        promises a new form of `public sociology', and \"has helped to\u000d\u000a          revitalise the BBC's web science\u000d\u000a          presence...

In 2013, as a result of the GBCS collaboration\u000d\u000a        with CRESC, the BBC won the\u000d\u000a        Global Editor's Network International Data Journalism Award, for\u000d\u000a        their work on the interactive\u000d\u000a        `Great British Class Calculator, with the award recognising `outstanding\u000d\u000a        work and editorial\u000d\u000a        excellence in the field of data journalism' [7].\u000d\u000a      2: Re-orienting Market Research: CRESC's cultural class\u000d\u000a        analysis approach, including insights\u000d\u000a        gained from the GBCS, has been applied to endorse a reworking of class\u000d\u000a        measurement in market\u000d\u000a        research. Though repeatedly discredited by sociologists, since the 1940s\u000d\u000a        market researchers have\u000d\u000a        used the social grades (A to E) as class proxies.

The evidence base generated has shaped the\u000a      practices of prominent\u000a      race equality NGOs, in campaigns promoting alternative frameworks for\u000a      understanding race,\u000a      segregation and migration &#8212; challenging the public concern with ethnic\u000a      integration, and redirecting\u000a      focus to the problem of ethnic inequality. At a more detailed level, local\u000a      authorities are, adopting\u000a      Finney and colleagues' methods for population estimation as they monitor\u000a      and plan for population\u000a      change.\u000a    (1) `Myth busting' in public understandings of segregation: The\u000a      book that showcases this\u000a      research [D] was deliberately titled `Sleepwalking to Segregation' after a\u000a      speech by the (then)\u000a      Commission for Racial Equality Chief Executive, Trevor Phillips. Crafted\u000a      purposefully to target, as\u000a      its key audience, individuals and organisations politically involved in\u000a      race and diversity issues, the\u000a      book directly examines (and rebuts) common myths about race and\u000a        migration (e.g. `Britain\u000a      takes too many immigrants', `Minorities do not want to integrate',\u000a      `Minority White Cities'). Firstly, by\u000a      providing an evidence-based challenge to common myths about segregation\u000a      (including a `quick\u000a      reference summary' of myths and counter-arguments), the book was designed\u000a      to open up a space\u000a      for public debate and to provide an effective tool in campaigns promoting\u000a      alternative\u000a      understandings of race, segregation and migration. Secondly, the\u000a      book provoked considerable\u000a      media and public interest on publication, including coverage in the\u000a      international, national, local and\u000a      community press; including BBC regional TV and radio, Channel 4 TV and\u000a      online. The work also\u000a      received coverage in magazine and popular journal articles, and in online\u000a      commentary with public\u000a      and policy audiences, including: Geography, for Geography\u000a      teachers; Significance (Royal\u000a      Statistical Society); and the Institute for Race Relations website [1].\u000a    (2) Informing political debate and shaping government policy: In\u000a      the national policy context\u000a      the work has been presented to a House of Commons Select Committee, during\u000a      the current\u000a      Parliament, by Jon Cruddas MP who used `Sleepwalking to\u000a      Segregation...' to illustrate the paucity\u000a      of evidence for problems of segregation, and to suggest that policy\u000a      efforts be better directed to\u000a      social concerns such as deprivation. He notes that he used the book's \"robust\u000a        and accessible\"\u000a      arguments in Committee to \"highlight the dangers of political debate\u000a        ignoring evidence in favour of\u000a        popular opinion\", and subsequent to his appointment to the Shadow\u000a      Cabinet as Labour's Policy\u000a      Coordinator (15th May 2012), notes that he has employed the\u000a      research in order to address his\u000a      `current concerns' around child poverty and `family wellbeing', within the\u000a      Labour Party's Policy\u000a      Review, recognising that the book: \"illustrates the presence of ongoing\u000a        disadvantage for minorities\u000a        in Britain and demonstrates how myths about race and segregation\u000a        stigmatise communities, which\u000a        in turn exacerbates overall inequality...Your work showed me that,\u000a        despite popular rhetoric that\u000a        situates ethnic diversity as the cause of social problems, the\u000a        evidence...demonstrates the reality of\u000a        ethnic integration. These are particularly important insights, as in my\u000a        view they demonstrate that\u000a        our attention in Parliament is better focused on poverty and social\u000a        inequalities.\" He adds that he\u000a      also uses the book as a \"resource in responding to local constituents\u000a        and organisations who are\u000a        concerned about increasing ethnic diversity...to challenge inaccuracies\u000a        in commonly held views\u000a        about migration and ethnic integration\" [2].\u000a    Andrew Stunell MP confirms that the book provides \"an\u000a        accessible, useful and robust summary of\u000a        evidence about race and local population change. In May 2010 I was\u000a        appointed as Parliamentary\u000a        Under Secretary of State at the Department of Communities and Local\u000a        Government... one of my\u000a        specific responsibilities... was developing the Government's approach to\u000a        integration and social\u000a        cohesion, leading [to] the publication of the DCLG report\u000a        `Creating the Conditions for Integration'.\u000a        This has underpinned Government policy-making and funding programmes in\u000a        social cohesion\u000a        since. It is right to record that Dr Finney's book provided a valuable\u000a        resource during that process...\u000a      [subsequently] the Deputy Prime Minister has asked me to lead a working\u000a        Party developing\u000a        proposals on Social Cohesion, Integration and Migration for our 2013\u000a        programme for government.\u000a        Once again it has been invaluable to have the facts and perspectives of\u000a        Dr Finney's work available\u000a        to inform my thinking,\" further stating that the book provides \"an\u000a        essential counter to the heated\u000a        rhetoric on these topics that characterises current race debates\"\u000a      [3].\u000a    (3) Shaping the practice of prominent race equality NGOs in campaigns\u000a        promoting\u000a        alternative frameworks for understanding race, segregation and migration:\u000a      Groups working\u000a      on race relations and race equality have benefited from the work's\u000a      prominent evidence-based\u000a      intervention, as the basis for campaigns to challenge and redirect public\u000a      and policy debate. The\u000a        Runnymede Trust has used the work as evidence in their recent\u000a      campaigns for a need to\u000a      (re)focus policy debate and practice on ethnic inequality and\u000a      discrimination rather than residential\u000a      segregation. Runnymede's Director comments that \"Having your evidence\u000a        to hand has allowed us\u000a        to challenge assumptions about trends in neighbourhood population\u000a        change, such as about `White\u000a        flight'\", noting the work has \"directly helped the cases we have\u000a        put to high level political circles\u000a        about appropriate policies for community cohesion and ethnic equality.\u000a        Your research has become\u000a        increasingly important in countering policy approaches which seek to\u000a        privilege `integration' over\u000a        equality... provided essential evidence, in accessible formats, for our\u000a        campaigns to shift political\u000a        and public debate from concern with segregation and self-segregation to\u000a        more pressing issues of\u000a        ethnic equality. Your work has made a central contribution to high\u000a        profile debate around ethnic\u000a        segregation and opened up the opportunity for us to stimulate further\u000a        debate on Runnymede's\u000a        priorities\". The work has also been directly used as evidence in\u000a      Runnymede reports [4].\u000a    The North of England Refugee Service (NERS) has used the work's\u000a      demonstration of how\u000a      myths about race and migration gain currency in its ongoing campaign to\u000a      challenge negative and\u000a      inaccurate media reporting of migrant populations. Their use of the\u000a      research as \"evidence to\u000a        challenge myths of race and migration\" has been \"directly useful\u000a        for NERS to provide accurate and\u000a        balanced information about migration. The evidence provided by your work\u000a        has helped us to\u000a        challenge mis-reporting of asylum and refugee issues. The intervention\u000a        of your work in race\u000a        debates has provided a hook for our longstanding campaign to generate\u000a        new thinking on asylum\u000a        and raise the level of public debate\". NERS has employed \"the\u000a        statistics and evidence in your\u000a        book... in awareness-raising talks across the North East... [and] in\u000a        multiagency meetings of\u000a        migrant and asylum\/refugee service providers from government, private,\u000a        voluntary sectors in the\u000a      North East to emphasise the broad processes of minority integration and\u000a        mixing. I also ensured\u000a        that key members of staff at NERS had copies of the mythbusters section\u000a        of your book so they\u000a        could equip themselves with the facts about population change and ethnic\u000a        integration in Britain\" [5].\u000a    (4) Assisting local authorities to assess the drivers of population\u000a        change. Findings on the\u000a      drivers of local population change and ethnic diversity were drawn upon by\u000a      Salford City Council\u000a      in the development of strategies for the management of neighbourhoods with\u000a      high population\u000a      turnover. Their Equalities Officer confirms that they \"have...\u000a        incorporated learning from publications\u000a        such as 'Sleepwalking to Segregation'? into our consideration of\u000a        community cohesion at the local\u000a        level\" [6]. Several local authorities, including Manchester,\u000a        Glasgow, Bradford, Rochdale,\u000a        Oldham and the Greater London Authority (GLA) have received invited\u000a        presentations on the\u000a        innovative demographic methods devised by this project,\u000a      incorporating them into the\u000a      monitoring and reporting procedures for population estimation which inform\u000a      local service planning\u000a      for diverse communities. For instance, an Intelligence Analyst at Manchester\u000a        City Council (MCC)\u000a      comments that \"Your evidence about decreasing residential ethnic\u000a        segregation and dispersal of\u000a        minorities from settlement areas has informed us and helped to\u000a        anticipate local population changes\u000a        and thus contributed to the development of our strategies for addressing\u000a        ethnic equality and\u000a        managing local population change' and has provided \"information\u000a        about local population change\u000a        that we did not previously have and that is not available elsewhere...\u000a        The Census 2011 Briefings\u000a        on Dynamics of Diversity and the accompanying local Area Profilers are\u000a        an invaluable resource,\u000a        summarising the recently released Census data on ethnicity for local\u000a        areas. The availability of\u000a        these expert analyses to local government is particularly welcome at a\u000a        time when research\u000a        capacity in local government is reduced\" [7]. Similarly, a Senior\u000a      Analyst working at the Greater\u000a        London Authority Intelligence Unit, comments that: \"Your analyses\u000a        of national patterns and\u000a        trends in ethnicity and migration have provided important contextual\u000a        understanding for our work\u000a        locally\" and provided evidence about residential ethnic segregation\u000a      and dispersal of minorities\u000a      which has \"helped to corroborate our own studies into ethnic diversity\u000a        and support policy making\"\u000a      [8].\u000a    (5) Ongoing Impact: Finney and colleagues are now recognised as\u000a      expert commentators on\u000a      issues of race, segregation and diversity. This was evident when the 2011\u000a      Census data on\u000a      ethnicity was released in December 2012, with early analysis published by\u000a      CoDE. As an ESRC\u000a      Centre, CoDE is anticipated to have substantial ongoing impact over the\u000a      coming years, with an\u000a      impact strategy that includes: media work (including around politically\u000a      salient issues, such as\u000a      `white-flight'); partnerships with non-academic organisations (including\u000a      Runnymede); Cumberland\u000a      Lodge seminars with politicians and policy makers; and involvement in\u000a      political party conferences,\u000a      etcetera. Finney has taken a prominent role in the CoDE Census\u000a      Briefings (part funded by the\u000a      Joseph Rowntree Foundation) that have established CoDE as a voice of\u000a      authority on matters of\u000a      Census analysis, ethnicity and inequality. Some recent examples of\u000a      engagement include Finney\u000a      being invited to provide expert commentary by a number of media outlets\u000a      including regional radio\u000a      (BBC and independent) and national television (Channel 4 News), alongside\u000a      speeches at policy\u000a      seminars, such as by Just West Yorkshire (February 2013).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Work undertaken at the University of Manchester (UoM) has provoked\u000a      debate, and challenged\u000a      established lines of thought, by `myth busting' current claims about\u000a      racial diversity and segregation &#8212; such as\u000a      `Britain is becoming a country of ghettos' &#8212; which have hitherto dominated\u000a      public and\u000a      policy debate.

Taken together, these projects address questions of ethnic\u000a      segregation and local ethnic\u000a      group population change, recognising that policy debate has been largely\u000a      reactive to events, such\u000a      as `race riots' or the rise of far right politics, rather than informed by\u000a      evidence. This research\u000a      programme is distinctive in two key ways:\u000a    (1) It focuses on the processes (not solely the\u000a        outcomes) of population change in local\u000a        areas, developing innovative methods for estimating neighbourhood ethnic\u000a        group\u000a        population change. Adding an important new dimension to CCSR work on\u000a      demography, the\u000a      research [A-E] developed techniques for calculating population change in\u000a      small areas in terms of\u000a      age, sex and ethnic group, and has advanced theoretical perspectives\u000a        in segregation studies\u000a      by drawing on theories of social demographic change, life course and\u000a      migration. This has shifted\u000a      the methodological focus of the field from measures of residential\u000a      segregation (and circular\u000a      debates around appropriateness) to the development of estimation\u000a      techniques, the production of\u000a      local population change estimates for ethnic groups, and towards an\u000a      emphasis on understanding\u000a      the drivers and processes (not just the outcomes) of population change.\u000a    (2) It directly targets and critically challenges claims about\u000a        segregation and diversity\u000a        commonly made in policy and public debate, such as `Britain is\u000a      becoming a country of ghettos'\u000a      or `Minorities don't want to integrate'. Outputs are intentionally\u000a      designed to be accessible to non-\u000a      academic audiences whilst retaining academic rigour. This strategy &#8212; to\u000a      produce accessible\u000a      evidence-based outputs that directly examine key concerns within popular\u000a      race debates &#8212; constitutes\u000a      a significant intervention, providing a hook for both Government and NGOs\u000a      to engage\u000a      in and promote alternative understandings of race, segregation and\u000a      diversity [D].\u000a    Key ideas that this work's intervention in race debates have\u000a      helped gain currency are that:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aMany common assumptions about race, migration and segregation are\u000a          myths. For\u000a        example, that neighbourhood population change is driven by `white\u000a        flight', or that racial\u000a        segregation is increasing. [D]\u000a      \u000aNatural change (the difference between births and deaths) is the\u000a          main driver of local\u000a          population change for many areas and ethnic groups. Processes of\u000a        family building and\u000a        ageing bring about changes in ethnic residential segregation, regardless\u000a        of migration. [C][D]\u000a      \u000aGeographies of migration within Britain indicate the same processes\u000a          (dispersal and\u000a          counter-urbanisation) across ethnic groups. These migration\u000a        patterns are leading to greater\u000a        residential ethnic mixing. [A][D]\u000a      \u000aThere are ethnic differences in levels of residential mobility even\u000a          when individual\u000a          demographic and socio-economic characteristics are accounted for.\u000a        This may reflect\u000a        different expectations and aspirations across ethnic groups, as well as\u000a        different opportunities\u000a        and constraints. If some groups are more constrained in residential\u000a        mobility than others, this\u000a        can impact on employment or education, exacerbating ethnic inequalities.\u000a        [A][B][E]\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32060","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1168579","Name":"Pakistan"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Director of BBC World Service stated: `The research that Professor\u000a      Gillespie and her team\u000a      have conducted over the last 6-7 years has made an extremely valuable\u000a      contribution to our internal\u000a      policy debates at BBC World Service on strategy and editorial matters.'\u000a    Since 2007 this team has created an enduring partnership with the BBCWS.\u000a      Findings have been\u000a      presented at over 20 workshops at the BBCWS and at an ongoing OU\/BBCWS\u000a      joint lunchtime\u000a      seminar series (seven to date). Up to 30 BBCWS staff at all levels and\u000a      across sections, as well as\u000a      FCO officials, have come to debate our findings and gone on to translate\u000a      them into policy, practice\u000a      and programming decisions. Collaborations with the FCO led to Gillespie\u000a      and Webb submitting\u000a      evidence to the BBC Trust, the House of Commons Home Affairs Select\u000a      Committee, and the\u000a      House of Lords Committee on Soft Power (Section 5: 4).\u000a    It is in geopolitically strategic services &#8212; BBC Arabic and Urdu\u000a      &#8212; that our impact has been most\u000a      direct, by enabling the BBCWS to reconceive its audiences as global\u000a      diasporas.\u000a    BBC Arabic Service: Our research on BBC Arabic audiences' use of\u000a      social media, presented at a\u000a      lunchtime seminar and in a report circulated among senior management\u000a      (Section 5: 3), directly\u000a      influenced BBC Arabic's strategic `Change Project' (2012). According to\u000a      the Change Project\u000a      Director: `Your recommendations highlighted the lack of a cohesive social\u000a      media policy across the\u000a      service as a major problem and provided strong, independent, robust\u000a      evidence that underpinned\u000a      my decision to set up three major work streams as part of the BBC Arabic\u000a      Change Project ... Your\u000a      research was integral to these very positive developments ... Your report\u000a      was very helpful indeed.'\u000a    Both the Change Project Director and the Head of Audiences stated that\u000a      our recommendations led\u000a      directly to:\u000a    (i) strategic change: management re-structuring and the creation\u000a      of social media and digital\u000a      editorial posts\u000a    (ii) editorial change: the flagship daily political talk show `Talking\u000a        Point' was re-scheduled to\u000a      accommodate diaspora audiences, and the `100 Women Season' created\u000a      to tackle perceived\u000a      under-representation of women\u000a    (iii) greater audience engagement: a 60% increase in unique users\u000a      at Arabic Online since\u000a      January 2013.\u000a    BBC Urdu Service: Gillespie's briefing paper for the FCO on\u000a      diaspora news consumption (Section\u000a      5: 4, 2007) contributed to a successful FCO bid for &#163;1 million funding\u000a      from HM Treasury for the\u000a      BBCWS to work with diasporas in the UK. The BBCWS then commissioned\u000a      Gillespie to research\u000a      media use by the UK Pakistani diaspora (Section 5:3, 2007). The BBCWS\u000a      Managing Editor of\u000a      Future Media stated the findings were: `really useful in providing\u000a      evidence about this audience but\u000a      also made us realise that we need to have a much more robust offer.' Our\u000a      research catalysed\u000a      strategic and editorial decisions at the BBCWS Urdu Service and the wider\u000a      BBC including:\u000a    (i) reduction of planned investment in online Urdu services for the\u000a      diaspora, since Urdu literacy is\u000a      limited;\u000a    (ii) commissioning of a BBC1 serial about UK Pakistanis (`Citizen Khan')\u000a      and the BBC's first Urdu\u000a      TV programme (`Sairbeen' news\/talkshow);\u000a    (iii) avoidance of association of `Pakistani' with `terrorist' in BBC\u000a      reporting.\u000a    Human resources: One of our reports to WS (Section 5:3, 2010)\u000a      identified career progression\u000a      concerns among staff in all the Language Services surveyed. The BBC's\u000a      Human Resources\u000a      Manager stated: `Since that period, we have been placing more emphasis on\u000a      strategic activities to\u000a      help address some of the issues that the report raised.' Our research\u000a      criticised `language silos' and\u000a      called for integration of multilingual BBCWS staff in working practices\u000a      across the BBC. This\u000a      informed decision-making during the BBCWS's move from Bush House to New\u000a      Broadcasting\u000a      House (2012).\u000a    Institutional memory and OU\/BBC Partnership: Gillespie organised\u000a      three witness seminars with\u000a      serving and former diasporic broadcasters from BBCWS Bush House, and led\u000a      collaborative\u000a      research on creative writers who work(ed) for the service. Findings were\u000a      published for non-academic\u000a      audiences in Wasafiri magazine (`Writers at Bush House', 2011) and\u000a      a commemorative\u000a      volume, Tales from Bush House (eds, Ismailov, Gillespie, Aslanyan,\u000a      2012). The impact of this\u000a      strand of research was that the BBC WS belatedly recognised its importance\u000a      as a historic site of\u000a      diasporic cultural creativity (Section 3: 4, 2010). BBCWS created a\u000a      writer-in-residence post (from\u000a      2010) and consulted Gillespie for the Radio 4 programme `World Service\u000a        Writers' (2012; audience\u000a      c. 2.5 million). Further, as part of the BBC's International Playwriting\u000a      Competition (IPC), the Georgi\u000a      Markov Prize was instituted at Gillespie's instigation, marking the BBC's\u000a      recognition of this eminent\u000a      BBCWS broadcaster and writer, and Gillespie co-commissioned, with the OU,\u000a      the BBC radio\u000a      broadcasting of the IPC's winning plays, further cementing the enduring\u000a      OU-BBCWS partnership.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Since 2007, Open University (OU) researchers have been examining the BBC\u000a      World Service\u000a      (BBCWS) from the perspectives of its diaspora broadcasters in London and\u000a      its diaspora audiences\u000a      worldwide. Multilingual migrants have always enabled the BBCWS to\u000a      broadcast in many\u000a      languages, creating a cultural bridge to global audiences. Increasingly,\u000a      BBCWS audiences\u000a      themselves are diasporic: living outside territorial `homelands'. The\u000a      research made the BBC aware\u000a      of its diasporas for the first time. By demonstrating their significance,\u000a      it led to changes in BBCWS\u000a      strategy, editorial practices, human resources management and\u000a      institutional memory.

He understood diasporas as fluid, dispersed migrant\u000a      formations, rather than\u000a      bounded groups with fixed ethnicities. The project team drew on this\u000a      research to develop an\u000a      approach that viewed diasporas as shaped and sustained by cultural and\u000a      media practices rather\u000a      than entirely by `race' and ethnicity.\u000a    In the aftermath of the Iraq War 2003, a time of intense suspicion about\u000a      the putative threat of\u000a      diasporic Muslims and media, Gillespie and her collaborators developed\u000a      innovative multilingual\u000a      methodologies (refined in subsequent projects) for researching diaspora\u000a      news cultures (Section 3:\u000a      E) (2004-07). Contrary to prevalent assumptions, British news media,\u000a      particularly the BBCWS,\u000a      proved to be a significant news source for diasporic groups. Afghans,\u000a      Somalis, Persians and Iraqis\u000a      were avid listeners of BBCWS radio and users of BBCWS online services. It\u000a      was hypothesised that\u000a      global diasporas connected by a common language and shared media habits\u000a      were forging\u000a      transnational ties around the BBCWS.\u000a    The `Tuning In' project (Section 3: 2 and 3: D) (2007-10) tested this\u000a      hypothesis. The research\u000a      involved OU researchers (Gillespie [PI], Toynbee and Woodward [Co-Is],\u000a      Andersson, Herbert, Hill,\u000a      Mackay and Webb), leading international scholars, and 25 multilingual\u000a      researchers. We\u000a      investigated diasporic broadcasters and audiences in relation to genres\u000a      (global sports, world\u000a      music, drama for development), political and religious movements (Section\u000a      3: 6), the politics of\u000a      translation, and new media (Section 3: 1). Outputs included six edited\u000a      volumes, eight special\u000a      issues of refereed journals, over 50 peer-reviewed papers, eight reports,\u000a      contributions to seven\u000a      BBC radio programmes, and over a dozen press articles (examples in\u000a      Sections 3 and 5).\u000a    Research with diaspora broadcasters evidenced their pivotal role in\u000a      mediating relations between\u000a      the UK government, the BBC and overseas audiences (e.g. Section 3: 4). Our\u000a      research opened up\u000a      new ways of conceiving and studying audiences (Section 3: 1-3, 5, 6). As\u000a      the Head of Audience\u000a      Research at BBCWS noted: `If at the start of the project the term\u000a      \"diaspora\" seemed obscure, used\u000a      mainly to reference expatriate communities, by the end it had become a\u000a      live and relevant concept\u000a      within BBCWS.' Re-analysing BBC data, we found that most users of a\u000a      majority of BBCWS online\u000a      services were located in diaspora, rather than in the regional target\u000a      markets designated by\u000a      BBCWS's funders, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO).\u000a    The challenges of these `digital diasporas' were further explored in an\u000a      Arts and Humanities\u000a      Research Council (AHRC) Public Policy Fellowship, which placed three\u000a      researchers managed by\u000a      Gillespie within the BBCWS (Section 3: A) (2011-12). They had full access\u000a      to production\u000a      processes and audience research data, and attended editorial and strategy\u000a      meetings &#8212; an\u000a      indication of the exceptional trust between Gillespie and the BBC.\u000a      Gillespie's team and the\u000a      BBCWS Audience Research Unit have jointly developed new methods for\u000a      studying online\u000a      behaviour (Section 3: 3). The AHRC has since funded a project extending\u000a      the work on the BBC's\u000a      diasporas to the British Council (Section 3: C) (2013-14).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32065","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    There are three domains in which Enacting Citizenship has made an impact:\u000d\u000a    (1) Giving EU-level activism greater influence: Activists and MEPs\u000d\u000a      are campaigning to protect\u000d\u000a      and expand civil, political and social rights made possible by European\u000d\u000a      citizenship.

Our research provides empirical evidence for this\u000d\u000a      broader definition. It also\u000d\u000a      shows how vulnerable groups have used European citizenship to access these\u000d\u000a      rights when they\u000d\u000a      are denied them by their governments and in doing so have strengthened the\u000d\u000a      EU as an institution.\u000d\u000a    This has had an impact on how citizenship is understood and invoked by\u000d\u000a      activist campaigns and\u000d\u000a      European commission policy makers during the European Year of Citizens\u000d\u000a      2013.

The\u000d\u000a      terminology used by the project\u000d\u000a      has been widely discussed, for instance as part of a 2012 Policy Review on\u000d\u000a      EU citizenship\u000d\u000a      published by the European Commission, and has sparked controversial\u000d\u000a      debates at conferences'.\u000d\u000a    The European Commission (17\/07\/13) news report stated that `Enacting\u000d\u000a      European Citizenship has\u000d\u000a      come to some highly original results based on using an innovative\u000d\u000a      methodology involving activists\u000d\u000a      and civil society directly in conducting the research, and not limiting\u000d\u000a      the research to \"traditional\"\u000d\u000a      forms of citizen participation, or actors who already consider themselves\u000d\u000a      to be \"European\" citizens.\u000d\u000a      European Alternatives has been involved in the research and thinks that it\u000d\u000a      reflects very well the\u000d\u000a      approaches that they have found productive and also the problems with\u000d\u000a      which they are faced daily\u000d\u000a      in their work promoting active European citizenship.

The issues addressed in\u000d\u000a      this area relate to the\u000d\u000a      development of European democracies, to the rights and obligations of\u000d\u000a      European citizens, and to\u000d\u000a      the shared values in a diverse union. The report argues that ENACT `...\u000d\u000a      shows how the actions of\u000d\u000a      groups and individuals on the margins of the European Union, just as much\u000d\u000a      as those of formal EU\u000d\u000a      institutions, have an impact on EU identity and its policies on\u000d\u000a      citizenship.' [p. 267].\u000d\u000a    Isin was invited onto the working group for the European Year Citizenship\u000d\u000a      Alliance (EYCA) to draft\u000d\u000a      a manifesto to be presented to the European Commission in 2013, enshrining\u000d\u000a      the principles of an\u000d\u000a      `active European citizenship.' Our role in this campaign stems from\u000d\u000a      ENACT's articulation of how\u000d\u000a      European citizenship is enacted. As the only academic partner in the\u000d\u000a      alliance, we provide an\u000d\u000a      intellectual framework for the ECYA and other organisations that use a\u000d\u000a      broad definition of\u000d\u000a      European Citizenship.\u000d\u000a    During EY2013 we held joint workshops hosted by Rui Taveres MEP at the\u000d\u000a      European Parliament\u000d\u000a      and at the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC), attended by over\u000d\u000a      40 delegates. Irini\u000d\u000a      Pari of the EESC stressed the importance of our research evidence for\u000d\u000a      furthering the social aims of\u000d\u000a      the European project, at a time when they are being marginalised by the\u000d\u000a      ongoing economic crisis.\u000d\u000a      This event was aimed at analysts (rather than senior figures) and sought\u000d\u000a      to directly inform policy\u000d\u000a      thinking on citizenship. Linda Ravo of the European Commission said of the\u000d\u000a      workshop that it\u000d\u000a      revealed `the importance of getting the European project closer to the\u000d\u000a      citizens'. It built on previous\u000d\u000a      policy workshops for ENACT in Brussels in 2010 and in Nijmegen in 2011.\u000d\u000a    (2) Enhancing intercultural understanding of citizenship through\u000d\u000a        workshops designed to\u000d\u000a        help non-academics in their work about citizenship. Directly through\u000d\u000a      workshops and interviews\u000d\u000a      and indirectly through published research, we inform public opinion about\u000d\u000a      the creative ways in\u000d\u000a      which people can be political and act as citizens in times of crisis.\u000d\u000a    Our articulation of citizenship informed Arabic language media coverage\u000d\u000a      of the unexpected and\u000d\u000a      inspiring activism produced by `the Arab Spring'. In a series of\u000d\u000a      programmes broadcast in February\u000d\u000a      2012, Russia Today's Arabic Service used our broader definition of\u000d\u000a      citizenship and the symposium\u000d\u000a      it inspired to inform their coverage of the impact of the Arab Spring.\u000d\u000a      Salwa AbdelTawab, the\u000d\u000a      journalist who proposed the reports, stated: `Any previous approach in the\u000d\u000a      media tackled the social\u000d\u000a      aspects of the protests in the Arab countries from a mere economic\u000d\u000a      perspective. The idea of a new\u000d\u000a      relationship between citizens and governments, new notions forming about\u000d\u000a      identities and rights\u000d\u000a      was new and gave more depth to the continuing discussion of the\u000d\u000a      developments in the region.'\u000d\u000a    In February 2012, Isin was invited to discuss enacting citizenship on Thinking\u000d\u000a        Allowed on BBC\u000d\u000a      Radio 4 and Nightwaves on BBC Radio 4.\u000d\u000a    (3) Inform public opinion by articulating a vocabulary through which\u000d\u000a        activists can\u000d\u000a        understand themselves as citizens. Impact is the starting point of\u000d\u000a      our research model: activists\u000d\u000a      and their needs are integrated into the entire research process. Appointed\u000d\u000a      as Canada Research\u000d\u000a      Chair in 2002, Isin founded the Citizenship Studies Media Lab (CSML) based\u000d\u000a      at York University.\u000d\u000a      This network of activists and researchers became a model for the three\u000d\u000a      projects based at the OU.\u000d\u000a      ENACT led activists, lawyers and researchers to co-produce Enacting\u000d\u000a        European Citizenship\u000d\u000a      (2013), the culmination of a series of research reports designed to help\u000d\u000a      policy makers understand\u000d\u000a      the work of activists as acts of citizenship. OECUMENE and ENACTMENTS have\u000d\u000a      spread this\u000d\u000a      methodology beyond the study of Europe and North America, and to a\u000d\u000a      self-sustaining and growing\u000d\u000a      community of activists and researchers. Working with activists and policy\u000d\u000a      makers was integral to\u000d\u000a      ENACT. For example, our team included a judge, an aid worker with the Red\u000d\u000a      Cross, and many\u000d\u000a      other activists. Through workshops with non-governmental organisations\u000d\u000a      (NGOs) in Riga and\u000d\u000a      Istanbul in 2010, we ensured that our findings on activism as citizenship\u000d\u000a      could be used to support\u000d\u000a      the work of the very activists we researched. OECUMENE has reinforced\u000d\u000a      these links by building up\u000d\u000a      a network of over 20 civil society activists and a further 400 members of\u000d\u000a      our website.\u000d\u000a    In February 2012, Net4Society used ENACT as a success story for Social\u000d\u000a      Science and Humanities\u000d\u000a      (SSH) funding by the European Union. Net4Society's article on ENACT's\u000d\u000a      impact observed: `Before\u000d\u000a      ENACT, any discussion of European citizenship was dominated by lawyers,\u000d\u000a      who naturally stressed\u000d\u000a      the legal aspect of citizenship. This has changed, thanks to the civil\u000d\u000a      society organisation \"European\u000d\u000a      Year of Citizens 2013 Alliance\", choosing as its slogan \"European\u000d\u000a      citizenship is more than rights!\"\u000d\u000a      The European Commission is now explicitly seeking new research projects to\u000d\u000a      investigate \"how\u000d\u000a      citizens claim and enact their rights\". This is recognition of ENACT's\u000d\u000a      role in supporting and marking\u000d\u000a      the importance of activism as an aspect of European citizenship.\u000d\u000a    Our research is contributing to a wider public discourse about activism\u000d\u000a      both online and via\u000d\u000a      broadcast media.

It comprises the\u000d\u000a      European Union Seventh\u000d\u000a      Framework Programme funded project Enacting European Citizenship\u000d\u000a        (ENACT), the European\u000d\u000a      Research Council funded project Citizenship After Orientalism\u000d\u000a        (OECUMENE), and the\u000d\u000a      ENACTMENTS Programme &#8212; all based in the Centre for Citizenship,\u000d\u000a      Identity and Governance.\u000d\u000a    Enacting citizenship investigates some of the most urgent questions\u000d\u000a      raised by the growing field of\u000d\u000a      citizenship studies in the past two decades. Citizenship has become one of\u000d\u000a      the most debated\u000d\u000a      issues in the social sciences and humanities. If the post-war social\u000d\u000a      sciences and humanities were\u000d\u000a      dominated by class, it is now becoming dominated by citizenship. As editor\u000d\u000a      of Citizenship Studies,\u000d\u000a      a leading peer-reviewed journal, Isin (Principal Investigator of ENACT and\u000d\u000a      OECUMENE) has been\u000d\u000a      at the forefront of the field.\u000d\u000a    Enacting citizenship defines citizenship as those acts of collective\u000d\u000a      activism that enable people to\u000d\u000a      perform citizenship, regardless of whether or not they hold the legal\u000d\u000a      status of members of a given\u000d\u000a      state. These performances produce claims to, and demands for, citizenship\u000d\u000a      and thus articulate\u000d\u000a      new rights as well as deepening the meaning of existing rights. The\u000d\u000a      research supplements the\u000d\u000a      received view of citizenship as membership of a polity such as a nation\u000d\u000a      state. ENACT developed\u000d\u000a      the idea of European citizenship as enacted by those who are marginalised\u000d\u000a      by the existing\u000d\u000a      citizenship regimes, such as Roma, Kurds, and Muslim women. OECUMENE\u000d\u000a      expanded the idea\u000d\u000a      outside Europe and began investigating how people claim the right to have\u000d\u000a      rights as citizens.\u000d\u000a      ENACTMENTS is investigating how people take up positions of `activist\u000d\u000a      citizenship' in streets and\u000d\u000a      squares in popular struggles.\u000d\u000a    Enacting citizenship explores how people around the world have developed\u000d\u000a      dynamic and effective\u000d\u000a      practices inside, outside and alongside the nation state [3.6]. These\u000d\u000a      include Kurds using the\u000d\u000a      European Court of Human Rights to make claims to Turkish citizenship;\u000d\u000a      lesbian and gay groups\u000d\u000a      challenging the Latvian regime of citizenship; sex workers struggling\u000d\u000a      against criminalisation; and\u000d\u000a      migrants claiming rights to citizenship. The methodological underpinning\u000d\u000a      of Enacting Citizenship is\u000d\u000a      a shift of the object of investigation from membership to acts, thereby\u000d\u000a      shifting attention from static\u000d\u000a      rules and norms to dynamic actions. So far, it has accomplished its aims\u000d\u000a      by three innovations:\u000d\u000a    (1) Theoretical innovations. Field research and the development of\u000d\u000a      theoretical tools to\u000d\u000a      understand the underlying idea of citizenship both as enacted and after\u000d\u000a      orientalism [3.1]. In other\u000d\u000a      words, we demonstrate that citizenship &#8212; as the capacity to demand the\u000d\u000a      right to have rights &#8212; cannot\u000d\u000a      be considered as a uniquely western phenomenon or achievement.\u000d\u000a    (2) Methodological innovations. OECUMENE and ENACT both developed\u000d\u000a      cumulative expertise\u000d\u000a      in providing innovative methods of inquiry into the new ways people around\u000d\u000a      the world act as\u000d\u000a      citizens.\u000d\u000a    (3) Scope innovations. Given its starting point, the research then\u000d\u000a      aims at discovering where and\u000d\u000a      how these capacities exist in latent or manifest forms. This has been done\u000d\u000a      through investigating\u000d\u000a      non-citizens and how they use various repertoires of rights to claim\u000d\u000a      rights. There are currently six\u000d\u000a      main research programmes and three PhD programmes in OECUMENE, including\u000d\u000a      field research in\u000d\u000a      Argentina, Spain, Jordan, India, Israel, Japan, the UK and Turkey. The\u000d\u000a      project also provides an\u000d\u000a      online platform for reportage by a group of seven activists.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32085","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The final report provided recommendations for the successful operation of\u000a      street markets across a variety of sites and sectors, including local\u000a      authority markets, privately run markets, and farmers' markets. It argued\u000a      that markets were significant in a number of key local and national\u000a      government policy arenas: community development and cohesion, health\u000a      agendas for better diets and nutrition, economic and social innovation\u000a      agendas including offering sites for start up businesses, and\u000a      environmental agendas for reductions in packaging and shopping in the\u000a      locality by foot as opposed to car journeys to supermarkets at some\u000a      distance.\u000a    The research led to a number of publications as indicated above.\u000a    The research was immediately picked up by the National Association of\u000a      British Market Authorities (NABMA), which is the leading organisation for\u000a      local authority street markets across the UK. Watson was asked to give the\u000a      keynote lecture at the NABMA annual conference in 2006. Here she promoted\u000a      a new agenda for the role of markets beyond their traditional role as\u000a      commercial and retail sites. Her argument, which became central to NABMA's\u000a      public platform, was that markets had other roles to play in terms of\u000a      political and policy agendas for urban regeneration, social and community\u000a      inclusion and cohesion, healthy eating and nutrition, economic innovation,\u000a      and the reduction of environmental impact and city liveability. The\u000a      research was influential in the launch of the Love Your Local Market\u000a        Campaign and in providing the impetus for the regeneration of\u000a      markets in local areas.\u000a    Graham Wilson Chief Executive of NABMA confirmed the significance of the\u000a      impact of Watson's research as follows:\u000a    Sophie Watson was really the first person to undertake research on the\u000a        social impact of markets. The research was of great significance because\u000a        it led to a more detailed consideration of the way markets interact with\u000a        their local communities. Sophie's research was also one of the catalysts\u000a        for the Communities and Local Government's Committee Inquiry into Retail\u000a        Markets which produced a detailed agenda for the markets industry to\u000a        address.\u000a    In the period since Sophie's research, we have seen markets linked\u000a        with a range of policy objectives including healthy eating, culture,\u000a        tourism, public space utilisation, new start opportunities and\u000a        regeneration and it is this broader base that has given markets a higher\u000a        profile and wider appeal. The research was enhanced by the provision of\u000a        case studies showing what can be achieved and providing good practice\u000a        guidance for those who want to find new ideas and initiatives. In the\u000a        last two years my organisation has led the `Love Your Local Market\u000a        Campaign' which has focused on new start opportunities but also sought\u000a        to build affection and support for local markets and provide evidence of\u000a        the connectivity between the market and the well being of the local\u000a        community. Sophie must take credit for giving us the impetus to look at\u000a        this wider picture.\u000a    Watson's invited lecture at the National Food Markets Conference\u000a        2007: From Producer to Consumer further emphasised the social and\u000a      public role of markets to market advocates whose focus to date had been on\u000a      the more nutritional value of markets.\u000a    From 2008-9 Watson was a special adviser to the House of Commons DCLG\u000a      Select Committee's Traditional Retail Markets Inquiry. Her role\u000a      was to highlight the hidden social and community benefits of street\u000a      markets that had hitherto been unrecognised. She accompanied the\u000a      Commission on two site visits to Leicester and to two London markets\u000a      (Annexes 2 and 3 of the final report).\u000a    Watson was also a key witness to the Committee. Her arguments were\u000a      central to the final report `Can Market Failure:Traditional Markets\u000a        Survive?', presented to the House of Commons DCLG Committee in 2009\u000a      (see pp. Ev 4-8). Her evidence and arguments brought a new perspective to\u000a      the value of street markets in the UK, which has contributed to their\u000a      regeneration in many local areas.\u000a    In 2010, Watson was appointed as expert adviser to Regeneris on the\u000a      London Development Agency Report on London's street markets. Her\u000a      contribution to this is evidenced in their report London's Street\u000a        Markets. Her research was also drawn upon in Markets 21 A Policy\u000a        and Research Review of UK Retail and Wholesale Markets in the 21st\u000a      Century conducted by the Retail Markets Alliance in November 2009.\u000a      Her work was cited as evidence in a written statement submitted by R.\u000a      Janssens to the Draft Newham Core Strategy with respect to Newham's\u000a      strategy for Queens Market.\u000a    Watson was invited again by NABMA to remind market authorities and\u000a      strategists of her arguments at the 2013 Annual Conference. At this event\u000a      many of the speakers and participants spoke of how they had adopted her\u000a      recommendations in their strategies for revitalising or rebuilding their\u000a      local markets. There was now a much wider acceptance of the notion that\u000a      markets could play a role in revitalising the community and as a social\u000a      and public space. Her speech was reported on the NABMA website following\u000a      the conference. Rob Nixon - markets manager for Stoke on Trent Council\u000a      reports:\u000a    Despite recent advances in profile emanating from the likes of the\u000a        `Portas' study, markets to a greater extent remain hidden in terms of\u000a        their role and significance. With over 47,000 micro businesses, their\u000a        staff and associated supply chains, they are surely an important part of\u000a        our retail landscape. However I and many people in the industry believe\u000a        they are so much more in terms of place management. I refer specifically\u000a        to the part markets play in social interaction and cohesion. Despite\u000a        their history, countrywide presence and broad reach there remains little\u000a        in the way of empirical data or theory surrounding retail markets.\u000a    This is the reason why your work `Markets as Sites for Social\u000a        Interaction' has and remains a staple document for those working in the\u000a        industry....It is one of the few documents that identifies the humanity\u000a        of the market environment and in doing so explains why despite the\u000a        dramatic change in patterns of consumption they survive and in many\u000a        places prosper.\u000a    Watson has been invited to a number of different institutions and events\u000a      to give lectures on street markets and their implications for public\u000a      space, and on the methodologies for researching street markets. Her\u000a      research has had a significant impact on teaching in the City of Vienna\u000a      where she was appointed in 2011-12 to a Visiting Professorship in SKUOR &#8212;\u000a      The Interdisciplinary Centre for Public Space and Urban Cultures &#8212; a post\u000a      funded in part by the City of Vienna. Her role was to lead student\u000a      research on street markets in Vienna and Budapest.\u000a    She was invited to present her research on BBC Radio 4's Thinking\u000a        Allowed in May 2011 and was also a guest on the programme on 20\u000a      March 2013.\u000a    Watson's research on street markets is featured on the Charisma Web Site\u000a      for Consumer Market Studies.\u000a    To summarise, through Watson's different activities and roles cited\u000a      above, markets are now recognised by national and local government, within\u000a      the market authorities sector, as key sites for sociality, community and\u000a      public space.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Watson's Joseph Rowntree funded study on Street Markets as Spaces of\u000a        Social Diversity shifted the dominant view that street markets in\u000a      Britain were failing economically and that their decline was inevitable.\u000a      The research brought the importance of markets as spaces of social\u000a      interaction and community to the fore.

This research led to two articles in\u000a      academic journals [3.1 and 3.2] and a wider interest in street markets in\u000a      the UK. As a result, Watson responded to a call from the Joseph Rowntree\u000a      Foundation on public space as social space, and was awarded a grant\u000a      (&#163;56,000) for her proposal to research street markets as spaces of social\u000a      diversity.\u000a    This study investigated eight markets across Britain, selected to reflect\u000a      both different socio-economic populations, and also different town and\u000a      metropolitan sites. It countered the view that markets were facing an\u000a      inevitable decline due to the rise of supermarkets and lack of investment,\u000a      and explored instead the potentiality of markets as public space, and\u000a      social and economic innovation, where multiple forms of sociality are\u000a      enacted. Research was conducted in the eight markets during 2004-6.\u000a    The research revealed that markets were not just spaces of consumption\u000a      for many different groups in each of the localities, they were also\u000a      important sites for vibrant social encounters, for social inclusion and\u000a      the care of others, for `rubbing along', and for mediating differences.\u000a      The research concluded that the social encounters and connections found in\u000a      markets contradicted pessimistic accounts of the decline of social\u000a      association in local communities. The research argued that in contrast to\u000a      the shopping mall, markets provided the possibility for the inclusion of\u000a      marginalised groups and for the co-mingling of differences where these are\u000a      increasingly relegated to more private spheres. As such, markets were\u000a      revealed to be key, but often unnoticed, spaces of the public sphere\u000a      [3.3].\u000a    The research also investigated and explored the social, economic,\u000a      institutional and design factors that were significant in producing\u000a      successful markets, and the reasons for the failure of markets in some\u000a      localities.\u000a    The study led to the publication of a report to Joseph Rowntree,\u000a      published by Policy Press [3.4], which provided recommendations for the\u000a      successful operation of street markets across a variety of sites and\u000a      sectors, including local authority markets, privately run markets and\u000a      farmers' markets. It argued that markets were significant in a number of\u000a      key government, social, urban and economic policy arenas. The research\u000a      further revealed that lack of investment, management and strategic\u000a      thinking led to the failure of markets in local areas, and that where\u000a      coherent strategies had been put in place, the decline of the market had\u000a      been turned around. The research led to further academic publications [3.5\u000a      and 3.6] and has been taken up in a variety of policy and academic arenas.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32090","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2629691","Name":"Iceland"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Himmelweit's arguments were used, among others, by the developing\u000d\u000a      international `gender\u000d\u000a      budgeting' movement to persuade international bodies, governments and\u000d\u000a      civil society\u000d\u000a      organisations to adopt GIA to improve their policy making. Many countries\u000d\u000a      have now adopted\u000d\u000a      some form of gender budgeting and many Non-Government Organisations (NGOs)\u000d\u000a      have been\u000d\u000a      monitoring the gender impact of their government's policies. The\u000d\u000a      importance of OU research to this\u000d\u000a      process can be seen by the wide citation of Himmelweit's papers in policy\u000d\u000a      documents (e.g.\u000d\u000a      International Monetary Fund (IMF) working papers, Unifem, and the UNDP),\u000d\u000a      invitations to speak at\u000d\u000a      high level conferences at the United Nations (UN), the European Union,\u000d\u000a      regional and national\u000d\u000a      governmental bodies, and contributions to the Commonwealth Secretariat's\u000d\u000a      gender budgeting\u000d\u000a      programme. More recently, she has helped build capacity in GIA for\u000d\u000a      governments and NGOs, e.g.\u000d\u000a      in Iceland and for the charity, Action Aid. Internationally, the Gender\u000d\u000a      and Tax project has led to the\u000d\u000a      annual joint tax dialogue conference, run jointly by the World Bank, the\u000d\u000a      IMF and Organisation for\u000d\u000a      Economic Co-operation and Development and attended by finance ministers\u000d\u000a      from around the\u000d\u000a      world. This discussed gender issues in taxation for the first time in\u000d\u000a      December 2011, and drew\u000d\u000a      heavily on the project's results.\u000d\u000a    Himmelweit's argument that childcare should be seen as part of societal\u000d\u000a      infrastructure is now\u000d\u000a      accepted in Scotland, where the chief economist's office is developing an\u000d\u000a      analysis of the economic\u000d\u000a      benefits of public investment in childcare to present to the first\u000d\u000a      minister. In the UK, the Labour Party\u000d\u000a      has adopted this position and the shadow Financial Secretary proposed an\u000d\u000a      amendment to the\u000d\u000a      Infrastructure (Financial Assistance) Bill to include childcare under its\u000d\u000a      provisions:\u000d\u000a      (http:\/\/www.publications.parliament.uk\/pa\/cm201213\/cmhansrd\/cm121015\/debtext\/121015-0002.htm#12101531000001).\u000d\u000a    The Women's Budget Group (WBG), a civil society think tank that\u000d\u000a      Himmelweit initially chaired and\u000d\u000a      whose Policy Advisory Group she now co-ordinates, regularly assesses the\u000d\u000a      gender impact of UK\u000d\u000a      budgets and spending reviews. WBG reports (http:\/\/www.wbg.org.uk\/RRB_Reports.htm)\u000d\u000a      have\u000d\u000a      been widely cited as evidence of the adverse impact of the UK coalition's\u000d\u000a      government's austerity\u000d\u000a      measures on women, thought to be responsible for a divergence in women's\u000d\u000a      and men's voting\u000d\u000a      intentions. OU researchers (De Henau, Himmelweit and Santos) are leading\u000d\u000a      contributors to these\u000d\u000a      reports.\u000d\u000a    In the UK, the Equality Act (2010 amended 2011) now requires public\u000d\u000a      sector bodies to pay\u000d\u000a      attention to the gender impact of their activities. By demonstrating\u000d\u000a      weaknesses in the Treasury's\u000d\u000a      own GIA, OU researchers provided evidence for legal challenges (by the\u000d\u000a      Fawcett Society) and\u000d\u000a      investigations (by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC)) into\u000d\u000a      whether the Treasury\u000d\u000a      had fulfilled its duties under the Acts. During the Fawcett case, the\u000d\u000a      Treasury conceded that they\u000d\u000a      had looked at the gender impact of only two of over 100 budget measures,\u000d\u000a      expressed regret at not\u000d\u000a      having met the requirements of the Gender Equality Duty, and pledged to\u000d\u000a      take a different approach\u000d\u000a      in future.\u000d\u000a    While this case was pending, Himmelweit, along with representatives of\u000d\u000a      other `protected groups',\u000d\u000a      was invited by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury to discuss how he could\u000d\u000a      ensure that the Equality\u000d\u000a      Act was adhered to in the forthcoming spending review. Nevertheless, after\u000d\u000a      that spending review,\u000d\u000a      the EHRC did decide to conduct a formal assessment of whether the Treasury\u000d\u000a      had met its\u000d\u000a      obligations under the Act. Himmelweit, through the WBG, was again asked to\u000d\u000a      provide evidence,\u000d\u000a      and was invited to a seminar to consider whether HM Treasury could have\u000d\u000a      extended their\u000d\u000a      distributional analysis in order to consider equality impacts. The\u000d\u000a      Commission made various\u000d\u000a      recommendations to assure better future compliance and practice\u000d\u000a      (http:\/\/www.equalityhumanrights.com\/uploaded_files\/Inquiries\/s31_final.pdf)\u000d\u000a      including two that\u000d\u000a      picked up directly on WBG practices, and invited Himmelweit to be a member\u000d\u000a      of its expert advisory\u000d\u000a      group, working with HM Treasury to implement these recommendations.\u000d\u000a    Himmelweit was invited, with Fran Bennett (Oxford University), to give a\u000d\u000a      seminar at the\u000d\u000a      Department for Work and Pensions to civil servants working on the Welfare\u000d\u000a      Reform Bill, for which\u000d\u000a      they drew on the results of their joint GeNet research. These results also\u000d\u000a      informed presentations\u000d\u000a      they made to peers as the Bill went through the House of Lords, advice\u000d\u000a      given to individual peers,\u000d\u000a      and briefing notes they provided on gender impact as particular amendments\u000d\u000a      were discussed\u000d\u000a      (http:\/\/wbg.org.uk\/RRB_Briefings.htm).\u000d\u000a      The work of the WBG on these issues was cited several\u000d\u000a      times in debates in parliament, and some speakers quoted almost verbatim\u000d\u000a      from these briefing\u000d\u000a      notes (see e.g. http:\/\/www.publications.parliament.uk\/pa\/ld201011\/ldhansrd\/text\/111123-gc0001.htm#11112397000150).\u000aFor\u000d\u000a      example, so as to prevent reinforcing a male breadwinner\u000d\u000a      model, Amendment 52 C provided for second earners to have an individual\u000d\u000a      earnings disregard.\u000d\u000a      Himmelweit used both GeNet and GenIX research findings in the presentation\u000d\u000a      she gave to an all-party\u000d\u000a      seminar and in the briefing notes she wrote on second earner issues for\u000d\u000a      peers\u000d\u000a      (http:\/\/wbg.org.uk\/pdfs\/Notes-on-second-earners_-final.pdf).\u000d\u000a      Many of those who spoke in favour of\u000d\u000a      the amendment had attended that seminar and Lady Howe, a cross-bencher and\u000d\u000a      previous chair of\u000d\u000a      the EOC, decided to support and speak to the amendment only after\u000d\u000a      receiving these briefing notes.\u000d\u000a    Baroness Lister, who moved the amendment, had asked Himmelweit to brief\u000d\u000a      her on the issues and\u000d\u000a      to comment on a draft of her speech. In it she said `... this is one of\u000d\u000a      the most important issues in\u000d\u000a      the Bill that affect women. I am grateful to members of the [WBG], of\u000d\u000a      which I am a member, for\u000d\u000a      helping me to think through some of these issues.' She later withdrew the\u000d\u000a      amendment after the\u000d\u000a      minister responsible (Lord Freud) promised to revisit the issue and\u000d\u000a      summing up said `...

of papers proposing GIA of\u000d\u000a      all economic and social\u000d\u000a      policy and developed a distinctive methodology for doing such analysis\u000d\u000a      [3.1 and 3.2]. These\u000d\u000a      papers argued that there is both an efficiency and an equality case for\u000d\u000a      GIA, and therefore that all\u000d\u000a      policies &#8212; not only those designed to reduce gender inequalities &#8212; could\u000d\u000a      reach their goals more\u000d\u000a      effectively by assessing their potential gender impact. Himmelweit argued\u000d\u000a      that assessment is\u000d\u000a      needed of the effects of policy on the unpaid care economy as well as on\u000d\u000a      the paid economy; that\u000d\u000a      GIA should encompass taxation as well as expenditure; and that gender\u000d\u000a      equality should be\u000d\u000a      assessed both between households and within them. OU researchers have\u000d\u000a      subsequently worked\u000d\u000a      mainly on the last three of these themes.\u000d\u000a    Himmelweit combined feminist and economic analysis to develop a\u000d\u000a      theoretical understanding of\u000d\u000a      the care economy and draw out implications for developing policy on care\u000d\u000a      [3.3]. In this and some\u000d\u000a      later more policy-oriented applications, the case was made for seeing care\u000d\u000a      as part of the social\u000d\u000a      infrastructure of society, whose evolution is shaped by gendered norms and\u000d\u000a      behaviour. This\u000d\u000a      research showed that the public costs of funding care would rise, not only\u000d\u000a      because of well-recognised\u000d\u000a      demographic changes, but also because of changing gender norms and\u000d\u000a      inherent\u000d\u000a      characteristics of care that limit productivity increases. Failing to\u000d\u000a      recognise these tendencies would\u000d\u000a      lead, among other things, to unsustainable pressures on the unpaid\u000d\u000a      economy, worsening\u000d\u000a      conditions in the care industry, and a decline in unacceptable standards\u000d\u000a      of care quality.\u000d\u000a    In 2006, the Ford Foundation, the International Development Research\u000d\u000a      Centre (IDRC) and the\u000d\u000a      United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) jointly funded an\u000d\u000a      international research project\u000d\u000a      on gender and taxation, to which Himmelweit became a technical advisor. In\u000d\u000a      2008, it was decided\u000d\u000a      that this project, although focused mainly on developing countries, would\u000d\u000a      benefit from a developed,\u000d\u000a      country comparator, so Himmelweit, De Henau and Santos conducted a UK\u000d\u000a      study. The project's\u000d\u000a      findings uncovered some hidden gender implications of apparently gender\u000d\u000a      neutral tax systems by\u000d\u000a      showing that practices, such as joint income tax filing, disadvantage\u000d\u000a      women in particular.\u000d\u000a    One hurdle in GIA is assessing how inequalities work within households.\u000d\u000a      Recognition of this\u000d\u000a      problem led to a cross-university collaborative research project on\u000d\u000a      `Within household inequalities\u000d\u000a      and public policy' &#8212; (part of the ESRC-funded Gender (in) equality network\u000d\u000a      (GeNet)) &#8212; and a\u000d\u000a      subsequent cross-national project `Gender and Intra-Household\u000d\u000a      Entitlements. A Cross-National\u000d\u000a      Longitudinal Analysis (GenIX)'. These projects revealed that how money is\u000d\u000a      managed varies greatly\u000d\u000a      within couples and that while gender roles affect men's and women's\u000d\u000a      relative benefit from joint\u000d\u000a      household income, the extent to which this is the case varies across\u000d\u000a      policy regimes (De Henau and\u000d\u000a      Himmelweit, Sections 3:5 and 3:6).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32788","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2275384","Name":"Liberia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Scott's core scientific research on family change, gender role\u000a      inequalities, and work-family balance has sought to communicate the\u000a      findings and their implications clearly and accessibly in order to\u000a      facilitate take-up by non-academics. The accessibility of Scott's earlier\u000a      research was testified by an unsolicited letter she received from David\u000a      Willetts (16\/12\/04), the then Shadow Secretary of State for Work and\u000a      Pensions stating \"I am trying to make sense of the debate about the extent\u000a      to which attitudes are shaped by the cohorts to which people belong or\u000a      alternatively shaped by the stage in the life cycle.

He indicated that he\u000a      would like further information. This led to a further correspondence and a\u000a      meeting to discuss related research, which he acknowledged as influencing\u000a      his own work in an interview for the BSA Network and by citations to\u000a      Scott's research in his 2010 book `The Pinch' (Section V:i ).\u000a    The ESRC Research Priority Network on Gender Inequalities in Production\u000a      and Reproduction (GeNet) had the critical mass to make a significant\u000a      impact on policy makers, government commissions, NGOs and charities, as\u000a      well as fostering greater awareness in the general public though media\u000a      coverage and use of knowledge brokers. One of the things especially\u000a      commended by the ESRC Evaluation report (2011) was the extraordinary\u000a      interest that the purposive GeNet (www.genet.ac.uk)\u000a      website attracted with over quarter of a million hits per year at its\u000a      peak, and which is now archived for future generations through the British\u000a      Library.\u000a    Scott as GeNet director co-ordinated efforts to ensure GeNet research was\u000a      used by Government Commissions and NGOs. One of the key issues for\u000a      evidence based research concerned the factors that underpinned the gender\u000a      pay gap and what could be done to ameliorate such inequalities. For\u000a      example Scott provided evidence in for the 2006 Women and Work Commission\u000a      which emphasised the persistent constraints of childcare and domestic\u000a      labour that impede gender equality in employment; the same issues were\u000a      picked up in the 2009 Report on `Shaping a Fairer Future' which reviewed\u000a      progress on the Commission's recommendations, three years on (Section\u000a        5:ii). Scott co-organised with the Women and Equality Unit a\u000a      conference held at the Department of Trade and Industry on Women and\u000a      Employment (over 150 participants) to mark the 25th Anniversary\u000a      of the Women and Employment Survey in 2005, emphasising the overwhelming\u000a      research evidence for the importance of mandatory pay disclosure. The\u000a      subsequent impact and success of the cumulative research evidence on\u000a      mandatory pay has been mixed, in part because of the change in Government.\u000a      However, the Equality Bill (2010) does make provision for mandatory pay\u000a      disclosure in Section 28 (albeit that this has still to be implemented by\u000a      the Coalition government). It is an issue that the Equality and Human\u000a      Rights Commission continues to press; EHRC reports cite various GeNet\u000a      publications, including work that is relevant to the research evidence\u000a      base that underpinned their inquiry into gender discrimination in the\u000a      financial sector, where pay gaps are marked (Section V: viii).\u000a    GeNet was very successful in media dissemination and public engagement in\u000a      ways that sparked new public debate. The University of Cambridge's\u000a      External Communication team provide support to publicise the Network's\u000a      research. After a press release on `Gender Equality on the slide' (2008),\u000a      Scott gave interviews on the BBC World Service (with the current President\u000a      of Liberia, Africa's first female elected president), BBC Radio 4 and over\u000a      15 local radio stations &#8212; several of which encouraged `phone-ins' and\u000a      `bloggings' to debate `the changing gender roles of women and men' (Section\u000a        V: iv). Scott also took part in a Cambridge Festival of Ideas\u000a      seminar about the Long Term Legacy of the Recession which was recorded as\u000a      a Guardian podcast; and discussed gender inequalities with a sold-out\u000a      audience of 100 at the Guardian sponsored Hay-on Wye Festival (May 2010\u000a      and May 2012). Evidence that such outreach sponsors new public debate can\u000a      be found in its reporting on Mumsnet blogs (Section V: v) and by\u000a      reference in popular books on current affairs\/parenting e.g. Shattered\u000a      by Rebecca Asher 2011; Half-a Wife by Gaby Hinsliff 2012 (Section\u000a        V: vi).\u000a    Another important way of reaching the public was through working with\u000a      independent charity organisations. Scott was invited to give a plenary\u000a      address to the Family and Parenting Institute's Annual conference at\u000a      Church House (in 2009), along with Ed Balls the then Secretary of State\u000a      for Children, Schools and Families), stressing the social costs of gender\u000a      inequalities in parenting. The address has been made available on Youtube,\u000a      with 135 viewings (Section V: iii)\u000a    The international impact of the GeNet research is evident from the award\u000a      of a further grant (2008-9) from the European Commission to identify\u000a      institutional `best practice; for the promotion of gender equality in\u000a      science. The grant led to identification of `best practice' guidelines to\u000a      evaluate schemes whereby higher education and research organisations are\u000a      seeking to reduce gender inequalities e.g. Athena SWAN awards (Section\u000a        V:vii ).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research by Professor Jacqueline Scott and others involved in the Network\u000a      on Gender Inequalities in Production and Reproduction (GeNet) has\u000a      influenced policy makers, government commissions and charities.

Starting in 2004 and spanning eight\u000a      different HEIs, the network was co-ordinated by Professor Jacqueline Scott\u000a      and funded 25 fte research posts (2004-2010). For further details see: http:\/\/www.genet.ac.uk\/. The aim was\u000a      to explore the changing dynamics of gender inequalities in contemporary\u000a      society. The research included both quantitative and qualitative\u000a      approaches to investigate the processes of selection and exclusion that\u000a      reflect and create gender inequalities in changing lives and structures.\u000a      To this end, the Network conducted new quantitative analysis of large and\u000a      complex data sets such as the National Child Development Study (NCDS), the\u000a      Millennium Cohort Study (MCS) and the British Household Panel Study\u000a      (BHPS). New qualitative studies were also conducted to gain a\u000a      contextualised understanding of the mechanisms that maintain or challenge\u000a      gender inequalities, within households, in different employment sectors\u000a      and in different nations. The scientific quality of the Network as a whole\u000a      was considered exemplary in the 2011 review commissioned by the ESRC.\u000a    The Network benefitted from a strong theoretical framework that\u000a      emphasised the importance of the State in shaping family and individual\u000a      life course trajectories and, in particular, the way social policies can\u000a      support or undermine efforts to reduce gender inequalities including their\u000a      manifestation in the perceived conflicts between work and family. In\u000a      addition, one of the Network's explicit aims was to enhance the\u000a      methodological rigour of empirical investigations of gender equality.\u000a      Scott remains a strong advocate of combining quantitative and qualitative\u000a      research (Scott 2010) and GeNet benefitted from this methodological\u000a      eclecticism.\u000a    The scientific agenda of the GeNet research network, in part, built on\u000a      prior work done by Scott et al (1996) on gender role attitudinal change\u000a      and Scott (1999) on family change. The former emphasised the importance of\u000a      unpacking the three component parts of societal change (period, cohort and\u000a      ageing effects) because each has played a different role in gender-role\u000a      change. The latter questioned whether family change is associated with a\u000a      backlash in attitudes, arguing that the demise of traditional values has\u000a      been exaggerated. One of the Network's main theoretical and methodological\u000a      challenges was identifying the mechanisms of change. For example, the life\u000a      course approach focused attention on how the gendering of paid and unpaid\u000a      work perpetuates inequalities. In addition, we examined why the demise of\u000a      the breadwinner family has brought more gender equality in paid work, than\u000a      in unpaid domestic work and family care.\u000a    At Cambridge, research related to Scott's gender equality project was\u000a      also undertaken by Research Associates Dr Jane Nolan, Dr Anke Plagnol, Dr\u000a      Shireen Kanji (2004-2011) and Dr Pia Schoeber, British Academy Fellow\u000a      (2009-2012). Also Prof. Simon Deakin (Law) led the GeNet project on\u000a      `Addressing Gender Inequality through Corporate Governance', with Research\u000a      Associate Dr Colm McLaughlin (Centre for Business Research, 2006-2007).\u000a    The Network's collaborative research was incorporated in a three volume\u000a      book series on different aspects of gender inequalities: Scott et al\u000a      (2008) Women and employment: Changing lives and New Challenges;\u000a      Scott et al (2010) Gender inequalities in the 21st\u000a      Century: New Barriers and Continuing Constraints; Scott et al\u000a      (2012) Gendered Lives: Gender Inequalities in Production and\u000a        Reproduction. In addition, Scott and Nolan (2007) were guest editors\u000a      for a special issue of Equal Opportunities International on `New\u000a      Technology and Gender Division of Labour: Problems and Prospects for\u000a      Equality in Public and Private Spheres.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32833","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"3865483","Name":"Argentina"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact of this research is evident in four main areas:\u000d\u000a    1 The research has been actively taken up by professionals and\u000d\u000a      practitioners in the\u000d\u000a      publishing industry as well as by governments and used as a key resource\u000d\u000a      for reflecting on\u000d\u000a      business practices and strategies and developing policies. Books in\u000d\u000a        the Digital Age and the article\u000d\u000a      in the Chronicle for Higher Education in the US, `Survival\u000d\u000a      Strategies for Academic Publishing', were\u000d\u000a      much discussed by senior managers in the university presses and other\u000d\u000a      academic publishers\u000d\u000a      [sources 1, 2]; they had an impact both on the strategic thinking of\u000d\u000a      university presses and on the\u000d\u000a      understanding and practices of editors: `It definitely changed my\u000d\u000a      awareness', said the Editor-in-Chief\u000d\u000a      at Oxford University Press; `at conferences and on campus visits, I lay\u000d\u000a      out Thompson's\u000d\u000a      thesis constantly to scholars wondering about the role of commercial\u000d\u000a      publishers in the scholarly\u000d\u000a      publishing world, particularly with regard to works of original\u000d\u000a      scholarship'. Merchants of Culture\u000d\u000a      has been widely read and discussed by professionals working in trade\u000d\u000a      publishing and is seen by\u000d\u000a      many as the best guide to understanding their industry. For example, Sealy\u000d\u000a      Yates, a literary agent,\u000d\u000a      describes it as `a must-read for anyone currently working in any position\u000d\u000a      in trade publishing.'\u000d\u000a      Thompson is often invited to present the main findings of his research to\u000d\u000a      meetings of the main\u000d\u000a      professional bodies and events in Britain, Europe and Latin America. He\u000d\u000a      gave keynote\u000d\u000a      presentations at the 34th and 37th Buenos Aires Book\u000d\u000a      Fairs (2008, 2011), the Bienal do Livro de\u000d\u000a      Sao Paulo (2010), the Swedish publishers association (2011), the Danish\u000d\u000a      publishers association\u000d\u000a      (2011), a gathering of the leading Norwegian publishers (2011), the annual\u000d\u000a      conference of the\u000d\u000a      Independent Publishers Group in the UK (2012) and a conference with key\u000d\u000a      figures in the Brazilian\u000d\u000a      publishing industry (May 2013). HIs work has been taken up and used by\u000d\u000a      many publishing houses\u000d\u000a      in different countries to inform and shape their strategic thinking. For\u000d\u000a      example, a Director of\u000d\u000a      Gyldendal, the largest publisher in Denmark, said: `Publishers in Denmark\u000d\u000a      have read with great\u000d\u000a      interest John Thompson's unique and important books on publishing, which\u000d\u000a      have become key\u000d\u000a      reference points for those of us who work in the industry... It is\u000d\u000a      relatively easy to apply Thompson's\u000d\u000a      analysis in actual practice, not least because he establishes a precise\u000d\u000a      terminology and conceptual\u000d\u000a      framework that enable us as publishers to understand better and more\u000d\u000a      clearly what we do. This in\u000d\u000a      itself is very valuable, because you have to be able to form a clear and\u000d\u000a      accurate view of what you\u000d\u000a      are doing at the moment in order to be able to change and adapt to a new\u000d\u000a      and emerging reality'\u000d\u000a      [source 3]. Thompson was invited to give a presentation to senior managers\u000d\u000a      at Aschehoug, one of\u000d\u000a      the largest publishers in Norway, after which the CEO said: `We have\u000d\u000a      bought a number of copies of\u000d\u000a      Merchants of Culture for key staff in our house, for our board and\u000d\u000a      for our owners. Your work has\u000d\u000a      had, and continues to have, an impact on our way thinking about the\u000d\u000a      complicated mission of\u000d\u000a      running a publishing house of our kind. It has been internalized in our\u000d\u000a      mindset so that we have it\u000d\u000a      as an important part of our frame of reference'. The book has been used by\u000d\u000a      start-ups &#8212; both\u000d\u000a      traditional print publishers and digital publishers &#8212; as a crash course in\u000d\u000a      publishing. The co-founder\u000d\u000a      and CEO of a leading digital start-up in the UK put it like this: `Your\u000d\u000a      book was a revelation for us,\u000d\u000a      providing exactly the insight that we needed to formulate our strategy and\u000d\u000a      to understand the\u000d\u000a      competitive landscape we were entering. The book is essential reading for\u000d\u000a      everyone in the\u000d\u000a      company and I have recommended it to many of our digital publishing peers'\u000d\u000a      [source 4]. His co-founder\u000d\u000a      concurred: `Merchants of Culture is a very important practical\u000d\u000a      guide to navigating the shark\u000d\u000a      infested waters of the publishing world, and I recommend it to everyone I\u000d\u000a      come into contact with in\u000d\u000a      that benighted industry. It is a rare combination of serious academic\u000d\u000a      research with actually useful\u000d\u000a      and directly actionable information.'  Merchants of Culture also\u000d\u000a      had a direct impact on, and is cited\u000d\u000a      extensively in, a report commissioned by the Norwegian government on the\u000d\u000a      position of small and\u000d\u000a      medium-sized publishers in Norway, Rapport om sm&#229;forlag, and a\u000d\u000a      report on book pricing\u000d\u000a      commissioned by the Norwegian Ministries of Culture and Education, Til\u000d\u000a        bokas pris [sources 5, 6,\u000d\u000a      7]. The report on book pricing, which draws directly on Thompson's\u000d\u000a      analysis of price competition\u000d\u000a      and the role of supermarkets in the UK, was discussed in the public debate\u000d\u000a      in Norway and was\u000d\u000a      influential in the development of the proposal for a Norwegian Book Law\u000d\u000a      presented to the\u000d\u000a      Norwegian parliament in 2012.\u000d\u000a    2 The research has also had an impact on related professionals who depend\u000d\u000a      on the\u000d\u000a      publishing industry, such as writers of fiction and general interest\u000d\u000a      nonfiction. Many writers have a\u000d\u000a      limited understanding of the industry, even though they may depend on it\u000d\u000a      for their career and\u000d\u000a      livelihood. Thompson's research has been welcomed by writers and writers'\u000d\u000a      organizations as a\u000d\u000a      valuable guide to the industry and a way of informing their actions and\u000d\u000a      understanding. He has\u000d\u000a      been invited to give accounts of his findings in magazines that are widely\u000d\u000a      read by writers, such as\u000d\u000a      Poets &amp; Writers and Brooklyn Rail. He was invited to\u000d\u000a      give the keynote address at the Annual\u000d\u000a      General Meeting of the Norwegian Nonfiction Writers and Translators\u000d\u000a      Association in 2011, which,\u000d\u000a      according to a leading authority on the book business in Norway,\u000d\u000a      `definitely was of importance for\u000d\u000a      authors' understanding of the situation in international publishing'.\u000d\u000a      Thompson has received many\u000d\u000a      letters from writers attesting to the fact that his research has changed\u000d\u000a      their understanding of the\u000d\u000a      industry and helped them to make better decisions and career choices. For\u000d\u000a      example, a children's\u000d\u000a      book writer in Australia said: `Have just read Merchants of Culture\u000d\u000a      and finally been able to put\u000d\u000a      together all the pieces of the publishing industry that have been so\u000d\u000a      puzzling... I can't tell you how\u000d\u000a      enlightened I am by your publishing insights. I can finally make some\u000d\u000a      informed career decisions'.\u000d\u000a      A New York Times best-selling fiction writer wrote: `I've just\u000d\u000a      finished reading Merchants of Culture\u000d\u000a      and I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed it... Since I now have an\u000d\u000a      extensive publishing and\u000d\u000a      agent team, it is so helpful to know the demons that haunt them so that I\u000d\u000a      can both perform my own\u000d\u000a      role as author better and interpret more accurately why a certain piece of\u000d\u000a      advice may have been\u000d\u000a      imparted'. And this from a poet in the US: `I have been a writer for 20\u000d\u000a      years and can honestly say\u000d\u000a      your book illuminated so much for me. It has explained the marginalized\u000d\u000a      feeling I can sometimes\u000d\u000a      have as a writer and, oddly enough, it was comforting to see it so clearly\u000d\u000a      explained... I hope you\u000d\u000a      will continue your study of this fast-changing field. We, the writers,\u000d\u000a      need you to help us stay\u000d\u000a      informed and, as such, empowered'.\u000d\u000a    3 Thompson's research has been taken up by libraries and other\u000d\u000a      organizations that are part\u000d\u000a      of the book supply chain and key players in the information economy. For\u000d\u000a      example, the Library of\u000d\u000a      Congress in Washington D.C. invited Thompson to be part of a small group\u000d\u000a      of 15 leading\u000d\u000a      researchers working on the social impact of the digital revolution to\u000d\u000a      advise the Library on the\u000d\u000a      development of a new strategic plan to guide investment decisions related\u000d\u000a      to the Library's\u000d\u000a      collections and services for the next 25 years. Thompson presented his\u000d\u000a      analysis of the\u000d\u000a      transformation of the publishing industry and the likely future trends in\u000d\u000a      publishing and information\u000d\u000a      dissemination to senior managers at the Library of Congress in July 2012\u000d\u000a      and his analysis has\u000d\u000a      been incorporated into the development of the Library's Digital Revolution\u000d\u000a      initiative &#8212; `you have\u000d\u000a      definitely influenced our thinking', commented one senior manager at the\u000d\u000a      Library of Congress.\u000d\u000a    4 The research has also had an impact on public debates about changes in\u000d\u000a      the publishing\u000d\u000a      industry and the implications of these changes for literary culture and\u000d\u000a      the future of the book. The\u000d\u000a      dramatic changes affecting the world of publishing have given rise to a\u000d\u000a      great deal of public interest\u000d\u000a      and concern, and Thompson is often turned to by the media as an expert. Merchants\u000d\u000a        of Culture\u000d\u000a      has been widely and very positively reviewed in the general press &#8212; `A\u000d\u000a      superb history and analysis\u000d\u000a      of publishing and bookselling' (New Statesman, Books of the Year);\u000d\u000a      `The best account we have of\u000d\u000a      what happened to publishing' (The Observer); `authoritative' (The\u000d\u000a        Guardian) (see &#167;3 above for\u000d\u000a      further references).

During this period Thompson held two\u000d\u000a      ESRC grants. The\u000d\u000a      first grant supported a three-year research project on `New Technologies\u000d\u000a      and Global Change in the\u000d\u000a      Book Publishing Industry'; this research focused on the transformation of\u000d\u000a      academic and higher\u000d\u000a      education publishing in Britain and the US from c1960 to c2005. It\u000d\u000a      involved detailed case studies\u000d\u000a      of 16 publishing firms in Britain and the US and around 230 interviews.\u000d\u000a      The project had a full-time\u000d\u000a      Research Assistant (2000-2) who helped gather background materials, etc.,\u000d\u000a      but Thompson did all\u000d\u000a      of the on-site research, all of the interviews and all of the analysis and\u000d\u000a      writing-up. The key output\u000d\u000a      was Books in the Digital Age: The Transformation of Academic and\u000d\u000a        Higher Education Publishing in\u000d\u000a        Britain and the United States.\u000d\u000a    The second grant supported a three-year research project on\u000d\u000a      `Concentration and\u000d\u000a      Innovation in the Book Publishing Industry'; this focused on the\u000d\u000a      transformation of mainstream trade\u000d\u000a      publishing in Britain and the US from c1960 to c2010 and on the making of\u000d\u000a      bestsellers. Thompson\u000d\u000a      conducted all of the research, which involved more than 280 interviews\u000d\u000a      with CEOs, CFOs,\u000d\u000a      publishers, editors, sales managers, marketing managers, agents,\u000d\u000a      booksellers, review editors,\u000d\u000a      authors and others involved in the book publishing business.

Thompson\u000d\u000a      carried out additional research in\u000d\u000a      2011, including 20 new interviews, to update the book for the new\u000d\u000a      paperback edition, which was\u000d\u000a      published in 2012.\u000d\u000a    The principal aim of these two research projects was to provide a\u000d\u000a      systematic account of the\u000d\u000a      changing structure of the modern book publishing industry and to examine\u000d\u000a      the key challenges\u000d\u000a      confronting the industry today. Prior to this research, the study of the\u000d\u000a      modern book publishing\u000d\u000a      industry had been largely neglected in the social sciences. The research\u000d\u000a      set out to fill this gap.\u000d\u000a      The two main outputs, taken together, now represent the most sustained\u000d\u000a      account of the\u000d\u000a      transformation of the modern book publishing industry available in any\u000d\u000a      language.\u000d\u000a    Thompson develops an original theory of publishing fields and uses it to\u000d\u000a      analyse the\u000d\u000a      structure and transformation of three of the most important sectors of the\u000d\u000a      book publishing industry:\u000d\u000a      academic publishing, higher education publishing and mainstream trade\u000d\u000a      publishing. He shows that\u000d\u000a      each publishing field is characterized by a distinctive set of processes\u000d\u000a      and developments that\u000d\u000a      comprise what he calls `the logic of the field'. By reconstructing this\u000d\u000a      logic through careful fieldwork,\u000d\u000a      he shows how and why the field has evolved as it has and why agents act as\u000d\u000a      they do. He also\u000d\u000a      sheds light on the key challenges faced by the industry today, as the\u000d\u000a      unfolding of the logic of the\u000d\u000a      field collides with a technological revolution that is beginning to\u000d\u000a      challenge and disrupt the traditional\u000d\u000a      rules of the game, forcing all the key players in the field to reconsider\u000d\u000a      their positions and practices.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32834","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2264397","Name":"Portugal"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"}],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The study linking privatization to mortality created an awareness of the\u000d\u000a      potential role of privatization on health outcomes in the general public\u000d\u000a      and the economic policy community. The main article published in the Lancet\u000d\u000a      was reported by over 200 media outlets globally. These included including\u000d\u000a      key opinion shaping outlets for economic policy makers: the article was\u000d\u000a      debated in the Financial Times (by Jeffrey Sachs), the New\u000d\u000a        York Times (by Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz), and in the Economist.\u000d\u000a      It was also debated by the general public on the NYT's website. The\u000d\u000a      articles on pharmaceuticals in Poland reached a high position on the media\u000d\u000a      agenda, as suggested by both their widespread coverage in popular and\u000d\u000a      specialized media in Poland and the fact that in some instances they\u000d\u000a      formed front-page stories. They were discussed by all major stakeholders\u000d\u000a      involved in developing pharmaceutical policy in Poland. For example,\u000d\u000a      Stanislaw Karczewski, Vice-Chairman and a member of the Health Committee\u000d\u000a      of the Senate of the Republic of Poland, referred to the article on his\u000d\u000a      websites (Karczewski 2011). The president of the Association of Innovative\u000d\u000a      Pharmaceutical Companies stated: `The report...is an important document\u000d\u000a      because it not only offers a diagnosis of the situation, but shows the\u000d\u000a      underlying causes. What is key for us, though, are its conclusions and\u000d\u000a      recommendations' (Toczyski 2012). The article was also commented on in the\u000d\u000a      official bulletin of the Chamber of Physicians and Dentists: `They [the\u000d\u000a      authors] seem to be saying to decision-and lawmakers in the field of drug\u000d\u000a      reimbursement: \"We can see you, you are in a candid camera\"' (Knypl 2011).\u000d\u000a      At the end of 2012, the Minister of Health announced the overhaul of the\u000d\u000a      Agency for Health Technology Assessment, which was criticized in our\u000d\u000a      articles. It is of course difficult to prove that this step was influenced\u000d\u000a      by the publications or their coverage.\u000d\u000a    The article by King linking IMF programmes to Tuberculosis received\u000d\u000a      global media coverage and was viewed online 21,592 times, and downloaded\u000d\u000a      2,880 times (as of 27\/09\/13). Kentikelenis' work that extended this\u000d\u000a      research to Greece has also received wide coverage in national and\u000d\u000a      international media, and has had an impact on policy and public debates.\u000d\u000a      His research formed the basis of an invited talk at a World Health\u000d\u000a      Organization conference that led to the formulation of the organization's\u000d\u000a      policy proposals to its members. A Member of the European Parliament, Jo&#227;o\u000d\u000a      Ferreira, asked the European Commission: `The steep decline in living\u000d\u000a      conditions affecting the population of Greece is already being seen by\u000d\u000a      specialists as an authentic \"tragedy\", this term being used in a study...\u000d\u000a      headed by Alexander Kentikelenis... Does the Commission intend to ignore\u000d\u000a      the social consequences of these programmes for much longer?' The Greek\u000d\u000a      Minister of Health and various other officials responded to this work in\u000d\u000a      the press and in academic journals. This work and the subsequent popular\u000d\u000a      pressure led to the introduction of policies designed to offset some of\u000d\u000a      the effects of the crisis. Kentikelenis is now in contact with the social\u000d\u000a      affairs committee of the Greek Parliament and the WHO on these issues, as\u000d\u000a      well as with NGOs in Greece and other European countries that have used\u000d\u000a      his work to challenge government policies. For example, a Reuters article\u000d\u000a      on Portuguese health policy reported: `Kentikelenis... said... \"The\u000d\u000a      government will think twice now before cutting further in [health\u000d\u000a      spending]. Such spending has to be countercyclical. People need it the\u000d\u000a      most in downturns, not when the economy is growing.\"'\u000d\u000a    Stuckler and Basu's book The Body Economic has received\u000d\u000a      widespread media coverage and influenced the policy debate. The\u000d\u000a      influential FT columnist Harry Eyes wrote that this book is `a\u000d\u000a      powerful indictment of the unnecessary suffering and rising mortality\u000d\u000a      rates associated with austerity policies unsoftened by remedial social\u000d\u000a      programmes.' Eyes continues: `I hope the finance ministers read it, and\u000d\u000a      try mixing with the ordinary people, who are the only ones who can bring\u000d\u000a      about economic recovery'. A Guardian feature by Jon Henley under\u000d\u000a      the headline `recessions hurt but austerity kills' generated 420 public\u000d\u000a      comments on their website. The charity Royal Society for the Encouragement\u000d\u000a      of Arts held a public lecture by Stuckler on `austerity kills' on 22nd\u000d\u000a      May 2013 which has had more than 1578 viewings on YouTube (as of\u000d\u000a      25\/9\/2013).

This research\u000d\u000a      programme applies theories and methods from political, economic and\u000d\u000a      comparative historical sociology to explain public health outcomes, as\u000d\u000a      well as the governance of public health systems. The underpinning research\u000d\u000a      was based at the Department of Sociology in Cambridge and carried out\u000d\u000a      between 2006 and 2012 by Professor King and his group, in collaboration\u000d\u000a      with leading public health researchers. The Political Economy of Public\u000d\u000a      Health radicalizes and makes dynamic the \"social determinants of health\"\u000d\u000a      school of social epidemiology made famous by Michael Marmot and Richard\u000d\u000a      Wilkinson. It lays bare the social determinants of the \"social\u000d\u000a      determinants of health.\"\u000d\u000a    Professor King and the members of his research group have published on a\u000d\u000a      wide range of topics within this research agenda. Due to space\u000d\u000a      considerations, we can only discuss a selection of these publications.\u000d\u000a    In a series of articles, including publications in The Lancet,\u000d\u000a      Professor King and his collaborators investigated the determinants of the\u000d\u000a      seven million premature deaths that occurred throughout the post-communist\u000d\u000a      world after the transition to capitalism. The crucial finding was that\u000d\u000a      radical privatization was associated with heightened working-age\u000d\u000a      mortality. In another article published in PLoSMED, Professor King\u000d\u000a      showed that IMF mandated austerity programs led to a tuberculosis epidemic\u000d\u000a      in Eastern Europe. Another member of King's research group, Alexander\u000d\u000a      Kentikelenis, built on this work with an article in The Lancet,\u000d\u000a      showing that the IMF-supported austerity programme in Greece led to\u000d\u000a      increased suicides and HIV incidence. Related to these articles, King\u000d\u000a      published an article showing that banking crises increased heart disease\u000d\u000a      mortality. David Stuckler, a member of the research team and University\u000d\u000a      Lecturer from 2011-2013, combined the findings from these papers for his\u000d\u000a      book The Body Economic: recession, budget battles, and the politics of\u000d\u000a        life and death, published in 2013. (Stuckler subsequently took up a\u000d\u000a      position in Oxford in April 2013, but the research for and writing of The\u000a        Body Economic was done while he was a lecturer in the Department of\u000d\u000a      Sociology at Cambridge.) In two articles published in health policy\u000d\u000a      journals, Professor King used political sociology research methods to\u000d\u000a      study the way in which multinational drug companies influenced the\u000d\u000a      scientific evaluation of, and the decision to reimburse, very expensive\u000d\u000a      patent-protected drugs in Poland (so called `niche-busters'). This\u000d\u000a      research was based on over 100 interviews with key stake-holders in the\u000d\u000a      pharmaceutical policy domain and an analysis of several hundred scientific\u000d\u000a      evaluations of drugs made by the Polish Health Technology Assessment\u000d\u000a      Agency, as well as an analysis of conflict of interest statements of key\u000d\u000a      decision makers. This research showed how multinational drug companies\u000d\u000a      used their financial power to influence and co-opt every group of actors &#8212;\u000d\u000a      from politicians to scientists to patient organizations &#8212; involved in the\u000d\u000a      scientific evaluation process and reimbursement decisions. As a result,\u000d\u000a      spending on `niche-busters' was rising to an unsustainable level, and more\u000d\u000a      than half of such drugs that were recommended for reimbursement lacked\u000d\u000a      positive scientific evaluations.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35396","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    As summarised above, this research has had direct and indirect impacts in\u000a      five areas:\u000a    &#8226; Work with the NUS which has informed their policies and\u000a        interventions\u000a    Phipps' work in the area of sexual-violence policy led the NUS to ask her\u000a      to provide consultancy for the Hidden Marks report (detailed in\u000a      Section 2). This was launched at the 2010 NUS Women's Conference, and the\u000a      debate on its recommendations led to the NUS `zero tolerance' campaign\u000a      detailed below. The other main recommendation (for students' unions and\u000a      universities to develop cross-institutional policies to tackle violence\u000a      against women) has been more difficult for the NUS to implement, although\u000a      some successes are detailed below. The NUS Women's Campaign subsequently\u000a      adopted the issue of violence and objectification towards women students\u000a      as its lead campaign [see Section 5, C1], and Phipps' contribution to Hidden\u000a      Marks was a major factor in the award of the grant to conduct the `That's\u000a      What She Said' study [C2a]. This was launched at the 2013 NUS\u000a      Women's Conference, where delegates adopted a number of policies such as a\u000a      national `zero-tolerance' charter and motions against street harassment\u000a      and rape apology on campus, as well as `pimps and hos' parties,\u000a      slut-dropping and the Uni Lad website [C1]. It was also debated at the NUS\u000a      National Conference, where President Liam Burns welcomed its findings and\u000a      stated that it highlighted a need to introduce gender balancing across NUS\u000a      committees [C1].\u000a    &#8226; Improved public and policy understanding of the issues of violence\u000a        against female students and `lad culture' in UK HE\u000a    Phipps' research has been extensively covered by the British media and\u000a      has been read, cited and disseminated by policy-makers and third-sector\u000a      organisations, informing their knowledge of the issue and current and\u000a      planned interventions. `That's What She Said' was featured in over\u000a      40 separate articles in various tabloid and broadsheet newspapers,\u000a      magazines and student publications &#8212; for instance The Guardian, The\u000a        Independent, The Huffington Post, The Times, The\u000a        New Statesman, Times Higher Education, the Telegraph,\u000a      Glamour magazine and The F Word [C3]. It also featured in a\u000a      number of blogs and there were lively discussions on many of the news\u000a      articles [C3], as well as a `Tweetathon' hosted by the Everyday Sexism\u000a      project in which over 300 men and women posted [C3]. Statements were made\u000a      in response to the report by high-profile individuals such as Diane Abbott\u000a      MP, Polly Williams (Senior Policy Adviser, Equality Challenge Unit) and\u000a      Nicola Dandridge (Chief Executive of Universities UK) [C3] and by YWCA\u000a      England and Wales [C3], and the NUS have been in discussions with\u000a      ministers and organisations such as the Equality Challenge Unit about a\u000a      potential summit on the issues [C2]. The NUS have stated: `The media and\u000a      public interest in the research has already facilitated our efforts to put\u000a      the recommendations into practice' [C2]. The media and public debate built\u000a      on earlier responses to the Hidden Marks report, for example from\u000a      Sandra Horley OBE (CEO of national domestic violence charity Refuge) [C3]\u000a      and journalist Julie Bindel (whose piece sparked a lively discussion)\u000a      [C3].\u000a    &#8226; Students' unions attempting to tackle problems associated with `lad\u000a        culture' and adopting `zero-tolerance' policies in relation to sexual\u000a        harassment and abuse\u000a    Phipps' work with the NUS has led directly to a number of students'\u000a      unions adopting `zero-tolerance' policies or putting in place other\u000a      initiatives to address problematic `laddish' behaviour. In an informal\u000a      survey of 75 students' unions conducted by the NUS in 2012, 96 per cent\u000a      had engaged with the Hidden Marks report in some way (passed\u000a      policy in their union relating to it or otherwise tried to take forward\u000a      the recommendations), and 75 per cent had run a `zero-tolerance' campaign\u000a      [C2a] in line with the model developed by the NUS, which requires unions\u000a      to take measures including awareness-raising, training for union staff\u000a      working in bars and at events, instituting clear reporting procedures,\u000a      developing relationships with local police, engaging with sports clubs and\u000a      societies, and doing an audit of potentially sexist union-sponsored events\u000a      [C2b]. There have also been other responses from student groups: for\u000a      instance, in response to `That's What She Said', the Oxford\u000a      University Rugby Club launched GoodLad, a campaign which involves\u000a      providing gender workshops for players, which sits within a broader Oxford\u000a      Students' Union campaign entitled `It Happens Here' which aims to address\u000a      issues of sexual violence and harassment primarily through targeting\u000a      sports clubs and drinking societies [C4]. In addition to their\u000a      zero-tolerance campaign, the University of Birmingham Guild of Students\u000a      teamed up with the local branch of Hollaback, a global movement\u000a      which aims to end street harassment, to tackle harassment on campus [C4].\u000a      The Sussex Students' Union zero-tolerance campaign was also set up\u000a      following `That's What She Said', and runs alongside an initiative\u000a      within the University to develop a clear process of reporting and to\u000a      ensure a consistent level of support and signposting for survivors of\u000a      sexual violence [C5].\u000a    &#8226; Institutions developing procedural frameworks around reporting and\u000a        addressing violence against women students\u000a    Although prompting institutional responses has been difficult, there are\u000a      examples of universities responding positively to Phipps' work with the\u000a      NUS. For instance, in Autumn\/Winter 2012 she gave substantive input to the\u000a      drafting of the Sexual Assault policy at Corpus Christi College Oxford and\u000a      continues to give advice as it is implemented; if this is successful, the\u000a      policy will be rolled out to other Oxford Colleges [C6]. In response to `That's\u000a      What She Said', Durham University instituted a group to review\u000a      discipline procedures [C7] and Glasgow University Senate are also\u000a      investigating `lad culture' within the institution [C8]. There were broad\u000a      discussions amongst faculty and students at Sussex University following\u000a      the publication of Hidden Marks, with the Students Against Sexual\u000a      Harassment Campaign being set up in response; a Sexual Violence working\u000a      group was also set up as a collaboration between the institution and\u000a      students in 2012, aiming to establish a clear process of reporting and\u000a      ensure a consistent level of support and signposting for survivors of\u000a      sexual violence. To date the University has funded training to all key\u000a      front-line staff in the University and Union on how to support survivors,\u000a      and has started working on draft guidance for all University staff on\u000a      supporting survivors and signposting them to specialist services [C5].\u000a    &#8226; Governmental, public and third-sector organisations including\u000a        students as a key demographic in their policies and initiatives\u000a    In response to the Hidden Marks report, the Home Office agreed to\u000a      add information on violence against women and girls to its `Student\u000a        Survival Guide' published in partnership with the NUS, to make links\u000a      with the NUS on their `This is Abuse' campaign targeted at teenagers and\u000a      to engage with the Association of Chief Police Officers to try to improve\u000a      advice given to students on violence [C9]. There are also a number of\u000a      examples of local governmental and non-governmental bodies acting on the\u000a      intelligence in Hidden Marks and `That's What She Said'.\u000a      For instance, in response to Hidden Marks, Lincolnshire Police\u000a      produced a specific factsheet on students and domestic abuse [C10], and\u000a      the Nottinghamshire Domestic Violence Forum began working in partnership\u000a      with students from the University of Nottingham on an awareness-raising\u000a      campaign [C10]. In response to `That's What She Said', the Scottish\u000a      White Ribbon Campaign started a collaboration with NUS Scotland on a\u000a      series of postcards, aiming to inspire a national dialogue around sexist\u000a      banter [C10]. As a result of both reports, the national End Violence\u000a      Against Women Coalition have now taken steps to broaden their successful\u000a      prevention work in schools to include universities, with a pilot project,\u000a      on which they will work with Phipps, planned for early 2014 [C11].

Although gender equality in HE has been a long-held\u000a      ideal and is now a requirement under the Gender Equality Duty, this\u000a      research suggests that universities are far from equitable institutions\u000a      and that female students are suffering discomfort, sexual harassment and\u000a      occasionally violence as the result of the growth of student `lad\u000a      culture'. This feeds into a number of different debates: around violence\u000a      against women and girls, the so-called `crisis of masculinity', and the\u000a      role, values and responsiveness of our HE communities.\u000a    The impact in this case study is underpinned by research carried out\u000a      between 2008 and 2013, which initially focused on UK sexual-violence\u000a      policy and criminal-justice procedures [see Section 3, R1, R2], and\u000a      highlighted a need for more emphasis on prevention and under-served groups\u000a      in relation to criminal justice and support. Phipps' expertise in this\u000a      area, and her developing interest in students as an under-served\u000a      population, led the NUS to ask her to work with them on the Hidden\u000a        Marks project [R3], a survey of over 2,000 female students in UK\u000a      further and higher education, focused on their perceptions of safety and\u000a      experiences of stalking, sexual harassment and physical and sexual\u000a      violence. Phipps gave feedback on drafts of the survey instrument,\u000a      guidance on analysis of the qualitative data and comments on several\u000a      drafts of the report [R3]. The report found that 14 per cent of\u000a      respondents had experienced serious sexual or physical violence while at\u000a      university, and 68 per cent sexual harassment. Ten per cent had reported\u000a      their experiences to the police and 4 per cent to their institution. The Hidden\u000a        Marks report was widely disseminated and discussed in media and\u000a      policy circles and, following its publication, Phipps co-authored a paper\u000a      comparing the situation in the UK to that in the US, where the issue has\u000a      been high on the public and policy agenda for decades and where federal\u000a      laws mandate universities to take action [R4].\u000a    The success of this work with the NUS led directly to Phipps' commission\u000a      by the organisation to conduct a study on `lad culture' in HE with\u000a      researcher Isabel Young. This project consisted of an extensive literature\u000a      review, qualitative interviews and focus groups with 40 women from England\u000a      and Scotland on their experiences of university life, and `lad culture' in\u000a      particular. It found that, although the preserve of a minority of men,\u000a      `lad culture' was felt to dominate the social side of university life.\u000a      Respondents described it as being characterised by sexist and sexualised\u000a      `banter' and other activities, which could easily spill over into sexual\u000a      harassment and violence. The report, entitled `That's What She Said'\u000a      [R5], linked this to the so-called `crisis of masculinity' and\u000a      encroachment of economic values into UK HE, and argued that accelerating\u000a      privatisation could exacerbate such cultures through its perpetuation of\u000a      competitive and individualistic values, and threaten support services\u000a      through outsourcing and the rationalisation of pastoral care.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35400","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Farsides' research has directly informed the development of policy and\u000a      practice in relation to both solid-organ donation and transplantation and\u000a      the donation and use of human embryos, eggs and sperm and other human\u000a      tissue in scientific and clinical settings. Her empirical and theoretical\u000a      work has informed both the high-level principles upon which guidance and\u000a      recommendations have been based and the ground-level advice and guidance\u000a      offered to practitioners [see Section 5, C1-C6].\u000a    Solid-organ donation\u000a    In 2008, the Organ Donation Taskforce (ODT) reported on barriers to organ\u000a      donation and made recommendations to improve donation rates by 50 per\u000a      cent. In 2013, NHS Blood and Transplant was able to announce that it had\u000a      met that target. Farsides' research on the ethics of donation underpinned\u000a      several of the reports and documents that cumulatively resulted in this\u000a      improvement C2-C6].\u000a    Opt-out\u000a    Following their main report, the ODT was charged by the Chief Medical\u000a      Officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, to look at the issue of `Opt-out' and\u000a      Farsides was asked to chair an ethics sub-group. The group's report was\u000a      seen as decisive in the Taskforce's decision not to support an Opt-out\u000a      system for organ donation [C2]. However, the open tone and careful\u000a      argument of the report were widely acknowledged even by proponents of the\u000a      change, thus allowing the Taskforce to keep communications open with\u000a      bodies such as the British Medical Association (BMA) who were campaigning\u000a      heavily for an Opt-out system [C2-C6].\u000a    Donation after circulatory death\u000a    Farsides was the first ethicist appointed to the UK Donation Ethics\u000a      Committee which has now published definitive guidance entitled An\u000a        Ethical Framework for Controlled Donation after Circulatory Death.\u000a      Farsides contributed by developing the substantive ethical content and in\u000a      drafting recommendations to make them fit-for-purpose in the clinical\u000a      setting. Her input relied not only on her research into organ donation but\u000a      also on her longstanding research on end-of-life care more generally. This\u000a      guidance addresses the specific legal and ethical issues faced by\u000a      health-care professionals caring for potential organ donors which were\u000a      identified in the original Taskforce report as a key obstacle to\u000a      increasing levels of donation. The 50 per cent increase in donation\u000a      required by the ODT and announced in 2013 is in large part due to the\u000a      increased willingness and ability of staff to facilitate donation after\u000a      circulatory death [C2-C6].\u000a    Embryo donation\u000a    In 2011 Farsides was appointed as a member of the Nuffield Council on\u000a      Bioethics Working Party on Human Bodies in Medicine and Research; amongst\u000a      other activities, she was responsible for drafting Chapter 5 of the\u000a      report, which set out the substantive ethical framework informing the\u000a      recommendations (with Tim Lewes, Cambridge University). The Council's\u000a      report has already influenced key policy-makers, most notably the HFEA,\u000a      which cited the influence of the Council's work when raising the level of\u000a      payment to egg donors [C1]\u000a    Definition of `spare' in the context of embryo donation\u000a    To ensure valid consent for the donation of embryos for treatment or\u000a      research purposes, the embryo must first be defined as spare in a sense\u000a      acceptable to the creating couple. The research [R4] has led us to an\u000a      understanding that certain practices work against this principle. In turn\u000a      these findings have informed subsequent work on the establishment of\u000a      robust donation frameworks [R6; C1, C6].\u000a    National guidance on consent for donation in the context of\u000a          stem-cell research\u000a    In 2013, Farsides was asked to Co-Chair a sub-group of SABTO, the\u000a      Governmental Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood Tissues and Organs,\u000a      which was writing new national guidance relating to consent in the context\u000a      of cell-based advanced therapies. The group relied heavily on the work\u000a      reported from Farsides' Wellcome Trust-funded project `A framework for the\u000a      acquisition of embryos for research' [R2, R5, R6] which engaged directly\u000a      with stakeholders in the field to attempt to establish a consensus\u000a      approach to consent for the donation of embryos in the context of\u000a      stem-cell research. Farsides established the ethical principles informing\u000a      the guidance, enabling a workable document which gives due consideration\u000a      to risk management, operational feasibility and ethical governance in a\u000a      field that is growing in scientific, commercial and, hopefully, clinical\u000a      importance [C7].\u000a    Good practice in egg, sperm and embryo donation\u000a    In 2012, Farsides was appointed to the HFEA's National Donation Strategy\u000a      Group charged with investigating obstacles to egg, sperm and embryo\u000a      donation and establishing guidance for good practice in clinics. She has\u000a      worked with the Chair, Professor Sheila McClean, to establish the\u000a      underlying ethical and legal principles informing the group's work and\u000a      collaborated on the production of practical tools to enhance information\u000a      provision and consent processes within clinics [C1]. Farsides' normative\u000a      and empirical ethics research has allowed the group to provide clearly\u000a      argued and evidence-based advice.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Work by Farsides has had a significant impact on public policy and\u000a      professional practice and has led to measurable improvement in outcomes.\u000a      Farsides' research has contributed to an increase of 50 per cent in organ\u000a      donations. Her work has facilitated the resolution of ethical issues for\u000a      clinicians caring for potential organ donors, for example through the\u000a      establishment of an ethical framework for caring for donors after\u000a      circulatory death. In terms of embryo donation, her research has\u000a      influenced current practice and policy around consent and payment for\u000a      donation, and led to the revisiting of guidance relating to donation and\u000a      freezing policies.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Sussex\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Sussex (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Sussex","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007806}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000aR1 Ehrich, K., Williams, C. and Farsides, B.

The research underpinning the\u000a      impact described here has taken place at the BSMS\/Sussex since 2006. Over\u000a      a range of funded research projects (Wellcome Trust, National Institute\u000a      for Health Research, Economic and Social Research Council), she has\u000a      employed a novel methodological approach entailing the combination of\u000a      mixed empirical methods and philosophical\/medico-legal analysis. She\u000a      introduced and developed the use of Ethical Discussion Groups (EDGs) [see\u000a      Section 3, R1, R4] within the context of observational and interview-based\u000a      studies. This is an approach whereby practitioners who have previously\u000a      been interviewed and observed in their professional setting are invited to\u000a      participate in a group discussion facilitated by an ethicist. The data\u000a      collected from these interventions have highlighted issues that needed to\u000a      be addressed and have contributed to identifying workable solutions to\u000a      complex ethical, legal and clinical issues identified as important by\u000a      practitioners in the field [R4, R5].\u000a    In relation to embryos, Farsides' research has considered the attitudes\u000a      and beliefs of those who work in Assisted Reproductive services,\u000a      Embryology, and Stem Cell laboratories, particularly in relation to\u000a      donation for research and treatment [R1, R2, R4, R5]. It has addressed\u000a      questions of how and when to approach clients with regard to donation, how\u000a      to define an embryo as `spare', how to conceptualise and then acquire\u000a      consent for the donation of embryos for treatment or research, and how\u000a      best to construct robust regulatory and advisory frameworks [R5]. This\u000a      work has been funded by the Wellcome Trust. This research has led to a\u000a      significant number of peer- reviewed publications, all of which rely\u000a      heavily on the data collected within the Ethical Discussion Groups led by\u000a      Farsides. The findings have been particularly influential in prompting\u000a      professional and regulatory bodies to revisit the basis upon which an\u000a      embryo is defined as spare and thereby available for research. Through her\u000a      work with the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, Farsides has also directly\u000a      influenced the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority's (HFEA)\u000a      position on payment for egg donation for treatment and research.\u000a    With regard to solid-organ donation, Farsides has been a major expert\u000a      contributor to the national debate regarding consent to donation. Her work\u000a      has been highly influential, gaining support from individuals and bodies\u000a      key to the development of donation strategy in the UK. Her defence of the\u000a      current `Opt-in' system and her innovative approach to the interpretation\u000a      of best interest within a donation context have been widely acknowledged\u000a      [R6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"36240","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The primary impact objective of Dupr&#233;'s research, and that of the Egenis\u000a      Centre more broadly, has\u000a      been about improving public understanding of science &#8212; through promoting\u000a      more sophisticated\u000a      appreciations of genetics and of evolution, and informing public\u000a      discourse, which can lead to better\u000a      informed decision-making. The research has obvious and immediate relevance\u000a      to this goal, and\u000a      Dupr&#233; has disseminated his research findings to a variety of specialist\u000a      and non-specialist\u000a      audiences. A central strategy has been to speak in a variety of forums and\u000a      to publish in a wide\u000a      variety of media, from academic papers to general news media, from\u000a      podcasts to radio broadcasts,\u000a      to stimulate better-informed discussion of biological issues.\u000a    Dupr&#233; gave evidence to the House of Lords Select Committee on Science and\u000a      Technology Inquiry\u000a      on Genomic Medicine (April 30, 2008). He emphasised, inter alia,\u000a      the need for better patient\u000a      understanding of genetic tests. In paragraph 6.7 of its report (Section 5,\u000a      Reference 1) the\u000a      Committee recommended that `debate should aim to improve public\u000a        understanding of genetic risk\u000a        and predictive testing in common complex disorders', a\u000a      recommendation accepted in the\u000a      Government response: `We have asked the HGC to consider how to generate\u000a        demonstrably\u000a        effective and informative debate around the issues raised by complex\u000a        diseases' (2).\u000a    Dupr&#233; was later asked to write an article, `Are there \"Genes For\"\u000a      Traits?' (March 8, 2010), for\u000a      BioNews, a website dedicated to promoting better public understanding of\u000a      genetics and related\u000a      areas. The article was reproduced as part of a School Resource Pack,\u000a      `Spectrum of Opinion:\u000a      Genes, Autism and Psychological Spectrum Disorders', produced by the\u000a      Progress Educational\u000a      Trust (PET), with the aim of informing debate on assisted conception and\u000a      genetics. The pack,\u000a      piloted at the Robert Napier School in Gillingham, Kent, is available for\u000a      download by teachers to\u000a      support lessons and homework on the topic (3). He was also invited to give\u000a      a keynote presentation\u000a      to an international conference in the Netherlands (14-16 March 2013) on\u000a      `Genetics Education in\u000a      the 21st Century, Design Criteria and Good Practices', for an audience of\u000a      100 researchers,\u000a      developers, teacher trainers and teachers in science education.\u000a    Dupr&#233; was invited to take part in the first Nobel Week Dialogue, in\u000a      connection with the 2012 Nobel\u000a      awards, in which he participated in panels on genetics and nurture, and on\u000a      human evolution (4).\u000a      Contributors included leading scientists (e.g. seven Nobel Laureates) and\u000a      policymakers (e.g. the\u000a      US Secretary for Energy), and the proceedings, which took place before an\u000a      audience of more than\u000a      1200 people, were streamed to a worldwide online audience via\u000a      Nobelprize.org. Films of the\u000a      discussions have been posted on the Nobel Week Dialogue site and on\u000a      YouTube. Dupr&#233; was\u000a      quoted in a piece on the event for the Bloomberg News website. The\u000a      Bloomberg science\u000a      correspondent later noted that reading Dupr&#233;'s work had led him to change\u000a      his reporting of\u000a      genetics, such as avoiding using words like `blueprint' (5).\u000a    Further specific impact relates to public understanding of evolution.\u000a      This includes the debate\u000a      generated by Dupr&#233;'s criticism of the traditional `Tree of Life'\u000a      representation of evolution. On\u000a      January 21 2009, New Scientist published a cover feature entitled\u000a      `Why Darwin was Wrong about\u000a      the Tree of Life', which quoted Dupr&#233;, as did the Daily Telegraph (January\u000a      22 2009) (6). A\u000a      consequence of these two articles was considerable international debate,\u000a      including among\u000a      creationists and scientists, questioning Darwinism further and quoting\u000a      Dupr&#233; in blogs and\u000a      discussion forums online, for example NEUROLOGICA blog, Sandwalk,\u000a      Darwin's God blogspot,\u000a      Who is Your Creator?, and Texas Citizens for Science.\u000a    Dupr&#233;'s work on Darwinism has been presented to a wide range of audiences\u000a      in talks in the USA,\u000a      Mexico, Israel, Canada, Belgium, France, Norway, Germany and the UK,\u000a      including a contribution\u000a      to the prestigious Cambridge Darwin lectures in 2009, with an audience of\u000a      c. 800. The podcast of\u000a      that talk has been downloaded almost 26,000 times since March 2009 (7). In\u000a      December 2009,\u000a      Dupr&#233; gave a talk to the American Philosophical Association on `Post\u000a      Genomic Darwinism and\u000a      Human Nature'. In the week following, the Cambridge Darwin Lecture podcast\u000a      received 2,193\u000a      downloads, circa 20 times its weekly average. A talk on Darwinism at the\u000a      American Association for\u000a      the Advancement of Science meeting in 2009 was followed by an interview on\u000a      the BBC World\u000a      Service; the BBC interviewer later stated that Dupr&#233; had made a\u000a      `considerable contribution' to\u000a      extending public understanding of Darwinism (8). The talk contributed to\u000a      Dupr&#233;'s election to a\u000a      Fellowship of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the\u000a      only UK-based\u000a      philosopher with this distinction, further raising the international\u000a      public profile and reach of his work,\u000a      and augmenting its impact-generating capacities.\u000a    In 2012, Dupr&#233; published a column for Project Syndicate (9), which works\u000a      with 475 leading\u000a      newspapers in 151 countries (and one of the top five internet news sources\u000a      in the world for 2012,\u000a      according to the influential Real Clear website). There he argued for the\u000a      importance of open\u000a      debate about weaknesses in current evolutionary theory, despite the\u000a      dangers of unintentionally\u000a      lending encouragement to anti-evolutionists in so doing. This column\u000a      prompted extensive\u000a      commentary and discussion in leading and widely-read science blogs,\u000a      including a critical\u000a      discussion on Jerry Coyne's Why Evolution is True, and a defence\u000a      on Massimo Pigliucci's\u000a      RationallySpeaking (10).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    John Dupr&#233; has been engaged in an intensive investigation of contemporary\u000a      genomic science and\u000a      its implications for policy, practice and public understanding.

Under his direction, in 2007 Egenis was\u000a      awarded a further &#163;4.1m,\u000a      continuing it for another five years. Over the last 10 years, Dupr&#233;'s\u000a      research has led the Egenis\u000a      research agenda, and his public engagement and impact activities have\u000a      complemented and driven\u000a      those of Egenis as a whole. The research has been directed at providing a\u000a      philosophical\u000a      understanding of recent work in molecular biology which has undermined\u000a      widespread assumptions\u000a      about the nature of genetic inheritance (Section 3, Reference 1). At the\u000a      same time, he has\u000a      presented his work in a variety of ways that are widely accessible to\u000a      general audiences. He has\u000a      explored the relevance of these scientific developments to a broad range\u000a      of issues, including\u000a      understandings of health and illness, ideas of `human nature' and\u000a      `normality', and the implications\u000a      of these both for important social categories such as gender and `race',\u000a      and also for philosophical\u000a      issues such as the possibility of free will (2). Not only has research in\u000a      genomics illustrated the\u000a      complexity of interactions between multiple genes and multiple features of\u000a      the environment in\u000a      determining phenotypes, the emerging field of epigenetics has also\u000a      provided increasing\u000a      understanding of the ways that environmental factors can modulate the\u000a      structure and behaviour of\u000a      the genome. He has also been concerned with a number of ramifications of\u000a      these central\u000a      developments in genomics in other areas of biology, especially\u000a      evolutionary theory (3).\u000a    With respect to evolution, Dupr&#233; has argued that research in genomics and\u000a      epigenetics decisively\u000a      undermines the popular notion of grounding human nature in psychological\u000a      modules evolved in the\u000a      Pleistocene era. Applying understandings of microbiology derived from\u000a      genomic tools, he has\u000a      explored the implications of the phenomenon of lateral gene transfer for\u000a      the popular Darwinian\u000a      notion of the `Tree of Life' (4). In the `Questioning the Tree of Life'\u000a      Network &#8212; an international\u000a      collaboration between philosophers of biology and biologists, led by\u000a      Egenis with Dupr&#233; as PI, and\u000a      funded by the Leverhulme Trust &#8212; the participants have supported Dupr&#233;'s\u000a      view that the Tree of\u000a      Life is an increasingly questionable construct.\u000a    Dupr&#233;'s argument in favour of understanding human development as an\u000a      interactive process,\u000a      constantly driven by environmental factors as much as by biological\u000a      causes, provides a picture of\u000a      developmental plasticity quite incompatible with traditional ideas of\u000a      `biology as destiny', especially\u000a      in respect to gender. With respect to `race', the ability of complex\u000a      genetic screens in certain\u000a      contexts to make reliable predictions of self-identified `race' has had\u000a      some tendency to revive ideas\u000a      of race as a biological category or natural kind. Dupr&#233; has provided\u000a      detailed analyses of this\u000a      population genetic research which show that such ideas about race are\u000a      quite unjustified (4, 5).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"36243","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"690791","Name":"Ukraine"},{"GeoNamesId":"226074","Name":"Uganda"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"3865483","Name":"Argentina"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Rappert has helped identify poorly recognized issues and facilitated\u000a        international debate through a dedicated programme of outreach\u000d\u000a      activities and educational work on the responsible stewardship of the life\u000d\u000a      sciences (undertaken with Prof. Malcolm Dando &#8212; Bradford). Since 2008,\u000d\u000a      over 1,800 bioscientists in industry, academia and government have taken\u000d\u000a      part in more than 75 workshops that have redressed practitioners' lack of\u000d\u000a      familiarity with security related policy initiatives and encouraged them\u000d\u000a      to give serious consideration &#8212; in many cases for the first time &#8212; to the\u000d\u000a      issue of how to avoid the hostile use of their findings, methods, and\u000d\u000a      techniques.

In 15\u000d\u000a      of the 16 countries visited, Rappert partnered with government agencies\u000d\u000a      and professional science organisations.\u000d\u000a    Rappert advised in the organization of national and regional biosecurity\u000d\u000a      meetings in Ukraine, Israel, Uganda, and the Netherlands held by their\u000d\u000a      national science academies (Section 5, Reference 1). He has aided established\u000a        networks of concerned practitioners in many of the fieldwork site\u000d\u000a      countries (2, 10). Rappert's commitment to bringing together varied\u000d\u000a      communities in setting future agendas is evidenced by his edited books,\u000d\u000a      which are notable for the range of their non-academic contributors\u000d\u000a      (Section 3, References 1, 3, 4).\u000d\u000a    Rappert has not only drawn attention to a central area of concern, but\u000d\u000a      has helped provide the tools, impetus and intellectual agenda for\u000d\u000a      affecting professional standards. In April 2011, the findings of\u000d\u000a      Rappert's outreach efforts formed an integral component of a submission to\u000d\u000a      the Preparatory Committee of the Seventh Review Conference of the United\u000d\u000a      Nations Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) (Section 5, Reference 3). Put\u000d\u000a      forward by Australia, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland, the submission cited\u000d\u000a      the importance of Rappert's contribution to `a stimulation of debate\u000d\u000a        and reflection among researchers on life sciences, security and the\u000d\u000a        potentially destructive application of their activities', and\u000d\u000a      described how many of those who took part in Rappert's seminars spoke of\u000d\u000a      them as `an eye-opener'. The submission concluded that Rappert's\u000d\u000a      research helped `provide the base for possible ways forward, such as\u000d\u000a        the inclusion of educational modules on biosecurity for biosafety\u000d\u000a        officers in research facilities or the encouragement to introduce\u000d\u000a        educational modules on biosecurity in academic courses for future life\u000d\u000a        scientists'. In December 2011, the 164 governments of the BWC agreed\u000d\u000a      a 5-year plan of work. Rappert's contribution to shaping agendas\u000d\u000a      is demonstrated through reference to it in an official Working Paper\u000d\u000a      submitted by 12 nations that laid a basis for that 5-year plan (1, 2, 4).\u000d\u000a    A number of individual governments have acknowledged the importance of\u000d\u000a      his advice and evaluations: thus a 2008 report by the Netherlands'\u000d\u000a      Biosecurity Working Group, which successfully established a code of\u000d\u000a      conduct for the country's bioscientists at the request of the Dutch\u000d\u000a      Ministry of Education, Culture and Science, credited Rappert with helping\u000d\u000a      raise awareness of the potential risks of `dual use' research and with\u000d\u000a      providing a framework for understanding codes (5). A 2012 report by the US\u000d\u000a      Government's National Science Advisory Board on Biosecurity &#8212; an\u000d\u000a      organisation which has produced a \"toolkit\" and an educational module for\u000d\u000a      institutions and scientific associations &#8212; highlighted the significance of\u000d\u000a      Rappert's work in assessing codes, as well as noting his `extensive\u000d\u000a        educational engagement efforts' (6).\u000d\u000a    Rappert's work on cluster bombs has also had an impact in the wider field\u000d\u000a      of international disarmament. In part through a series of reports for\u000d\u000a      civil society organisations which were widely distributed in diplomatic\u000d\u000a      forums, he helped reframe international attention to this technology (see\u000d\u000a      Section 3, Reference 5 for an overview summary). This was done by shifting\u000a        agendas away from the terms of international humanitarian law, and\u000d\u000a      on to more precautionary principle arguments which re-distributed burdens\u000d\u000a      of proof within the negotiations. Specifically, Rappert formulated\u000d\u000a      and advocated an intellectual strategy for agreeing what should be\u000d\u000a      defined as prohibited under the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions\u000d\u000a      (Section 5, References 7, 8). This treaty was adopted in May 2008, and has\u000d\u000a      so far been signed by over 110 nations. These states held in excess of 140\u000d\u000a      million explosive submunitions. These are now prohibited from use, with\u000d\u000a      more than 64 million already destroyed. The lead negotiator for a grouping\u000d\u000a      of over 300 NGOs stated that the `change of approach that Rappert\u000d\u000a        initiated was central to the dynamic of the subsequent campaign and\u000d\u000a        provided a framing for the negotiation of definitions that allowed the\u000d\u000a        Convention on Cluster Munitions to achieve a significantly greater level\u000d\u000a        of humanitarian protection than would have otherwise been possible'\u000d\u000a      (9).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Reducing the humanitarian suffering associated with conflict is a vital\u000d\u000a      but demanding task, not least because continuing developments in science\u000d\u000a      and technology enable ever more destructive capabilities.

Rappert's research\u000d\u000a      has highlighted the growing need for effective control measures in the\u000d\u000a      overarching form of a global network for the life sciences &#8212; a network\u000d\u000a      that brings together the mutually reinforcing elements necessary to create\u000d\u000a      and strengthen a so-called `web of prevention' (Section 3, References 3\u000d\u000a      and 4). A crucial requirement and outcome of this work has been the\u000d\u000a      encouraging of interaction between scientists, policy-makers, NGOs and\u000d\u000a      others.\u000d\u000a    A central feature of his work has been to conduct workshops for\u000d\u000a      bioscientists regarding the possible `dual use' implications of their\u000d\u000a      research and the appropriateness of suggested policy responses. Since\u000d\u000a      2004, over 130 workshops with 3000+ practicing scientists have been\u000d\u000a      conducted in some 16 countries. This work (undertaken with Prof. Malcolm\u000d\u000a      Dando, Bradford) has been supported by a number of government agencies,\u000d\u000a      science academies, NGOs, think-tanks and universities (1, 3). This work\u000d\u000a      indicated little engagement among life science practitioners with concerns\u000d\u000a      about the dual use potential of their research-generated knowledge and\u000d\u000a      techniques. In response, the workshops: informed the development of\u000d\u000a      educational training, which then functioned as a basis for further\u000d\u000a      engagement with scientific practitioners and public officials; served as a\u000d\u000a      foundation for assessing and advocating international policy proposals;\u000d\u000a      and resulted in the emergence of a novel focus group methodology.\u000d\u000a    Another aspect of Rappert's work has concerned the controls governing the\u000d\u000a      appropriateness of force in armed conflict. In combination with a range of\u000d\u000a      academic and civil society organizations, he has developed an appreciation\u000d\u000a      of the limitations of government regarding the humanitarian consequences\u000d\u000a      of their use of force (5). In response, Rappert has sought the\u000d\u000a      redefinition of how the effects of weapons on civilian populations can\u000d\u000a      inform the international humanitarian rules on armed conflict. Much of\u000d\u000a      this activity has focused on the use and acceptability of so-called\u000d\u000a      'cluster bombs'. Beginning in 2005, with an analysis of the UK\u000d\u000a      government's efforts to understand the use of such weapons in the context\u000d\u000a      of international humanitarian law, this research has expanded to include\u000d\u000a      historical critiques and comparative analyses of the impact of cluster\u000d\u000a      bombs, the rules of international humanitarian law, and the potential for\u000d\u000a      international norms in limiting armed conflict. Because much of this\u000d\u000a      research has been undertaken in security and diplomatic communities where\u000d\u000a      questions of disclosure and concealment loom large, Rappert has turned to\u000d\u000a      reflect on the methodological and epistemological issues associated with\u000d\u000a      investigating and writing about secrecy and ignorance (2). This has\u000d\u000a      enabled novel forms of writing, sometimes undertaken in collaboration with\u000d\u000a      those in civil society (2, 5). Professor Rappert joined the University of\u000d\u000a      Exeter in 2003.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"36246","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1149361","Name":"Afghanistan"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","British Academy"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Influencing the execution of military operations\u000a    In early 2008, acknowledging his expertise about military planning\u000a      developed during British\u000a      Academy- and ESRC-funded research projects, King was invited to contribute\u000a      to Britain's new\u000a      counter-insurgency doctrine, Joint Doctrine Publication 3-40, Security\u000a        and Stabilisation: The\u000a        Military Contribution (Section 5, Reference 1).

Drawing\u000a      on this, King wrote a\u000a      political engagement plan, which had the effect of revising ISAF's\u000a      counter-insurgency strategy,\u000a      which, up to that point, had focused exclusively and quite unrealistically\u000a      on gaining the local\u000a      population's consent for a centralised Afghan state (2, 3). King\u000a      recommended that the\u000a      headquarters engage with local power-brokers to develop a political\u000a      campaign through existing\u000a      patrimonial networks, with the military element being subordinate to this\u000a      political strategy. This\u000a      concept was implemented as part of the civil-military campaign to secure\u000a      Kandahar City in 2010.\u000a      The Head of Prism Cell said King's contribution to the latter `cannot\u000a        be overstated' (2), and the\u000a      Chief of Staff of the Headquarters claimed that King's plan had `influenced\u000a        strategic thinking' (3).\u000a      King's impact on the reframing of strategy was recognised with an ISAF\u000a      medal. The success of the\u000a      Prism Cell is noted in the MoD Joint Doctrine Note 3\/11 `Decision-Making\u000a      and Problem-Solving:\u000a      Human and Organisational Factors' (para 313) (4). Since 2011, initially\u000a      under the aegis of the\u000a      Defence Cultural Specialist Unit, and starting with 3 Commando Brigade\u000a      Royal Marines, King has\u000a      advised successive brigades deploying into Helmand province about the\u000a      area's complex power\u000a      dynamics, and mentored the final Helmand task force in September 2013. He\u000a      has sought to\u000a      persuade Task Force Helmand and ISAF to place political engagement at the\u000a      heart of their current\u000a      transition strategy.\u000a    Shaping military training and education\u000a    As a result of his contribution to military operations and his continuing\u000a      research on the armed\u000a      forces, King has played an increasingly prominent role in military\u000a      education. He was invited to\u000a      contribute to Royal Marines Young Officer training (60 officers a year\u000a      since 2010), lecturing and\u000a      mentoring future lieutenants on stabilization and counter-insurgency in\u000a      preparation for operations.\u000a      King also delivers a Continuing Professional Development course at Exeter\u000a      on counter-insurgency\u000a      to 25 military personnel a year (since 2010), attended by\u000a      operationally-experienced officers and\u000a      non-commissioned officers who have served in Iraq and\/or Afghanistan,\u000a      often in combat roles,\u000a      including members of the Special Forces. In recognition of the esteem in\u000a      which his input to strategy\u000a      is held, the armed forces have requested that this course now runs twice a\u000a      year. King is an annual\u000a      contributor to both the Advanced and Higher Command and\u000a      Staff Courses at the Joint Services\u000a      Command and Staff College (JSCSC), lecturing and instructing officers,\u000a      including those destined\u000a      for the highest levels of command. Since 2010, 1400 middle-ranking\u000a      officers from the UK and\u000a      overseas have attended his teaching on the Advanced Course (350 a year).\u000a      From 2011 onwards,\u000a      120 senior UK and NATO military officers, diplomats, intelligence agents\u000a      and civil servants have\u000a      attended his contribution to the Higher Course. One Commanding Officer\u000a      recorded that King's\u000a      `considerable effort to generate a better understanding for our people\u000a        paid off handsomely' (5). He\u000a      was appointed to the new advisory panel of the Joint Services Command and\u000a      Staff College in\u000a      2012, is currently contributing to course design, and is a mentor on the\u000a      Higher Command and Staff\u000a      Course. There is thus an increasingly numerous cohort of officers in the\u000a      British armed forces who\u000a      have been taught by King and with whom he has close professional\u000a      relations, and whose strategic\u000a      thinking has been impacted upon and shaped by King.\u000a    Informing public policy debate\u000a    In November 2010, following the publication of his paper on Helmand\u000a      province (Section 3,\u000a      Reference 3), King was asked to give expert testimony through both oral\u000a      and written evidence to\u000a      the House of Commons All-Party Parliamentary Defence Committee hearing\u000a      into operations in\u000a      Afghanistan (Section 5, Reference 6). This evidence and the paper itself\u000a      have been widely cited in\u000a      the resulting discussions and the Committee's report. A former UK Defence\u000a      Secretary twice cited\u000a      the paper in his testimony to the Defence Committee's inquiry on\u000a      operations in Afghanistan (7).\u000a      The paper was listed on the Chief of Defence Staff's 2013 recommended\u000a      reading list for military\u000a      personnel, with a commentary by a senior officer (8).\u000a    King has also influenced public debates by using the media to communicate\u000a      his work beyond the\u000a      military and policy-making communities, including an appearance on BBC2's\u000a      Newsnight (20\u000a      September 2010) with a former commander of the SAS, and articles in The\u000a        Guardian and Prospect\u000a      (9, 10).\u000a    Most recently, as part of ESRC and Nuffield Foundation projects on\u000a      `cohesion', King has\u000a      contributed to practitioner debates about female accession to combat\u000a      units, demonstrating that the\u000a      evidence from Iraq and Afghanistan shows that in a highly professional\u000a      military, women should be\u000a      able to serve in the infantry. To promote this view widely and\u000a      effectively, he organised a major\u000a      international joint scholarly and practitioner conference at All Souls\u000a      College, Oxford in March 2013\u000a      entitled Frontline: Combat and Cohesion in Iraq and Afghanistan.\u000a      The conference included 48\u000a      prominent academic and military practitioners from 11 countries, including\u000a      representatives from the\u000a      highest ranks of the British Army and NATO, such as the Deputy Supreme\u000a      Allied Commander's\u000a      special gender representative. King's report from this conference has been\u000a      sent to the latter and to\u000a      selected senior officers in NATO, the British Army and the UK Ministry of\u000a      Defence. In response to\u000a      the decision by the former US Secretary of State for Defence, Leon\u000a      Panetta, to integrate women\u000a      into combat units, King has published pieces on female accession in the\u000a      premier defence\/military\u000a      policy\/practitioner journals in the UK and US, such as Parameters (the\u000a      journal of the US Army War\u000a      College), the Royal United Services Institute's RUSI Journal\u000a      (Section 3, Reference 5) and the\u000a      British Army Review, thus reaching a range of influential\u000a      professional audiences. He has also\u000a      appeared on Radio 4 to discuss these issues (Section 5, References 10).\u000a      Through giving talks and\u000a      seminars at venues in the US such as West Point and the Army War College,\u000a      to military personnel\u000a      both affected by Panetta's decision and\/or currently attempting to\u000a      institutionalise it, he has advised\u000a      key practitioners and sought to impact on their thinking and professional\u000a      practices.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Since the end of the Cold War, and especially in the last decade, the\u000a      armed forces have\u000a      undergone profound organizational and cultural transformations. Anthony\u000a      King's research has\u000a      been able to make a notable contribution to this process. Through critical\u000a      sociological analysis, he\u000a      has: enhanced the British army's socio-political grasp of key contemporary\u000a      theatres of operation;\u000a      informed the education and training of high-ranking officers; and\u000a      stimulated debates about defence\u000a      policy. He has also developed close relationships with the armed forces\u000a      and the defence policy\u000a      communities, as well as communicating his expertise to a wider audience\u000a      through various media\u000a      appearances. In sum, King's work on and with the armed forces has had an\u000a      impact in three key\u000a      areas: influencing the execution of military operations; shaping\u000a        military training and\u000a        education; informing public policy debate.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Exeter\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Exeter (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Exeter","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"South West","UKPRN":10007792}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"1138336","Name":"Kandahar"},{"GeoNamesId":"1138336","Name":"Kandahar City"},{"GeoNamesId":"1140043","Name":"Helmand"}],"References":"\u000a    Key Publications:\u000a    \u000a1) The Combat Soldier: Infantry Tactics and Cohesion in the Twentieth\u000a        and Twenty-First Centuries.\u000a      Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013 [submitted output]\u000a    \u000a\u000a2) The Transformation of Europe's Armed Forces: From the Rhine to\u000a        Afghanistan, Cambridge:\u000a      Cambridge University Press, 2011 [submitted output]\u000a    \u000a\u000a3) `Understanding the Helmand Campaign: British Military Operations in\u000a      Afghanistan', International\u000a        Affairs, 2010, 86(2): 311-332.

Such wars\u000a      are no longer the norm. Since the 1990s, Western forces have been\u000a      primarily involved in complex\u000a      stabilization operations in the Balkans, Africa and Afghanistan. The Arab\u000a      Spring and, recent events\u000a      in Syria suggest that hybrid warfare will continue to predominate in the\u000a      near future. These changes\u000a      have compelled the military to revise many of its practices, concepts and\u000a      organizational culture.\u000a      King has helped shape this response over the last decade. He has been able\u000a      to exert influence\u000a      because his research is seen to be a faithful representation of the armed\u000a      forces, not only by\u000a      academics but also by military practitioners themselves. Using rich\u000a      empirical, comparative,\u000a      historical and ethnographic methods, he has plotted the organizational\u000a      dynamics at the heart of\u000a      contemporary military transformations, to highlight the role played by the\u000a      distinctive corporate\u000a      identity and ethos of the armed forces. In an attempt to heighten the\u000a      self-awareness of armed force\u000a      personnel, he has shown how dynamics of ethos and identity have influenced\u000a      the ways in which\u000a      campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan were conducted.\u000a    In the face of new conflicts, and in light of budget cuts following the\u000a      Cold War, many scholars have\u000a      argued that the armed forces are getting smaller. King has taken an\u000a      alternative view. In his 2013\u000a      monograph, supported by grants from the British Academy and ESRC, he\u000a      described how the\u000a      globalizing armed forces of the early 21st century are\u000a      undergoing a process of concentration and\u000a      transnationalization. Accordingly, mass citizen armies have been replaced\u000a      by smaller, increasingly\u000a      professionalized military organisations. These professional forces are\u000a      more technically capable\u000a      than their predecessors, and now co-operate with each other ever more\u000a      closely across national\u000a      borders in training and on operations. In his 2011 monograph on European\u000a      military\u000a      transformations, King analysed military headquarters and the evolution of\u000a      Western military\u000a      planning procedures, to develop a deeper understanding of military\u000a      practice. This focus has been\u000a      the basis for much of the impact his work has generated. His most recent\u000a      work on infantry tactics\u000a      and cohesion, supported by Nuffield and ESRC, extends this story back to\u000a      World War I, to explore\u000a      the different ways in which today's professional armies generate cohesion\u000a      among their soldiers on\u000a      the battlefield. He has gone against conventional views, to argue that\u000a      females can serve as combat\u000a      soldiers. Contributing to current debates about female accession in the US\u000a      and UK, he has\u000a      published a number of policy-relevant papers in practitioner journals.\u000a      King's 2010 and 2011 articles\u000a      in the journal International Affairs represent critical and widely\u000a      cited analyses of the armed forces\u000a      and defence policy today. They highlight the complexity of today's\u000a      multi-agency military operations,\u000a      and suggest the ethos of the UK's military &#8212; with its preference for\u000a      high-intensity warfare, its\u000a      regimental traditions and its inter-service rivalries &#8212; might have\u000a      actually undermined its own\u000a      performance on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Service\u000a      provision for people dependent on heroin changed considerably beginning in\u000a      2001, with the introduction of pharmacy-based needle\/syringe exchange\u000a      schemes in Northern Ireland. In the first year that scheme data were\u000a      collected, 5,213 visits to needle\/syringe exchanges were recorded.\u000a      In the same year, McElrath was asked to serve on the Drug and Alcohol\u000a      Information and Research Working Group, DHSSPS, which provided further\u000a      opportunity to engage with service providers and drug policymakers, and\u000a      share research insights. In 2002, she was appointed as Specialist Advisor\u000a      to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee to assist in its investigation\u000a      into the drug trade in Northern Ireland (see below, Section 5, Sources\u000a        1-4). That role provided her with the opportunity to compile a list\u000a      of witnesses (e.g., community workers; voluntary sector) for the Committee\u000a      that they had previously overlooked. Over time, needle\/syringe exchange\u000a      schemes had expanded to include other pharmacies, and 15,828 visits to\u000a      exchanges were recorded in 2009-10. These visits involved the collection\u000a      of 153,625 syringes (see below, Section 5, Source 5).\u000a    McElrath's first recommendation in Reference 5 was that methadone\u000a      maintenance be made available as a treatment option. The DHSSPS accepted\u000a      that recommendation and agreed to establish an implementation group.\u000a      Substitute prescribing in the form of methadone or Subutex maintenance was\u000a      introduced in Northern Ireland in 2004 (see below, Section 5, Source 6).\u000a      Annual reports from the DHSSPS continue to state that References 3 and 5\u000a      were important contributing factors for the introduction of substitute\u000a      prescribing in Northern Ireland (see below, Section 5, Source 7).\u000a      The cumulative impact from the underpinning research (References 4\u000a      and 5) is demonstrated in the annual reviews of the substitute prescribing\u000a      database, issued by the DHSSPS. In 2009-10, 576 clients were in receipt of\u000a      substitute prescribing treatment in Northern Ireland (see below,\u000a        Section 5, Source 7).\u000a    Reference 5 also recommended the development of drug outreach initiatives\u000a      to work with out-of-treatment heroin users in particular. In 2003, two\u000a      community workers met with McElrath to discuss strategies for the\u000a      development of drug outreach in South Belfast. In 2004, the first drug\u000a      outreach team (DOT) was implemented in Northern Ireland. Organised\u000a      initially in the voluntary sector, the Drug Outreach Team gained a\u000a      permanent place in drug service provision when it was incorporated into\u000a      the statutory sector. It continues to serve dozens of clients who inject\u000a      drugs or smoke heroin in the Belfast region. Michele Jordan, co-author of\u000a      Reference 6 subsequently worked for several years as a drug outreach\u000a      worker in the Northern Board (see below, Section 5, Source 8). Her\u000a      outreach work focused primarily on women who were injecting drugs, hence\u000a      the diffusion of impact through Ms Jordan's outreach role.\u000a    A number of drug services extended invitations to McElrath to speak with\u000a      staff in treatment services (e.g., Northern Ireland Community Addiction\u000a      Service; Northern Ireland Community Addiction Team Forum; Community\u000a      Addiction Service, Northern Board). These requests created opportunities\u000a      to discuss research findings with individuals (e.g., service providers)\u000a      who were in a position to facilitate change. The author's appointments to\u000a      three advisory boards also helped to integrate research findings within\u000a      the context of service provision. These boards included: Dunlewey\u000a      Substance Advice Centre (2004-2009), Drug Outreach Team, South and East\u000a      Trust (2002-2005; 2008-2009), and Turas Counselling, Dundalk, County Louth\u000a      (2008-2010).\u000a    In 2004, McElrath was interviewing two respondents who participated in\u000a      the study described in Reference 6. These individuals resided in the\u000a      Southern Board where clients were not permitted to be prescribed\u000a      methadone, despite the region-wide implementation of that service. As a\u000a      consequence, the respondents made two or three trips each week to the\u000a      Republic of Ireland in order to participate in the MMT programme in that\u000a      jurisdiction. McElrath helped the clients liaise with a legal team, and\u000a      the case was accepted for judicial review (see below, Section 5, Source\u000a        9) which subsequently found that the clients had a right to obtain\u000a      MMT in the Southern Board. The additional impact from Reference 6 was that\u000a      the underpinning research contributed to changing service delivery in a\u000a      health board area.\u000a    In summary, the reach of these impacts extended to individuals\u000a      who have experienced heroin dependency. The significance of the\u000a      impacts is the expansion of service provision for marginalised groups.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The key impact focuses on the underpinning research contributions to the\u000a      health and wellbeing of individuals who are dependent on heroin in\u000a      Northern Ireland, where an estimated 828 \"problem heroin users\" resided\u000a      just prior to substantial changes in the provision of drug services. The\u000a      impact on extremely marginalised individuals who were dependent on heroin\u000a      is linked to the implementation of substitute prescribing and\u000a      needle\/syringe exchange in Northern Ireland. These services can contribute\u000a      to recovery from drug dependence and can help reduce the spread of\u000a      blood-borne viruses, e.g., HIV, among these individuals.

At the time, Northern Ireland drug policy lagged well behind\u000a      those of other regions in western Europe. Needle\/syringe exchange\u000a      services, designed to reduce the loaning and borrowing of needles among\u000a      injectors, was not available in Northern Ireland. Methadone maintenance\u000a      treatment (MMT) was not permitted, despite scientific evidence that had\u000a      demonstrated its effectiveness for treating heroin dependence. At the\u000a      time, these services had been available in Dublin, England, Scotland and\u000a      several other European regions for well over a decade. In the late 1990s,\u000a      heroin use in Northern Ireland began to escalate considerably. In the\u000a      absence of MMT, some general practitioners reluctantly began to prescribe\u000a      benzodiazepines or dihydrocodeine to their patients, although neither drug\u000a      was considered to be an effective intervention for treating heroin\u000a      dependence, and both had strong potential for additional dependency.\u000a    The underpinning body of research consisted of three studies and one\u000a      critical review (2001; 2002; 2003; 2005), conducted by Dr Karen McElrath,\u000a      a lecturer at Queen's University from 1996-2000 and Reader thereafter. The\u000a      collection of work focused on marginalised individuals who were dependent\u000a      on heroin.\u000a    References 1 and 3 are based on the first study of heroin use in Northern\u000a      Ireland (other than a master's thesis which included interviews with a few\u000a      individuals who had used heroin). McElrath conducted the study which drew\u000a      on qualitative interviews with a hidden population of adults who had used\u000a      heroin in the region. Interviews were conducted between 1997 and 1999. The\u000a        study highlighted individuals' difficulties with the limited treatment\u000a        options that were available in Northern Ireland, the stigmatised\u000a      nature of drug addiction in Northern Ireland, and how wider factors\u000a      (limited access to new needles\/syringes) placed people at risk for\u000a      blood-borne viruses, e.g. HIV.\u000a    Reference 4 was a capture-recapture prevalence study that estimated the\u000a      number of problem heroin users in Northern Ireland to be 828 (range\u000a      695-1,018 individuals). This figure equated to 13 per 10,000 persons aged\u000a      15-29 years and 6 per 10,000 persons aged 30-54, during a 12-month period\u000a      in 2000-1. Prior estimates had been based on anecdotal information\u000a      described by news media or treatment sources that omitted individuals who\u000a      were not in contact with treatment services. McElrath was the author..\u000a    The prevalence study was followed by Reference 5 which was based on a\u000a      critical review of the international literature into the effectiveness of\u000a      substitute prescribing. McElrath conducted the review and wrote the report\u000a      in 2002. The review included several recommendations to which the\u000a      Department of Health, Social Services &amp; Public Safety (DHSSPS)\u000a      responded in the Appendix of the report (pages 95-103).\u000a    Reference 6 is a study of 90 adults from a number of areas in Northern\u000a      Ireland, who had injected illicit drugs (namely heroin) within the 30-day\u000a      period prior to interview. Data were collected in 2003-4. Ms Michele\u000a      Jordan, a former undergraduate student in the School, was initially hired\u000a      to assist with the interviews. She contributed to the study in several\u000a      other significant ways, and McElrath asked Ms Jordan to be co-author of\u000a      the final report. A key research insight arising from this study was that\u000a      despite its region-wide implantation in 2004, MMT was not an option for\u000a      individuals residing in the Southern Health Board. Substitute prescribing\u000a      was limited to Subutex, a restriction that ignored the diverse needs of\u000a      individual clients and the neglected the importance of matching treatment\u000a      to clients' needs.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38407","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Since 1996 the World Health Organisation has advised that research is a\u000d\u000a      key component of suicide prevention strategies.

The study found that the\u000d\u000a      internationally recognised social costs of conflicts include psychological\u000d\u000a      damage experienced by combatants, civilians and refugee populations.\u000d\u000a      Experience from the Balkans and other regions of conflict showed that\u000d\u000a      trauma and depression are long-lasting, often resulting in the\u000d\u000a      transmission of trauma between generations and in elevated suicide rates\u000d\u000a      among young people (Tomlinson, 2007b). In Northern Ireland, personal\u000d\u000a      experience of violence was significantly associated with poor mental\u000d\u000a      health, although on measures of happiness (Tomlinson 2013), people in\u000d\u000a      Northern Ireland score highly compared with most parts of Europe. The\u000d\u000a      study drew attention to rising suicide rates especially among men in\u000d\u000a      younger age groups over the ten-year period up to 2002. One recommendation\u000d\u000a      was for policy makers to recognise the growing suicide problem, given the\u000d\u000a      lack of a suicide prevention policy at the time.\u000d\u000a    The Department for Health, Social Services and Public Safety (Northern\u000d\u000a      Ireland) (DHSSPS) subsequently commissioned a systematic literature review\u000d\u000a      to explore the links between conflict, mental health and suicide\u000d\u000a      (Tomlinson, 2007a). `The Trouble with Suicide' challenged the conventional\u000d\u000a      wisdom that the conflict generated a high level of `wartime' social\u000d\u000a      cohesion, which was said to explain both the decline in suicides in the\u000d\u000a      early 1970s and the increase in the period of peace. On the contrary, the\u000d\u000a      1970s' trend is explained by some suicides being classified as\u000d\u000a      `accidents'. The study also questioned the idea that a more peaceful\u000d\u000a      society was a less cohesive one: the factors behind the rising suicide\u000d\u000a      rate were more complex than this. They include the changing age and gender\u000d\u000a      profile of competed suicides, the resilience of groups whose identities\u000d\u000a      and livelihoods were invested in the conflict, the greater awareness of\u000d\u000a      suicide especially among younger people, and evidence of huge increases in\u000d\u000a      the consumption of alcohol, prescription drugs and illicit substances\u000d\u000a      known to cause depression.\u000d\u000a    Unlike in neighbouring jurisdictions and regions, Northern Ireland's\u000d\u000a      suicide rate uniquely continued to rise from the late 1990s, with a very\u000d\u000a      steep increase between 2004 and 2012. Further attempts were made to\u000d\u000a      comprehend the post-conflict suicide trends using data going back to the\u000d\u000a      mid-1960s. Suicide trends were found to have distinct phases which varied\u000d\u000a      by age groups and gender such that the trends for some specific groups\u000d\u000a      went against the overall trend (Tomlinson, 2012). A cohort effect was\u000d\u000a      discovered such that male children and young people who grew up in the\u000d\u000a      worst years of violence (now in their middle years) have the highest and\u000d\u000a      most rapidly increasing suicide rates in the period of peace, and largely\u000d\u000a      account for the steep upward trend in suicides following the 1998\u000d\u000a      Agreement.\u000d\u000a    These findings have implications for the identification of at-risk\u000d\u000a      individuals, groups and communities, for understanding the disconnect\u000d\u000a      between services and those in need, and for public health strategies which\u000d\u000a      need to address middle and older age groups.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38408","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Impact 1. Local level: Rural Development Fund &amp; childcare\u000a        provision\u000a      The research summarised in Research studies 1, 2 and 4, supported by\u000a      References 1, 3, 4 and 5,\u000a      has highlighted the differential impacts of rural policies on women in NI.\u000a      Particular findings include\u000a      the need to target farm-training at women living and working on farms. The\u000a      need to provide\u000a      childcare in rural areas in order to facilitate female employment was\u000a      recognised in the Rural\u000a      Childcare Stakeholder Group report (reference 3). This report recommended\u000a      that the Department\u000a      should fund a specific childcare programme, train childminders living in\u000a      rural areas and create new\u000a      childcare places.\u000a    Policy makers and civil servants have used the research extensively to\u000a      develop rural policies, most\u000a      notably, the &#163;1.5 million initiative to improve childcare provision in\u000a      rural parts of NI, launched by\u000a      DARD in 2009. Working through the Childminding Association, training\u000a        and support was\u000a        provided to create 100 new child minders and 400 new childcare places\u000a        over a two year\u000a        period. This was part of DARD's wider policy to address poverty and\u000a      social exclusion in rural\u000a      areas. As recognised by the research outlined in this case study, the\u000a      policy recognised that the\u000a      lack of rural childcare was a barrier to parents' participation in\u000a      employment, social and community\u000a      activities, and this was particularly true for women.\u000a    In the press coverage of the launch, the Minister explicitly made the\u000a      connection between the new\u000a      policy initiative and the Rural Childcare Stakeholder Group Report\u000a      (reference 3). The DARD\u000a      website on the Rural Childcare Programme also refers to the Rural\u000a      Childcare Stakeholder Group\u000a      Report as does the programme guidelines. The Rural Childcare Stakeholder\u000a      Group Report in\u000a      which Shortall participated underpinned this policy initiative.\u000a      Furthermore, Kelly and Shortall's\u000a      (2001) research (reference no. 1) is heavily used in the Rural Childcare\u000a      Stakeholder Group Report.\u000a    The impact therefore relates to a wide range of actors. For example,\u000a      policy makers and civil\u000a      servants, who drew heavily on the research to design rural policy,\u000a      childminding organisations who\u000a      were funded to train childminders, people (all women) who were trained to\u000a      be childminders and\u000a      therefore skilled for employment, as well as rural families.\u000a    Impact 2. EU level: EU rural policy\u000a      The research, summarised in Research study 3, was on foot of a commission\u000a      by the European\u000a      Parliament in 2010. This led to the publication of a policy report\u000a      (reference 2), which assesses the\u000a      situation of women in farming in the 27 EU Member States. Furthermore, the\u000a      report provides a\u000a      series of recommendations on how the Parliament could improve the position\u000a      of women in the\u000a      revised CAP policies post-2013. The report, prepared for EU civil\u000a      servants, highlighted the need to\u000a      increase women's representation in rural policy, for example, on national\u000a      monitoring committees.\u000a    The research, directly requested by EU Parliament, provides the necessary\u000a      evidence base to\u000a      inform the direction of future rural policy post-2013.\u000a    The impact relates therefore not only in terms of policymakers at an EU\u000a      level but also in terms of\u000a      achieving a greater representation of farming women on Rural\u000a        Development Programme\u000a        national monitoring committees across Europe.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    56% of the European Union (EU) population and 35% of the population of\u000a      Northern Ireland (NI) live\u000a      in rural areas.

It is\u000a      often initially understood\u000a      as a policy that subsidises the farming industry. However, the CAP has\u000a      broader reach, affecting\u000a      the lives of men and women on farms, and rural dwellers generally. As\u000a      farming income declines,\u000a      the off-farm employment of women on farms is essential to the survival of\u000a      the family farm.\u000a      Women often play a managerial role in farm decisions. While women's\u000a      position is shaped by the\u000a      fact that they do not inherit land, there is no reason women should not\u000a      play an equal role to men\u000a      in rural development programmes.

January 2000-July 2001.\u000a      Researchers: Shortall and research assistant Kelly (now working as Clerk\u000a      to the Bill Office, NI\u000a      Assembly). This project examined the implications of CAP reforms on\u000a        farm families and\u000a        people living in rural areas in NI, with a particular focus\u000a        on women. We interviewed\u000a      farming unions, women's networks, civil servants, EU officials and\u000a      conducted focus groups with\u000a      men and women on farms and rural dwellers. The report noted the need to\u000a      specifically target\u000a      women to ensure that they engaged with the Rural Development Programme. It\u000a      also noted the\u000a      issue of inadequate childcare provision in rural areas and how this\u000a        impacted on women's\u000a        employment options. The stress of minding children on a farm, which\u000a      is a workplace as well\u000a      as a home, was also highlighted in this study.\u000a    2. Gender Mainstreaming the Rural Development Programme. Funded\u000a      by the ESRC Follow\u000a      on Fund, 2012, &#163;85,184 with an additional &#163;8,700 from the Department of\u000a      Agriculture and\u000a      Rural Development (DARD).\u000a      Researchers: Shortall and Kelly (see above). This research updated\u000a      previous work detailed in\u000a      point 1 above on how to more effectively engage women in the Rural\u000a        Development\u000a        Programme (RDP) for NI. Despite the previous research being over a\u000a      decade old, it is still\u000a      being quoted in DARD policy documents, NGO reports and in childcare\u000a      studies. This research\u000a      was designed in close consultation with DARD, the Local Action Groups who\u000a      deliver the RDP,\u000a      women's networks, and key rural development and agricultural\u000a      organisations. The\u000a      methodology replicated the previous study as much as possible; we\u000a      interviewed farming\u000a      unions, women's networks, civil servants, EU officials and conducted focus\u000a      groups with men\u000a      and women on farms, and men and women in rural areas. The timing of the\u000a      research was\u000a      significant as it can inform the end of the current Programme and the\u000a      drafting of the next\u000a      Programme post-2013.\u000a    3. Women working on the farm: how to promote their contribution to\u000a        the development of\u000a        agriculture and rural areas in Europe. 2010. Funded by the European\u000a      Parliament, Brussels.\u000a      Researcher: Shortall. This research provided an overview of the\u000a        situation of women in\u000a        farming across the EU. It was primarily desk research, pulling\u000a      together European research,\u000a      with some additional analysis by Eurostat. It looked at women's\u000a      contribution to the farm labour\u000a      force, their contribution to farm income through off-farm work and\u000a      diversification activities. It\u000a      considered the political and legal framework of the EU and how it impacts\u000a      on women on farms.\u000a      Finally it offered some recommendations for the CAP post-2013, including how\u000a        to increase\u000a        women's representation on national monitoring committees.\u000a    4. Participation in the Rural Childcare Stakeholder Group to\u000a      prepare a report to inform a rural\u000a      childcare strategy. 2007-2008.\u000a      Researcher: Shortall and advisory group. Shortall was one of the 21\u000a      members of the group,\u000a      including NGOs, childcare providers, academics and civil servants. The\u000a      group was convened to\u000a      advise the Minister on how to address inadequate childcare provision\u000a        in rural areas. It\u000a      considered existing research and heavily used reference 1 below. In\u000a      addition to desk research,\u000a      the group visited rural childcare facilities. This group recommended that\u000a      DARD should fund a\u000a      specific rural childcare programme and provide training to increase the\u000a      number of registered\u000a      rural childminders.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38460","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    One of the growing health threats in the UK and internationally is the\u000a      pathogens that cause bloodstream infections. In 2011-2012 there were 99000\u000a      reported cases of bloodstream infections in England, Wales and Northern\u000a      Ireland, with E.coli accounting for 36% of these cases. The overall number\u000a      of cases has been increasing, with about half of these resistant to\u000a      antibiotics and therefore untreatable by conventional methods and\u000a      approximately 5% resulting in death. The growing resistance of such\u000a      pathogens to antibiotics is claimed to pose a threat equivalent to\u000a      terrorism, according to the UK Government's Chief Medical Officer, and\u000a      indicates the need to identify alternative avenues besides medication for\u000a      prevention and control. In the case of E.coli, one of these avenues is\u000a      enforcement and compliance around food hygiene, given that this particular\u000a      pathogen is often spread through infected raw and ready-to-eat food. The\u000a      underpinning research described in this case study has been instrumental\u000a      in helping to define the food hygiene regulation necessary to battle the\u000a      threat of E.coli and other food-borne pathogens in the UK. Such regulation\u000a      has been instituted by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and has resulted in\u000a      a significant increase in business compliance with food hygiene\u000a      regulations.\u000a    In September 2005 there was an outbreak of E.coli O157 in South Wales,\u000a      with a majority of the 157 victims being children from 44 schools.\u000a      Thirty-one people were admitted to hospital, of whom some developed\u000a      serious long-term health implications; a five-year-old boy died. It was\u000a      the second largest outbreak of its kind in the UK. Professor Hugh\u000a      Pennington was appointed to chair an inquiry into this outbreak and\u000a      commissioned Professor Hutter to prepare a report on Risk Regulation\u000a        and Compliance. Her 2008 report [A], drafted with the assistance of\u000a      former CARR graduate Dr Tola Amodu, set out the key principles of food\u000a      hygiene regulation in the UK and considered issues of enforcement and\u000a      compliance. The report highlighted the main tensions characterising risk\u000a      regulation in an area such as food hygiene populated predominantly by\u000a      small businesses (i.e. restaurants, butchers, etc). It drew directly upon\u000a      the findings of Hutter's research, particularly those relating to the\u000a      weaknesses in government policies that advocate self-regulation and the\u000a      difficulties of generalist inspectors working with more technical\u000a      concepts.\u000a    The report was taken as evidence that informed the Inquiry's\u000a      recommendations concerning regulation of food hygiene [B]. In particular,\u000a      it was instrumental in the formulation of four key recommendations\u000a      presented in the Inquiry's formal report [C]. These were as follows:\u000a    \u000a      'Light touch' enforcement of individual food businesses should be kept\u000a        under constant review, as some small businesses lack the capacity to\u000a        appreciate and manage food hygiene risks and require more attention and\u000a        support (Rec 7)\u000a      Training should be developed to ensure environmental health officers\u000a        have the necessary knowledge and skills to regulate food hygiene (Rec 9)\u000a      Decisions about confidence in food safety management by a business\u000a        should be evidence based (Rec 12)\u000a      The Food Standards Agency (FSA) should develop a means to assess how\u000a        hygiene inspections are conducted by local authorities (Rec 15).\u000a    \u000a    Following the publication of the Inquiry's report (March 2009), the FSA\u000a      established \"as a matter of priority\" a Food Hygiene Delivery Programme\u000a      (FHDP) to prioritise, direct and measure progress in its programme of work\u000a      to improve food hygiene delivery and enforcement across the UK [D].\u000a      Chaired by the FSA Director of Operations, it was set up to drive forward\u000a      actions to respond to the recommendations of the Public Inquiry. Hutter\u000a      was consulted on the FHDP and provided specific advice on such issues as\u000a      non-state regulation, local authority enforcement and encouraging business\u000a      compliance.\u000a    In early 2012 Professor Hutter was invited to give the seventh Chief\u000a      Scientist's lecture to a gathering of FSA scientists, at which she\u000a      detailed her research on governance and regulation in managing food safety\u000a      and hygiene [4]. Her findings were disseminated more broadly through an\u000a      article in FSA's official publication Bite [E] and in a blog by\u000a      FSA Chief Scientist Andrew Wadge [F].\u000a    Professor Hutter was also invited to give oral evidence to the FSA's\u000a      Review of Delivery of Official Controls (RDOC), which was tasked with\u000a      supporting and improving the activities of local authorities and port\u000a      health authorities in monitoring and securing business compliance with\u000a      laws and regulations related to food handling and hygiene. The evidence\u000a      she provided \"fed into the thinking of the Review of Official Controls\u000a      work\" [G], particularly in terms of its guiding principles and expected\u000a      outcomes.\u000a    Derrick Jones, Head of FSA's Analysis and Research Division, noted that\u000a      the oral evidence and written research by Professor Hutter has \"helped to\u000a      inform the Agency's on-going development of our compliance and enforcement\u000a      strategy...providing a broader context for enforcement regulation and\u000a      evidence on what small businesses find helpful in their relationships with\u000a      regulators, and stimulating us to think about our further research needs\u000a      for supporting and developing our strategies\" [G].\u000a    In November 2012 the FSA reported that 80% of expected progress on\u000a      Recommendation 7 of the Inquiry report had been achieved and 100% on\u000a      Recommendations 9, 12 and 15, with the fully completed recommendations now\u000a      mainstreamed into business as usual [D]. Specific changes included:\u000a    \u000a      introduction of a 'cause for concern' initiative of focussed action\u000a        for businesses failing to achieve compliance (Rec 7)\u000a      a programme of training for local authority enforcement officers,\u000a        official veterinarians and meat hygiene inspectors on `Effective\u000a        Evaluation of Food Safety Management Systems', attended by over 2600\u000a        officials (Rec 9)\u000a      an evidence-based approach to audits and enforcement by Official\u000a        Veterinarians (Rec 12)\u000a      revision of the local authority inspection process and issuance of a\u000a        new guide for local authorities called Making Every Inspection Count\u000a        (Rec 15).\u000a    \u000a    In terms of downstream impact, business compliance was significantly\u000a      improved, with 81.6% of supervised businesses in the 'broadly compliant'\u000a      category, up from 64% in October 2009. Only 15.2% were 'not broadly\u000a      compliant' and 3.2% a 'cause for concern', compared to 27% and 9%\u000a      respectively in 2009.\u000a    In assessing overall impact, the FSA concluded that the Public Inquiry\u000a      and the establishment of the FHDP \"have been key in informing the future\u000a      direction of food safety and official control delivery in the UK. They\u000a      have been the catalyst for a number of significant developments in FSA\u000a      policy with the intention of lasting impact on public safety\" [D].\u000a      Professor Hutter's research underpinned four of 24 recommendations taken\u000a      forward from the Inquiry and now mainstreamed in the FSA's new approach to\u000a      food hygiene regulation, as well as informing the work of the Review of\u000a      Delivery of Official Controls and FSA's own ongoing strategic research\u000a      programme.\u000a    Hutter's influence on food hygiene and safety regulations has extended\u000a      beyond the UK, e.g. the Food Standards agency in Australia and New Zealand\u000a      (FSANZ). E.coli infections are an important cause of foodborne disease in\u000a      this region and a significant expense for the health system. Individuals\u000a      are ill from 3 to 31 days and 41% end up in hospital at an overall cost of\u000a      over $3000 per case. According to FSANZ's Principal Economist Jason March,\u000a      Hutter's research has been useful in \"framing and formulating our\u000a      responses to a number of food regulatory issues\", including reducing the\u000a      risks associated with \"infrequent yet possible disastrous outbreaks\" like\u000a      E.coli and \"recognising and taking into account the actual regulatory\u000a      capacity of all the businesses across the food supply chain, particularly\u000a      the small farmers that typically fall outside the present voluntary\u000a      arrangements\" [H].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    LSE research on regulatory enforcement and compliance has challenged the\u000a      assumption that businesses are capable of self-regulation, particularly in\u000a      sectors critical to public health such as the food business and\u000a      particularly in terms of small businesses that rely on government\u000a      regulations to help them identify and manage business risks. This research\u000a      became the basis for four specific recommendations on the regulation of\u000a      food hygiene and safety that emerged from a UK Government inquiry into the\u000a      2005 E.coli outbreak. All four recommendations have been implemented and\u000a      mainstreamed into the practices of the Food Standards Agency (FSA).\u000a      Collectively, they have contributed to a substantial increase in business\u000a      compliance with food safety standards and a significant reduction in\u000a      businesses giving 'cause for concern' around transmission of E.coli and\u000a      other food-borne pathogens.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Political","Institution":"\u000a    London School of Economics and Political Science\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"London School of Economics and Political Science","InstitutionName":"London School of Economics & Political Science","PeerGroup":"C","Region":"London","UKPRN":10004063}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

Ethnographic research in the 1990s examined the work\u000a      of regulators in various government departments, including occupational\u000a      health and safety, environment, railways and environmental health [1].\u000a      This was complemented by two research studies focused on the other side of\u000a      the equation &#8212; how businesses respond to regulation and manage their\u000a      risks. The first study, conducted in the 1990s, examined the range of\u000a      responses to occupational health and safety legislation across job\u000a      functions, departments and regions within the UK's national railway\u000a      organisation [2]. A second study, conducted from 2003-6, provided a\u000a      detailed analysis of the risk management practices of 28 food retail and\u000a      catering businesses in the UK [3,4].\u000a    This body of research illuminated the ways in which risk management\u000a      practices are influenced by sources of regulation external to the business\u000a      [5,6]. Specifically, the research found that:\u000a    \u000a      state regulation remains a key influence on business risk management\u000a        practices, e.g. the Food Standards Agency (FSA), but is not sufficient\u000a        as an influencer by itself\u000a      businesses recognize the importance of `beyond the state' regulators,\u000a        such as industry and trade associations, consultancies and insurance\u000a        companies\u000a      however, some non-state influences (e.g. lawyers, the media, insurance\u000a        companies, advocacy groups) are less important than assumed by some of\u000a        the academic literature\u000a      managerial perceptions of consumer expectations are highly influential\u000a    \u000a    Reputational risks are a major incentive for businesses to comply with\u000a      regulation and to implement risk management standards and practices. This\u000a      is especially the case in the food industry, with managers worried about\u000a      consumer perceptions of their food safety and food handling practices and\u000a      convinced that such perceptions are a key influence over consumer\u000a      decision-making (even though this belief is not supported by hard\u000a      evidence).\u000a    Sources of regulation internal to business organizations, such as Board\u000a      directives and risk officers, were also examined. The research found that\u000a      while larger, successful organizations do have the regulatory capacity to\u000a      buy in-house risk regulation expertise (such as risk or compliance\u000a      officers and departments) or ad hoc advice from outside, they may\u000a      find it difficult to embed risk regulation arrangements and\u000a      infrastructures within the entirety of their organization or may suffer\u000a      internal communication and co-ordination problems. Small and micro\u000a      businesses (SMEs), on the other hand, are less likely to have either the\u000a      knowledge resource in-house or the capacity to purchase specialist help.\u000a      They are thus much more likely than larger organisations to be reliant on\u000a      state regulators to help them understand and manage their risks.\u000a    These findings raise questions about government policies and practices\u000a      that assume the ability of businesses to self-regulate and about the\u000a      withdrawal of inspections that help businesses, especially SMEs, to\u000a      identify and manage risks. Such questions are particularly relevant and\u000a      critical in regulating the food industry. Hutter found that the risk\u000a      related to food hygiene and safety was considered one of the top risks by\u000a      food retail and catering businesses and that SMEs in this sector tended to\u000a      rely on environmental health officers to help them understand and manage\u000a      their risks at the very time such officers were being cut back. People\u000a      assume that big businesses represent bigger risks, but in fact smaller\u000a      businesses taken together account for a significant portion of the food\u000a      sector and some of the E.coli outbreaks in the UK and Germany have\u000a      actually come out of small businesses.\u000a    Key Researcher: Bridget Hutter is LSE Professor of Risk Regulation\u000a      in the LSE Sociology Department.

Beyond academia, the exhibition has\u000d\u000a      had a significant impact on a number of distinct user-groups and\u000d\u000a      beneficiaries, both directly &#8212; on the night itself &#8212; and indirectly, over\u000d\u000a      the longer term.\u000d\u000a    Firstly, gallery visitors in the local community. The White Night\u000d\u000a      is a major arts festival in Brighton, attracting thousands of visitors and\u000d\u000a      aimed explicitly at widening community participation in the arts, beyond\u000d\u000a      the usual (middle-class) gallery-going population. Thus, by holding our\u000d\u000a      exhibition at this event, we effectively communicated the research to\u000d\u000a      local people; over 7,000 visitors attended over the night [see Section 5,\u000d\u000a      C2]. Importantly, also, these visitors provided us with some useful\u000d\u000a      feedback (through questionnaires and comments via the specially designed\u000d\u000a      `ShineUs' device; see below) about their experiences of shyness in museums\u000d\u000a      and galleries, and suggestions about how these environments could be made\u000d\u000a      more accessible. There was a clear preference for exhibits that provided\u000d\u000a      some instructions, explanation or `rules' as to how the technology worked,\u000d\u000a      to reduce visitors' anxieties about `getting it wrong', and a preference\u000d\u000a      for exhibits with clear signage. Visitors also reported that they enjoyed\u000d\u000a      having some exhibits that allowed for a more passive spectatorship rather\u000d\u000a      than demanding active engagement; the `relaxation' areas we had set up in\u000d\u000a      the gallery (quiet corners with sofas, refreshments and artworks that\u000d\u000a      could just be looked at) were very popular throughout the evening. These\u000d\u000a      findings were communicated to artists, curators and other audiences,\u000d\u000a      through the dissemination activities detailed below.\u000d\u000a    Secondly, curators benefited from hearing this visitor feedback,\u000d\u000a      and from the impact of the event in general. Our research team\u000d\u000a      collaborated with local curator Helen Sloan throughout the project, and\u000d\u000a      she reported that the experience had positively informed her working\u000d\u000a      practices. In particular, our critique of the `ideal visitor' model that\u000d\u000a      was implicit in most interactive exhibits (the assumption that visitors\u000d\u000a      will be comfortable and confident with using technology, as well as\u000d\u000a      extroverted enough to perform in public without embarrassment) led her to\u000d\u000a      rethink the design and layout of exhibitions she curated to make them more\u000d\u000a      `shy-friendly' [C1]. Helen's non-academic dissemination activities, like\u000d\u000a      ours, have encouraged curators to consider a wider range of possible ways\u000d\u000a      of engaging with contemporary artworks, on a continuum from active\u000d\u000a      engagement to passive spectatorship. Helen presented the research findings\u000d\u000a      to other curators through a non-academic conference presentation\u000d\u000a      (Association of Art Historians conference, Open University, Milton Keynes,\u000d\u000a      March 2012), and a book chapter (Sloan, H. (2013) `Performativity in the\u000d\u000a      art gallery', in Remes, O. and Trench, C. (eds) Performativity in the\u000d\u000a        Gallery: Staging Interactive Encounters. Oxford: Peter Lang Ltd),\u000d\u000a      which contributed to debates about the `inclusive museum\/gallery' to the\u000d\u000a      arts and heritage industries more widely. Susie Scott, gave an invited\u000d\u000a      presentation about the research to a workshop of artists and curators at\u000d\u000a      the Museums and Cultural Institutions as Spaces for Participation\u000d\u000a      Symposium (Roskilde University, Denmark, December 2012), which encouraged\u000d\u000a      a lively debate about shyness and accessibility.\u000d\u000a    Thirdly, the artists who exhibited at the event said that they\u000d\u000a      had found the experience worthwhile in informing their own working\u000d\u000a      practices, by learning how to make their artworks more publicly\u000d\u000a      accessible. Several of the artists told us that they had become more aware\u000d\u000a      of the issue of shyness in gallery visitors, and were interested in the\u000d\u000a      theoretical question of shifting the responsibility for `dealing with'\u000d\u000a      this onto the arts institutions. The Sussex artist-in-residence, Anna\u000d\u000a      Dumitriu, in particular, found the experience helpful in opening up new\u000d\u000a      areas of research and generating ideas for future artworks. She and other\u000d\u000a      exhibiting artists, such as Tom Keene and Alex May, confirmed that the\u000d\u000a      event had been useful to them in building their public profile and leading\u000d\u000a      on to other opportunities for work [C3, C4, C5]. Dumitriu, May and Keene\u000d\u000a      also presented a non-academic paper about the project at the ISEA\u000d\u000a      (International Symposium on Electronic Art) conference in Istanbul,\u000d\u000a      Turkey, in September 2011, thus disseminating the research findings\u000d\u000a      further within the artistic community. Comments from the artists and\u000d\u000a      curator are shown in Section 5.\u000d\u000a    Fourthly, two of the Co-Investigators (Dan Chalmers and Ian Wakeman) in\u000d\u000a      Informatics designed a new piece of technology, which was deployed\u000d\u000a      during the exhibition event and has had a demonstrative impact on software\u000d\u000a      systems in other, everyday settings. This device, called `ShineUs', allows\u000d\u000a      visitors to leave anonymous feedback comments on a projector screen by\u000d\u000a      scanning QR codes on physical artefacts (in this case, the exhibited\u000d\u000a      artworks) into their mobile phone, from which comments can be sent via SMS\u000d\u000a      text message, Facebook or Twitter. The device was designed to enable\u000d\u000a      consumers participating in discussion forums to control the extent of a)\u000d\u000a      the public visibility of their comments, and b) their anonymity\/personal\u000d\u000a      exposure, according to their individual preferences for different levels\u000d\u000a      of sociability, active engagement, trust in the others present, and\u000d\u000a      `technological comfort zones'. At the White Night, 30 people left comments\u000d\u000a      about the exhibits: for example, 16 users said that they felt less than\u000d\u000a      confident about understanding art, while 18 rated themselves at the higher\u000d\u000a      end of a scale of self- defined shyness. Since then, the device has also\u000d\u000a      been used in other contexts, such as a Farmer's Market (where customers\u000d\u000a      shared comments and advice about the goods available) and an academic\u000d\u000a      computer-science conference (where delegates chose to leave more critical\u000d\u000a      comments about presentations using higher levels of concealment and\u000d\u000a      anonymity).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    `Like Shadows: A Celebration of Shyness' brought together members of the\u000d\u000a      art and lay-public communities in a lively debate about visitor shyness in\u000d\u000a      contemporary interactive museums and galleries, in relation to wider\u000d\u000a      debates about public engagement and social exclusion. The project informed\u000d\u000a      the working practices of the ten local artists and curators with whom the\u000d\u000a      researchers collaborated, who created new exhibits on the theme of shyness\u000d\u000a      and designed the event to appeal to shy visitors. Their reports [see\u000d\u000a      Sections 4 and 5] show that this experience has made them more aware of\u000d\u000a      the propensity of digitally-mediated artworks to evoke feelings of shyness\u000d\u000a      amongst visitors, and of the need to reconsider the design and\u000d\u000a      presentation of such exhibits to be more `shy-friendly'. This\u000d\u000a      community-focused event drew in over 7000 visitors, whose feedback\u000d\u000a      confirmed the tendency of interactive, digital media-based exhibits to\u000d\u000a      assume a level of performative confidence and technical knowledge,\u000d\u000a      excluding visitors who felt shy.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Sussex\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Sussex (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Sussex","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"South East","UKPRN":10007806}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"745044","Name":"Istanbul"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000aR1 Scott, S., Hinton-Smith, T., H&#228;rm&#228;, V. and Broome, K.

This project was part of\u000d\u000a      Susie Scott's (R5) original programme of research on the `sociology of\u000d\u000a      shyness', which has explored the ways in which shyness is created by\u000d\u000a      situational factors and social interaction, rather than being an\u000d\u000a      individual personality trait. Scott has demonstrated how shyness is a\u000d\u000a      common experience, particularly in certain kinds of situation that require\u000d\u000a      performing one's identity in public, and where the rules of social\u000d\u000a      behaviour are ambiguous. This has been illustrated by Scott's empirical\u000d\u000a      research on groups of self-defined `shy' people (R5), university lecturers\u000d\u000a      (R6), ethnographers (R3) and swimming pool patrons (R4). Scott's research\u000d\u000a      agenda aims to de-pathologise shyness by redefining it as a social rather\u000d\u000a      than an individual `problem', whose creation is contingent upon cultural\u000d\u000a      norms, and whose management is the responsibility of social environments.\u000d\u000a    The project explored how pervasive computing devices (those that are\u000d\u000a      built into the environment, mobile, hidden or invisible) can affect\u000d\u000a      shyness by either by causing it, heightening the experience, or making it\u000d\u000a      easier to cope with. We studied this in different social contexts,\u000d\u000a      including classrooms, online games and networking sites, and art\u000d\u000a      galleries\/museums. The project was a collaboration with the Informatics\u000d\u000a      department at Sussex; the Informatics researchers designed a new\u000d\u000a      technological device, ShineUs (see section 4 below; R2). The Sociology\u000d\u000a      team (Susie Scott, Tamsin Hinton-Smith, Vuokko H&#228;rm&#228; and Karl Broome)\u000d\u000a      looked at visitors' responses to interactive art exhibitions that used\u000d\u000a      digital media. We compared an exhibition at Fabrica, a small contemporary\u000d\u000a      art gallery in Brighton, to one at the more traditional Victoria and\u000d\u000a      Albert Museum in London. The methods we used included interviews with\u000d\u000a      visitors and staff, observations of people's behaviour in the galleries,\u000d\u000a      questionnaires, focus groups and an online survey. The primary aim of the\u000d\u000a      project was to understand how interactive exhibitions of this kind, with a\u000d\u000a      high technological and\/or performative component, might evoke feelings of\u000d\u000a      shyness in visitors; a secondary aim was to raise artists' and curators'\u000d\u000a      awareness of this as a barrier to public participation, and to encourage\u000d\u000a      them to think more inclusively about their working practices.\u000d\u000a    Our results (R1) highlighted a common theme in the experience of shyness:\u000d\u000a      the fear about `not knowing the rules' of a social situation and of\u000d\u000a      `getting it wrong'. Art can seem like a strange and exclusive world, which\u000d\u000a      is quite intimidating to those unfamiliar with it. Visitors to both of the\u000d\u000a      art galleries said that they disliked exhibitions that did not have a\u000d\u000a      clear explanation or instructions about what the artists had intended or\u000d\u000a      what they were supposed to do when looking around. Many people felt shy\u000d\u000a      about being asked to `play' with technology or `perform' in some\u000d\u000a      unspecified way when engaging with the artworks, especially when other\u000d\u000a      people might be watching. They wanted to be told how to understand the art\u000d\u000a      and give the correct response, so that they would not risk making a fool\u000d\u000a      of themselves. Some people preferred to wait and watch other visitors\u000d\u000a      before having a go, to make sure that they got it `right'. This conflicted\u000d\u000a      with the ideas of interactive artists and curators, who said that there\u000d\u000a      were no secret rules or intended messages, nor any `right' way of doing it\u000d\u000a      &#8212; their optimistic model of `visitor self-discovery' encouraged visitors\u000d\u000a      to explore freely and make their own interpretations. We therefore argued\u000d\u000a      that this model was unrealistic insofar as it was not grounded in the\u000d\u000a      lived experiences and situated practices of ordinary gallery- and\u000d\u000a      museum-goers. Artists, curators and gallery staff stand to gain a great\u000d\u000a      deal from listening to such views from their visiting public and by\u000d\u000a      continuing to encourage community engagement in the arts. We also\u000d\u000a      encourage these art providers to be more aware of shy visitors' concerns,\u000d\u000a      and to design exhibits that are more `shy-friendly'. This is why we\u000d\u000a      organised the `Like Shadows' event, to disseminate the research findings\u000d\u000a      and generate wider debate on this issue.\u000d\u000a    Collaborating artists and curators\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Helen Sloan (curator)\u000d\u000a      `Like Shadows' exhibition artists: Anna Dumitiru (Artist in Residence,\u000d\u000a        University of Sussex), Alex May, Alexa Wright, Ben Swailes, Olu Taiwo,\u000d\u000a        Peter Hardie, Tom Keene, Kyp Kyprianou, Jeannie Driver and Tina\u000d\u000a        Gonsalves\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40305","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact since 2008 of Modood's research has taken the following main\u000d\u000a      forms:\u000d\u000a    Operation of legislation on religious discrimination and incitement to\u000d\u000a        hatred\u000d\u000a    The continuing operation since 2008 of legislation on religious\u000d\u000a      discrimination and incitement to hatred has its origins in part in\u000d\u000a      Modood's work. The introduction of a religion question in the 2001 Census\u000d\u000a      and of monitoring and targeting of Pakistanis and Bangladeshis per se\u000d\u000a      (as distinct from `ethnic minorities') in relation to disadvantage in\u000d\u000a      schools and labour markets was encouraged by his research [1]. The primary\u000d\u000a      mode of impact in relation to law and policies was the take-up of Modood's\u000d\u000a      research and ideas [1] [2] by Muslim and multiculturalist proponents of\u000d\u000a      change. These included the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) [c], who\u000d\u000a      effectively lobbied for action with their allies in the New Labour\u000d\u000a      government, and the Commission on Multi-Ethnic Britain (1998-2000),\u000d\u000a      chaired by Lord Bhikhu Parekh, to which Modood was the adviser [d].\u000d\u000a      Modood's data and arguments [1] were one of the key sources that led to\u000d\u000a      the outlawing of religious discrimination. Initially this related only to\u000d\u000a      employment (2003), but the provisions were extended in 2007 and scaled up\u000d\u000a      to match all other equality strands in the Equalities Act of 2010 [i]. In\u000d\u000a      addition, Modood's work [1] helped in the creation of the offence of\u000d\u000a      incitement to religious hatred in 2006, the ongoing significance of which\u000d\u000a      is reflected in the statistics: the number of claims accepted by\u000d\u000a      employment tribunals in relation to religious belief discrimination is\u000d\u000a      currently averaging over 1,000 a year. The fact that opinion on matters\u000d\u000a      such as incitement to religious hatred has swung in Modood's direction is\u000d\u000a      evident from British newspapers' decision in 2005 not to reproduce the\u000d\u000a      Danish Muhammad cartoons, in contrast to their counterparts in France and\u000d\u000a      Germany (and to their own earlier lack of sympathy for Muslim protests\u000d\u000a      against The Satanic Verses). In public discourse and government\u000d\u000a      policy, Muslims have remained the most prominent minority group. The\u000d\u000a      Secretary General of the MCB attests that Modood's work [1] on the\u000d\u000a      incitement to hatred and religious discrimination debate `shaped the\u000d\u000a      Muslim community's discourse and campaigning efforts eventually leading to\u000d\u000a      changes in legislation and greater equity in society'. He also notes that\u000d\u000a      Modood's research [1, 2] has \"introduced a rich set of concepts and\u000d\u000a      notions that has enabled community organisations to participate in\u000d\u000a      national conversations in an informed and effective way\" [c]. The Census\u000d\u000a      data on religion is being used not just to analyse diversity and\u000d\u000a      inequality but more widely to discuss the place of religion in British\u000d\u000a      society.\u000d\u000a    Operation of racial equality policies in higher education\u000d\u000a    Modood's report with Carter and Fenton [5] on ethnicity and employment in\u000d\u000a      higher education was widely reported at the time in 2000, including two\u000d\u000a      pages in the Times Higher Education Supplement and was explicitly\u000d\u000a      adopted as the basis for action by the Department for Education, Committee\u000d\u000a      of Vice Chancellors and Principals, Association of University Teachers\u000d\u000a      (AUT), National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education\u000d\u000a      (NATFHE) and others. Hence it was foundational in the introduction and\u000d\u000a      development of racial equality employment policies. The policies initiated\u000d\u000a      in the sector as a result of this publication continue to be significant\u000d\u000a      post-2008 with the HEFCE Equality Challenge Unit having created new `Race\u000d\u000a      Charter Marks' in 2013 and Operation Black Vote - a collaboration between\u000d\u000a      Charter 88 and the 1990 Trust - referring directly in April 2013 to\u000d\u000a      Modood's research [5] on racial inequality in Higher Education (www.obv.org.uk\/news-blogs\/black-british-academics)\u000d\u000a      [g]. The work (with M. Shiner) [4] on ethnic differentials in student\u000d\u000a      admission rates was picked up by the 2004 Schwartz Review on Fair\u000d\u000a        Admissions to Higher Education: Recommendations for Good Practice\u000d\u000a      (2004) and in 2005 HEFCE replicated the Shiner and Modood analysis. The\u000d\u000a      debate is being continued by a new analysis by Shiner and Modood currently\u000d\u000a      under review with a journal. Modood's research [1] [4] (with that of\u000d\u000a      Khattab) was fed into the ten-member National Equality Panel, on which he\u000d\u000a      served. The panel's report in January 2010 received extensive publicity\u000d\u000a      and has been welcomed by policymakers and practitioners at all levels of\u000d\u000a      government and civil society across many policy areas. Deputy Prime\u000d\u000a      Minister Harriet Harman described the National Equality Panel report as\u000d\u000a      `important work done to the highest standard of professionalism ...\u000d\u000a      [which] will underpin the response by all strategic authorities to Clause\u000d\u000a      One of the Equality Bill which places a new legal duty on key public\u000d\u000a      bodies to consider, in all the important decisions they make and all\u000d\u000a      important actions they take, how they can tackle socio-economic\u000d\u000a      inequality' [a]. Modood had laid some of the groundwork on these issues at\u000d\u000a      the Prime Ministerial Seminar on Equality, Fairness and Responsibility in\u000d\u000a      the Post-Crisis Society at Chequers in October 2009 [j].\u000d\u000a    Acceptance of moderate secularism as a resource for the accommodation\u000d\u000a        of Muslims\u000d\u000a    Many Muslims and others have been persuaded since 2008 by Modood's view\u000d\u000a      that the moderate secularism of Britain should be seen as a valuable\u000d\u000a      resource for the accommodation of Muslims [3]. On the need to rethink\u000d\u000a      secularism, Modood contributed to a seminar organised by the Islamic\u000d\u000a      Foundation's Policy Research Centre and a related book [e]. His chapter of\u000d\u000a      the book published in 2010 is responded to by the key social policy\u000d\u000a      advisers Ted Cantle (a leading proponent of the policy concept of\u000d\u000a      `community cohesion' in the New Labour government) and Sunder Katwala\u000d\u000a      (Director, Fabian Society), to whom he replies. The book - British\u000d\u000a        Secularism and Religion - endorses Modood's idea that the moderate\u000d\u000a      secularism of Britain has been misunderstood by its critics and proponents\u000d\u000a      and is a resource for the accommodation of Muslims in a multicultural way\u000d\u000a      as well as a key vehicle for discussion amongst Muslims and between\u000d\u000a      Muslims and others. Modood is a Commissioner and Steering Group member of\u000d\u000a      the new Commission on Multi-Faith Britain, chaired by Baroness Elisabeth\u000d\u000a      Butler-Schloss, established in September 2013, with a brief to report in\u000d\u000a      two years on the policy and national identity implications of the evolving\u000d\u000a      place of religion and religious diversity in Britain [i].\u000d\u000a    Creation and enhancement of mechanisms of Muslim participation in\u000d\u000a        governance\u000d\u000a    The primary focus of Modood's current research-based impact interventions\u000d\u000a      has been on enhancing online and face to face mechanisms of Muslim\u000d\u000a      participation in contemporary governance. The assessors of the proposal\u000d\u000a      for Modood's AHRC-funded work (with O'Toole, Sociology, Bristol) on this\u000d\u000a      topic [9] awarded it the highest score of `6' and judged it to be\u000d\u000a      `outstanding' and `world-leading'. The project was awarded AHRC Follow-on\u000d\u000a      Funding [10] to create an online knowledge exchange forum, Public Spirit (http:\/\/www.publicspirit.org.uk\/),\u000a      on the subject of religion and public policy, for researchers,\u000d\u000a      policymakers, politicians and practitioners. Launched in June 2013,\u000d\u000a      participants include personnel from the All-Party Parliamentary Group on\u000d\u000a      Faith and Society and FaithAction, the national network of faith-based\u000d\u000a      organisations. Modood and O'Toole run a related ESRC-funded Connected\u000d\u000a      Communities project on Muslim political participation in Bristol, Building\u000d\u000a      the Bridge (http:\/\/www.allmosquestogether.org\/building-the-bridge\/)\u000d\u000a      which in August 2013 [11] extended work begun in 2009. The focus is on\u000d\u000a      preventing violent extremism: it responds to the Government's Prevent\u000d\u000a      Strategy through Muslim participation in local governance. Its activities\u000d\u000a      include regular meetings between stakeholder such as the Council of\u000d\u000a      Bristol Mosques and the Muslim Women's Network.\u000d\u000a    Awareness raising and agenda setting through public engagement\u000d\u000a    During 2008-2013, Modood has presented his views on Muslims and\u000d\u000a      multiculturalism in a number of fora and through the national media,\u000d\u000a      including BBC2 Newsnight and BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight, Start The\u000d\u000a      Week, Thinking Allowed and The Moral Maze. He averages six presentations\u000d\u000a      at policy\/public events, plus five radio and two television interviews,\u000d\u000a      each year. He also blogs and engages through Twitter and Facebook. Modood\u000d\u000a      was described in 2011 as `One of the most prominent voices [in the\u000d\u000a      debate]. [He] has greatly influenced the way multiculturalism is\u000d\u000a      understood both normatively and practically in contemporary Europe' [f].\u000d\u000a      In 2013 another scholar cited him as an example of how `political\u000d\u000a      theorists generate impact [on] our thinking about politics', specifically,\u000d\u000a      `helping to clarify and reconfigure our understanding about ... the\u000d\u000a      foundations of our multiple identities and issues pertaining to ...\u000d\u000a      religious toleration as well as reasonable difference' [h].\u000d\u000a    Continuing adherence to multiculturalism among Muslim and government\u000d\u000a        actors\u000d\u000a    Lord Bhikhu Parekh summarised the impact since 2008 of Modood's research\u000d\u000a      on the debate on secularism, the widespread discussion of Britishness, and\u000d\u000a      the development of a sophisticated and politically meaningful form of\u000d\u000a      multiculturalism, as follows:\u000d\u000a    In all three areas his writings represent decisive interventions in the\u000d\u000a      onging debate. They have questioned the traditional ways of formulating\u000d\u000a      the debate, problematized what has often been taken for granted, offerred\u000d\u000a      a new conceptual language, and put novel questions on the agenda. In so\u000d\u000a      doing they have subtly altered the nature and content of much of the\u000d\u000a      dominant discourse in these areas, a truly remarkable achievement ... Many\u000d\u000a      liberal Muslims have also been influenced by his way of thinking and have\u000d\u000a      found in his writings powerful ammunition to counter their militant fellow\u000d\u000a      Muslims. Modood's impact thus has been both on those who make policies and\u000d\u000a      those who demand and are affected by it. [d]\u000d\u000a    See also [c]. A recent example of Modood's contribution to policy and\u000d\u000a      national thinking on these issues was through the Labour Party 'One\u000d\u000a      Nation' Policy Review of late 2012 to January 2013 [b].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Professor Tariq Modood - awarded an MBE for services to social sciences\u000d\u000a      and ethnic relations in 2001 - is one of the UK's most prominent analysts\u000d\u000a      of and commentators on Muslims and multiculturalism.

He pursued these issues as Principal Investigator (PI) for the\u000d\u000a      Policy Studies Institute's Fourth National Survey (1993-1997).\u000d\u000a    Since coming to Bristol he has developed a sociological and normative\u000d\u000a      understanding of minority, especially Muslim, political identities, and of\u000d\u000a      a multicultural Britishness able to accommodate them. He has presented his\u000d\u000a      ideas within and outside academia, and shifted opinion within each. Modood\u000d\u000a      has emphasised (against the current of post-9\/11 thinking) the importance\u000d\u000a      of a concept of multicultural integration that is built on national\u000d\u000a      citizenship in at least two respects. Firstly, the concept involves a\u000d\u000a      macro-symbolic integration that cannot be reduced to individual choices,\u000d\u000a      individual integration, local multi-culture or local cohesion. Secondly,\u000d\u000a      the concept fosters new forms of belonging which are best achieved through\u000d\u000a      a suitably pluralised national identity rather than a merely civic or\u000d\u000a      constitutional patriotism. He also started a critical engagement with and\u000d\u000a      defence of political secularism, arguing that it, no less than citizenship\u000d\u000a      and national identity, needs to be multiculturalised in order to be\u000d\u000a      genuinely inclusive. He has developed a sociologically grounded political\u000d\u000a      theory of multiculturalism and pioneered the interrogation of secularism,\u000d\u000a      using this intellectual framework in a series of funded projects [7] [8]\u000d\u000a      [9] [10] [11].\u000d\u000a    Modood's work has had four strands. The first two are\u000d\u000a      macro\/discursive\/theoretical and the second two are concerned with\u000d\u000a      specific areas of society and policy: First, rethinking racial equality,\u000d\u000a      ethnicity, multiculturalism and Britishness in the context of Muslim\u000d\u000a      political assertiveness and Islamophobia [1] [2] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11].\u000d\u000a      Second, rethinking political secularism in contemporary Britain [3] [7]\u000d\u000a      [8] [9] [10] [11]. Third, ethnicity and Higher Education (HE) institutions\u000d\u000a      in contemporary Britain. Modood has shown that the over-representation of\u000d\u000a      most ethnic minority groups as students in HE is a continuing trend, as\u000d\u000a      are differential rates in the offers made by universities [4] [7]. In\u000d\u000a      addition, with Fenton (Sociology, Bristol), he established the fact of\u000d\u000a      under-representation in 1998-99 of ethnic minorities among academic staff\u000d\u000a      [5]. Fourth, socio-economic locations and trajectories of ethnic\u000d\u000a      minorities in contemporary Britain and beyond. Here, he confirmed the\u000d\u000a      diversity of ethnic minorities, who are differentially endowed with human\u000d\u000a      and social capitals [6] [7]. Within that larger study (with Khattab,\u000d\u000a      Sociology, Bristol) he has analysed the `ethnic penalty' experienced by\u000d\u000a      different groups and argued that an `ethno-religious penalty' is a more\u000d\u000a      accurate conceptualisation.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40306","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    1. Changing thinking about and triggering reforms to prison policy\u000a    Since 2008, Naughton has influenced the treatment of prisoners\u000a      maintaining innocence by communicating his research findings to policy\u000a      makers including the Parole Board and the National Offender Management\u000a      Service (NOMS). This was done by communicating his findings [1] [2] [3]\u000a      [4] to these agencies at the Home Office and to the House of Commons,\u000a      acting as stakeholder for the Parole Board and running a series of\u000a      workshops for the Parole Board. These efforts led to an unprecedented\u000a      acknowledgment from NOMS, which oversees the work of prisons and\u000a      probation, and the Parole Board that some prisoners may, indeed, be\u000a      innocent and that the traditional blanket label of them as `deniers' is\u000a      inappropriate [a] [b]. His research also led to a new way of assessing\u000a      prisoners maintaining innocence by prison and probation staff. In\u000a      particular, it heavily influenced the design of NOMS's training course\u000a      `Managing Indeterminate Sentences and Risk' (MISaR) [a], which has been\u000a      delivered to circa 30,000 prison and probation officers across the UK\u000a      since 2008. Naughton was consulted in the design of MISaR during a visit\u000a      at the University of Bristol by NOMS's Indeterminate Sentenced Prisoners\u000a      Lead in 2008. The course incorporates Naughton's research [4] and educates\u000a      prison and probation staff on the reasons why prisoners may claim that\u000a      they are innocent when they are not (for example, due to misunderstanding\u000a      of criminal law, disagreeing that what they have done should be a criminal\u000a      offence or protecting a family member). Most significantly, prison and\u000a      probation staff are now trained to provide such prisoners with information\u000a      about the criminal appeals system and organisations that could assist them\u000a      in overturning their convictions. Another related impact of Naughton's\u000a      research in this area is the amendment of Prison Service Order (PSO) 4700,\u000a      implemented by NOMS in July 2010, which takes into account the `typology\u000a      of claims of innocence' devised by Naughton [1] [4]. Acknowledging for the\u000a      first time that some prisoners are likely in fact to be innocent, PSO 4700\u000a      also adopts the recommendations in Naughton's research findings [4] and\u000a      provides guidance to Offender Supervisors on the management of prisoners\u000a      maintaining innocence [c].\u000a    2. Creating 26 pro bono innocence projects which have influenced\u000a        casework and generated pro bono work equivalent to over &#163;5 million\u000a    Naughton led the process of establishing a network of innocence projects\u000a      in the UK through the vehicle of the Innocence Network UK (INUK) (www.innocencenetwork.org.uk)\u000a      which he founded at the University of Bristol in 2004. 26 of these were\u000a      operating as of June 2013. INUK was established as a practical response to\u000a      Naughton's initial findings from his research begun in 2001 and published\u000a      in 2007 [3]. From the outset Naughton has employed an entrepreneurial\u000a      approach to funding the employment of a full time member of staff for INUK\u000a      to enable its development and sustainability. INUK's innocence projects\u000a      generate a conservative estimate of 100,000 hours of pro bono work per\u000a      annum. This is achieved by around 500 university staff and student\u000a      caseworkers each year working an average of 5 hours weekly and an\u000a      additional 4,000 hours of free work provided by legal and forensic\u000a      experts. At legal aid rates, this equates to a notional monetary value of\u000a      &#163;5 million per year (500 caseworkers x 5 hours x 40 weeks x &#163;50 per hour).\u000a      This increases by an estimated further &#163;250,000 for the work that the pro\u000a      bono lawyers and experts give freely to INUK projects, also based on legal\u000a      aid rates for solicitors. Overall, the resources generated by INUK have\u000a      enabled and improved access to justice in an area where public funding is\u000a      notoriously limited [e]. As of January 2013, twelve applications have been\u000a      submitted to the CCRC and the Scottish CCRC following full investigations\u000a      by INUK member innocence projects. Three cases have also reached the Court\u000a      of Appeal [d, page 19]. These casework impacts are unlikely to have\u000a      occurred without the research that led to the establishment of INUK and\u000a      that has shaped the ways in which INUK member innocence projects operate.\u000a    3. Supporting and shaping the practices of innocence projects\u000a    Since its establishment in 2004, Naughton has directed INUK as a cohesive\u000a      and integrated informal body for assessing alleged wrongful convictions\u000a      and referring eligible cases to member innocence projects for full\u000a      investigation. The need for such an initiative to promote the review of\u000a      alleged wrongful convictions stems from Naughton's research, which\u000a      identified a gap in the provision of such assistance [2] [3] [5]. As of\u000a      June 2013, INUK had received 1,285 requests for assistance, of which\u000a      around 223 were deemed eligible for full investigation and 113 cases of\u000a      those were referred by INUK to member innocence projects for full\u000a      investigation [d, page 19]. INUK's central case referral system saves INUK\u000a      member innocence projects many thousands of pounds per annum in\u000a      administrative costs. Such efficiency savings allow limited resources to\u000a      be focused on clients\/prisoners and students. The absence of\u000a      innocence-focused law clinics in the UK meant that prior to existence of\u000a      INUK no guidance was available on how innocence projects should run to\u000a      ensure that clients receive a professional standard of care [2]. Naughton\u000a      instituted quality control to the services provided by devising the INUK\u000a      Innocence Project Protocols in 2008, which all INUK member innocence\u000a      projects are required to sign up to and work in accordance with. The\u000a      Protocols were adapted from the model standards for live-client work that\u000a      govern associates of the Clinical Legal Education Organisation (CLEO) and\u000a      have been validated by the Attorney General's Pro Bono Protocols. The\u000a      impact of this is the regulation of INUK's member innocence projects to\u000a      ensure quality in the assistance and client-care provided, as demonstrated\u000a      by the Annual Reports submitted by member innocence projects [e]. By\u000a      sharing his research and practical experience with INUK innocence\u000a      projects, Naughton has shaped their practices [f]. In particular, he has\u000a      instilled an `innocence-oriented' approach to the investigations by\u000a      innocence projects, which he found lacking in the criminal appeal system\u000a      and the CCRC [2] [3] [5]. This has been achieved through training\u000a      conferences and materials provided to innocence projects. Since 2008\u000a      Naughton has organised eleven INUK national training conferences (two\u000a      conferences per year). Consisting of high quality speakers including\u000a      lawyers, forensic scientists, representatives of the criminal justice\u000a      system and academics, the conferences enhance the knowledge of innocence\u000a      project staff and students on wrongful convictions so that they can make\u000a      better progress on their cases. These conferences (which form the\u000a      principal training for student caseworkers) help innocence projects to\u000a      understand the inquisitorial, impartial investigative approach they should\u000a      adopt in their casework [g]. In addition, core support materials,\u000a      including the INUK Starter Pack, Handbook and First Steps document, were\u000a      devised by Naughton and are heavily based on his research [1] [2] [3] [h].\u000a    Raising awareness\u000a    (a) Raising awareness of the limitations of the Criminal Cases Review\u000a        Commission:\u000a    Naughton's research &#8212; especially [2] [5] [6] &#8212; and his leadership of INUK\u000a      have led to increased public awareness of the limitations of the CCRC in\u000a      assisting the innocent. In December 2011, INUK launched its Joseph\u000a      Rowntree Reform Trust public campaign to reform the CCRC. The campaign\u000a      involved a public symposium that brought together criminal appeal lawyers,\u000a      journalists, campaigners, former CCRC Commissioners, alleged miscarriages\u000a      of justice victims and academics. In addition, INUK issued two public\u000a      statements on the limits of the CCRC and published a dossier of 44 `cases\u000a      for concern' that have been refused by the CCRC despite their possible\u000a      innocence. Between January and May 2012, INUK's campaign generated five\u000a      feature articles in national media (Guardian, Times, BBC\u000a      News), seven articles in local newspapers and three articles in\u000a      professional magazines (Law Society Gazette; Lawyer 2B). A\u000a      Report from the public symposium (printed by LexisNexis) was launched in\u000a      2012 and was part of Naughton's (with Tan) invited submission to the\u000a      Ministry of Justice's Triennial Review of the CCRC.\u000a    (b) Raising awareness of wrongful convictions in general: The\u000a      establishment of the CCRC resulted in reduced public and media interest in\u000a      wrongful convictions. Naughton's research [2] [3] [5] and related work\u000a      with INUK has made a notable contribution to reigniting public and media\u000a      awareness on the issue of wrongful convictions generally. Since 2008,\u000a      Naughton and INUK have been featured 47 times in national newspapers,\u000a      radio and TV interviews and currently (as of September 2013) generate over\u000a      42,600 hits on Google from diverse sources including the media, websites\u000a      of other universities, third-sector groups, and professional\/commercial\u000a      bodies.\u000a    5. Influencing criminal justice policies internationally, including\u000a        avoiding potential harm\u000a    Naughton's research on the limitations of the CCRC [2] [5] [6] has led to\u000a      impact in Australia. In 2011, Naughton was invited to consult with the\u000a      Parliament of South Australia in its Inquiry into the Australian CCRC Bill\u000a      2010, including a meeting with Hon. Stephen Wade MLC, Shadow Attorney\u000a      General and Shadow Minister of Justice, who visited Naughton at the\u000a      University of Bristol in 2011. Naughton's invited submissions &#8212; based on\u000a      [1] and [2] &#8212; were cited many times in the Legislative Committee's final\u000a      report published in 2012. The Committee accepted Naughton's submission on\u000a      the limitations of a CCRC-style body and decided not to establish a body\u000a      based on that model in South Australia and\/or nationally [i]: hence the\u000a      harm of adopting a UK approach that Naughton's research had demonstrated\u000a      is deeply flawed was avoided. Naughton was also invited by the National\u000a      Institute of Justice of the US Dept of Justice to participate in a two day\u000a      workshop held in September 2010 to discuss best practices for preventing\u000a      and dealing with wrongful convictions and to determine their\u000a      transferability to the United States. Naughton's research [3] [5] was\u000a      referred to several times in the final report by the US Dept of Justice\u000a      and helped to shape its agenda [j].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    This case study details Dr. Michael Naughton's translation of his\u000a      sociological research on wrongful convictions and imprisonment into\u000a      practical help for alleged victims and into policy reforms in the UK and\u000a      internationally. It refers to five impacts, all occurring wholly or mainly\u000a      since 2008: (1) Generating a shift in thinking by the Parole Board in 2008\u000a      about prisoners maintaining innocence which in turn triggered reforms to\u000a      prison policy on the treatment of such prisoners in 2010. (2) Establishing\u000a      26 innocence projects in UK universities under the banner of the Innocence\u000a      Network UK (INUK) which has influenced casework and generated pro bono\u000a      work equivalent to over &#163;5 million.

Naughton's\u000a      first monograph was published in 2007. It identified a tripartite\u000a      connection between public crises of confidence around certain alleged\u000a      miscarriages of justice, concrete evidence in the form of successful\u000a      appeals against criminal convictions, and governmental intervention in\u000a      terms of reforms to correct the apparent cause(s) of the miscarriages of\u000a      justice [3]. This scholarly critique led on to practically-oriented\u000a      research by Naughton that unearthed evidence showing the inability of the\u000a      existing justice system to effect adequate corrective reforms.\u000a    Typology of innocence claims: [1] [4]. In 2005, Naughton published\u000a      on how the risk assessment method adopted by the prison service and Parole\u000a      Board had resulted in what is commonly termed the `parole deal', whereby\u000a      indeterminate-sentenced prisoners are unable to achieve release on parole\u000a      due to their innocence stance [1]. Between 2005 and 2008, Naughton sought\u000a      to develop a more constructive approach to assessing prisoners maintaining\u000a      innocence through continuing active engagements with the prison service\u000a      and Parole Board on one hand, and alleged victims of wrongful imprisonment\u000a      on the other. In 2009, Naughton published his `typology of claims of\u000a      innocence' as a method that the prison service and Parole Board can\u000a      utilise in their assessment of prisoners maintaining innocence and\u000a      assisting such prisoners who might be innocent to make progress and\/or\u000a      attain release [4]. The typology provides a nuanced understanding of the\u000a      range of reasons why prisoners maintain innocence and has fostered a more\u000a      constructive engagement with prisoners maintaining innocence by the prison\u000a      service and Parole Board (see section 4).\u000a    Failure of safeguards: [2] [5] [6]. Since 2006, Naughton has been\u000a      undertaking ongoing research on the way in which apparent `safeguards' of\u000a      the criminal appeal system and the reviews of alleged miscarriages of\u000a      justice by the CCRC can fail the innocent [2]. In particular, his\u000a      publications in 2009 [5] and 2012 [6] emphasised how the statute that\u000a      created the CCRC subordinates it entirely to the criminal appeal system by\u000a      mandating that it can only refer cases back to the appeal courts if there\u000a      is a `real possibility' that the conviction will not be upheld (s.13 of\u000a      the Criminal Appeal Act 1995). Consequently, the CCRC mirrors the Court of\u000a      Appeal and tends to refer cases back to the appeal courts only on `fresh\u000a      evidence' (as required by s.23 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968) and will,\u000a      generally, not be able to assist applicants whose evidence of innocence is\u000a      not deemed to be fresh if it was or could have been available at the time\u000a      of the original trial.\u000a    Casework assistance gap: [2] [3] [5]. Naughton's research between\u000a      2006 and 2009 identified a serious gap in the provision of casework\u000a      assistance to alleged victims of wrongful imprisonment. In particular,\u000a      non-governmental organisations such as JUSTICE and Liberty ceased working\u000a      on alleged wrongful convictions following the establishment of the CCRC on\u000a      the assumption that their services were no longer necessary, and\u000a      programmes such as Channel 4's Trial and Error were axed. In response,\u000a      Naughton's research demonstrated that assumption to be false and\u000a      underpinned the success of his work in reducing the casework assistance\u000a      gap (see section 4).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40307","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"2629691","Name":"Iceland"},{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"1668284","Name":"Taiwan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Levitas's early theoretical work on social exclusion published in 1996\u000a      [1], partly funded by the ESRC [7], has had a huge interdisciplinary\u000a      impact and has continued to be a key reference point (106 citations since\u000a      2008). The concept of social exclusion had an increasingly high profile in\u000a      New Labour discourse from 1997 with the setting up of the Social Exclusion\u000a      Unit. In the years after 2001, the terminology became more central to EU\u000a      discourse and social policy, with member states required to produce\u000a      National Inclusion Plans. International attention to the potential (and\u000a      potentially different) meanings of inclusion was consequently high at this\u000a      time. Levitas's impact was reflected in the very high number of citations\u000a      for The Inclusive Society? (641 since 2008) [2]; in academic\u000a      invitations (including to Harvard in 2001); in invitations to speak to\u000a      non-academic groups, notably people working in local government; and in\u000a      invited contributions to professional journals, such as: `Calculated\u000a      Poverty', The Stakeholder, 5(6) (2002), pp. 12-13. Levitas was\u000a      also invited to give an opening plenary address at the 2003 Social\u000a      Inclusion Research Conference, Canadian Council on Social Development,\u000a      Ottawa (www.ccsd.ca\/events\/inclusion\/papers)\u000a      which was aimed at local and central government and practioners rather\u000a      than academics. Subsequently, in 2005, Levitas was an invited participant\u000a      in Ottawa on the Expert Round Table on Social Inclusion of the Canadian\u000a      Department of Social Development.\u000a    The impact of the 1999 PSE, together with that of the PSE 2002-03\u000a      Northern Ireland Survey, has also been ongoing since 2000, including from\u000a      2008 onwards. The PSE questionnaire was placed in the public domain, and\u000a      widely adapted for use elsewhere (including in Japan in a study published\u000a      in 2010) [e]. The public perception of necessities, key to the consensual\u000a      approach, varies between countries and the method has been introduced in\u000a      many countries across the world to apply nationally appropriate criteria.\u000a      The United Nations Expert Group on Poverty Measurement (Rio Group)\u000a      endorsed the PSE deprivation index construction methodology in 2006 as\u000a      `best practice' to guide national policy makers. In 2011 the European\u000a      Union recommended it as the academic `gold standard' (7th\u000a      Meeting of the EU-SILC Task-Force on Material Deprivation, 19 March\u000a      2011, p. 7). Its continuing influence is evident in poverty policy and\u000a      surveys in more than 50 countries worldwide today. It has changed the way\u000a      that information about poverty is collected, measured and understood by\u000a      governments, academics and NGOs in most OECD countries, including all 27\u000a      European Union member states, Australia, Hong Kong, Iceland, Israel,\u000a      Japan, New Zealand, Mexico, Norway, Switzerland, Taiwan and Turkey. Hence\u000a      the PSE has had global impact. Levitas' collaborative research [4] is\u000a      cited in the European Commission's Eurostat Reports http:\/\/ec.europa.eu\/eurostat\u000a      from 2007 through to the present day [d] funded by the European Commission\u000a      as part of its Programme for Employment and Social Solidarity. The PSE\u000a      approach is also being promoted globally by the UN Dept of Economic and\u000a      Social Affairs: e.g. 2010 report [f].\u000a    The impact of the B-SEM, originally published in 2007 [6], is also\u000a      widespread, ongoing and global: a search produces 20,400 Google hits. The\u000a      Cabinet Office's Social Exclusion Task Force commissioned four pieces of\u000a      work based on the B-SEM framework and addressing different stages of the\u000a      life-course. Three were written by scholars at institutions other than\u000a      Bristol: these were published in 2009 [a] [b] [c]. The Bristol team, this\u000a      time with Fahmy as PI and Levitas and Gordon as CIs, carried out the\u000a      fourth study: Understanding the Risks of Social Exclusion Across the\u000a        Life-Course: Working Age Adults without Dependent Children, Social\u000a      Exclusion Task Force, Cabinet Office, 2009. The approach taken in the\u000a      B-SEM was used extensively by the think-tank Demos in its attempt to\u000a      derive a broader, more multi-dimensional measure of poverty: see their 3D\u000a        Poverty (2010) http:\/\/www.demos.co.uk\/files\/3-D_Poverty_-_web.pdf.\u000a      This continues to be influential, such as in the joint work in 2013 of the\u000a      Family Strategic Partnership and Family and Parenting Institute which\u000a      explicitly frames its analysis in terms of the B-SEM and its adoption by\u000a      Demos (http:\/\/www.familystrategicpartner.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/01\/Policymakinglife_chances.pdf). The\u000a      B-SEM features at the global, regional, national and local levels and in\u000a      diverse contexts. To illustrate, it can be found at the global level in\u000a      the work of the World Health Organisation in 2008 [j]; at the regional\u000a      level in a 2012 EU report whose methodology follows `the seminal study of\u000a      Levitas et al. (2007)' [i]; at the national level in the work of the\u000a      Australian government in 2008 [h]; and at the local level by the\u000a      Hertfordshire Safeguarding Children Board in 2011 (http:\/\/www.hertssafeguarding.org.uk).\u000a      It is used in diverse contexts: in commercial care home management in the\u000a      UK in 2013 by Croner-i (http:\/\/cronersolutions.co.uk);\u000a      in tackling social exclusion in libraries, museums, archives and galleries\u000a      in 2009 (http:\/\/www.seapn.org.uk\/site_content_files\/files\/newsletter_ns_99.pdf);\u000a      and in the UK Equip online tool, developed for the JRF and currently in\u000a      use, to help housing providers assess the impact of their existing or\u000a      potential new policies (http:\/\/www.equip.org.uk\/policy-elements\/).\u000a    The various impacts are cumulating and coming through in the response to\u000a      the first results of the most recent survey, PSEUK 2012. A prime time ITV\u000a      documentary based on the initial results was broadcast at 7.30 pm on 28\u000a      March 2013 and was watched by an estimated 3.3 million viewers. It\u000a      stimulated widespread debates about cuts in welfare spending. An e-mail\u000a      from the ITV Tonight programme producer on 3 April 2013 stated: `everyone\u000a      is delighted with the response we had to Breadline Britain, the ratings\u000a      were great 3.3 million and 17% but more than that the emails we've had in\u000a      from viewers expressing their concern for our contributors has been\u000a      incredible' [g].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research by Professor Ruth Levitas (solely-authored and co-authored as\u000a      indicated below) has transformed the definition and measurement of social\u000a      exclusion and poverty in the UK and worldwide by national governments, the\u000a      United Nations (UN), the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and\u000a      Development (OECD) and the European Union (EU). It has also shaped the\u000a      work of local actors in diverse contexts. It fed into the measurement of\u000a      social exclusion in the 1999 Poverty and Social Exclusion (PSE) survey,\u000a      which was distinguished by its incorporation of a social dimension into\u000a      the measurement of social exclusion. Levitas took the lead role in\u000a      developing the measurement of social exclusion in the 1999 PSE. Subsequent\u000a      work involving Levitas on these issues was taken up by the UK Cabinet\u000a      Office in 2006, resulting in the B-SEM (Bristol Social Exclusion Matrix)\u000a      in 2007. The B-SEM forms the basis of the measurement of social exclusion\u000a      in the 2012 PSE survey, the largest poverty survey ever undertaken in the\u000a      UK. The impact of the 1999 PSE and the B-SEM has been global and profound\u000a      since 2008 &#8212; nationally in the measurement of poverty and the use of\u000a      direct indicators of material and social deprivation; and internationally\u000a      in the measurement of both poverty and social exclusion. Public interest\u000a      in the initial results of the 2012 PSE is indicative of the fact that the\u000a      impact is continuing.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    University of Bristol\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Bristol (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Bristol","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"South West","UKPRN":10007786}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2654675","Name":"Bristol"},{"GeoNamesId":"6094817","Name":"Ottawa"},{"GeoNamesId":"1819729","Name":"Hong Kong"}],"References":"\u000a    Outputs\u000a    \u000a[1] Levitas, RA (1996) 'The Concept of Social Exclusion and the New\u000a      \"Durkheimian\" Hegemony', Critical Social Policy, 16 (1), pp. 5-20.\u000a      DOI: 10.1177\/026101839601604601.

However, they disagree on what\u000a      social exclusion is or what the `best' policies are to address it.\u000a      Reliable and accurate measurement of poverty and exclusion is an essential\u000a      prerequisite of providing policy makers and the general public with\u000a      scientific evidence on the effectiveness and efficiency of such policies.\u000a      In addition without good measurement, such policies and programmes cannot\u000a      be evaluated.\u000a    Levitas's original research in 1995-96 involved a critical analysis of\u000a      the concept of social exclusion as deployed in the EU [1]. She used this\u000a      approach in further research in 1996-97 to critique the discourse of New\u000a      Labour in relation to social exclusion [2], supported by an ESRC grant\u000a      [7]. The research in this early work [1] [2] and subsequently [3] [4]\u000a      found that it was clear that the dominant mode of understanding social\u000a      inclusion in both public and political discourse was inclusion in paid\u000a      work. The research labelled this a social integrationist discourse (SID).\u000a      Also present were a redistributive discourse (RED), although this was\u000a      being displaced, and a moral underclass discourse (MUD), which focused on\u000a      the behaviour of the poor. The specifically social aspects of social\u000a      integration were conspicuously lacking from public discourse and official\u000a      indicators of social exclusion. In 1998-99, as part of the preparatory\u000a      work for the PSE 1999 and funded by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF)\u000a      [8] [9], Levitas worked with Peter Townsend, David Gordon and Christina\u000a      Pantazis &#8212; all School for Policy Studies (SPS), University of Bristol &#8212; on\u000a      operationalising social exclusion for the survey. It was innovative in\u000a      having a social dimension in terms of participation in common social\u000a      activities, social support and the extent and quality of social networks.\u000a      The PSE 1999 &#8212; which Levitas led conceptually &#8212; developed a rigorous,\u000a      theory-based, scientific methodology of poverty, deprivation and social\u000a      exclusion indicators which are suitable, valid, reliable and additive. The\u000a      use of consensual methods incorporates the views of the public into the\u000a      measurement of poverty: it also allows the direct measurement of material\u000a      deprivation and restricted social participation in relation to\u000a      democratically set norms. The PSE 1999 was a cross-institution study\u000a      funded by the JRF [9] in which the Principal Investigator (PI) was\u000a      Jonathan Bradshaw (York) with Levitas as a Co-Investigator (CI) and\u000a      resulted in an influential publication in 2006 of which Levitas was one of\u000a      three co-authors [5].\u000a    As a result of this high profile success, Levitas as PI and a group of\u000a      colleagues in SPS, Bristol, named below as CIs were commissioned in 2006\u000a      by the UK Cabinet Office to undertake an assessment of existing data sets\u000a      in terms of their potential for examining social exclusion [10]. This\u000a      project devised the Bristol Social Exclusion Matrix (B-SEM) as a framework\u000a      for assessing multi-dimensional poverty and social exclusion. It\u000a      incorporates distinctive dimensions of social participation and quality of\u000a      life. This study reported in 2007 [6], and was used by the Cabinet Office\u000a      as the basis for commissioning further research conducted in 2007-08 [11]\u000a      with Levitas as a CI, Eldin Fahmy as PI and David Gordon as the other CI\u000a      (both SPS, Bristol) [11]. The B-SEM then provided the underpinning\u000a      theoretical framework for assessing social exclusion in the 2012 PSEUK\u000a      (Poverty and Social Exclusion in the UK) project, funded by a &#163;4.3 million\u000a      grant from the ESRC [12] (http:\/\/www.poverty.ac.uk\/pse-research\/pse-uk-2012).\u000a      Launched in 2010 and due to conclude in 2014, this is the largest study of\u000a      poverty and social exclusion ever undertaken in the UK. It involves a team\u000a      of over twenty researchers in six universities and two survey\u000a      organisations, with David Gordon (SPS, Bristol) as PI and Levitas as a CI.\u000a      The B-SEM framework of social exclusion incorporates social relations,\u000a      social participation and quality of life as key components. The research\u000a      will provide the most detailed and theoretically grounded assessment of\u000a      experiences of poverty and social exclusion among the UK population since\u000a      the onset of the financial crisis and subsequent long and deep recession.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40397","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"},{"GeoNamesId":"453733","Name":"Estonia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Research on European and global LGBT rights has impacted on\u000d\u000a      international, European and UK human rights law, standards of care, health\u000d\u000a      policies, and the training of mental health professionals.

Supplemented with new\u000d\u000a      quantitative methods of en-masse narrative analysis, research for the\u000d\u000a      Discrimination Law Review (2006) [1] and a wide-ranging\u000d\u000a      multi-language study for the Council of Europe(2008) which co-ordinated\u000d\u000a      data collection using European sociologists [2] found entrenched\u000d\u000a      structural inequalities resisting legal change, demonstrating a need for\u000d\u000a      positive equalities policies, particularly in the public sector. This\u000d\u000a      served as a platform for the development of wider, dynamic research into\u000d\u000a      transgender rights, with a focus on transgender health care [3] in\u000d\u000a      recent years and the activism\/scholarship connection.\u000d\u000a    This relationship between activism and scholarship was central to\u000d\u000a      research on transnational LGBTQ activism in Central and Eastern Europe by\u000d\u000a      Binnie and Klesse (2008-2009). An interdisciplinary qualitative project\u000d\u000a      examined the spatial dynamics of LGBTQ activist networks at protest events\u000d\u000a      in Poland, it involved a mixed-method qualitative methodology, in-depth\u000d\u000a      interviews with 35 transnational LGBT activists, and participant\u000d\u000a      observation of LGBTQ protest events. The key findings of this research\u000d\u000a      were that solidarity is a key to the formation of transnational activist\u000d\u000a      networks, and that coalitions are subject to tensions around age, gender,\u000d\u000a      class and nationality. Moreover, the project demonstrates the centrality\u000d\u000a      of transnational coalitions and socio-economic inequalities to\u000d\u000a      contemporary European LGBT politics.\u000d\u000a    As a pioneer of the geographies of sexualities, through a series of\u000d\u000a      ground-breaking publications, Binnie has charted the development of\u000d\u000a      research on the spatialities of sexual subjectivities and politics since\u000d\u000a      the mid-1990s. His work provided a theoretical overview and critique of\u000d\u000a      the emerging field of global sexualities studies between the mid-1990s and\u000d\u000a      the mid-2000s culminating in his ground-breaking book The\u000d\u000a        Globalization of Sexuality [4]. This monograph established a\u000d\u000a      political economic framework for research on global sexualities,\u000d\u000a      foregrounding questions of class and redistribution as key dimensions of\u000d\u000a      transnational sexual politics and activism. This established a theoretical\u000d\u000a      framework for collaborative research on transnational LGBT activism in\u000d\u000a      Central and Eastern Europe with Klesse (2008-2009). Binnie also examines\u000d\u000a      socio-economic inequalities in publications drawing on data collected of\u000d\u000a      the qualitative ESRC-funded study on sustainable gay space entitled Violence,\u000a        Security, Space: A Study of the Practical and Policy Context of\u000d\u000a        Sustainable Safe Public Spaces, in Manchester (1999-2001), led by\u000d\u000a      Professor Beverley Skeggs [5]. This project entailed a\u000d\u000a      mixed-method project including qualitative interviews and focus groups\u000d\u000a      with different user groups of Manchester's gay village.\u000d\u000a    Klesse's [6] qualitative interview-based, discourse-analytical\u000d\u000a      research on non-heterosexual, non-monogamous relationships and identities\u000d\u000a      (undertaken between 1997 and 2003) established non-monogamy as a key theme\u000d\u000a      within sexuality studies. It also demonstrated the social invisibility of,\u000d\u000a      and discrimination against bisexual and polyamorous communities. This work\u000d\u000a      highlighted the centrality of conflicts around non-monogamy in gay male,\u000d\u000a      bisexual and polyamorous politics.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40573","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The programme of research has had a significant impact on \"major\u000d\u000a        strategic shifts\" (Research Scientist at the Environment Agency) at\u000d\u000a      the Environment Agency in the area of flooding, in two key respects.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Two years ago, in 2011, the Environment Agency undertook a Flood\u000d\u000a        Warning Service Improvements Project. A Research Scientist of the\u000d\u000a        Environment Agency explains that this: `used the evidence from your\u000d\u000a          Public response to Flood Warning research (SC020116) to change the\u000d\u000a          flood warning codes and messages'. Both the number and design of\u000d\u000a        the flood warning codes were changed in line with the focus group\u000d\u000a        findings. As a direct result of Surrey's research, the Environment\u000d\u000a        Agency introduced new flood warning codes in November 2010. With over\u000d\u000a        5.5 million people (one in six properties) living with flood risk in\u000d\u000a        England and Wales, the improvements made are expected to result in\u000d\u000a        increased awareness of flood risk and greater public understanding of\u000d\u000a        flood warnings and hence resilience.\u000d\u000a      Secondly, research published in Burningham, K. et al.

The NRPP\u000a      evaluation found confidence in policing increased in the trial sites by 15\u000a      percentage points over a\u000a      12-month period, compared to a three point increase in the comparison\u000a      sites (Tuffin et al, 2006).\u000a      The same research revealed a high degree of consistency between the NRPP\u000a      delivery\u000a      mechanisms, police activity on the ground, and impact. The increase in\u000a      public confidence was\u000a      predicated on a reduction in the crime and anti-social behaviour problems\u000a      identified by local\u000a      communities as a priority for police action (`signal crimes') rather than\u000a      an overall reduction in\u000a      volume crime (Innes and Fielding, 2002). The design of the NRPP was\u000a      directly linked to the Signal\u000a      Crimes perspective developed at Surrey. Transferable tools, such as the\u000a      Environmental Scanning\u000a      Tool, which officers use to record indicators of crime and disorder,\u000a      facilitated it.\u000a    There is evidence that the NPP, which was informed by the Signal Crime\u000a      perspective and operates\u000a      in all police services in England and Wales, is associated with the\u000a      improvements in confidence in\u000a      local policing observed between 2003\/04 and 2011\/12 (ONS, 2012). There is,\u000a      as the head of\u000a      research at the College of Policing, noted `a strong case that the focus\u000a      on tackling local issues\u000a      informed by the Signal Crimes perspective lies behind the change in the\u000a      trend in public confidence,\u000a      linked to perceptions of the crime rate'. A three-year NPP was officially\u000a      launched in April 2005.\u000a      Every neighbourhood in England and Wales had a dedicated team by April\u000a      2008.\u000a    Guidance derived from the RP work prioritised attention to community\u000a      influentials (those at pivot\u000a      points in the formation of local public opinion at neighbourhood level),\u000a      the role of community\u000a      informants (not paid informants but individuals motivated to exchange\u000a      reliable information with\u000a      police), and the need for connected action with other municipal agencies\u000a      (e.g., equipping police\u000a      vehicles with online facilities with which citizens can report problems in\u000a      the physical environment,\u000a      such as a broken streetlamp, to the relevant council department). The NPP\u000a      had a central presence\u000a      in the Flanagan Review of Policing in 2008, and the Casey Engaging\u000a      Communities in Fighting\u000a      Crime Review. The then Labour Government renewed its commitment to\u000a      sustaining NP. The 2011\u000a      Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act reaffirm commitment to the\u000a      principles. A driver of\u000a      these policies was the research conducted at Surrey. Research that the\u000a      Association of Chief Police\u000a      Officers (ACPO) lead on the Home Office `Prevent' strategy described as\u000a      `influencing [one of] the\u000a      two most significant developments in police policy in the last decade'.\u000a    Findings on the interaction between minor public incivilities and\u000a      perceived crime risk at\u000a      neighbourhood level were among the first to emerge from research in the\u000a      UK. Via work with Surrey\u000a      Police they underpinned the first application of the `broken windows'\u000a      approach to UK policing. This\u000a      formed the basis of N Fielding's knowledge exchange work with the police\u000a      (ESRC Public Policy\u000a      seminars at House of Lords, Police Foundation\/Oxford University\u000a      academic\/chief officer seminars,\u000a      and reference 4 in section 3). Innes established and directs the\u000a      Universities' Police Science\u000a      Institute at Cardiff University, continuing work on NP. The `environmental\u000a      scan' work continues. In\u000a      2010 and 2011 N and J Fielding applied an enhanced instrument in\u000a      geo-referenced fieldwork (with\u000a      ESRC funding) involving Surrey Police that assessed the latent\u000a      criminogenic effects of local\u000a      authority housing and education policy in a mixed residential area. The\u000a      team provided residents,\u000a      community influentials, and police with tools to assess risk; evaluation\u000a      of impact is in progress.\u000a    Based on our work in 2010 and 2011 on the interaction of the NPP and\u000a      intelligence-led policing,\u000a      Surrey Police have re-oriented aspects of practice, including:\u000a    \u000a      consulting with citizens through social media, email and website\u000a      reviewing how officers record and communicate their decision making\u000a        processes\u000a      encouraging officers to resolve problems in ways other than the\u000a        enforcement of the criminal\u000a        law\u000a    \u000a    Improvements in policing and public safety are testament to the benefits\u000a      partnerships between\u000a      universities and police service can produce.

The former deriving from the collective actions of\u000a      neighbours that are\u000a      productive of social order, the latter, the interventions of formal agents\u000a      of social control. We\u000a      positioned policing as one amongst several modes of social control that\u000a      are routinely involved in\u000a      framing citizen experiences of public spaces, whilst at the same time\u000a      tracing the contours of the\u000a      limits to what policing can and should be enacted to achieve. We linked\u000a      Goffman's (1972)\u000a      argument that social order in urban environments is a fragile and\u000a      contingent veneer, with his view\u000a      that impressions are all that we have in organising our conduct, to argue,\u000a      perhaps counter-intuitively, that agencies involved in the provision of neighbourhood\u000a      security must attend to surface\u000a      appearances, rather than the deep-rooted causes of problems.\u000a    Reassurance policing and neighbourhood policing (RP\/NP)\u000a    In the early 2000s some police services in England and Wales became\u000a      concerned that citizens\u000a      perceived that crime was rising in their local areas despite sustained\u000a      falls in the actual crime rate.\u000a      Often referred to as the `reassurance gap,' police services began to\u000a      explore styles of policing to fill\u000a      that gap, often through tackling crime, anti-social behaviour and quality\u000a      of life issues of particular\u000a      concern to local communities. Within this context, Nigel Fielding, Jane\u000a      Fielding and Martin Innes\u000a      were initially asked by the Chief Constable of Surrey Police, Denis\u000a      O'Connor (later HM Chief\u000a      Inspector of Police) to evaluate the force's programme of Reassurance\u000a      Policing. Subsequently, the\u000a      Metropolitan Police Service asked the team to include MPS areas in the\u000a      research. Trials began in\u000a      Surrey and London which would be precursors to the National Reassurance\u000a      Policing Programme\u000a      (NRPP).\u000a    The design of the NRPP was closely allied to the emerging Signal Crimes\u000a      perspective. After an\u000a      appraisal of the Chicago Alternative Policing initiative and research on\u000a      the relationship between\u000a      public incivilities\/disorder and perceived social integration\/crime risk\u000a      in neighbourhoods, the\u000a      University of Surrey team designed and piloted an `environmental scan'\u000a      instrument, and developed\u000a      a methodology to integrate it with quantitative analysis of existing force\u000a      surveys of public\u000a      confidence\/satisfaction. This work, presented to Surrey Police in 2002,\u000a      also produced a\u000a      conceptualisation of `Signal Crimes' (Innes and Fielding, 2002) and a\u000a      systematic analysis of how\u000a      alignment of police services with other municipal and regional agencies\u000a      can secure enhanced\u000a      engagement of disaffiliated minorities and other disadvantaged groups with\u000a      police, which is then\u000a      reflected in improved public satisfaction with police services.\u000a    In developing the NRPP the University of Surrey team also worked closely\u000a      with the Police\u000a      Foundation to ensure that lessons were learned from the failure of\u000a      previous community initiatives;\u000a      to monitor progress in the initial trial sites in Surrey and the MPS; and\u000a      to assess the readiness of\u000a      six selected forces to join the main NRPP. In addition, the team engaged\u000a      in the original\u000a      Reassurance Policing work was centrally involved in the evaluation of the\u000a      sixteen BCU sites where\u000a      Neighbourhood Policing underwent pilot implementation under Home Office\u000a      direction. The field\u000a      evaluation was led by Innes, with N Fielding contributing on research\u000a      design, data analysis and\u000a      data analysis technology.

Working from core elements of community policing, it\u000a      suggests that what are\u000a      received as reassuring police interventions against crime and disorder\u000a      differ in respect of specific\u000a      incidents (major crimes) or conditions (abandoned vehicles, broken\u000a      windows) by the geo-location,\u000a      socio-economic status and local knowledge in locales. The work on\u000a      Reassurance Policing also\u000a      rendered new empirically-based analysis of the much-debated relationship\u000a      between crime and\u000a      incivilities (the `broken windows' hypothesis). Specifically, actions to\u000a      quell incivilities and signs of\u000a      disorder do not deter major crime but do engender social capital that is\u000a      indirectly deployable\u000a      against crime (the creation of `capable guardians') as well as being a\u000a      good in its own right (in terms\u000a      of community-building). Further analysis focuses on technological and\u000a      organisational facilitators of\u000a      effectively-coordinated multi-agency response to deterioration in the\u000a      built environment and the\u000a      social disorder that often accompanies it.\u000a    Nigel Fielding, Jane Fielding and Karen Bullock are current members of\u000a        staff in the Department of\u000a        Sociology at Surrey.

The idea of developing computational\u000d\u000a      models to express complex sociological theories of innovation was also\u000d\u000a      ground-breaking (Gilbert, Pyka and Ahrweiler, 2001). The SEIN project was\u000d\u000a      followed by one funded by the German DAAD and the British Council in which\u000d\u000a      the model was augmented by a representation of the market, so that firms\u000d\u000a      not only had relationships involving the transfer of knowledge but also\u000d\u000a      traded in a market, exchanging products for money. This was continued with\u000d\u000a      a further EC-funded project in which the original model was developed\u000d\u000a      further and applied to the Framework Programme itself.\u000d\u000a    The model was then made available as program code together with some ten\u000d\u000a      academic publications from the three developers describing various\u000d\u000a      `experiments' with the model. This encouraged widespread interest in the\u000d\u000a      model by research groups around the world (e.g. in China, Chile, the USA\u000d\u000a      and many European countries), and it now forms the basis of a number of\u000d\u000a      major research efforts examining topics such as the growth of industrial\u000d\u000a      eco-parks in South Korea, the future of the European defence industry and\u000d\u000a      Irish industrial policy (see section 4 for more examples and their\u000d\u000a      impact). Two workshops (with a third planned for May 2014) for users of\u000d\u000a      the SKIN model also encouraged take up, and have led to a book to be\u000d\u000a      published by Springer in 2014 that includes contributions from many users\u000d\u000a      describing their applications of the model.\u000d\u000a    SKIN is an agent-based model (see N. Gilbert (2008) Agent-Based\u000d\u000a        Models. SAGE) in which the agents represent firms. Each firm has a\u000d\u000a      `kene' (Gilbert 1997) standing for the firm's particular knowledge,\u000d\u000a      expertise and skills. A subset of the kene is the firm's `innovation\u000d\u000a      hypothesis', a design for a potentially innovative product. In the basic\u000d\u000a      model, firms attempt to sell their products to other firms, and have to\u000d\u000a      source their production requirements from other firms, thus making the\u000d\u000a      model as a whole a circular economy. Firms are able to develop their kenes\u000d\u000a      (and thus their innovation hypotheses and products) through incremental or\u000d\u000a      radical research, and by exchanging knowledge with partner firms. Prices\u000d\u000a      are set by firms according to market conditions, and firms also have to\u000d\u000a      learn what a suitable price for their products is. The model allows for\u000d\u000a      firms to die when they have no more funds, and for start-ups to enter the\u000d\u000a      market. After calibrating the model with a range of parameters that\u000d\u000a      represent specific industries or sectors, the model can be used to examine\u000d\u000a      the effect of policies such as those that encourage knowledge transfer\u000d\u000a      between firms.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41126","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"146669","Name":"Cyprus"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The participatory nature of the underpinning research helped to ensure\u000a      its beneficial impacts on contributing individuals and organisations. The\u000a      access and trust offered to the project's research team by these\u000a      organisations &#8212; which are usually closed to outsiders &#8212; are indicative of\u000a      the significance of the project specifically, and of the CMRB more\u000a      generally, to them. Increased community participation and cohesion via\u000a        co-research: At the end of the research in 2008, special meetings\u000a      were organised with each of the participating research communities to\u000a      share the results and disseminate a video produced during the research\u000a      sessions for them to use for their own purposes. The participants received\u000a      special certificates, some awarded by MP Diana Abbott as part of a Hackney\u000a      Migrants' Day. Several hundred participants, including community theatre\u000a      specialists, policy makers, community activists and academics also engaged\u000a      with the project's final conference on `Theoretical, Methodological and\u000a        Political Implications of Doing Research Among Refugees' (2-8 March\u000a      2008). In addition to theoretical and academic papers, the conference\u000a      included presentations by some of the research participants, as well as\u000a      Forum workshops aimed especially at the activists and policy-makers in\u000a      attendance. About 20-30 people attended each workshop, which included\u000a      enacted scenes relating to refugees' encounters with local authorities,\u000a      schools and social security.\u000a    Both during that conference and informally and in gathered testimonies,\u000a      the co-ordinators of the participating refugee groups expressed their\u000a      appreciation for the mutual respect and reciprocal relationships\u000a      established between the research team and their own members [a].\u000a      They also acknowledged the transformative impacts of the IPSA project on\u000a      participants from within their groups, and on their own capacity to\u000a      effectively administer the services they provide. The impacts were often a\u000a      result of breaking taboos around discussion of issues such as sexuality\u000a      and family relations via their transformation from individual issues to\u000a      shared and collective ones. As the coordinator of the Kosovan youth group\u000a      explained: \"[As a result of the IPSA project] we realize more about youth\u000a      identity and the need to co-create long term processes of engagement and\u000a      participation using applied arts.\" The encouragement of and support for\u000a      participants' reflection on issues within their own community, as well as\u000a      the wider society and the state, also affected their professional lives.\u000a      As a worker from the advice trainees' group explained: \"I've been working\u000a      as a group leader for ten years...after my engagement in the participatory\u000a      theatre I viewed social relations differently'. Her own work changed but\u000a      she was also \"able to articulate that with my colleagues\" [a].\u000a      Furthermore, the project supported participating community groups in\u000a      setting up their own, sustainable group projects. The Shpresa group, for\u000a      example, used the project as a platform to establish an `Alabanian\u000a      X-factor', using a combination of Alabanian and British rap and fashion in\u000a      a participatory project which has now been running for several years.\u000a    Provision of new methodological tools improving the provision of\u000a      services by community organisations across and beyond London: The\u000a      reach of the research impacts has been extended beyond project\u000a      participants and local arts organisations to other community and support\u000a      organisations across and beyond London via their use of our participatory\u000a      theatre methodology. The CMRB has received requests from numerous\u000a      community organizations for permission to use (and for its provision of\u000a      support in implementing) the methodology. It was, for instance, widely\u000a      recognised as an effective tool for disseminating information about and\u000a      raising awareness of carers' issues (Enfield Carers Centre); homelessness\u000a      among Roma (Roma Support Group); and issues of advocacy for mental health\u000a      users (Studio Upstairs). At Elders Voice it was used in 2010 to support\u000a      the development of 'Belonging in Brent' an intergenerational project in a\u000a      multi-ethnic area of London and involving Afro-Caribbean and Irish elderly\u000a      people and youth [b]. The organisation employed IPSA's Senior\u000a      Research Fello (Kaptani) to work with them in using the methodology to\u000a      support \"older and younger adults to come together to share their stories\u000a      and insights in a non-threatening collaborative and enjoyable way\". Within\u000a      the Migrant Rights Network, the approach was used in community work with\u000a      other migrants groups including Enfield carers centre, Arachne Greek\u000a      Cypriot centre and Cecil Housing Trust [b]. The reach of the\u000a      impacts of the research methodology has been enhanced by reference to it\u000a      in various published resources supporting community development, policy,\u000a      social work and education [c].\u000a    Development of new artistic and cultural resources engaging public\u000a        audiences with issues relating to the research: In 2008 the Kaptani\u000a      worked with research participants and research team actors to write,\u000a      produce and stage a Verbatim Theatre play titled `Suspended Lives', based\u000a      on scenes and interview extracts collated in the original research\u000a      project. Recognising the importance and relevance of the play, a local\u000a      London theatre venue, Tara Studios, invited the team to perform there as\u000a      part of their `Displacement Week' programme (2-4 October 2008) and brought\u000a      in new audiences of community centres, refugees and young people [d].\u000a      Each performance was followed by Forum workshops and attracted full house\u000a      audiences. The play was subsequently commissioned by Harrow Migrant and\u000a      Refugee Forum for inclusion in its Refugee week (27 June, 2009), and by\u000a      Rich Mix for delivery as part of its Identity and Migration season (2-4\u000a      July 2009). Over the course of a total run of 7 performances, the play\u000a      engaged more than 500 members of the general public with the important\u000a      socio-political issues that it raised. Although these audiences were not\u000a      canvassed at the time, feedback on the performances suggests their\u000a      particular impact on audience awareness of and engagement with issues\u000a      relating both to migration and to individuals' experiences of that\u000a      process. According to the theatre programmer who invited 'Suspended Lives'\u000a      to present the play at Tara Studios, \"the interactive workshops with the\u000a      audience and the public debate following the play were important for using\u000a      theatre as a medium for citizenship\" [e]. One cast member (a\u000a      participant from the Kurdish group) reported that audience members spoke\u000a      of how the play made them realise that there were issues about the refugee\u000a      community that they had never thought about before [e]. As such,\u000a      `Suspended Lives' played an important role in disseminating the research\u000a      findings and providing audiences with deeper insights to the lived\u000a      experiences and multi-layered identities of refugees living in London.\u000a    The participatory approach developed through the project has also\u000a      supported the work of art organizations such as Studio Upstairs, Tara\u000a      Arts, Rich Mix, the Geoffrye Museum, and the Museum of Manchester. Here,\u000a      it was used to support an exploration of issues of community inclusion by\u000a      providing a way \"to broker and facilitate an open and honest conversation\u000a      between the institutions and community participants in a way in which the\u000a      community members would not be at a disadvantage\" [f].\u000a    Contributions to policy discussion and debate: As well as a\u000a      general public audience, policy makers constituted an important target for\u000a      dissemination work relating to the project. In January 2007 the UEL\u000a      Identity and Social Action research programme (headed by Prof. Maggie\u000a      Wetherell) made a submission to the Integration and Social Cohesion\u000a      Commission based on the contributions of all the research projects in the\u000a      programme. That submission informed the Commission's final report,\u000a      released in June 2007 [g], but since used to develop myriad\u000a      strategies and policies relating to community cohesion and partnership. In\u000a      addition, members of the research team presented their findings at three\u000a      conferences organised by the programme specifically for policy makers\u000a      working in the field of migration, social cohesion and belonging. The\u000a      integrative, participatory methods and specific insights developed through\u000a      the research have also been used internationally: recent examples include\u000a      its use by AKMA, a Greek organisation working with newly arrived Afgani\u000a      refugees to Lesbos. In 2009, Prof. Yuval-Davis was appointed as a\u000a      consultant to a local authority in Sweden leading the `Youth in Action &#8212;\u000a      Democracy Project', an EU-funded project. Drawing on her experience in\u000a      developing the dialogical approach to participation and integration used\u000a      in IPSA, Yuval Davis advised on transversal dialogue and integration\u000a      politics. The project was subsequently declared the 2013 best European\u000a      practice example by Sweden's National Youth Agency [h].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research conducted at UEL as part of an ESRC-funded participatory project\u000a      exploring identity, performance and social action among refugee\u000a      communities in London has enhanced cohesion within the participating\u000a      communities, and supported the transfer of specialist expertise and skills\u000a      from academia to local community and artistic organisations.

The Refugees Research Centre was established in\u000a      2004 and expanded in 2009 to form the Centre for Research on Migration,\u000a      Refugees and Belonging (CMRB). Directed by Professor Nira Yuval-Davis and\u000a      Professor Philip Marfleet the Centre has achieved high standing in both\u000a      academic circles and related communities and organisations involved in\u000a      various collaborative work with the Centre. UEL's expertise in this area\u000a      has been supported by the development of close and embedded relations with\u000a      refugee and other migrant communities in London by staff and post-graduate\u000a      students; many of those communities have given their archives to the\u000a      Centre and organised activities relating to its work.\u000a    The impacts described here are underpinned primarily by work conducted by\u000a      the CMRB between 2005 and 2008 as part of the ESRC \"Identity, Performance\u000a      and Social Action: The Use of Participatory Theatre Among Refugees\" (IPSA)\u000a      project. The project was directed by Professor Yuval-Davis (joined UEL in\u000a      2003). The Senior Research Fellow was Erene Kaptani, an associate member\u000a      of the Centre. The CMRB's history of forging and sustaining personal and\u000a      collective embedded relationships was central to the success of the IPSA\u000a      research project. Rather than relying on more conventional interview\u000a      techniques, the IPSA project explored the utility of a combination of\u000a      participatory theatre techniques which would expose the dialogical nature\u000a      of the construction and politics of identities and belonging. The key\u000a      techniques considered were Playback &#8212; improvisational theatre based on\u000a      stories told by audience members &#8212; and Forum theatre &#8212; in which real\u000a      problems are staged with fictional characters in an unsolved form, the\u000a      audience being invited to suggest and act out solutions. The principal\u000a      project aims were to develop participatory theatre techniques as a social\u000a      science research method [1, 2], and to develop theoretical insights on the\u000a      dialogical performativity and performance of social identities [3, 4]. The\u000a      project particularly explored social issues relating to refugees'\u000a      experiences both of settling in London and of becoming integrated within\u000a      the twin processes of inclusion\/exclusion [5, 6].\u000a    Project partners included four local refugee groups, each of which\u000a      provided 15-30 participants. Those groups were: the Kosovan Shpresa youth\u000a      programme; the Kurdish Alkevi Community Theatre group; the Somali Women's\u000a      Group (Stratford); and participants of a mixed Migrants counselling\u000a      training course in Hackney. During 2006-7 two Playback Theatre sessions\u000a      and four Forum theatre workshops were run by the research team for each of\u000a      these groups in their regular meeting places. During the Playback sessions\u000a      participants were asked to tell stories from their lives, focused on\u000a      settling in London, which were immediately recreated by a group of\u000a      Playback actors. The Forum theatre workshops, which built on some of the\u000a      stories brought out through the Playback sessions, asked participants to\u000a      work on building characters and a scene (reflecting one or more of the\u000a      Playback stories), providing opportunities to highlight their feelings\u000a      both of hope and despair, and to develop debates about strategies of\u000a      empowerment and conflict resolution. Follow-up individual interviews with\u000a      a sub-sample of those groups were used to gather feedback on the impact of\u000a      and insights provided by the sessions. Key findings of the research\u000a      highlighted the need to treat `refugees' as a non-homogenous category\u000a      whose differential access to economic and social capital mediates their\u000a      settlement processes and encounters with the state and local communities.\u000a      They also highlighted the importance of community organisations as a\u000a      significant source of support in settlement and integration in refugees'\u000a      precarious existence. Refugees were shown to develop multi-layered senses\u000a      of belonging: longing for and\/or loyalty to their country of origin\u000a      co-exists with a sense of local belonging which is often pragmatic or\u000a      ambivalent as a result of racialisation or exclusion. Even when state\u000a      policies are aimed at inclusion and integration, lack of case sensitivity\u000a      can make them counterproductive.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41128","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research outlined above has stimulated and informed discussion and\u000a      debate about the potential legacies of the London 2012 Olympic games and\u000a      helped to define the dynamics of Olympic legacy, including the notion of\u000a      `legacy momentum'. It has informed the analysis, planning and evaluation\u000a      of urban regeneration policy and practice relating to that legacy by the\u000a      Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), UK\u000a      Government Department for Communities and Local Government, and Greater\u000a      London Assembly (GLA).\u000a    Some of these impacts have been delivered via LERI's use of the research\u000a      to establish a broad network of collaborative links with external partners\u000a      in UK universities (University College London, Queen Mary College) and in\u000a      universities in Brazil (the Architectural and Urban Technology Research\u000a      Nucleus of the University of S&#227;o Paulo and Gama Filho University, Rio de\u000a      Janeiro) and Spain (Centre d'Estudis Ol&#237;mpics i de l'Esport at the\u000a      Autonomous University of Barcelona). In September 2013 UEL hosted the\u000a      International Conference on `Olympic Legacies - impacts of mega-events\u000a        on cities', at which papers were presented by over 120 academics,\u000a      professionals and policy makers from across the world.\u000a    Shaping and influencing Local Government policy (London Assembly) on\u000a        the assessment and delivery of Olympic Legacy.\u000a      The UEL\/London Assembly commissioned research review of Olympic Legacy\u000a      published in 2007 [2] was presented in autumn 2007 to the then-Major of\u000a      London, Ken Livingstone. It was used between 2008-2012 to brief London\u000a      Assembly members, and metrics reported in it were used by Assembly members\u000a      to press the Olympic Delivery bodies on outcome measures [a]. It\u000a      was also referenced in the Written Evidence presented in January 2010 by\u000a      the London Assembly EDCST Committee to the House of Commons Culture, Media\u000a      and Sport Committee [b]. In addition, evidence from the report was\u000a      reproduced in the London Assembly's own 2009 policy document, `Toward a\u000a        Lasting Legacy' [c], many sections of which drew directly on\u000a      conclusions from [2]. The findings of the report are, for example,\u000a      described (and the report itself referenced) in paragraphs 1.5 (p.8); 3.1\u000a      (p.13); 4.1 (p. 21); and 6.1 and 6.2 (p. 28).\u000a    The subsequent ESRC-funded evaluation of key indicators of legacy [6]\u000a      provided a longitudinal evaluation of the initial impact of the London\u000a      2012 Games on the UK, London and local boroughs. The studies conducted as\u000a      part of that evaluation enabled LERI to engage with local and UK\u000a      government and LOCOG to fulfill its commitments to the IOC, and to\u000a      evaluate government policy performance and the value of investment in the\u000a      Games. This provided an evidence-base to inform public investment\u000a      decisions and interventions required to achieve positive outcomes in the\u000a      post- games legacy phase.\u000a    Working with the Department for Communities and Local Government and\u000a        OECD to a review of the UK approach to Legacy.\u000a      The international Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u000a      (OECD) programme on Local Economic and Employment Development (LEED) has\u000a      advised government and communities across many countries since 1982 on how\u000a      to respond to economic change and tackle complex problems. Through its\u000a      Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG), the UK Government\u000a      invited the OECD LEED Programme to carry out a peer review of the Olympic\u000a      legacy arrangements put in place by the Department and local\/London\u000a      stakeholders. LERI's 2009 background thinkpiece report, \"London's Olympic\u000a      Legacy\" [7] was produced as part of this process.\u000a    That report for the OECD and Department for Communities and Local\u000a      Government [7] recommended that the Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC)\u000a      broadened its remit to include the delivery of socio-economic benefits by\u000a      working closely with local authorities and city-wide government, and that\u000a      it be given long term assurances about its future funding. This informed\u000a      policy recommendations subsequently made in the London Assembly 2010\u000a      document `Legacy Limited: a review of the Olympic Park Legacy Company\u000a      Role' [d]. Its influence is evident, for example, in the inclusion\u000a      in that policy document of key risks and challenges faced by the OPLC in\u000a      the run-up to and aftermath of the 2012 Games (pp.10-12). This draws\u000a      particularly on the risk analysis in [7, esp. pp.88-89] in relation to the\u000a      attainment of the five Olympic legacy commitments. UEL work published in\u000a      [2] and [6] is explicitly referenced under recommendation 2 (pp. 27 and\u000a      28), which raises concerns about the relationship between local and\u000a      national government. `Legacy Limited' also refers to LERI's research on\u000a      Olympic cities: it includes, for example, comments made by Baroness Ford,\u000a      the Chair of the Olympic Park Legacy Company, referring to [5] in stating\u000a      that the Company would learn from the experience of previous residential\u000a      developments in east London (paragraph 5.3, p. 38).\u000a    The UEL report also helped to identify and share `best practice'\u000a      guidelines for OECD member\/non- member countries and specified areas for\u000a      improvement to ensure a strong legacy for East London. Poynter worked\u000a      closely with DCLG analysts and policymakers and was involved in high-level\u000a      discussions with DCLG senior officials, including the responsible Director\u000a      General, and the OECD LEED reviewers [e]. In combination with\u000a      other LERI's research [1-5], the report fed into the evidence base for the\u000a      department's approach to London 2012 legacy and its governance. Thus, for\u000a      example, it is referred to directly in the OECD peer review report [f],\u000a      and contributed to a positive response from OECD on London's preparations,\u000a      highlighting the huge range of potential local benefits of large-scale\u000a      regeneration activity. The recommendations made in the LERI Report (pp.\u000a      6-11) included establishing an economic framework or plan for the area to\u000a      encourage the development of business clusters, inward investment and long\u000a      term job creation and recommended an enhanced role for city-wide\u000a      government to assume leadership in collaboration with local authorities\u000a      and the (then) Legacy Company in creating such a plan. These\u000a      recommendations were reflected in the OECD publication `Local Development\u000a      Benefits from Staging Global Events' and acknowledged by the OECD authors\u000a      (p.18).\u000a    Government officials and the relevant Minister commented on the OECD\u000a      report via a press release (18 October 2010) that referred explicitly to\u000a      specific recommendations made [7]. Local Government Minister Bob Neill\u000a      (Department for Communities and Local Government) commented:\u000a    \" It's clear that the OECD share the Government's view that\u000a        communities know best how to meet their area's needs and ambitions.\u000a        We've already begun to put control of Legacy decisions back into local\u000a        authorities' and the Mayor of London's hands...\" [g].\u000a    Subsequently, MacRury and Brimicombe were invited to become members of\u000a      the academic panel for the consortium led by Grant Thornton that undertook\u000a      the UK Government Department for Culture Media and Sport\u000a      meta-evaluation work (London 2012).

Research undertaken within LERI since\u000a      1993 has drawn on UEL's regional context within the changing landscape of\u000a      East London to investigate the cultural, social and economic dimensions of\u000a      contemporary urbanism. LERI's work has focused particularly on the\u000a      delivery and implications of large-scale regeneration projects, and\u000a      recently on the impacts of the financial crisis (beginning in 2007-8). Its\u000a      staff have analysed major public interventions in urban regeneration and,\u000a      in particular, in the Thames Gateway Development Zone [1].\u000a    Since the announcement of the award of the Olympics to East London in\u000a      July 2005, work within LERI by Poynter, MacRury (UEL to 2012), Rustin and\u000a      Brimicombe has especially stimulated and supported contemporary debate\u000a      about and conceptual understanding of urban regeneration in the context of\u000a      potential legacies of the 2012 games and similar \"mega-events\". UEL\u000a      responded rapidly to that announcement with a new strand of\u000a      interdisciplinary work allowing it to take the lead in critical analysis\u000a      of the potential legacies of the forthcoming \"Mega-event\" through their\u000a      consideration in a number of thought pieces such as Poynter's 2006 working\u000a      paper \"From Bejing to Bow Bells: Measuring the Olympics Effect\". Although\u000a      they happen within short-term frameworks, mega-events have long-term\u000a      implications for the urban spaces they remake. They are `temporal hubs'\u000a      that initiate complex processes of social change. LERI research has\u000a      elucidated these processes by adopting and developing narratives of\u000a      commodity and gift [3, 4]; re-conceptualizing the forms of institutional\u000a      innovation required to deliver social transformation [2]; re-thinking the\u000a      potential provided by public investment in urban infrastructure to include\u000a      not only its creation but also the policy mechanisms required to enhance\u000a      its more equitable social distribution [1, 5, 6]; and grounded these\u000a      contributions to sociological enquiry by basing them on the close scrutiny\u000a      of socio- economic, cultural and environmental data [5, 6].\u000a    Along with LERI's long-standing reputation for expertise in urban\u000a      regeneration in the `Thames Gateway' [1], this post-announcement research\u000a      provided the academic credibility catalyzing a commission in 2006\/7 by the\u000a      (local government) London Assembly for UEL to produce an interdisciplinary\u000a      research report reviewing the Olympic legacy for four previous Olympic\u000a      cities, and reporting on key legacy indicators [2]. That report made\u000a      policy recommendations based on the evaluation of London's five legacy\u000a      commitments (published in January 2008) to: increase opportunities for\u000a      Londoners to become involved in sport; ensure Londoners benefit from new\u000a      jobs, business and volunteering opportunities; transform the heart of East\u000a      London; deliver a sustainable Games and develop sustainable communities;\u000a      and showcase London as a diverse, inclusive, creative and welcoming city.\u000a      It concluded that a mega event's success lies in its capacity achieve a\u000a      `legacy momentum' via its use to initiate further, publicly-supported\u000a      programmes of renewal and regeneration. These and related findings were\u000a      reported in, journal articles [e.g. 3,4] and a major book [5] edited by\u000a      Poynter and MacRury with notable contributions from Poynter, MacRury and\u000a      Rustin.\u000a    In April 2008 the ESRC was formally contracted by the London Organising\u000a      Committee for the Olympic Games (LOCOG) as the London 2012 Games Impact\u000a      Study Research Partner. Following a competitive tender process by the\u000a      ESRC, UEL was commissioned by the ESRC to undertake the 2012 Games Impact\u000a      Study [6]; the contract for a pre-Games Report was awarded to UEL and\u000a      TGIfS in July 2009 and work commenced on that project in November 2009\u000a      [5]. The two phases of this longitudinal study reported data on 11\u000a      environmental, 23 socio-cultural and 22 economic indicators, focusing on\u000a      indicators of impact and providing evidence of underlying trends. These\u000a      studies, which were the first set up to evaluate the impacts of a summer\u000a      Olympic and Paralympic Games, provided:\u000a    (i) new theoretical approaches to understanding mega events, especially\u000a      the concept of `legacy' and its implications for local communities, social\u000a      equality and urban development;\u000a    (ii) new insights into the exploration of cross-country, comparative\u000a      research on the `legacies' achieved by Olympic host cities;\u000a    (ii) evaluations and analysis designed to inform the process of review\u000a      and development of public policy-making in domestic and international\u000a      contexts; and\u000a    (iv) analysis and assessment of the economic models informing\u000a      contemporary urban development and the social implications of public\u000a      investments and interventions in regions with high concentrations of\u000a      social disadvantage.\u000a    This work fed into LERI's production in 2009 of a think piece report\u000a      commissioned by the London Assembly to guide its investigation into the\u000a      future role of the Olympic Park Legacy Company (OPLC) [7]. Since 2009,\u000a      research within LERI into mega event cities more widely, in an attempt to\u000a      contribute to better defining and explaining `legacy' as a social and\u000a      cultural ambition complementing economic benefits in the city and beyond.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41259","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1668284","Name":"Taiwan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    There are more than 1.5 million over-85s currently in the UK; by 2030\u000a      there will be more than 3 million and by 2050 over 5 million, a dramatic\u000a      change in UK demography. The recently published House of Lords Select\u000a      Committee Report on Public Services and Demographic Change `Ready for\u000a        Ageing? suggests this could induce a \"series of crises\" in the\u000a      public service provision of health and social care, pensions and housing,\u000a      but notes that there is growing evidence that with better planning, by\u000a      both the state and individuals, some of the economic and social burden of\u000a      state care can be reduced. The main impact of the research described here\u000a      has been to identify impediments that prevent older people from\u000a      maintaining their capacity for independent living in their own homes, to\u000a      identify effective mechanisms for overcoming these, and to indicate how\u000a      these might be built into long term care and policies in the UK and\u000a      abroad.\u000a    In the UK, this research first informed the 1999 Royal Commission on\u000a      Long-Term Care (see Alternative Models of Care for Older People). This led\u000a      to Tinker's longstanding advisory roles with the then Department of\u000a      Communities and Local Government, the Department of Health and key\u000a      national consultative bodies including the Housing Corporation, the\u000a      National Housing Federation, the Audit Commission and Elderly\u000a      Accommodation Counsel. At the end of each research project, Tinker and\u000a      associated stakeholders were invited by government to discuss the\u000a      implementation of their findings and recommendations. The findings on\u000a      extra care housing contributed to the creation of guidelines for such\u000a      schemes and a greater understanding of the implications of their adoption\u000a      for older residents. This research demonstrated that extra care housing\u000a      schemes provided a better quality of life for older residents than\u000a      conventional sheltered housing or residential care homes. The findings\u000a      from the remodelling research informed the creation of a set of\u000a      recommendations and guidelines for implementation targeted at those\u000a      responsible for the development of such schemes: central and local\u000a      governments, housing associations and other service providers and funders,\u000a      and occupational and rehabilitation engineers. These were discussed at a\u000a      presentation in 2002 at the House of Commons. This fed directly into the\u000a      policy making process on revision of housing for the older community\u000a      through their dissemination to over 2000 stakeholders in the UK such as\u000a      local authorities and housing associations with copies distributed to some\u000a      300 other key advisory bodies such as the Audit Commission. In 2008 a\u000a      national conference sponsored by the Department of Health was held to\u000a      promote the findings of the later research.\u000a    These findings informed the Government's 2008 National Strategy for\u000a      Housing in an Ageing Society (1) and informed the Ministerial Group's\u000a      thinking on sheltered housing and the House of Lords Select Committee on\u000a      Ageing. Further guidelines on extra care housing were subsequently\u000a      published by the Department of Health's Housing Learning and Improvement\u000a      Network in 2008 (2) and then sent to all local government authorities,\u000a      many of which including Gateshead, Swindon and the London borough of\u000a      Kensington and Chelsea have since adopted these, directly changing their\u000a      housing policies as a consequence. In addition, many other charities such\u000a      as the Almshouses Association have also adopted these guidelines in\u000a      revising their approaches to the provision of sheltered housing. The\u000a      findings were disseminated in the UK at the 2009 Laing and Buisson Extra\u000a      Care Annual Conference; 2009 Joseph Rowntree Foundation Consultation on\u000a      Extra Care Housing; 2008 Health Investor Conference; 2008 Department of\u000a      Health Care Services Improvement Partnership, and through the 2006 Age\u000a      Concern England Advice, Information and Mediation Services. In 2010, Prof\u000a      Tinker presented her research to the Academy of the Social Sciences\u000a      Seminar on the Impact of the Social Sciences on Ageing policy to MPs,\u000a      members of House of Lords and policy makers (3). In March 2013 her\u000a      research findings on extra care housing were directly cited in the\u000a      Government's most recent report on housing for older persons: The House of\u000a      Lords Select Committee on Public Services and Demographic Change `Ready\u000a        for Ageing? Report.(4)\u000a    The impact of this work was also felt abroad. For example, some countries\u000a      such as Canada, the USA and Australia were experiencing similar problems\u000a      with their unsuitable sheltered housing and care homes and sought advice\u000a      from Tinker and her research collaborators. Her recommendations on\u000a      alternatives to institutional care &#8212; particularly the role of assistive\u000a      technologies &#8212; have been presented in numerous international plenary\u000a      presentations including since 2007 Australia and Taiwan (2007), Canada\u000a      (2008 and 2010), Spain (2010) the Netherlands (2012).The research relating\u000a      to housing and assistive technology informed the 2002 United Nations\u000a      Valencia Forum on Ageing (for the report on housing including technology)\u000a      which led to the UN 2002 Madrid Plan on Ageing (5), and OECD research on\u000a      provision of long term housing and care in 2005 (6). Moreover, Tinker\u000a      accompanied the Minister to advise Singapore on their strategy on long\u000a      term care in 2001; and in Hong Kong (1999, 2001) and later was personally\u000a      invited to give advice to the government of South Korea in 2006 (7) and\u000a      Japan on extra care housing. In June 2013 she was invited to give further\u000a      policy advice on long term care, on overcoming social isolation, and on\u000a      the use of assistive technologies in the home to the Centre for Housing,\u000a      Regional Planning at the University of Adelaide, and to the Ministerial\u000a      Advisory Group on Ageing, the Commissioner for Equal Opportunity and the\u000a      Executive Director of Health for the Government of South Australia.\u000a    This programme of research has directly changed the culture of policy\u000a      towards older people by providing creative and effective solutions and\u000a      alternatives to long term institutional care by actively promoting\u000a      technologies and adaptations that will allow large sections of the older\u000a      population to maintain their independence in later life. Key institutions\u000a      of government such as the Houses of Commons and Lords, local authorities,\u000a      housing associations and leading economists (8) in the UK have drawn upon\u000a      the research in significantly revising their policies on the provision of\u000a      housing in later life whilst the reach of the impact of this research\u000a      resonates internationally with its adoption in Europe, Canada, the USA,\u000a      Australia and the Far East.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    A key challenge for UK Government is to identify how older generations\u000a      can continue to live independently in their own homes.

All have been undertaken collaboratively with key stakeholders:\u000a      government departments and public sector providers and conducted with\u000a      multidisciplinary teams comprising social scientists, architects,\u000a      engineers, economists and occupational therapists.\u000a    Identifying the perceived benefits and burdens (including financial)\u000a        of owner-occupation in later life: This study found that\u000a      owner-occupation enhanced feelings of control but that these were counter\u000a      balanced by concerns over the cost and servicing of repairs. Such findings\u000a      highlighted the importance of providing affordable maintenance, preventive\u000a      and other services to help older people remain in their own homes. Results\u000a      also revealed that older people have considerable equity in their homes\u000a      but remained sceptical about schemes to generate income from this (see 1).\u000a    Research funded by the Royal Commission on Long Term Care:\u000a      Assessed a range of staying at home options including a comparative\u000a      analysis of economic and social costs of alternative models of care (2).\u000a    A study of `difficult to let' sheltered housing: This national\u000a      survey elucidated the complex reasons why sheltered housing, although\u000a      popular with government, has been unable to meet the needs of frail older\u000a      people. It highlighted the unsuitability of many schemes and showed\u000a      creative ways of overcoming the problems (1).\u000a    The feasibility, costs, and acceptability of assistive technology to\u000a        enable older people to stay in their own home: Using case studies\u000a      based on nationally representative criteria, research examined the\u000a      feasibility of introducing Assistive Technology into older people's\u000a      existing homes and challenged widespread assumptions concerning the ease\u000a      of having technology installed (3).\u000a    Adapting sheltered housing to provide extra care housing: This\u000a      study examined the feasibility of remodelling sheltered housing and\u000a      residential care homes to provide \"extra care housing and facilities\" insitu.\u000a      Architects, builders, surveyors and professional clients were asked to\u000a      evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of such schemes; support and care\u000a      staff provided information on how well they worked in practice; and the\u000a      older tenants themselves described their experiences of living in such\u000a      housing. The accessibility and availability of assistive technologies was\u000a      examined and an economist assessed the costs of conversion (4).\u000a    Revolutionising long term care: A study was carried out for the\u000a      Technology Strategy Board which examined alternatives to institutional\u000a      care in the UK and Europe and included examples of effective extra care\u000a      housing and a case study of the Netherlands.

The\u000a      model demands a minimum common requirement of pre-market review of all new\u000a      commercial genetic tests in order to ensure truth-in-labelling and\u000a      truth-in-promotion and greater disclosure of clinical data on test\u000a      performance. Hogarth and colleagues describe this approach as \"regulation\u000a      by information disclosure\". It requires that:\u000a    1. Test manufacturers should provide patients and healthcare providers\u000a      with evaluative data on the analytic and clinical validity of tests; and\u000a    2. That independent pre-market review should be used to evaluate whether\u000a      this information is an accurate account of a test's strengths and\u000a      weaknesses.\u000a    The team identified broad support for the view that data on analytic and\u000a      clinical validity of tests should be a minimal requirement for market\u000a      approval, but that data on clinical utility could be gathered post-market\u000a      and assessed through health technology assessment mechanisms. They have\u000a      promoted this regulatory model in Europe and North America since 2007\u000a      through invited presentations to policymakers, regulatory agencies,\u000a      industry and clinicians; public consultations; informal interactions with\u000a      policymakers and regulators, and through membership of (and consultancy\u000a      for) government advisory groups. The research was fed into regulatory and\u000a      policymaking bodies in specific ways in each jurisdiction as outlined\u000a      below:\u000a    European Union: At EU level efforts have focused on reform of the\u000a      IVD Directive, which constitutes the basis for statutory regulation of in\u000a      vitro diagnostic tests as medical devices within the EU (and EFTA). In\u000a      2007 Hogarth was invited by European Commission (EC) officials responsible\u000a      for the Directive to present his team's ideas for regulatory reform to the\u000a      annual meeting of representative member states' Competent Authorities. A\u000a      written briefing was prepared that summarised the research, outlined the\u000a      main weaknesses of the existing IVD Directive and made a series of\u000a      proposals for reform. The briefing was welcomed by leading member states\u000a      for providing a cogent and comprehensive analysis. In a press release\u000a      issued after the meeting the Competent Authorities highlighted this\u000a      `identified need' to monitor whether device regulations were keeping pace\u000a      with technological developments, using it to justify a \"critical review\"\u000a      of legislation on genetic testing. The issues Hogarth and colleagues\u000a      highlighted were also raised in the European Commission's 2010 public\u000a      consultation on reform of the IVD Directive. The Commission published a\u000a      summary of responses to the consultation which demonstrated broad support\u000a      for the changes they had specifically advocated, thus providing\u000a      independent confirmation that their in-depth engagement with stakeholders\u000a      had successfully identified a pragmatic remedy to a very contentious issue\u000a      that was acceptable to many different interest groups.\u000a    Subsequent to the consultation Hogarth's EuroGentest team organised an\u000a      international workshop in 2011 which brought together regulatory\u000a      officials, policymakers, industry and other stakeholders from Europe, USA\u000a      and Australia to discuss regulatory reform in the regulation of IVDs and\u000a      its likely impact on genetic testing. This meeting was attended by EC\u000a      officials with primary responsibility for the drafting of the proposed new\u000a      EU regulation on IVD devices. This dialogue had direct impact on various\u000a      aspects of the new draft EU regulation on IVD devices published by the\u000a      Commission in September 2012. In 2013 EuroGentest were invited to present\u000a      at a workshop convened by the MEP who is the Rapporteur for the IVD\u000a      Regulation. A written response to the draft Regulation which welcomed the\u000a      proposed changes but also made specific suggestions on how the proposal\u000a      might be strengthened was prepared for that meeting. Dialogue with EC\u000a      officials, MEPs, representatives of member states and other stakeholders\u000a      continues and the team expect to be directly involved in providing\u000a      detailed advice on textual changes to the final Bill.\u000a    UK: The main impact of this research on UK governance is evidenced\u000a      through engagements with the Human Genetics Commission supporting their\u000a      work on the regulation of consumer genetics. Hogarth was first invited to\u000a      provide a briefing for the Genetic Services subgroup of the HGC which\u000a      summarised developments in the regulation of commercial genetic testing\u000a      services in the UK. He then provided an overview of regulatory\u000a      developments in the USA to a plenary meeting of the HGC and later helped\u000a      the HGC to organise an international stakeholder workshop to review\u000a      developments since their 2003 report Genes Direct. His input included\u000a      development of the agenda and list of participants, giving presentations\u000a      at the meeting and work in drafting the influential meeting report More\u000a      Genes Direct. He played the same role in a further international meeting\u000a      convened in 2008 to explore whether there was support for development for\u000a      an industry code of practice. Having identified widespread support for\u000a      this in 2009 the HGC formed a small working group to develop guiding\u000a      principles for such a code, of which Hogarth was a key member.\u000a      Additionally he provided oral and written evidence to the House of Lords\u000a      enquiry on genomic medicine in 2008 (below).The ensuing report included a\u000a      recommendation for revision of the IVD Directive to ensure premarket\u000a      evaluation of genomic diagnostics &#8212; his key proposal to the enquiry. The\u000a      adoption of his regulatory model is clear evidence of impact in\u000a      influencing the direction of regulatory and policy reform. Hogarth\u000a      continues this work as a member of the Emerging Science and Bioethics\u000a      Advisory Committee, the successor to the Human Genetics Commission, which\u000a      is the main UK advisory body on emerging healthcare scientific\u000a      developments and their ethical, legal, social and economic implications.\u000a      He is also a member of the external strategy group advising the UK's MHRA\u000a      on its negotiating position on the European Commission's proposal for a\u000a      new regulation on IVDs (see above).\u000a    North America USA: Since the commencement of his research Hogarth\u000a      and his team have enjoyed excellent access to senior FDA officials\u000a      responsible for IVD regulation. They ran two policy workshops in\u000a      Washington DC which enjoyed strong FDA support (both were attended by the\u000a      Director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics) and led to their being\u000a      given a \"Leveraging and Collaboration\" award by the agency. They have\u000a      remained in regular dialogue with senior FDA officials and have sought to\u000a      involve them in a more international dialogue about policy in this area.\u000a    At their suggestion an FDA official attended the HGC workshop and the\u000a      Director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics (OIVD) and OIVD's Director\u000a      for Personalised Medicine both attended the team's 2011 workshop in\u000a      Leuven. In 2011 Hogarth was invited to give a presentation at the FDA's\u000a      advisory committee meeting on the regulation of direct-to-consumer\u000a      genetics, providing an overview of global developments in regulation in\u000a      this area. Canada: Hogarth and his collaborators produced two reports for\u000a      Health Canada one on the emerging regulatory frameworks for\u000a      pharmacogenomics and one on the policy implications of high-throughput\u000a      genomic platforms.\u000a    Dissemination of the impact: public engagement. Hogarth is now\u000a      considered a leading expert in the national and international regulation\u000a      of genetic testing and is regularly asked to appear in the national and\u000a      trade media to discuss issues relating to regulation and reform. Broadcast\u000a      media appearances include BBC Newsnight, Channel 4 news, the BBC Politics\u000a      Show, and Sky News. He has also written commentaries on this topic for The\u000a      Guardian's Science blog and in 2009 appeared on Radio 4's Analysis\u000a      programme on consumer genetics. To coincide with this broadcast he\u000a      organised a public event at the Dana Centre on the politics of genetic\u000a      testing.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Hogarth and external collaborators at Cambridge have developed a\u000a      regulatory model for the governance of commercial genetic testing in the\u000a      EU that requires pre-market review of all new commercial genetic tests and\u000a      greater public disclosure of clinical data about test performance. Drawing\u000a      on this model they recommended a number of changes to the current European\u000a      regulations. In 2012 the European Commission published a proposal for a\u000a      new regulation on In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) medical devices that incorporated\u000a        most of the changes which they recommended be addressed in the revision\u000a        of this regulation.

They have also resulted in the development of in vitro\u000a      diagnostic tests that can help identify genetic predisposition to disease\u000a      and tailor medical treatment to individual genetic profiles. The promise\u000a      of personalised medicine will not be realised, however, if tests are not\u000a      adequately regulated, as failure to validate the accuracy, reliability,\u000a      and clinical implications of a test may result in patient harm from\u000a      misdiagnosis, failure to treat, delay in treatment, inappropriate\u000a      treatment, or avoidable adverse events. Direct To Consumer (DTC) genetic\u000a      testing or consumer genetics presents particular challenges in terms of\u000a      its ability to circumvent existing regulatory protocols. Hogarth has been\u000a      leading global research into the analysis and reformation of regulatory\u000a      regimes for genetic testing since 2004 when he began a 3.5 year project to\u000a      perform a comparative mapping of existing regulatory frameworks for\u000a      genetic testing in Europe and North America that identified key regulatory\u000a      concerns and options for reform (with Prof. Melzer ,University of\u000a      Cambridge). Two allied consultancies were carried out for the Canadian\u000a      government and a commissioned briefing was provided for the Genetic\u000a      Services subgroup of the UK Human Genetics Commission (HGC).\u000a    Since joining KCL in 2009, Hogarth has further extended this programme of\u000a      research on the regulation of genetic testing through development of a\u000a      multivariate methodology that has involved comprehensive reviews of\u000a      literature, regulatory guidance documents, scientific papers, policy\u000a      reports, commercial industry surveys and news publications; qualitative\u000a      interviews with senior regulatory and policy advisors; and five policy\u000a      workshops with stakeholders (clinicians, scientists, industry executives,\u000a      policymakers and regulatory officials) in Europe and North America. This\u000a      has produced a number of highly cited, state of the art publications (see\u000a      below). In addition, Hogarth has hosted key international workshops in\u000a      2011 involving industry, regulators, clinicians, NGOs and scientists that\u000a      have directly informed policy development in Europe, North America and\u000a      Japan. Since 2011 this work has been funded through two research projects:\u000a      EuroGentest, an FP7 network (&#163;40K, 2011-2014, KU Leuven and UC Dublin key\u000a      collaborators); and an ESRC-funded project on the governance of biomedical\u000a      innovation (&#163;600K, 2012-2015).\u000a    Cumulatively this research programme has produced the first detailed\u000a      analysis of the international landscape of genetic testing governance,\u000a      comprised of a mosaic of statutory regulation, health technology\u000a      assessment policy and clinical practice guidelines implemented with\u000a      varying degrees of commensurability in the USA, EU, Canada, and Australia.\u000a      Drawing on this analysis, this research has produced a set of policy\u000a      proposals for reformation of governance of genetic testing and a\u000a      regulatory model to meet that end, since implemented, as set out below.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41261","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Research Councils UK","Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    Members of FRRIL have been responsible for developing the first detailed\u000d      workable frameworks for translating the broad principles of RRI into\u000d      practice by developing models for three key emerging biotechnologies:\u000d      novel neurotechnologies, synthetic biology and cognitive enhancement, each\u000d      of which are being taken up nationally and internationally in major\u000d      programmes or technology development and governance.\u000d    Novel Neurotechnologies: Engagement with Rose's earlier research on the\u000d      social implications of developments in the life sciences, biomedicine and\u000d      neuroscience led to his appointment as a member of the Nuffield Council on\u000d      Bioethics and his involvement as an internal reviewer of their Report on\u000d      Emerging Biotechnologies in 2012. This, in turn, prompted the Council to\u000d      initiate a report on the social and ethical implications of Novel\u000d      Neurotechnologies. Rose was asked to steward production of this report\u000d      which was published in June 2013. Rose researched and wrote the chapter on\u000d      Economic Drivers of Innovation, and Rose and Singh (as invited expert)\u000d      together developed an innovative applied framework for RRI in\u000d      neurotechnology to guide those funding and undertaking such research.\u000d      Singh also devised a detailed ethical framework for evaluating the impacts\u000d      of novel neurotechnologies. The framework stresses the virtues of\u000d      inventiveness, humility and responsibility, and proposes six elements as\u000d      regulatory priorities for the RRI of novel neurotechnologies: Securing\u000d      safety and efficacy; Generating robust evidence; Continuous reflexive\u000d      evaluation; Coordinated interdisciplinary action; Effective and\u000d      proportionate oversight; demonstrating how RRI can be operationalized in\u000d      practice in this important emerging field of scientific development.\u000d      Impact is at an early stage; however exemplars from earlier reports of the\u000d      NCOB suggest that the framework will act as a key benchmark for future\u000d      regulation of novel neurotechnologies, both in the UK and in Europe. In\u000d      related work, Rose has been charged with responsibility for refining and\u000d      applying the RRI models developed in FRRIL to governance of the Human\u000d      Brain Project. Funded by the EU up to a level of 1 Billion Euros for ten\u000d      years from October 2013 the HBP is addressing one of the greatest\u000d      challenges of modern science: how to find rigorous ways to address the\u000d      complexity of human brain function and neurological disease and mental\u000d      disorder. As a key member of the Steering Committee of the Social and\u000d      Ethical division of the HBP and leader of its Foresight Lab, Rose draws on\u000d      FRRIL's research and models to develop, implement and evaluate mechanisms\u000d      for fulfilling obligations to RRI in practice, providing one of the first\u000d      demonstrations of how this goal can be achieved in projects of this size.\u000d      Synthetic Biology: Rose and Marris' research in developing and\u000d      implementing RRI in synthetic biology, carried out in the context of the\u000d      EPSRC funded `Flowers consortium' (King's, Imperial, Newcastle, Cambridge\u000d      and Durham) led to their appointment to the Working Group developing the\u000d      `UK Roadmap for Synthetic Biology'\u000d      (http:\/\/www.rcuk.ac.uk\/documents\/publications\/SyntheticBiologyRoadmap.pdf).\u000a      The RRI approach which they proposed was one of the \"Key Themes\" of the\u000d      Roadmap: \"It is crucial that this technology continues to be developed in\u000d      a socially responsible fashion, and that relevant stakeholders, regulators\u000d      and the public are engaged in research and innovation processes from the\u000d      outset. Responsible research and innovation encompasses, but is not\u000d      confined to, operating within an effective risk regulatory framework. The\u000d      UK needs to be, and to be seen to be, leading the way in frameworks and\u000d      methodologies for responsible innovation.\" The Roadmap led to the decision\u000d      of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) to nominate\u000d      synthetic biology as a key emerging technology for investment in the 2012\u000d      Autumn Statement. This led to further funding from TSB, and a major\u000d      funding initiative by the EPSRC and BBSRC for multidisciplinary research\u000d      centres in synthetic biology to \"implement the Roadmap's recommendations\u000d      and deliver on the investment from government ...as part of a larger\u000d      `Synthetic Biology for Growth Programme'...accelerating the route to\u000d      market for innovative synthetic biology research\". It is intended that all\u000d      UK funding in this area will, in future, be contingent upon recipients'\u000d      demonstration of commitment to RRI. FRRIL is centrally embedded in UK's\u000d      major consortia of universities funded to develop synthetic biology\u000d      technologies in domains from health and medicine to green biofuels, who\u000d      have undertaken to develop their next phases of R &amp; D in accordance\u000d      with these principles of RRI. The EPSRC explicitly cite the RRI chapter of\u000d      the synthetic Biology Roadmap as a source for their \"Responsible\u000d      Innovation Framework\", published in October 2013.\u000d    http:\/\/www.epsrc.ac.uk\/research\/framework\/Pages\/acknowledgementsandresources.aspx\u000d      Cognitive Enhancement: Singh's research on cognitive enhancement led to\u000d      her invitation, in 2012, to join Professor David Nutt's Independent\u000d      Scientific Committee on Drugs (ISCD) which is committed to generating\u000d      evidence-based policy-making on drug use. Working with the ISCD, Singh\u000d      developed the first national UK survey to evaluate the use of cognitive\u000d      enhancers amongst university students. This research revealed that,\u000d      contrary to speculation, use of cognitive enhancers amongst this group was\u000d      actually low, strengthening the argument that responsible regulation must\u000d      be evidence based. Preliminary results from the survey were discussed by\u000d      Professor Nutt and Dr Nora Volkow (Director of the US National Institute\u000d      of Drug Addiction &#8212; NIDA) in a podcast chaired by Dr Steven Hyman, former\u000d      Director of the National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH); the interview\u000d      was subsequently published in Neuropsychopharmacology. Singh was also\u000d      invited to present her findings at a rare UK Joint Academies meeting on\u000d      responsible research and innovation in neuroenhancement (to which Rose\u000d      also contributed). Emerging out of Singh's earlier work with ISCD, which\u000d      demonstrated the need to employ empirical evidence as the basis of\u000d      responsible policy-making on cognitive enhancement, she has recently\u000d      secured &#8364;3.8 million of FP7 funding (from March 2013) to develop NERRI\u000d      (`Neuroenhancement, Responsible Research and Innovation'), which mobilises\u000d      stakeholder engagement around Europe to ensure that current and novel\u000d      neurotechnologies are developed in the context of RRI values and\u000d      objectives. The Italian Bioethics Commission (CNB) has recently developed\u000d      recommendations on cognitive enhancement based on the framework developed\u000d      by Ragan, Bard and Singh, as evidenced through CNB's extensive citation of\u000d      that work. Whilst the opinions of the CNB are not legally binding they\u000d      report directly to the Italian government and, according to specialists:\u000d      \"for all intents and purposes their opinion documents frame the issue\".\u000d      Singh is also mobilizing FRRIL objectives in talks on cognitive\u000d      enhancement to international audiences of lay and professional adult\u000d      stakeholders and to school children; for example as part of the European\u000d      Science Open Forum (ESOF) in 2014. Her earlier methodology for evidencing\u000d      use of cognitive enhancers is now also informing the development of\u000d      national surveys on cognitive enhancement in Australia (Hall, University\u000d      of Queensland) in Montreal (Collins, University of Montreal) and by the\u000d      Wellcome Trust's UK Monitor. These frameworks together provide much needed\u000d      models through which to address the major funding bodies' new requirements\u000d      to make RRI an integral part of technology development and governance and\u000d      important exemplars of best practice models.\u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    In the face of perceived public concerns about technological innovations,\u000d      leading national and international bodies increasingly recognize the need\u000d      for dialogue between policy makers, scientific researchers and social\u000d      actors in order to develop the technologies to address the grand\u000d      challenges facing our societies in a way that meets social needs and gains\u000d      public trust. The Directorate-General for Research and Innovation of the\u000d      EU, the UK Government and many funding bodies are addressing this issue by\u000d      insisting on Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) in the development\u000d      of emerging technologies, yet the mechanisms for implementing RRI remain\u000d      largely unspecified. Researchers in SSHM (Rose, Singh, Marris and\u000d      colleagues) have established a Foresight and Responsible Research and\u000d      Innovation Laboratory (FRRIL) that has devised and implemented the first\u000d      detailed frameworks for applying the principles of RRI in the regulation\u000d      of synthetic biology, novel neurotechnologies and cognitive enhancement;\u000d      providing important, replicable models for translating the principles of\u000d      RRI into policy and practice in emerging biotechnologies.\u000d    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"King's College London","InstitutionName":"King's College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10003645}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"6077243","Name":"Montréal"}],"References":"\u000d    Where a DOI or URL is not given, a hard copy is available on request.\u000d    \u000aRose, N, (2012) Democracy in the contemporary life sciences, BioSocieties\u000d      7 (4), 459-472.

UNESCO and FP7 now require Responsible Research and\u000d      Innovation to be demonstrated in applications for technology research and\u000d      development and are calling for comprehensive RRI frameworks to be\u000d      developed for use in future initiatives such as Horizon 2020. Major\u000d      European and UK funding bodies (FP7, EPSRC, BBSRC,TSB) are also insisting\u000d      that researchers embody RRI in the design of their translation pathways to\u000d      ensure that they are ethically acceptable, sustainable and focused on\u000d      delivering societal benefits. Research by the FRRIL group has demonstrated\u000d      weaknesses in previous models to ensure social responsibility, and\u000d      proposed novel ways in which these RRI principles can be translated into\u000d      governance of emerging technologies and into scientific practice itself.\u000d      Rose has researched the democratic accountability of emerging technologies\u000d      (Rose, 2012), and Rose and Marris published and edited a series of\u000d      articles on public engagement and responsible research in the life\u000d      sciences for PLoS Biology (Marris and Rose, 2012), further developed in a\u000d      key report by Marris and Jefferson on RRI for the regulation of deliberate\u000d      release of synthetic organisms (Marris and Jefferson, 2013). Rose and\u000d      Marris were invited to participate in the first major EPSRC funded\u000d      research programme on synthetic biology, enabling further research into\u000d      the practical development of the RRI approach in a very early stage\u000d      biotechnology which makes major claims about public and social benefit\u000d      (Rose, 2012; Marris and Rose, 2012).\u000d    Rose's most recent research on the social implications of developments in\u000d      the brain sciences (previously published in a number of highly cited\u000d      articles on neuroscience) culminated in Neuro: The New Brain Sciences and\u000d      the Management of the Mind (2013) which provides underpinnings for a new\u000d      mode of critical friendship between social scientists and life scientists\u000d      to facilitate the responsible translation process between laboratory\u000d      research, clinical practice and policy in the real world. Singh took a\u000d      different but complementary trajectory based on empirical research on\u000d      ethical dilemmas on the use of `cognitive enhancement drugs' which\u000d      generated a pathbreaking model for linking technology development with\u000d      everyday ethical experience based on empirical research into practical\u000d      ethics in clinical settings. She has developed this sociological\u000d      alternative to `speculative ethics' in a number of research papers (Ragan,\u000d      Bard &amp; Singh, 2011; Singh et. al forthcoming).This underpinning\u000d      research by members of FRRIL demonstrated a clear need to develop workable\u000d      frameworks for translating the principles of RRI (particularly\u000d      collaborative evidence based policy making) into practice to meet domestic\u000d      and international commitments to deliver social and ethical responsibility\u000d      in biomedical research and innovation.\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42665","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Back's research for the EUMARGINS project has been presented on a number\u000d\u000a      of occasions to high-level policy-making audiences.

The enquiry into the provision for migrants at\u000d\u000a      what was the IND Croydon, led directly to a large-scale (&#163;800,000)\u000d\u000a      improvement of facilities at Lunar House. The research was presented to\u000d\u000a      Lin Homer (Director General of IND) and Tony Smith, UK Border Agency\u000d\u000a      Regional Director and was considered at Ministerial level. On 21 December\u000d\u000a      2009 a plaque was unveiled to Mary Apragas at the opening of the new\u000d\u000a      `Welcome Centre.' It was her story that sparked the enquiry and she sadly\u000d\u000a      died in 2004. Welcome Centre now provides heating, seating, a reception,\u000d\u000a      clear signage, and shelter where once users had to queue outdoors in all\u000d\u000a      weather conditions.[16]\u000d\u000a    As a result of the enquiry, a special commission formed by the SLC in\u000d\u000a      2006 produced over 180 recommendations to safeguard asylum seekers. In\u000d\u000a      order to campaign for these recommendations, a group was formed, Citizens\u000d\u000a      for Sanctuary. So far the campaign has had a number success stories,\u000d\u000a      including persuading the government to end Child Detention for immigration\u000d\u000a      purposes.[17]\u000d\u000a    The Lunar House enquiry opened up space for discussion among users of the\u000d\u000a      service and immigration officers who testify to feeling trapped and\u000d\u000a      distressed by what they have to do. At one meeting held by Back and SLC,\u000d\u000a      an immigration officer stood up in the crowded room and apologized to the\u000d\u000a      users present for the misery caused to them at Lunar House. More\u000d\u000a      generally, Back has helped shape a public narrative in favour of migration\u000d\u000a      and diversity in Europe, through widely read publications, mainstream\u000d\u000a      radio, and public events. He has, for example, written an article\u000d\u000a      questioning the social costs of European border controls for Eurozine,\u000d\u000a      a netmagazine which has an international readership of around 200,000.[18]\u000d\u000a      Two of his articles were published by The Guardian, a national\u000d\u000a      newspaper with an international reach.[19]\u000d\u000a    Back was a guest on BBC Radio 1's `Sunday Surgery debate on Nationality'\u000d\u000a      phone-in show on 30 November 2008. In 2009, he participated in one of Tate\u000d\u000a      Britain's themed public symposia, giving a talk on how cities benefit from\u000d\u000a      cultural diversity.[20] In 2010, at a public symposium on the\u000d\u000a      subject of `Living in Diversity' held by Barcelona's Centre de Cultura\u000d\u000a      Contempor&#224;nia', Back's talk was attended by 125 people.[21] He\u000d\u000a      was also asked to join nine others to form the Concerned Citizens of\u000d\u000a      Europe and to co-author a manifesto published in Eurozine, and a version\u000d\u000a      in The Guardian.[22]\u000d\u000a    Back's most recent writings on the `Go Home' texts were covered in The\u000a        Guardian and Independent newspapers precipitating a wide\u000d\u000a      public debate including BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. The media and\u000d\u000a      public response culminated in a statement from Prime Minister David\u000d\u000a      Cameron and a call for an investigation by the Labour Party.[23]\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Les Back has produced a body of research that has documented and\u000d\u000a      intervened in the institutional marginalisation of migrants in Europe, the\u000d\u000a      de-humanising impacts of the UK immigration system and the new\u000d\u000a      technologies of border regulation. This work has stimulated and shaped\u000d\u000a      public understanding through journalism and direct engagements with\u000d\u000a      politicians, policy makers, practitioners and third sector organisations.\u000d\u000a      It has contributed to an accumulating public narrative in favour of a\u000d\u000a      humane national and EU migration policy. In particular, his research of\u000d\u000a      conditions at Lunar House, Croydon gathered evidence of the poor quality\u000d\u000a      of facilities and de-humanising practices and led to specific\u000d\u000a      recommendations for improvement.

Research\u000d\u000a      was co-ordinated by Katrine Fangen at the University of Oslo and Back led\u000d\u000a      the data analysis work package at Goldsmiths. Back and Sinha contributed\u000d\u000a      to two books based on the project's findings. Inclusion and Exclusion\u000d\u000a        of Young Adult Migrants in Europe (2010) set out the historical\u000d\u000a      context and the comparative framework for the research and Back and Sinha\u000d\u000a      co-authored a chapter on the UK.[2] The book, Young\u000d\u000a        Migrants (2011), focuses on the project findings; Back and Sinha co-authored\u000d\u000a\u0009\u0009a chapter and provided cases from the UK team's research for\u000d\u000a      other chapters.[3]\u000d\u000a    Back's co-authored research summary report `A door to the future?'\u000d\u000a      focuses on the policy recommendations emerging from the EUMARGINS project.[4]\u000d\u000a      A co-authored article focuses on the EUMARGINS UK case studies, as does\u000d\u000a      the forthcoming book Migrant City.[5] Back has also\u000d\u000a      presented the EUMARGINS research in six invited keynote addresses at\u000d\u000a      international conferences and a further six invited public lectures and\u000d\u000a      seminar presentations at Princeton, Trinity College, Dublin, London School\u000d\u000a      of Economics, Manchester, York and Oxford.[6]\u000d\u000a    The underpinning research emerges out of a long civic engagement with\u000d\u000a      organisations concerned with migrant rights. Along with the community\u000d\u000a      organisation South London Citizens (SLC), Back was a co-author of a report\u000d\u000a      investigating the workings of the front line office headquarters of the\u000d\u000a      British Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND), at Lunar House in\u000d\u000a      Croydon. Beginning in October 2004, Back and colleagues gathered evidence\u000d\u000a      from about 300 staff and users of Lunar House through surveys, written\u000d\u000a      submissions, and oral testimonies. Further evidence was received from\u000d\u000a      refugee community organisations, universities and other organisations.\u000d\u000a      Back subsequently discussed the findings of this inquiry in his acclaimed\u000d\u000a      book The Art of Listening (2007).[7]\u000d\u000a    The enquiry into conditions at Lunar House found a poor standard of\u000d\u000a      facilities, a lack of quality and fairness in transactions, failures in IT\u000d\u000a      and record keeping, and poor working conditions of staff. Published in\u000d\u000a      2005 as a report aimed at politicians, policy makers and the public and\u000d\u000a      made publicly accessible on the SLC website, it highlighted areas of\u000d\u000a      immediate concern and made 28 recommendations.[8] These\u000d\u000a      included: indoor queuing areas, a ticketing system for queuing (so that\u000d\u000a      people can leave the queue to use the toilet), making complaint forms\u000d\u000a      available, and informing applicants of their rights concerning\u000d\u000a      interpreters.\u000d\u000a    Drawing on the underpinning research, in October 2013 Back exposed the\u000d\u000a      damaging consequences of UKBA's use of `Go Home' texts for both young\u000d\u000a      migrants and UK citizens to whom they were wrongly sent. Back and Sinha\u000d\u000a      published an article exposing the negative consequences of this practice\u000d\u000a      and subsequently an article documenting further developments and responses\u000d\u000a      of the government on openDemocracy.net.[9] Through this\u000d\u000a      platform the article received international coverage, from China and Chile\u000d\u000a      to all over Europe. In these ways Back's research is ongoing and continues\u000d\u000a      to develop a case against the current system of regulating UK borders,\u000d\u000a      arguing that its stringency criminalises and marginalises many migrants,\u000d\u000a      and that at bottom it is racist and contains the residue of colonial\u000d\u000a      superiority.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42667","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":["Arts and Humanities Research Council","Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Impact beyond the academy was integral to this project from its\u000a      inception, as its very purpose was to open up public dialogue about\u000a      post-colonial narratives in institutionalised national remembrance. It\u000a      sought to move between the biography of individual soldiers who\u000a      participated in colonial armies and the wider enclosure of war memory in\u000a      nationalistic and militaristic terms. By inserting erased stories and\u000a      narratives into remembrance, it was intended to interrupt accepted forms\u000a      of war and memory with the noise of the past.\u000a    At a time when the discipline of sociology is looking for methods of\u000a      engagement with wider public audiences, Noise of the Past has set\u000a      an example for doing this that is new and innovative. In the first\u000a      instance, participants collaborated in the project through the novel\u000a      technique of call-and-response, working across the media of poetry,\u000a      historical documents, music and visual art, and between different\u000a      specialisms and different generations in multi-lingual registers. In the\u000a      second, through screenings and performances at numerous venues and events,\u000a      it incited and opened up a broader dialogue and imagination about war and\u000a      memory with numerous publics through sound, poetry, image and sensate\u000a      experience.\u000a    The premi&#232;re launch of `Unravelling' and `Post-colonial War Requiem' in\u000a      Coventry Cathedral, on 8 November 2008, was situated within the Coventry\u000a      Peace Festival.[12] The event was opened by war reporter Martin\u000a      Bell (OBE, UNICEF ambassador) and compered by the renowned historian\u000a      Carolyn Steedman. The audience of over 450 people was highly diverse and\u000a      included many people new to the Cathedral, including members of minority\u000a      groups, something which was commented on by the Cathedral organisation. A\u000a      long-standing member of the Cathedral, who had as a child sung in\u000a      Britten's War Requiem in the Cathedral, said:\u000a    \"I would just like to say how moving I found this evening [applause].\u000a        I have been here since the 1960's, for over forty years. I have sung\u000a        Britten's War Requiem at least twenty times. So I am extremely familiar\u000a        with that whole background and ethos and reconciliation work promoted by\u000a        the cathedral.\u000a     I think this is certainly the first time I have seen this interleaving\u000a        of the English Anglican tradition with the Indian traditions, from the\u000a        people who come to this city, been part of the colonial empire, fought\u000a        the war from an Indian background and then came to Coventry. I thought\u000a        that was tremendously moving, to see that interleaving of the history\u000a        and experience of different communities. I would just like to say that I\u000a        really do hope we can find ways to move that forward into the future.\"\u000a    The war historian Alessandro Portelli (Sapienza University, Rome) noted\u000a      the transformative and affective nature of the public production put\u000a      together by the Noise of the Past team:\u000a    \"It was very moving...I thought the encounter between the local people\u000a        [in the cathedral] was very promising for the future...The presence of\u000a        the Grandfather...was very moving. It was just perfect.\"\u000a    The audience constituted a cross-section of the population including\u000a      non-academics in influential positions in the cultural sector. The Senior\u000a      Programme Manager of London' Royal Opera House in London said:\u000a    \"The setting of course was fantastic...I am sure you have had a great\u000a        deal of very positive feedback from the many people who attended &#8212; thank\u000a        you for allowing me the opportunity to be part of it.\"\u000a    Sarah Shalgosky (Curator of the Mead Gallery at Warwick University) said:\u000a    \"We really enjoyed the evening &#8212; ultimately, the breaks in electricity\u000a        provided a lovely moment to sit in the dark and reflect with the weight\u000a        of the building and Coventry's history above us. The lighting of the\u000a        ruins behind strongly evoked John Piper's image of Coventry...\"\u000a    The project has been commented upon widely in the South Asian Diaspora.\u000a      The affective qualities of the dialogue and the space it provides to deal\u000a      with tension have been recognised as transformative:\u000a    \"Congratulations, it is absolutely brilliant...the filming the\u000a        music... the language, I don't know the words to describe it was so\u000a        heart wrenching ... the film was mesmerising...\" (Jitey Samra, Black\u000a      &amp; Minority Ethnic Community Mental Health Development Worker).\u000a    Press and news coverage of the inaugural launch event was featured across\u000a      different media platforms.[13] When Unravelling and the\u000a      Postcolonial War Requiem were presented again in November 2010\u000a      during the Coventry Peace Festival and part of the Coventry Cathedral\u000a      Blitz events, 500 members of the public were present.[14]\u000a    The impact of the launch in the Cathedral was followed by further\u000a      national and international invitations. It first moved to the Herbert Art\u000a      Gallery and Museum, located opposite the Cathedral, and later to the\u000a      Imperial War Museum, the V&amp;A, RIBA, the Southbank, and international\u000a      film festivals.[15] Unravelling has circulated at\u000a      international arts events with audiences ranging from 50 - 200, such as,\u000a      the Re-Orient Festival, Stockholm (Oct 2008; audience size 200)\u000a      and international film festivals (e.g. USA and Germany). The film's\u000a      cultural impact has been acknowledged by being awarded two `best short\u000a      film' international awards: Sikh International Film Festival, USA,\u000a      (2009; audience size 100) and London Asian Film Festival, 2011 (audience\u000a      size: 80).[16]\u000a    Unravelling has been included in significant conferences involving\u000a      third sector groups and cultural institutions, including galleries,\u000a      museums and festivals. It was a central feature of the Black Screen\u000a        Heritage Conference (31 July 2009) organised by the Imperial War\u000a      Museum, in partnership with Yorkshire Film Archive and Skillset. The event\u000a      influenced the strategy for creating accessible collections relating to\u000a      Black British heritage and knowledge sharing for wider communities. The\u000a      pool of influence included black cultural organisations, archivists, film\u000a      curators, community arts workers and audience development managers.\u000a    Unravelling and Post-Colonial War Requiem formed a plenary\u000a      session on `Noise of the Past' in the Taking Part conference (29 -\u000a      30 Oct 2010), Southbank, London.[17] This public event with\u000a      over 100 audience members stimulated the creation of new contexts for\u000a      debates in arts practice, and strengthened links between third sector\u000a      organisations and academic institutions. A screening and panel discussion\u000a      was held at the V&amp;A conference `From the Margins to the Core' in 2010.[18]\u000a      The audience consisted mainly of museum and gallery professionals. In the\u000a      museum sector it is now becoming commonplace to display talking-head\u000a      testimonies on video and text boards. Unravelling offers a more\u000a      challenging, sensory and creatively engaged method of presenting these\u000a      histories. It informs its audiences, but also affects them emotionally.\u000a    The legacy of the project continues to be multi-pronged; impacting on the\u000a      academic field as well as broad publics located in established cultural\u000a      institutions as well as more informal grassroots organisations. In the\u000a      ESRC Festival of Social Science in November 2013, Unravelling was\u000a      screened alongside a series of workshops with different voluntary and\u000a      community organisations across the UK.[19] This included\u000a      ex-soldiers from the Commonwealth Countries, Asian Women's Groups, as well\u000a      as informal poetry societies.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Nirmal Puwar's project, Noise of the Past, has sought to\u000a      transform the public imagination of war by bringing post-colonial stories\u000a      into the UK's national memory of World War II. At the same time it has\u000a      worked to re-imagine the research process and its relation to publics. It\u000a      has shown how the `noise' of the past, derived from narratives and\u000a      situations that are usually excluded, can move cultural memory beyond a\u000a      nationalistic, militaristic consensus. The research produced an award\u000a      winning film, `Unravelling,' and a live musical performance, `Post-colonial\u000a        War Requiem'. They were launched in 2008 at a large public event in\u000a      Coventry Cathedral, opened by Martin Bell (OBE, UNICEF ambassador). On 14\u000a      November 2010, Noise of the Past was invited back to Coventry Cathedral to\u000a      mark the 70th anniversary of the Blitz.

The primary research underpinning her project was\u000a      funded by an AHRC grant but also supported by other organisations with an\u000a      interest in its impact, including the Arts Council and Coventry Council\u000a      Peace Festival.[1] Through the project, Puwar as P-I and Sharma\u000a      as Co-I aimed to bring the post-colonial to bear upon sensory studies by\u000a      articulating questions of difference, alterity, migration, and belonging\u000a      in relation to the senses. While postcolonial studies of war and memory\u000a      have been replete with implicit accounts of the senses, they have lacked\u000a      an explicit agenda of engagement within the developing field of sensory\u000a      studies. The project has thus contributed to addressing this by\u000a      demarcating the senses as a field within post-colonial studies. But it has\u000a      uniquely done this through an innovative collaboration between academic\u000a      researchers and artists working in the media of musical composition,\u000a      poetry and film. This collaboration was organised in four interwoven\u000a      stages of the research process.\u000a    First, researchers worked with the artists to locate archived military\u000a      documents, maps, photographs and letters from the Imperial War Museum\u000a      sound archive, the India Office Library and other archives. The second\u000a      stage developed a poetic exchange in Urdu between Puwar's father, Sawarn\u000a      Singh, a poet and veteran, and his grandson, Kuldip Powar, on the subject\u000a      of Singh's wartime experience and his subsequent exclusion from public\u000a      ceremonies of remembrance. In the third stage, the internationally\u000a      acclaimed award winning composer and musician Nitin Sawhney composed music\u000a      responding to the poetic exchange. In the fourth stage, Powar directed a\u000a      film, Unravelling, precisely in response to Sawhney's composition,\u000a      using his music as the soundtrack. In addition, an original musical\u000a      composition inspired by the research, Post-Colonial War Requiem by\u000a      Francis Silkstone (a researcher at Goldsmiths from July 2007 to June\u000a      2012), was also produced in response to the inter-generational poetic\u000a      exchange. A conference, `War, Sound and Post-Coloniality',\u000a      exploring themes of war, memory and sound preceded the launch of the film\u000a      and composition in Coventry Cathedral.[2] As detailed in\u000a      section 4, these works have been and continue to be performed in numerous\u000a      venues thus engaging a variety of publics in re-imagining war.\u000a    These events and exchanges formed the basis of a special issue of Senses\u000a        and Society as well as a Manifesto on `Live Methods' and an article\u000a      on `Curating Sociology' in Sociological Review.[3,4,5,6,7]\u000a      Through these publications Puwar's work has contributed to advancing a\u000a      `live sociology' that is attuned to new strategies and methods for telling\u000a      society through collaborative forms of curation, sharing, and respectful\u000a      engagement. In this way, it offers a case study for how collaborations can\u000a      move beyond traditional conceptions of knowledge transfer to embrace\u000a      research as a process of interdisciplinary co-production and dialogic\u000a      exchange. Through the media of film and music its curations have also\u000a      offered a sensory method for engaging wider publics as dialogic\u000a      participants rather than passive audiences.\u000a    The Noise of the Past project has also had an influential and\u000a      field-defining impact on both new and established scholars in the growing\u000a      field of Visual Sociology. To a large degree this impact has been realised\u000a      through Puwar's directorship of the Methods Lab at Goldsmiths, which is\u000a      committed to developing inventive ways of doing sociology and providing a\u000a      laboratory for the practice of the sociological imagination. At the 2013\u000a      International Visual Sociology Association [IVSA] conference, the project\u000a      was highly applauded in a plenary session delivered to a large audience of\u000a      300 for its ambition and scope.[8] Douglas Harper\u000a      (president of the IVSA) publicly endorsed the film for taking visual\u000a      sociology into new and innovative territory.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42668","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1605651","Name":"Thailand"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"},{"GeoNamesId":"895949","Name":"Zambia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3932488","Name":"Peru"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Rosengarten's Australian-based research provided the HIV field with an\u000a      awareness of how the\u000a      introduction of antiretroviral drugs changed conceptions of risk and risk\u000a      minimisation practices. It has\u000a      directly informed policy and prevention education by the Australian\u000a      Federation of AIDS\u000a      Organisations[7] and has gone on to influence understandings of\u000a      HIV prevention including\u000a      randomised trials for HIV prevention in a number of other countries\u000a      including Canada, Peru, South\u000a      Africa, Thailand, the United Kingdom and the United States.\u000a    Rosengarten's more recent research is now providing the international HIV\u000a      field with insights into\u000a      devising more ethical and effective prevention interventions.[8][9]\u000a      Her work on PrEP provides a radical\u000a      rethinking of this drug, showing that new forms of interdisciplinary\u000a      collaboration are needed for more\u000a      user-friendly and effective interventions.[10][11] It has\u000a      provided new ways of thinking and working that\u000a      allow scientists, clinicians, policy makers, implementers and social\u000a      researchers to develop new ways\u000a      of conducting effective randomised control trials, demonstration studies,\u000a      and prevention policies.\u000a    She has responded to many invitations to address clinical trialists,\u000a      epidemiologists, clinicians, policy\u000a      makers, implementers and user advocates;[12][13][14][15] to act\u000a      as co-principal investigator on\u000a      randomized control trials;[7] and she has attracted the\u000a      participation of those advising on medical\u000a      guidelines and policy in international forums.[9][15]\u000a    Rosengarten has led actors within the HIV field to devise new approaches\u000a      to user interventions such\u000a      as condoms, pills and needles. It is this activity from which the\u000a      Association for the Social Sciences\u000a      and Humanities in HIV (ASSHH) emerged in 2009. ASSHH (Rosengarten founder\u000a      and Chair 2011-2013)\u000a      has attracted the interest of biomedical researchers, policy analysts,\u000a      implementers and\u000a      advocacy organisations.[16] Non-academic participants which\u000a      represent people living with HIV\u000a      include the International AIDS Society (IAS), The Global Fund to Fight\u000a      AIDS and Tuberculosis and\u000a      Malaria, International HIV\/AIDS Alliance; Australian Federation of AIDS\u000a      Organisations (AFAO); The\u000a      Zambia AIDS Related Tuberculosis (ZAMBART), Zambia; British HIV\u000a      Association (BHIVA); Joint\u000a      United Nations Programme on AIDS (UNAIDS); World Health Organisation\u000a      (WHO); and AIDS\u000a      Vaccine Advocacy Coalition (AVAC).\u000a    Through her publications and all of these activities and direct\u000a      engagements with clinicians, policy\u000a      makers, scientists and advocacy groups, at a global level and at a number\u000a      of national levels including\u000a      the United Kingdom, the following groups of people have benefited from her\u000a      work: people living with\u000a      HIV; people at risk of contracting HIV; people targeted as `experimental\u000a      subjects' in `offshore\u000a      biomedical trials;' HIV specialist clinicians; HIV scientists; HIV\u000a      international policy analysts and\u000a      programmers; HIV advocacy organisations; and, HIV prevention educators.\u000a    How have they benefited? People living with HIV, people at risk of\u000a      contracting HIV, advocacy groups,\u000a      clinicians, scientists, public health policy analysts and programmers and\u000a      prevention educators have\u000a      benefitted as a consequence of Rosengarten's attention to the dynamic\u000a      processual and increasingly\u000a      heterogeneous area of HIV prevention. She has reconceptualised and\u000a      extended understandings of\u000a      antiretroviral drugs as agents affecting risk perceptions and practices,\u000a      thereby explaining and\u000a      offering new ways of intercepting modes of HIV transmission.\u000a    HIV international policy analysts and programmers, HIV activist\u000a      organisations, and HIV social\u000a      scientists have benefited through the rethinking of Pre-Exposure\u000a      Prophylaxis as a multiple entity,\u000a      contingent on the context of its use and immensely complex in its\u000a      generative effects. This has\u000a      enabled the HIV field to reassess intervention, moving beyond arguments\u000a      for or against particular\u000a      drugs in order to attend more closely to how context informs\u000a      effectiveness and that context is itself\u000a      open to transformation. For example, HIV policy and programming has\u000a      benefited from acceptability\u000a      studies conducted with Holt et al., which has been cited in scientific\u000a      journals that promote the uptake\u000a      of research findings into routine healthcare in clinical, organisational\u000a      or policy contexts.[17]\u000a    People targeted as `experimental subjects' in `offshore biomedical\u000a      trials' in Africa, South America\u000a      and South East Asia have benefitted by inviting the attention of\u000a      trialists, ethicists and social scientists\u000a      to the performative and exclusionary effects of bioethics, thereby making\u000a      possible broader\u000a      consideration of the complex ways in which `experimental subjects' are\u000a      affected by trial participation\u000a      and, in turn, affect trial enrolment, trial retention and trial outcomes.\u000a      This has also been important to\u000a      explaining why costly randomised controlled trials may achieve unexpected\u000a      results.[7][9][11][14]\u000a    HIV specialist clinicians in the UK have benefitted through the\u000a      articulation of how their concerns and\u000a      experiences altered from a focus on palliative care to a biotechnology\u000a      informed practice (e.g., viral\u000a      RNA testing) with the introduction of antiretroviral drugs, reflecting an\u000a      entirely different medical\u000a      practice.[12] Furthermore, the doctoral research group that she\u000a      established links Goldsmiths\u000a      researchers with medical professionals at the Homerton, Middlesex and\u000a      Royal Free hospitals in\u000a      London and in 2013 will extend to clinics in Poland.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Rosengarten's work during the past fourteen years has provided the HIV\u000a      field with new ways of\u000a      rethinking otherwise seemingly intractable problems of more effective\u000a      prevention. Despite over 30\u000a      years of biomedical and social research, and policy and programme\u000a      implementation, the HIV\u000a      epidemic continues to grow.

Her\u000a      collaborator, Mike Michael, was appointed at Goldsmiths as lecturer in\u000a      April 1998 and is now\u000a      Professor (0.2 FTE).\u000a    The design and delivery of HIV prevention interventions has traditionally\u000a      relied on a deficit model of\u000a      the knowledge and resources of individuals and populations. As a\u000a      consequence, it has been unable\u000a      to consider adequately the complex ways in which interventions affect but\u000a      are also affected by the\u000a      contexts in which they are delivered. Rosengarten's research since 1999\u000a      has worked towards a more\u000a      comprehensive understanding of how these interventions work. In\u000a      1999, in collaboration with Race\u000a      and Kippax, she showed how newly introduced antiretroviral drug treatments\u000a      were altering\u000a      conceptions of risk and risk minimisation practices. The collaboration\u000a      identified a new sexual risk\u000a      minimisation practice, later termed `strategic positioning' and made\u000a      apparent how clinical\u000a      conceptions of reduced individual viral loads were fracturing a more\u000a      homogeneous approach to risk\u000a      otherwise reliant on condom use.\u000a    In 2009, Rosengarten published her monograph HIV Interventions: The\u000a        Traffic in Information and\u000a        Flesh, which expanded this work by drawing on feminist theories of\u000a      materiality as well as Science\u000a      and Technology Studies. It radically revised the bifurcation of thinking\u000a      on HIV into the biological and\u000a      the social, reconceptualising the work of HIV diagnostic technologies and\u000a      other interventions.\u000a      Interventions such as antiretroviral drugs and diagnostics (for example\u000a      the HIV antibody test and the\u000a      viral load test) as well as concepts of gender, ethnicity, race and sex,\u000a      were shown to be active in\u000a      shaping the changing HIV epidemic.\u000a    In 2008, Rosengarten began a highly productive and innovative\u000a      collaboration with Mike Michael,\u000a      Professor of Science and Technology Studies (STS), which has developed a\u000a      process-oriented\u000a      theoretical approach to HIV. The work has focussed primarily on the\u000a      clinical trialling and recent US\u000a      approval of PrEP, a pill-a-day pre-exposure prophylaxis intervention of\u000a      antiretroviral drugs. The work\u000a      offers new conceptual tools for conceiving of PrEP and, by implication,\u000a      the epidemic. PrEP - not\u000a      unlike what could be argued of other `objects' - is presented as a\u000a      multiple entity, emerging as such\u000a      in relation to heterogeneous context specific phenomena. For instance,\u000a      PrEP can be a prophylactic,\u000a      a marker of international exploitation, and the occasion for the\u000a      renegotiation of sexual practices. This\u000a      way of viewing PrEP contrasts significantly with the current reliance on\u000a      behavioural surveillance and\u000a      structural analyses, allowing for a conception of the HIV epidemic\u000a      affected by as well as affecting\u000a      interventions.\u000a    Outputs from the collaboration include numerous invitations to\u000a      participate in biomedical and policy\u000a      oriented forums, keynote conference papers, journal articles, chapters and\u000a      a book to reframe the\u000a      `goldstandard-ness' of randomised control trials, bioethics and evidence.\u000a      With Michael, Rosengarten\u000a      has demonstrated that randomised control trials and bioethics close down\u000a      understandings of the\u000a      complex manner in which prevention - and notably, PrEP - does or does not\u000a      emerge.\u000a    Rosengarten and Michael's timely work on the increasing predominance of\u000a      biomedical approaches\u000a      to prevention is now animating ideas across the HIV field. In particular,\u000a      Rosengarten has drawn on\u000a      this to found the Association for the Social Sciences and Humanities in\u000a      HIV (ASSHH). This growing\u000a      international organisation has been designed to achieve greater impact by\u000a      the social sciences in the\u000a      field of HIV, supporting multidisciplinary collaborations and new modes of\u000a      thinking about HIV\u000a      interventions.\u000a    Rosengarten's research is being further advanced through her\u000a      establishment of a doctoral research\u000a      group who are influencing understanding of how biomedical protocols are\u000a      shaped by the challenge\u000a      of dealing with stigma factors; how pregnant women with HIV do not\u000a      necessarily share biomedical\u000a      understandings of antiretroviral drugs for prevention of mother-to-child\u000a      transmission; and how the\u000a      history of the epidemic offers a space for those living and working with\u000a      HIV to reflect on how HIV\u000a      science is entangled with gay sexuality, activism, memory and loss, and\u000a      specific clinical and research\u000a      practices.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42669","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1643084","Name":"Indonesia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    A key objective of Simone's research is to make visible the urbanization\u000a      processes, residential histories and social compositions that are usually\u000a      left out of policy deliberations and the collective imaginary of the city.\u000a      Through his collaborative project with institutional partners, [8][9]\u000a      he has made concerted efforts to insert his research findings into a wide\u000a      range of deliberative settings, including informal deliberations with the\u000a      Governor of Jakarta. This has been achieved through the project's\u000a      two-pronged strategy of public workshops, media dissemination and\u000a      advocacy, combined with informal, unofficial discussions with various\u000a      ministries and municipal departments with Jakarta management\u000a      responsibilities. The strategy is an attempt to access more expanded\u000a      opportunities for knowledge production but also to affect life in the\u000a      districts being studied for the better.\u000a    One example of the public engagement strategy is the project's role in\u000a      public forums on issues of governance. The present structure of Jakarta\u000a      urban governance is untenable in the long run. Excessive power and\u000a      competencies are located at the largest and smallest scales, with diffuse\u000a      functions and responsibilities in between. New local government\u000a      legislation has been identified as a necessity in order to reconfigure\u000a      powers and scales along with new formal mechanisms of accountability and\u000a      decision-making. Through their participation in a city-wide citizen's\u000a      forum Koalisi Warga untuk Jakarta 2030, the project has\u000a      incorporated research findings into deliberations on governance issues and\u000a      contributed to popularising the processes and politics of restructuring.[10]\u000a      Through the consistent engagement of the local press the project's\u000a      textured understanding of existing local political dynamics has been\u000a      widely disseminated.[11] Visibility and attention to these\u000a      dynamics and political relationships at the local level are significant\u000a      because of their economic implications. Political relationships give\u000a      residents varying opportunities to accumulate per diem payments, small\u000a      cash grants, tenders, contracts, and equipment and have a direct bearing\u000a      on how different economic activities are connected and where they are\u000a      situated spatially.\u000a    Another example of public engagement is the project's use of a range of\u000a      social media sites to engage a wider citizen audience in the\u000a      identification of places, networks, and facilities that are underutilized,\u000a      and those that have excess capacity that goes to waste simply because\u000a      resources tend to accumulate in specific `basins' formed through a dense\u000a      nexus of advantageous political connections and distributions.[12]\u000a      The project has been especially concerned with creating mechanisms to\u000a      enhance productive relationships amongst different spheres of influence\u000a      and resource use in response to a trend for local associations to be\u000a      formed explicitly to capture development funds. These funds are then used\u000a      to capture particular territories, loyalties, or business sectors. For\u000a      that purpose, workshops were conducted with the kelurahan\u000a      (district level governments) in each of the 14 research districts,\u000a      including Kebong Kesong, Penjaringan, Warakas, Kampung Raya, Tanah Tinggi,\u000a      Utan Panjang, Serdang, Sumar Baru, Serdang, Cempaka Baru, Harapan Mulya,\u000a      and Padamanagan Timur during September-November 2010.[13]\u000a    The project was also the subject of deliberations amongst a cross-section\u000a      of journalists, activists, and academics organized through Komunitas\u000a      Salihara, one of the city's primary public affairs centres, in November\u000a      2010.[14] Project findings have been incorporated into\u000a      deliberations on the part of the national ministry of housing in\u000a      preparation for new legislation on housing and human settlements.[15]\u000a      It has been used to elaborate a platform of policy proposals from a\u000a      coalition of civic organizations for the gubernatorial elections of 2011,\u000a      as well as efforts to contribute to consultative processes organized\u000a      around the development of the Spatial Plan for Jakarta during 2009-2010.\u000a    Impact has also been achieved through working group activities. Between\u000a      August 2009 and September 2010, the University of Tarumanagara and the\u000a      International Urban Development Association (INTA) organized a framework\u000a      of consultations between researchers, planners, municipal officials and\u000a      developers. This is now the basis for ongoing working group discussions\u000a      between a network of public architects and the planning staff of Bappeda\u000a      di Jakarta (the regional body for planning and development). The project\u000a      was also the basis for a public city wide forum, Warga Masih Miskin, for\u000a      municipal officials and civil society organizations held at the Taman\u000a      Ismail Marzuki in July 2008, as well as the international forum organized\u000a      by Erasmus House, Open City Jakarta in September 2010. [16]\u000a    Finally, a critical dimension of the project in North Jakarta has been\u000a      its affiliation with the Urban Poor Consortium (UPC) - an umbrella of\u000a      community-based organizations - to popularize the research work in areas\u000a      experiencing marked contestation and change. Through UPC, residential\u000a      activist groups have been integrated into the research process, for\u000a      example by leading discussion groups and gathering information.[17]\u000a    It is through these many activities and engagements involving the\u000a      co-construction of knowledge and as part of a multidisciplinary\u000a      collaborative project that Simone's research has and continues to have an\u000a      impact on urban redevelopment and restructuring in Jakarta.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Simone's research has contributed to the building of a comprehensive\u000a      knowledge base on changing residential patterns, investment history, local\u000a      economies, and social power relations in fourteen districts of North and\u000a      Central Jakarta. The richness of the knowledge he has generated and its\u000a      influence on urban redevelopment and restructuring in Jakarta are a\u000a      consequence of both his close collaboration with a number of institutional\u000a      partners in Indonesia and their direct engagements with community\u000a      residents, social action groups, architects, researchers and government\u000a      decision makers.

His research has been undertaken in the context of\u000a      immense urban, social and political change and uncertainty in Jakarta. New\u000a      transportation systems and improved infrastructures are needed to meet the\u000a      demands of rapid economic growth. But the land required for these projects\u000a      mean significant disruption to and transformation of the economic, social\u000a      and built environments of central city districts. Dislocation and\u000a      affordability threaten lives and livelihoods that have flourished for\u000a      decades in these districts. Simone's research has analysed and documented\u000a      the historic organisation of these districts and in relation to this\u000a      identified forms of social mobilization and governance capable of\u000a      maintaining the capacities of these districts to support and combine\u000a      diverse ways of life.\u000a    Historically, Simone has documented how Jakarta, like many central city\u000a      areas of Asia, Latin America, and Africa, is made up of mixed-income,\u000a      mixed-use districts that continue to be important facets of the urban\u000a      economy. The mixture developed at first in relation to the physical\u000a      environment in its articulation with topographic features, such as rivers\u000a      and riverbeds, swamps, watersheds, uplands and lowlands. Over time,\u000a      thoroughfares such as railways, streets, lanes, alleys, pathways, ramps\u000a      and overpasses came to shape the development of what is now a richly mixed\u000a      urban fabric. In the Jakarta districts of Kemorayan, Padamangan, Galur,\u000a      Anyar, or Senen, for example, almost every street has a different mix of\u000a      bungalows that have remained the same for decades. These exist alongside\u000a      varying gradations of rehabilitation, rebuilding and new construction that\u000a      have ensued from new residents buying out former ones, or long-term\u000a      residents deploying their savings. Rental accommodation of all standards\u000a      across central districts has also flourished.\u000a    These residential spaces are commonly folded into commercial ones, as are\u000a      various uses of commercial space including retail, repair, storage, and\u000a      production. Distinct forms of residential areas open up onto each other in\u000a      jarring proximity. There are cottage, household based industries, small-\u000a      scale workshops employing 10-30 workers on variable hourly and monthly\u000a      contracts, as well as piecework, and small factories that consolidate\u000a      discrete individual producers into a cooperative arrangement to produce\u000a      particular items at sale for short periods of time. There are complex\u000a      subcontracting arrangements, from major producers that tie together scores\u000a      of small cottage industries. There are neighbourhood-based associations\u000a      that specialize in one line of production, or where each has their own\u000a      specialty.\u000a    Simone has documented how urban redevelopment and restructuring pose a\u000a      threat to these vibrant mixed use districts especially as many residents\u000a      and businesses will have to be relocated. The development of new\u000a      industries and services at the periphery of the capital region will\u000a      provide employment, commercial and housing opportunities for a portion of\u000a      displaced residents. But many existing commercial activities, such as\u000a      vehicle repair and servicing, textile production, marketing, business\u000a      services, and retailing, depend on their location in the city centre, and\u000a      the density of commercial and social relationships that this location\u000a      affords. A significant proportion of the existing resident base of these\u000a      districts may well have the capacity to relocate their social and economic\u000a      lives to other areas of the city. Many have already done so over the past\u000a      two decades. But an equally significant proportion is heavily dependent\u000a      upon their current location and would not have the means to relocate\u000a      successfully without substantial government assistance or compensation.\u000a      While increased emphasis on high-density, vertical development is probably\u000a      inevitable in terms of accommodating relocated residents, the\u000a      always-challenging problem of affordability remains. Simone's research has\u000a      demonstrated that severe disruption of existing local economies and\u000a      commercial activities will likely compound these problems of dislocation\u000a      and affordability, and that it is therefore necessary to understand how\u000a      these local economies operate today, and how they can be replicated or\u000a      remade within new sites.\u000a    To that end, Simone's research focuses on understanding how these\u000a      districts have become places of intensive material and social\u000a      heterogeneity, their relationships to the larger urban system, and aspects\u000a      of these relationships that exert particular possibilities and\u000a      constraints. Beginning in 2009, these objectives have been pursued through\u000a      a collaborative project with several partners located in Indonesia. The\u000a      project is ongoing and involves the Program in Urban Development and Real\u000a      Estate Management of the University of Tarumanagara (funded by the\u000a      Tarumanagara Foundation) and the Rujak Centre for Urban Studies (RCUS),\u000a      facilitated by grants from the Open Society, Hivos (an International\u000a      Development organisation), and the European Commission. Through this\u000a      collaboration and a process-based approach to research, Simone has pursued\u000a      his research objectives using multiple methods including community\u000a      mapping, household surveys, ethnographic observation, focus groups, social\u000a      action engagement with local governance practices, and institutional\u000a      profiling. With this approach he has contributed to the making of a\u000a      comprehensive knowledge base on the socioeconomic composition of fourteen\u000a      districts located in North and Central Jakarta, the range of economic\u000a      capacities of resident households, the degrees of change in the\u000a      residential composition of these districts, and the understandings of a\u000a      sample of residents themselves. But most significantly, his research has\u000a      identified forms of social mobilization and governance capable of\u000a      maintaining the capacities of these central districts to support and\u000a      combine diverse ways of life in the midst of immense urban, social and\u000a      political change. While focused on Jakarta the research has relevance for\u000a      the analysis and understanding of redevelopment and restructuring in\u000a      cities in the global South.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43006","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The UK is the first European country to pass legislation on caste\u000a      discrimination and much of the\u000a      specialist knowledge, information and argument on the legal regulation of\u000a      caste discrimination is\u000a      directly attributable to Waughray's research.

Output\u000a      [1] has been credited by academics and non-academics alike as\u000a      radically altering legal thinking on\u000a      caste discrimination in the UK.

However the\u000a      amendment contributed to a climate in which the later amendment permitting\u000a      the addition of caste\u000a      to the definition of race became section 9(5)(a) of the Equality Act 2010\u000a      was accepted\u000a    In February 2010 Waughray was requested by the Minister then responsible\u000a      for the Equality Bill in\u000a      the Lords [B], to attend a meeting on caste and the Equality Bill\u000a      called in order for government to\u000a      consider whether to include caste in the Equality Act 2010. Waughray's\u000a      role was to outline why\u000a      caste was not adequately covered by existing discrimination law and to\u000a      propose possible\u000a      legislative solutions, which involved providing an explanation of the\u000a      difference between &#8212; and the\u000a      legal, policy and political implications of &#8212; the usage in legislation of\u000a      the terms `caste', `descent' and\u000a      `race'. Waughray was also requested by the Government Equalities Office to\u000a      assist with the\u000a      drafting of the Explanatory Notes on Caste to the Equality Act 2010.\u000a    In January 2011 and November 2012 Waughray was invited [C] to\u000a      speak in her capacity as a legal\u000a      expert on caste discrimination and British discrimination law at two House\u000a      of Lords conferences\u000a      attended by NGOs, government and shadow ministers, and other\u000a      parliamentarians, to put the legal\u000a      arguments for the exercise of the power in section 9(5)(a) to add caste to\u000a      the Equality Act 2010.\u000a      The second of these conferences led directly to an amendment to the\u000a      Enterprise and Regulatory\u000a      Reform Bill (ERRB) which mandated the addition of caste to the Equality\u000a      Act 2010.\u000a    On 24 April 2013 the government, after two Lords' defeats, conceded to\u000a      amend the ERRB by\u000a      converting into a duty the power in section 9(5)(a) of the\u000a      Equality Act 2010 making caste an aspect\u000a      of the protected characteristic of race. As a result, the Secretary of\u000a      State is now required to bring\u000a      forward secondary legislation to include caste as an aspect of race. In\u000a      order to inform the\u000a      regulations the Equality and Human Rights Commission has commissioned\u000a      research on `Caste in\u000a      Britain', which brings together a team of experts (including Waughray) to\u000a      report inter alia on socio-legal\u000a\u0009  definitions of caste. The Minister responsible for the Equality Act\u000a      in the Lords [B] commented\u000a      in an email to Waughray: \"Your skills and knowledge will be vital in\u000a      coming months with\u000a      negotiations about guidance.\"\u000a    On 30 April 2013, Waughray participated in a meeting to discuss some of\u000a      the legal implications of\u000a      the requirement to add caste as an aspect of race in the Equality Act at\u000a      the House of Lords. At that\u000a      meeting it was decided to draft a document setting out how caste could be\u000a      approached within the\u000a      legislation. This document was co-written by Waughray, Lord Lester and Dr.\u000a      David Keane of\u000a      Middlesex University Law School\u000a      http:\/\/www.odysseustrust.org\/caste\/Amending_the_Equality_Act_2010.pdf.\u000a    Keith Porteous Wood, executive director of the National Secular Society,\u000a      said he was delighted\u000a      that the government had committed itself to ensuring that caste would\u000a      enjoy the same statutory\u000a      protection as other protected characteristics: \"Too many British citizens\u000a      have suffered caste-based\u000a      discrimination. Our equality legislation will now send out a clear signal\u000a      that it will no longer be\u000a      tolerated, and offers hope to the tens of thousands of British Asians\u000a      whose lives are blighted by\u000a      such prejudice. This is a victory for the Lords and their emphasis on\u000a      protecting human rights.\"\u000a      In August 2013, Waughray was commissioned by the Equality and Human Rights\u000a      Commission\u000a      (EHRC) as part of a multi-institution, multidisciplinary team of expert\u000a      academics to conduct\u000a      independent research on caste in Britain including a review of law and\u000a      caste. The research will\u000a      inform the work of the EHRC and will feed into the consultation on caste\u000a      legislation that the\u000a      Government Equalities Office is due to undertake in spring 2014.\u000a      Waughray's work is listed in the\u000a      Equality and Human Rights Commission Key Readings on Race [D].\u000a    Waughray's work has had a direct impact on the behaviour and strategies\u000a      of NGOP and Advocacy\u000a      groups concerned with caste discrimination in Britain, such as Caste Watch\u000a      UK [E] and the Anti-Caste\u000a\u0009  Discrimination Alliance (ACDA) [F]. Dalit NGOs have cited\u000a      Waughray's work in shadow\u000a      reports submitted to the UN CERD [G]. Waughray was a key speaker\u000a      at the Caste Watch UK\u000a      conference at the Houses of Parliament in 2007 under the theme of Caste\u000a      and Discrimination Law.\u000a      The conference addressed the policy implications of caste-based\u000a      discrimination for British law and\u000a      was attended and supported by parliamentarians, human rights activists,\u000a      lawyers, academics and\u000a      community leaders. Waughray was an advisor to ACDA on their 2009 study Hidden\u000a        Apartheid:\u000a        Caste in the Community, which influenced government and\u000a      parliamentarians' thinking on the need\u000a      for legal regulation of caste discrimination in British law. She is also\u000a      named as a key consultant in\u000a      the National Institute for Social and Economic Research report on caste\u000a      discrimination [H].\u000a      Waughray's work has also been disseminated more broadly through media\u000a      invitations, including\u000a      invitations from the BBC World Service (2009) and BBC Radio 4 Woman's Hour\u000a      (January 2010) [I].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Annapurna Waughray is the first legal scholar to examine the capacity of\u000a      British equality law to\u000a      address discrimination based on caste.

In\u000a      India &#8212; the world's\u000a      largest caste-affected country &#8212; discrimination based on caste affects\u000a      around 167 million Dalits,\u000a      also known as `Scheduled Castes' in Indian legal and administrative\u000a      terminology, formerly known\u000a      as `Untouchables'. It is estimated that there are between 50,00 to 200,000\u000a      people of Dalit origin in\u000a      the UK, possibly more; the exact figure is unknown and is a matter of\u000a      controversy. Dalits in the UK\u000a      have complained of the practice of caste discrimination within the South\u000a      Asian community since\u000a      the 1960s. However, until recently Dalits constituted a largely invisible\u000a      `minority within a minority'.\u000a      Moreover, there was no expressed statutory prohibition of such\u000a      discrimination in British law. In the\u000a      mid-1990s, Dalit activists in India succeeded in bringing caste\u000a      discrimination to the attention of the\u000a      United Nations, resulting in its condemnation in 1996 by the UN Committee\u000a      for the Elimination of\u000a      Racial Discrimination (CERD) as a violation of the UN International\u000a      Convention for the Elimination\u000a      of all Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD). In 2002 CERD adopted\u000a      General Recommendation\u000a      29, which affirms that caste discrimination is a form of descent-based\u000a      racial discrimination. In 2003,\u000a      and in 2011, CERD specifically recommended that the UK introduce\u000a      legislative protection against\u000a      descent based-discrimination, including discrimination based on caste.\u000a    Waughray has worked as a Senior Lecturer in Law at MMU since 2001.\u000a      Originally a linguist, she\u000a      qualified as a Solicitor (England and Wales) in 1994 and practised as a\u000a      litigation lawyer until 2000.\u000a      From 1983 to 1989, she worked in the NGO and public sectors in London on\u000a      issues such as health\u000a      and women's rights, and with migrant and refugee populations. Since 2002\u000a      she has been\u000a      researching the legal regulation of caste discrimination in India, in the\u000a      UK and in international\u000a      human rights law.\u000a    Prior to Waugray's work, British lawyers had given little thought as to\u000a      whether caste discrimination\u000a      was covered by UK discrimination law. Caste and the associated phenomenon\u000a      of discrimination\u000a      based on caste were not on the radar of mainstream society or the UK legal\u000a      community. Waughray\u000a      challenged the assumption that existing legislation on race and religious\u000a      discrimination was\u000a      sufficient to cover caste discrimination in 2009 [1]. Waughray\u000a      argued that this assumption was\u000a      premised on a misunderstanding of caste, and that, at best, race and\u000a      religious discrimination\u000a      provisions offered only partial and uncertain protection from caste\u000a      discrimination. If it was accepted\u000a      that caste discrimination was occurring in the UK in fields covered by\u000a      British discrimination law,\u000a      then an explicit statutory prohibition would be essential.\u000a    Waughray's work has sought to address the above concerns by being the\u000a      first to address the\u000a      question of the legal regulation of caste discrimination in the UK. She is\u000a      also one of the first\u000a      academic lawyers to address the anomalies in India's legal frameworks for\u000a      Scheduled Castes and\u000a      minorities [2,3]. Waughray has frequently spoken on the legal\u000a      regulation of caste discrimination at\u000a      NGO and academic conferences, and in 2006 and 2007 she advised British\u000a      NGOs concerned with\u000a      caste discrimination on their submissions to the government consultations\u000a      on the Equalities\u000a      Review and the Discrimination Law Review, which led to the Equality Act\u000a      2010. Her advice on the\u000a      capture of caste by British discrimination law and international human\u000a      rights law was sought by the\u000a      government (Labour Minister responsible for the Equality Bill in the\u000a      Lords) in 2010 during the\u000a      parliamentary debates on the Equality Bill and contributed directly to the\u000a      government's decision to\u000a      include a provision in the Equality Act 2010 (section 9(5(a)) allowing for\u000a      the addition of caste at a\u000a      future date to the protected characteristic of race in the Act [3].\u000a    Waughray's work highlights the occurrence of caste discrimination both in\u000a      spheres covered by\u000a      discrimination law and, importantly, in the unregulated private sphere.\u000a      She has also highlighted the\u000a      psychological nature of caste-related attacks on self-worth and the\u000a      potential for domestic\u000a      provisions on harassment for addressing this form of discrimination.\u000a      Waughray's work on the legal\u000a      relationship between caste discrimination and religious identity\/religion\u000a      in the UK has also been\u000a      developed in relation to India [4] in the context of which she\u000a      critiques the legal framework for\u000a      discrimination against Dalits and the exclusion of Muslim and Christian\u000a      Dalits from statutory\u000a      protection from caste discrimination and from India's constitutional\u000a      affirmative action regime for the\u000a      Scheduled Castes. Waughray has made sure that her arguments on caste\u000a      discrimination and the\u000a      Equality Act 2010 are accessible to a legal practitioner audience [5].\u000a      In 2013 Waughray was part of\u000a      a multi-institutional, inter-disciplinary team of academics commissioned\u000a      by the Equality and Human\u000a      Rights Commission to carry out new research on caste in Britain to feed\u000a      into the planned\u000a      governmental consultation process on the introduction of a statutory\u000a      prohibition of caste\u000a      discrimination under the Equality Act 2010 [6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43221","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3017382","Name":"France"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Edensor and Millington's ambitions for producing impactful,\u000d\u000a      practice-centred research capable of improving the everyday quality of\u000d\u000a      life in the city is rooted in the work of the MIPC, which initiated the\u000d\u000a      formation of Manchester's &#163;31-million Museum of Urban Life, Urbis,\u000d\u000a      in 2002 and also fostered the development of Manchester's Creative\u000d\u000a      Industries Development Service (CIDS), the UK's first dedicated local\u000d\u000a      economic development agency for the creative industries.

In 2009 Edensor and Millington were\u000d\u000a      invited to present their work on Christmas illuminations to a meeting of\u000d\u000a      the Professional Light Designers Association (PDLA) in London.\u000d\u000a      Subsequently, the chair of the PDLA, commissioned a non-academic article\u000d\u000a      for the trade journal Lighting Matters to communicate these ideas\u000d\u000a      more widely to professionals as, in his view, vernacular lighting\u000d\u000a      practices deserved to be taken more seriously by the profession [B].\u000d\u000a      The journal is circulated to over 2500 lighting engineers, lighting\u000d\u000a      designers, consultants, lighting manufacturers and local authority\u000d\u000a      lighting personnel in the UK, as well as reaching an influential\u000d\u000a      readership among key lighting specialists in other English-speaking\u000d\u000a      countries. Also in 2009, Edensor and Millington were invited to address a\u000d\u000a      large gathering of light designers and policy makers at Fete Des\u000d\u000a        Lumieres, the annual international conference of Lighting Urban\u000d\u000a      Community International (LUCI) in Lyon [C]. Their presentation on\u000d\u000a      the Blackpool Illuminations prompted an unprecedented professional pledge\u000d\u000a      to furthering the potential social and economic utility of vernacular\u000d\u000a      illumination and led to further consultations with light designers from\u000d\u000a      Columbia, France, Italy, Germany, China and Sweden. The research has also\u000d\u000a      underpinned the development of certified qualifications for professional\u000d\u000a      place managers in association with the MMU-affiliated Institute of Place\u000d\u000a      Management http:\/\/www.placemanagement.org\/.\u000d\u000a      Millington's research has directly contributed to the Institute's\u000d\u000a      development and delivery of a Masters programme in Place Management, an\u000d\u000a      introductory diploma and international certificate, all of which have been\u000d\u000a      lauded for their transformative effect on professional practice. This\u000d\u000a      professional accreditation has been awarded to 48 place managers since\u000d\u000a      2008, and as one attendee testifies: \"The research context helped me\u000d\u000a        to gain vital learning and knowledge which has been instrumental in\u000d\u000a        shaping both my career and my understanding of the complexities in place\u000d\u000a        management. The professional qualification has assisted my career\u000d\u000a        enormously\" [D]. Research findings have also been shared\u000d\u000a      with professionals at the annual Streetscapes conference in 2010 organised\u000d\u000a      by RUDI http:\/\/www.rudi.net\/, a\u000d\u000a      national organisation for knowledge sharing about urban development for\u000d\u000a      both professionals and academics.\u000d\u000a    The research has directly impacted upon cultural and creative policy and\u000d\u000a      community development in a number of areas. Firstly, it has influenced the\u000d\u000a      strategy of the Blackpool Illuminations Team. Edensor and Millington were\u000d\u000a      consulted by the Director of Blackpool Illuminations, http:\/\/www.blackpool.gov.uk\/Services\/G-L\/Illuminations\/\u000d\u000a      [E] on the basis of their research into visitor experience, which\u000d\u000a      reveals how local lighting design can provide a more situated and grounded\u000d\u000a      expertise that pre-empts homogenising tendencies. Their advice was\u000d\u000a      subsequently incorporated into the department's strategic plans and\u000d\u000a      included in a successful bid for financial support from Blackpool Council,\u000d\u000a      which highlights the potential of the research to inform planning and\u000d\u000a      stimulate collaborative research across the academic\/professional divide.\u000d\u000a      Secondly, the North-West Coastal Forum, which brings together stakeholders\u000d\u000a      to promote sustainable management of the regional coastline, invited\u000d\u000a      Millington in 2011 to discuss the policy implications of his research\u000d\u000a      findings. In addition, the Littoral Society, an international network of\u000d\u000a      coastline policy makers, invited Millington to utilise data from the\u000d\u000a      Blackpool research to provide a workshop on lighting and coastal\u000d\u000a      regeneration to industry professionals at their 2010 international\u000d\u000a      conference. Thirdly, to develop further collaborative work with the PLDA,\u000d\u000a      designers Sharon Stammers and Martin Lupton, members of the Social Light\u000d\u000a      Movement [F], a philanthropic movement dedicated to improving\u000d\u000a      light provision for people and communities, were invited to MMU in 2010 to\u000d\u000a      deliver a public seminar that addressed the social uses of illumination.\u000d\u000a      Their visit initiated the writing of a co-authored work-in-progress paper,\u000d\u000a      which seeks to develop innovative theoretical perspectives in direct\u000d\u000a      complementation of the designers' practical expertise. The next step in\u000d\u000a      this collaboration will be a social lighting event scheduled for 2014 and\u000d\u000a      involving hands-on collaboration with PLDA to devise more creative ways\u000d\u000a      for illuminating the Bentley Housing Association in Manchester and an\u000d\u000a      adjacent section of the Mancunian Way, which will exemplify the broader\u000d\u000a      potential for making Manchester's public lighting at once more diverse and\u000d\u000a      sustainable.\u000d\u000a    The important role of Edensor and Millington's expertise in securing and\u000d\u000a      consolidating support for the archiving and exhibiting of popular heritage\u000d\u000a      collections is evidenced a statement from the Head of Heritage at\u000d\u000a      Blackpool Council, to add academic weight to a subsequently successful bid\u000d\u000a      (awarded January 2012) to the Heritage Lottery Fund. The award has\u000d\u000a      assisted `with the documentation and re-storage of the Illuminations\u000d\u000a      Collection' [G], making the collection available to the public,\u000d\u000a      particularly schools. Furthermore, Edensor has recently been invited to\u000d\u000a      collaborate with a senior curator at Manchester Museum of Science and\u000d\u000a      Industry, on a public exhibition for 2014 that will combine their academic\u000d\u000a      and curatorial expertise to showcase the history of urban illumination and\u000d\u000a      enhance popular understanding of its cultural evolution and contemporary\u000d\u000a      relevance.\u000d\u000a    The research has also contributed significantly to public engagement.\u000d\u000a      Millington collaborated with MMU's North-West Film Archive (NWFA) to host\u000d\u000a      a presentation of historic film footage of the Blackpool Illuminations to\u000d\u000a      over 70 people at Manchester's City Art Gallery in March 2013. Urbis\u000d\u000a      Research Forum, a public forum for debating issues concerning urban\u000d\u000a      regeneration and development in Manchester (http:\/\/urbisresearchforum.wordpress.com\/upcoming-events\/),\u000a      initiated and co-founded by another UoA23 researcher (Holloway), invited\u000d\u000a      Edensor and Millington in June 2013 to elaborate on the broader\u000d\u000a      implications of their work. Their research has also been instrumental in\u000d\u000a      creating a forum for collaboration and intellectual exchange through the\u000d\u000a      recently established website-cum-blog `Light Research at MMU' (http:\/\/www.lightresearch.mmu.ac.uk\/),\u000a      which provides an interactive resource for researchers and lighting\u000d\u000a      professionals at an international level, and moreover serves as a device\u000d\u000a      for public engagement. Beyond this, Edensor and Millington's lighting\u000d\u000a      research has also contributed to broader academic, professional and media\u000d\u000a      deliberations. The contemporary relevance of the debate on how\u000d\u000a      illumination could be more creatively utilised by professionals to improve\u000d\u000a      urban environments, enhance sustainability and develop place-making\u000d\u000a      strategies is indicated by increasing media interest in the research,\u000d\u000a      resulting, for example, in an invitation to contribute to the discussion\u000d\u000a      about Christmas and taste on BBC Radio 3's Thinking Aloud in 2010\u000d\u000a      [H]. The research made a further significant contribution to public\u000d\u000a      debate with an article in the Manchester Evening News and two\u000d\u000a      appearances by Millington on BBC Look North in February 2013.\u000d\u000a      Millington has also helped to enhance place-management activities along\u000d\u000a      the Oxford Road Corridor, an important thoroughfare and economic and\u000d\u000a      cultural quarter in Manchester city centre, by lending his research\u000d\u000a      expertise to a high-profile design competition focused on improving a\u000d\u000a      local \"sense of place\", which also included contributions from Transport\u000d\u000a      for Greater Manchester, the Arup firm and Manchester City Council [I].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The significance of illumination for the development of innovative\u000d\u000a      place-making strategies designed to enhance convivial life in the city,\u000d\u000a      enable better communal heritage preservation and augment urban economic\u000d\u000a      capacity has been acutely underestimated. The research showcased here is\u000d\u000a      interested in discovering new concepts and methodologies for the\u000d\u000a      understanding, utilisation and evaluation of illumination as both a\u000d\u000a      facilitator and intrinsic expression of communal life in both the city and\u000d\u000a      beyond. The research has initiated a vibrant knowledge exchange between\u000d\u000a      academics, professionals and municipal authorities leading to the\u000d\u000a      establishment of an increasingly international network focused on the\u000d\u000a      politics, aesthetics, communal benefits and economic potential of\u000d\u000a      effective urban place-making through strategic illumination. The research\u000d\u000a      has also impacted on the tourism strategies of coastal towns and resorts,\u000d\u000a      and on heritage cultivation through the provision of expert advice. Among\u000d\u000a      both specialist stakeholders and the wider public the research has raised\u000d\u000a      awareness of illumination as a place-making strategy, as well as a matter\u000d\u000a      of class and taste. The research has also rehabilitated aspects of popular\u000d\u000a      culture by reappraising the role of the vernacular in municipal event\u000d\u000a      planning and general policy-making discourse.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    Manchester Metropolitan University\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Manchester Metropolitan University","InstitutionName":"Manchester Metropolitan University","PeerGroup":"D","Region":"North West","UKPRN":10004180}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2996944","Name":"Lyon"}],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a[1] O'Connor, J. and Wynne, D.

The\u000d\u000a      increasingly practice- and utility-centred rationale informing this\u000d\u000a      research follows in the footsteps of the pioneering work of MMU's\u000d\u000a      Manchester Institute of Popular Culture (MIPC) (1991 - 2006). MIPC's\u000d\u000a      research on the complex interplay between production, consumption and\u000d\u000a      regeneration in contemporary urban contexts gave rise to a new\u000d\u000a      MMU-specific brand of impact-led sociological research intent on boosting\u000d\u000a      the local economy and promoting greater urban quality of life by\u000d\u000a      developing close collaborative research and knowledge-exchange\u000d\u000a      partnerships with the then newly emergent cultural industries as well as\u000d\u000a      the city itself. The legacy of two of MIPC's leading proponents &#8212; Justin\u000d\u000a      O'Connor, MIPC director (1995-2006) and now Professor of Cultural Economy\u000d\u000a      at Monash University, and Derek Wynne, Reader in Sociology at MMU\u000d\u000a      (1974-2002) &#8212; is particularly important here. In direct response to\u000d\u000a      Manchester's radically deindustrialised cityscape of the early 1990s,\u000d\u000a      subject to continuing accelerated change as new metropolitan lifestyles\u000d\u000a      began to assert themselves, O'Connor and Wynne devised a new\u000d\u000a      methodological approach to popular cultural research committed to making a\u000d\u000a      real difference to people's daily lives by engaging in dialogue with the\u000d\u000a      inhabitants of the city, as well as cultural entrepreneurs and the\u000d\u000a      municipal authorities. Their research on urban development instigated an\u000d\u000a      enduring intervention in debates and practices regarding the dynamics of\u000d\u000a      cultural regeneration [1].\u000d\u000a    MIPC's legacy underpins both the intellectual and methodological\u000d\u000a      foundations of Edensor and Millington's research, which has from the start\u000d\u000a      actively invited professional feedback and collaboration, and is now\u000d\u000a      indeed increasingly opening up to non-academic expertise and\u000d\u000a      co-authorship. Their work on urban illumination and popular culture has\u000d\u000a      identified four key insights relevant not only to other scholars, but also\u000d\u000a      to municipal policy-makers on urban regeneration and professional light\u000d\u000a      designers: 1) that particular practices of illumination are conducive to\u000d\u000a      generating a sense of place and community; 2) that vernacular light\u000d\u000a      decoration can constitute an aesthetic resource facilitating valuable\u000d\u000a      local forms of creative production; 3) that there is a profound lack of\u000d\u000a      understanding of how illumination and darkness are experienced, `felt' and\u000d\u000a      interpreted; 4) that over-illumination impairs the potential for darkness\u000d\u000a      to enchant space and, consequently, for illumination to be more effective.\u000d\u000a      The research project originally commenced with an investigation into what\u000d\u000a      motivated people to adorn their houses with extensive Christmas\u000d\u000a      illuminations. This investigation revealed the contested aesthetics over\u000d\u000a      this practice while highlighting the impetus amongst householders to\u000d\u000a      generate conviviality, festivity and community, qualities often\u000d\u000a      misrecognised in critical popular and media discourse [2]. The\u000d\u000a      focus on contested aesthetics led to further empirical research (2009-11)\u000d\u000a      examining the Blackpool Illuminations, hitherto wholly neglected by\u000d\u000a      researchers despite their enduring popularity. It was discovered that\u000d\u000a      these illuminations &#8212; grounded in a highly localised form of production\u000d\u000a      and consumed in ways that emphasise sociability, fun and nostalgia &#8212; have\u000d\u000a      remained insulated from wider taste-generating design practices\u000d\u000a      internationally [3]. This insight then inspired further conceptual\u000d\u000a      research on how illumination can be generative of affective atmospheres [4].\u000d\u000a      Between 2011 and 2013 the research turned to the potential of darkness to\u000d\u000a      offer stimulating encounters with space that foreground non-visual\u000d\u000a      sensations and forms of conviviality, examining also how the saturation of\u000d\u000a      nocturnal space with extensive illumination tends to minimise the\u000d\u000a      potential for positive experiences engendered by encounters with gloom.\u000d\u000a      This research coincided with the recent emergence of a range of popular\u000d\u000a      leisure attractions that offer experiences of darkness, including Dark Sky\u000d\u000a      Parks (http:\/\/www.darksky.org ) [4],\u000d\u000a      and resulted in Edensor being invited to play a leading role in a\u000d\u000a      pan-European Berlin-based network (`Loss of the Night', http:\/\/www.cost-lonne.eu\u000d\u000a      ) that explores the `loss of the night' through excessive illumination [5].\u000d\u000a      Most recently Edensor and Millington presented their work at the 2013\u000d\u000a      annual conferences of the Association of American Geographers in Los\u000d\u000a      Angeles in April and the Institute of British Geographers in London in\u000d\u000a      August.

Major projects included design\u000d\u000a      and analysis of the\u000d\u000a      Eurobarometer (EB 62.2, one of the main instruments for measuring the\u000d\u000a      climate of opinion in\u000d\u000a      European states; 2005\/6) and the European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS,\u000d\u000a      2007-11).\u000d\u000a    The findings highlighted two types of `social capital': formal\u000d\u000a      (participation in civil society) and\u000d\u000a      informal (participation in social networks and levels of giving and\u000d\u000a      receiving social support) [3.1].\u000d\u000a      Further research showed social capital to be a significant component of\u000d\u000a      life quality more generally\u000d\u000a      [3.2]. Both of these were shown to be highest in Northern Europe, but low\u000d\u000a      in the South and East,\u000d\u000a      where informal social capital was predominant. In Southern Europe, family\u000d\u000a      support was the primary\u000d\u000a      form of social capital.\u000d\u000a    One of the most important constituents of quality of life is satisfaction\u000d\u000a      with work. Using the EQLS,\u000d\u000a      Wallace and her team found that the most main components of job\u000d\u000a      satisfaction for poorer people\u000d\u000a      and people in poorer countries were having a regular job and an income\u000d\u000a      [3.3]. The research\u000d\u000a      showed that once a certain level of affluence is reached, more intrinsic\u000d\u000a      rewards of working (such\u000d\u000a      as job interest and autonomy) become more important. In Southern and\u000d\u000a      Eastern Europe, poor\u000d\u000a      working conditions and low job security were factors lowering quality of\u000d\u000a      life in general.\u000d\u000a    Working life was explored further in another EU project [3.4], which also\u000d\u000a      analysed work and care in\u000d\u000a      terms of the model of social quality that the Aberdeen team had been\u000d\u000a      developing since 2006,\u000d\u000a      building on the work of a European Social Quality network. Research\u000d\u000a      findings added to knowledge\u000d\u000a      about the social context of quality of life by examining the role of\u000d\u000a      socio-economic security and\u000d\u000a      social cohesion, inclusion and empowerment [3.5].\u000d\u000a    In 2012\/13, Pamela Abbott, Honorary Professor of Sociology at Aberdeen\u000d\u000a      since 2010, conducted\u000d\u000a      research on social quality in Rwanda, which looked at the extent to which\u000d\u000a      policies to build social\u000d\u000a      cohesion in the wake of the 1994 Genocide were succeeding. She found that\u000d\u000a      although economic\u000d\u000a      security and social integration at community level are improving there is\u000d\u000a      less evidence that people\u000d\u000a      are empowered and they are generally dissatisfied with their lives [3.6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43357","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"248816","Name":"Jordan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"1227603","Name":"Sri Lanka"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research described in this case study has directly benefitted policy\u000a      makers and\u000a      community leaders, peace practitioners and civil society groups in\u000a      Northern Ireland and\u000a      elsewhere, as well as building knowledge and stimulating debate via online\u000a      media.\u000a    Brewer and Hayes have briefed influential Northern Ireland policy makers,\u000a      community\u000a      leaders and opinion formers on their research findings.

A leaflet quoting\u000a      Hayes's work was\u000a      re-posted on the NICIE website in 2012; several of her outputs are\u000a      available on the site [5.4].\u000a    \u000a      Brewer and Hayes have both translated their research findings into\u000a      practical peace-building\u000a      events and workshops for civil society groups. Brewer contributed to an\u000a      international\u000a      conference on Trauma and Spirituality held in Belfast during March 2011;\u000a      it brought together\u000a      over 250 delegates (mostly health professionals and representatives of\u000a      faith communities)\u000a      from around the world. Brewer presented his findings on the role of church\u000a      leaders in\u000a      providing prophetic and practical guidance during the Northern Ireland\u000a      conflict [5.5].\u000a    In June and November 2011, Brewer delivered a set of workshops based on\u000a      his research to\u000a      an international group of participants from Sweden, Ireland and Northern\u000a      Ireland at\u000a      Ballymena under the auspices of Mediation Northern Ireland, a\u000a      peace-building NGO. The\u000a      aim of these workshops was to build civic leadership through international\u000a      dialogue [5.6].\u000a      This programme was coordinated with an event in July 2010, at which Brewer\u000a      addressed a\u000a      civil society audience at the John Hewitt International Summer School in\u000a      Armagh.\u000a    In October 2012, Hayes presented her research findings on church\u000a      attendance to a seminar\u000a      run by ARK, which aimed to promote knowledge-based policy in Northern\u000a      Ireland. The\u000a      audience included people from the voluntary sector and churches [5.7].\u000a    In 2011, Brewer's research findings on religion and well-being among\u000a      victims and ex-combatants\u000a      were translated by the Northern Ireland Association for Mental Health\u000a      (NIAMH)\u000a      into a training DVD, Journey towards Healing [5.8].\u000a    Internationally, Brewer has used his research insights to devise\u000a      peace-building workshops\u000a      for civil society groups, which he rolled out in Sri Lanka via the Asian\u000a      Institute of Missiology\u000a      in August 2010 and February 2012 [5.9]. Following the latter, Brewer\u000a      agreed with the\u000a      Institute that he would engage in a small scale but active civil society\u000a      peace-building project\u000a      bringing together Sinhalese and Tamil widows and their children. He also\u000a      addressed an\u000a      audience of civil society peacebuilders in Houston, Texas, under the\u000a      auspices of the Gulen\u000a      Institute in September 2010.\u000a    In September 2012, a former student of Brewer's set up a charity in\u000a      Scotland called Enabling\u000a        Women to Engage in Peace Processes, acknowledging that this was due\u000a      to Brewer's work\u000a      on gender empowerment in peace processes.\u000a    Brewer and Hayes have also actively engaged with opinion leaders,\u000a      peace-builders, and the\u000a      public through online media [5.10]. They have a following of nearly 7,250\u000a      on their Twitter\u000a      account, @compromisestudy, which focuses on the role of compromise after\u000a      conflict.\u000a      Followers include politicians such as Northern Ireland's First Minister,\u000a      Peter Robinson,\u000a      members of every political party in the UK, international organisations\u000a      like the European\u000a      Union, NATO and the White House, social movements and victim rights\u000a      activists, and world\u000a      leaders like Nelson Mandela. In 2012, representatives of the Northern\u000a      Ireland Assembly\u000a      contacted Brewer for advice on victims legislation as a result of his\u000a      tweeting and other social\u000a      media comments. The corresponding `Compromise after Conflict' website had\u000a      nearly 8,000\u000a      hits in the 12-month period up to 1st July 2011 until 30th\u000a      June 2012, with 6,320 of those being\u000a      unique visitors. Hayes's work has been quoted on the website of\u000a      Presbyterian minister and\u000a      former politician Ivan Foster, on Worldsecuritynetwork.com, an\u000a      international foreign and\u000a      security policy network, and on Northern Ireland's highly regarded\u000a      political blog,\u000a      sluggerotoole.com (2008).

As\u000a      these conflicts have proliferated so too have international efforts to\u000a      resolve them via peace\u000a      agreements. A team based in the Department of Sociology at the University\u000a      of Aberdeen, led\u000a      by John Brewer (Professor of Sociology at Aberdeen 2004-13) and Bernadette\u000a      Hayes\u000a      (Professor of Sociology at Aberdeen since 2005), has built a\u000a      well-established reputation for\u000a      research in this area.\u000a    Much of the team's research has focused on the conflict in Northern\u000a      Ireland. In 2009, Hayes\u000a      and Ian McAllister (Professor of Political Science at Australian National\u000a      University) examined\u000a      the impact of segregated and integrated education in Northern Ireland on\u000a      attitudes towards\u000a      community relations among the adult population. The results suggested that\u000a      individuals who\u000a      had attended an integrated school were significantly more likely to have\u000a      friends and\u000a      neighbours from across the religious divide, and a more optimistic view of\u000a      future community\u000a      relations. [3.1]\u000a    Another study, jointly produced by Hayes and Lizanne Dowds of Access\u000a      Research\u000a      Knowledge (ARK) examined religious affiliation in Northern Ireland and how\u000a      it relates to\u000a      church attendance. Published in 2010, the research found that since the\u000a      early 1990s, weekly\u000a      church attendance has declined sharply, particularly among the Catholic\u000a      community, with\u000a      nominal adherence &#8212; i.e., having a religious affiliation without going to\u000a      church every week &#8212;\u000a      now the norm. This work was further developed in a monograph by Hayes and\u000a      McAllister\u000a      (2013) focusing on the role of religious affiliation in terms of the\u000a      socio-political dimensions of\u000a      the conflict over a 50-year period. [3.2]\u000a    Building on earlier work by Brewer (2010) pointing to the neglected\u000a      social dimension of\u000a      peace processes, including the rights of victims [3.3], a further study\u000a      (Brewer and Hayes,\u000a      2011) examined the relationship between conceptions of perpetrators and\u000a      victims. Using the\u000a      2004 Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey, Hayes and Brewer found that\u000a      those who claim\u000a      a victimhood status are notably more likely than others to identity the\u000a      `other side' as the\u000a      group mainly responsible for the conflict. As a result, Brewer and Hayes\u000a      suggest, it is\u000a      problematic to hold up victims as `moral beacons' in post-conflict\u000a      societies. [3.4]\u000a    Another study by Brewer et al. focused on the role of the churches in\u000a      peace building in\u000a      Northern Ireland. Based on a series of in-depth interviews conducted\u000a      between 1999 and\u000a      2002, the study points to the key role of churches in ameliorating the\u000a      conflict via facilitating\u000a      secret communications between politicians and paramilitary organizations.\u000a      [3.5]\u000a    A further study by Brewer et. al (2013) examined the religious outlooks\u000a      of ex-combatants in\u000a      Northern Ireland. Based on a series of interviews with 29 ex-combatants,\u000a      the study assessed\u000a      the role of religion in their transition from a military to a political\u000a      campaign. [3.6]\u000a      Supported by a grant from the Leverhulme Trust, the team is continuing to\u000a      broaden its\u000a      understanding of intra-state conflict through the `Compromise after\u000a      Conflict' project, which\u000a      investigates a range of societies emerging from conflict, such as South\u000a      Africa and Sri Lanka.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43471","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Research Councils UK"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This study was commissioned by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)\u000d\u000a      to feed directly into policy, training and practice. On the basis of our\u000d\u000a      research, we have brought about changes within DWP and Jobcentre Plus. The\u000d\u000a      following impacts can be highlighted:\u000d\u000a    4.1 Through regular presentations, Working Papers, and our final report,\u000d\u000a      our research substantially increased policymakers' understanding of a\u000d\u000a        key area &#8212; advisory interviews - over which they have policy control\u000d\u000a      (see 5.1, below). As a civil servant based in the Jobcentre Plus Strategic\u000d\u000a      Planning Division commented in June 2009 (see 5.2, below): \"Your papers\u000d\u000a        have proved very useful... as we develop our strategy story. I think\u000d\u000a        much of what your papers tell us is about how we approach and deal with\u000d\u000a        our future learning routeway. Our Learning and Development colleagues\u000d\u000a        will probably be adamant that they encourage open questioning as part of\u000d\u000a        their training techniques etc., but your research offers so much more\u000d\u000a        and I think we need to take that on board\".\u000d\u000a    This same civil servant (now a DWP manager for the Fraud National Account\u000d\u000a      Team) more recently commented that the study's impact has travelled beyond\u000d\u000a      its initial remit: \"The skills and experiences I picked up from [this]\u000d\u000a        work and the video evidence she [Toerien] shared from the joint\u000d\u000a        workshops we held, have helped me, four years later, to consider how I\u000d\u000a        can better equip my current team, who focus on interviews where benefit\u000d\u000a        fraud is the primary driver, to be more effective and successful in\u000d\u000a        asking the right questions and then responding to the customer in often\u000d\u000a        tense and demanding interview situations\" (April 2013).\u000d\u000a    The study's reach has also extended beyond its immediate users (in\u000d\u000a      Jobcentre Plus and DWP) to the Citizens' Advice Bureau (who cite our\u000d\u000a      research in their 2010 report, \"Fair welfare: supporting claimants into\u000d\u000a      work\") and to the senior committee advising Government on social security\u000d\u000a      policy - the Social Security Advisory Committee (SSAC). In March 2010, we\u000d\u000a      were invited to present our findings to SSAC, allowing them to see for the\u000d\u000a      first time how advisory interviews are actually conducted. Thanked by the\u000d\u000a      Chair for \"an open discussion with Members\", we showed clips from our\u000d\u000a      recordings which led the committee to reflect on how the interviews might\u000d\u000a      be improved. The meeting minutes can be provided for audit purposes (see\u000d\u000a      5.3, below).\u000d\u000a    The relevance of our research has continued to be recognised following\u000d\u000a      the 2010 change in Government and subsequent changes to the benefits\u000d\u000a      system. In March 2013, we were invited to present our findings at the Behaviour\u000a        Change and Adviser Effectiveness Workshop, organised by the DWP (see\u000d\u000a      5.1). There were over 200 attendees, including senior policymakers and\u000d\u000a      advisers. As a result, we have subsequently met with the Principal\u000d\u000a      Psychologist at the DWP, to consult on how our work might contribute to a\u000d\u000a      `behavioural framework' (still under development) for DWP at both policy\u000d\u000a      and delivery levels (see 5.2).\u000d\u000a    4.2 DWP's approach to evaluating advisory practices in Jobcentre Plus\u000d\u000a        has changed as a result of our study. This is evident in two\u000d\u000a      subsequent pieces of research. First, on the basis of our interim results,\u000d\u000a      DWP commissioned us to assess &#8212; using the same methodology &#8212; whether there\u000d\u000a      was evidence of age-based discrimination in advisory interviews (DWP\u000d\u000a      report no.634, HMSO; see 5.4). Second, citing our final report, an\u000d\u000a      evaluation by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills used our\u000d\u000a      criteria for assessing the effectiveness of adviser techniques and styles.\u000d\u000a      The evaluation was commissioned specifically to shape Government reforms\u000d\u000a      of the welfare-to-work programme (see 5.5).\u000d\u000a    4.3 The evidence base generated by our study has contributed directly\u000d\u000a        to policy changes concerning the content and conduct of advisory\u000d\u000a        interviews. This is evidenced by two announcements made in the\u000d\u000a      official DWP Press Releases (June 2010) for the main study report and the\u000d\u000a      related report on age-based discrimination (see 4.2, above). The former\u000d\u000a      states that: \"Since the research was conducted in 2007 and 2008,\u000d\u000a        Jobcentre Plus has introduced a range of materials for Advisers and\u000d\u000a        their Managers which draws on findings from the study\"\u000d\u000a      (see 5.6, below). The latter states that: \"As a result of this\u000d\u000a          research more training is being introduced to help\u000d\u000a        advisers understand the detailed issues faced by some people over the\u000d\u000a        age of 50\" (see 5.7, below). A senior civil servant based in the DWP\u000d\u000a      (Labour Market Strategy Unit) also noted that: \"The findings from this\u000d\u000a        research have already helped inform decision-making around the\u000d\u000a        moving\/removal of a claimant segmentation tool which was shown to be\u000d\u000a        impeding the Work Focused Interviews between advisers and some\u000d\u000a        claimants. Their research results have deepened our understanding of\u000d\u000a        what makes an effective adviser\" (April 2013, see 5.2). Since DWP\u000d\u000a      policy determines what advisers are expected to cover with claimants on\u000d\u000a      the frontline, such changes impact advisers' day- to-day practice and,\u000d\u000a      hence, the quality of support received by claimants.\u000d\u000a    4.4 Our findings have been translated directly into an evidence-based\u000d\u000a        training package for advisers. At the invitation of the DWP &#8212; and\u000d\u000a      part-funded by them &#8212; we held a two-day workshop at York in June 2013 (see\u000d\u000a      5.1). The workshop offered intensive, tailored, interactive training for\u000d\u000a      fifteen advisers with the goal of enabling them to implement our findings\u000d\u000a      effectively when talking with claimants. Feedback showed the value of\u000d\u000a      using recordings of real interviews in training: \"Brought home how much\u000d\u000a        we need to simplify communications instead of overloading claimant &#8212;\u000d\u000a        particularly at first interview\" (anonymous feedback from\u000d\u000a      participant). Run as a pilot for a forthcoming DWP-led randomised\u000d\u000a      controlled trial of different approaches to adviser training, this\u000d\u000a      workshop may be rolled out across Jobcentre Plus nationally (depending on\u000d\u000a      the results of the trial). A senior civil servant based in the DWP (Labour\u000d\u000a      Market Strategy Unit) noted: \"This research has had both impacts in the\u000d\u000a        immediate and potentially long term performance gains. We are now using\u000d\u000a        the results of this research to develop and test a CA informed adviser\u000d\u000a        training programme. The results of this research have the potential to\u000d\u000a        change the whole adviser training approach\" (April 2013, see 5.2).\u000d\u000a    In sum, our research has had a significant impact beyond academia, with\u000d\u000a      beneficiaries including those on the frontline (advisers), those expected\u000d\u000a      to obtain personalised support from advisers (claimants), those who manage\u000d\u000a      Jobcentre Plus and DWP, and those with responsibility for UK social\u000d\u000a      security policy. The evidence presented in this case study shows not only\u000d\u000a      impact to date, but the strong potential for ongoing impact, as our\u000d\u000a      findings continue to be used to improve the conduct of adviser-claimant\u000d\u000a      interviews in Jobcentre Plus.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The impact of this research has been achieved through developing\u000d\u000a      evidence-based recommendations for personal advisers in Jobcentre Plus &#8212;\u000d\u000a      the UK's one-stop service for administering state benefits and helping\u000d\u000a      claimants into work.

Drew is one of the most highly cited researchers in his\u000d\u000a      field and is renowned for his work on interaction in organisations. This\u000d\u000a      study built directly on his impressive track record, developed with\u000d\u000a      colleagues at York since the mid-1970s.\u000d\u000a    The focus for this study was adviser-claimant interviews conducted in\u000d\u000a      Jobcentre Plus, the aim of which is to help benefits claimants (where\u000d\u000a      possible) to progress towards employment. Civil servants at the DWP\u000d\u000a      believed there was a critical gap in the evidence available to\u000d\u000a      policymakers responsible for this interview system: although advisers are\u000d\u000a      considered central to the Government's goal of providing claimants with\u000d\u000a      personalised support, the interviews themselves have remained a `black\u000d\u000a      box'. Thus policy and, crucially, adviser training, have been derived from\u000d\u000a      theory rather than an evidence-based understanding of how these interviews\u000d\u000a      work in practice. We addressed this gap by conducting the first and only\u000d\u000a      study to collect video recordings of advisory interviews in situ\u000d\u000a      in Jobcentre Plus.\u000d\u000a    We recorded over 200 interviews, including, for comparative purposes, a\u000d\u000a      sample conducted by private sector advisers. The aim was to identify those\u000d\u000a      techniques used by advisers that were most effective in helping claimants\u000d\u000a      progress towards work. We used the fine-grained, highly specialised\u000d\u000a      methods of conversation analysis (CA) to examine not only what was said in\u000d\u000a      the recordings, but precisely how it was said. CA is a qualitative,\u000d\u000a      systematic and technical approach. Analysis involves comparing all\u000d\u000a      instances of key activities conducted in the recorded interactions in\u000d\u000a      order to identify patterns. For instance, we compared the ways in which\u000d\u000a      advisers asked lone parents about their work-related plans. Typically,\u000d\u000a      advisers asked if they were `looking for work at the moment'; but\u000d\u000a      sometimes they asked if they would be `looking for work in the future'.\u000a      By examining claimants' responses, we showed that the first form of words\u000d\u000a      routinely shut down the discussion (claimants simply said `no', since they\u000d\u000a      were not required to find work until their child was older). By contrast,\u000d\u000a      the second form of words routinely opened up discussion about steps that\u000d\u000a      claimants could take to prepare for work. This was far more effective,\u000d\u000a      then, for addressing the core aim of these interviews: to be work-focused.\u000d\u000a      Through this form of detailed, comparative analysis we showed that\u000d\u000a      advisers were most effective when they were &#8212; to put it in non-technical\u000d\u000a      terms &#8212; collaborative, directive, proactive, positive, and challenging in\u000d\u000a      their interactions with claimants. For each of these characteristics we\u000d\u000a      provided concrete examples showing how to enact them in practice and what\u000d\u000a      the typical consequences were for the unfolding interaction.\u000d\u000a    The study was innovative in two main ways. Through our focus on actual\u000d\u000a      practice, we:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000aAddressed the question of `what works' directly.\u000d\u000a        By contrast, previous research has relied almost exclusively on indirect\u000d\u000a        and retrospective evidence, including research interviews with claimants\u000d\u000a        and quantitative outcome measures (e.g. job entry). Such studies cannot\u000d\u000a        illuminate what is effective about the precise ways in which advisers\u000d\u000a        manage the interaction with claimants. Yet this is crucial, as it is the\u000d\u000a        only form of support over which advisers have direct control.\u000d\u000a      \u000aProduced effective practice recommendations that are concrete\u000a            and detailed, by showing, for example, the difference small\u000d\u000a        changes in wording can make. By contrast, other recommendations in this\u000d\u000a        area have tended to be very general, based on theories of communication\u000d\u000a        (e.g. ask `open questions'), rather than on specific evidence of what\u000d\u000a        works with claimants in practice.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43472","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Research Councils UK","Economic and Social Research Council","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Webster's research in the field of biomedicine has been impactful both in\u000a      terms of shaping practice and influencing policy in relation to\u000a      biobanking, stem cell research and regenerative medicine by ensuring that\u000a      a `sociological voice' has been heard. Examples of his impact in these\u000a      fields include the following:\u000a    4:1 Changing donation procedures to the UK Biobank.\u000a      Following on from recommendations in the report by Webster, Public\u000a        attitudes to third party access and benefit sharing (2008),\u000a      the UK Ethics and Governance Council (EGC) and UK Biobank introduced\u000a      significant changes to their practices. As a result of Webster's findings\u000a      on public concerns (see 2:1 above) the UK Biobank has since produced\u000a      regular biannual reports to the EGC describing their data management\u000a      practices and their security systems. UK Biobank also acted on Webster's\u000a      recommendation to give more information about its security measures. It\u000a      did so by requiring since 2008 that the EGC employ information security\u000a      systems in order to enhance its ability to advise on and monitor this\u000a      area. In addition, UK Biobank changed its recruitment information for\u000a      potential donors to help reassure participants about the scale, form and\u000a      robustness of the security of personal biodata. Furthermore, as a result\u000a      of Webster's findings about anxieties among donors that they may be\u000a      re-contacted by the bank some time after donation, the EGC recommended\u000a      that UK Biobank investigate this in a systematic survey of participants\u000a      once 500,000 participants had been recruited. Webster's research has\u000a      therefore underpinned significant changes in practice that have been of\u000a      value to both the bank and to donors and potential donors in terms of\u000a      managing expectations and concerns.\u000a    4:2 Influencing regulatory decisions made by the UK Stem Cell\u000a        Bank Steering Committee (UKSCBSC). Since 2008 Webster has been on\u000a      the government's UKSCBSC, responsible for agreeing the deposit of and\u000a      access to banked cell lines by researchers. Underpinned by his research\u000a      (see 2.3 above) Webster has made a significant contribution to Committee's\u000a      decisions on, for example, regulation and intellectual property rights\u000a      involving UK and international cases. For example, in February 2011, he\u000a      was one of three members of the UKSCBSC responsible for meeting with\u000a      representatives of the Bio-Industry Association's Cell Therapy and\u000a      RegenMed Advisory Committee who were pressing for a change in the\u000a      intellectual property rights of firms. Webster and colleagues advised\u000a      against these demands for change because of concerns that this would\u000a      restrict public access to stem cell lines for research purposes and reduce\u000a      scope for innovation, a position adopted by the UKSCBSC.\u000a    4:3 Contributing to regulatory practices associated with\u000a        clinical trial design and adoption. As a result of his directorship\u000a      of the ESRC Stem Cell Initiative research programme, and his own related\u000a      research into regulatory issues associated with clinical trials (see 2:2\u000a      above), Webster was invited in 2012 to join a Ministerial Industry\u000a      Strategy Group (MISG) established by Sir Alasdair Breckenridge (Chair of\u000a      the Government's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency).\u000a      Webster led the Socio-Economic and Policy Perspective strand at the MISG\u000a      workshop which examined the regulatory framework of the stem cell therapy\u000a      field. He also co-authored the MISG report, Regenerative Medicine\u000a        Regulatory Workshop (2012). This report contributed to the UK\u000a      Regenerative Medicine Community's evidence to the House of Lords, Science\u000a      and Technology Committee's Regenerative Medicine inquiry (July\u000a      2013), which drew on Webster's work on the adoption of stem cell therapies\u000a      through `institutional readiness' and the need to rethink the\u000a      epistemological assumptions of trialling (p. 1). This finding informed the\u000a      Group's recommendation that the full potential of the NHS to support\u000a      regenerative medicine needed to be released, for example, through the NHS\u000a      National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) being more receptive to\u000a      non-conventional forms of data and evidence. This is important in this\u000a      context because processes of standardisation using conventional clinical\u000a      trials do not apply for research dealing with live tissue. This was\u000a      reflected in the House of Lords' report in the recommendation that the\u000a      NIHR should create a regenerative medicine stream of its clinical research\u000a      network to address `the specific needs of regenerative medicine clinical\u000a      trial design' (paragraph 89).\u000a    4:4 Informing the UK government's investment strategy in\u000a        regenerative medicine. Data and findings from the REMEDiE project\u000a      (see 2.3 above) mapped the current activity in the field across Europe to\u000a      identify the scope for the commercial development of regenerative\u000a      medicine. The sociological research has illuminated the strategic\u000a      challenges and choices that commercial companies face in relation to\u000a      regulation when making decisions about future investments. This work has\u000a      been directly drawn upon by the House of Lords' Regenerative Medicine\u000a      inquiry (July 2013) and the Department for Business, Innovation and\u000a      Science's (BIS) report Taking Stock of Regenerative Medicine in the\u000a        United Kingdom (July, 2011). In particular the project\u000a      underpinned the report's development of an integrated `national strategy\u000a      focussing on improving the delivery, infrastructure, regulation and uptake\u000a      of cell therapy and regenerative medicine' (p. 45). This is being advanced\u000a      through the government's investment strategy by the Technology Strategy\u000a      Board's (TSB) Cell Therapy Catapult (www.catapult.org.uk),\u000a      established in 2012 to bring together businesses, scientists and engineers\u000a      to transform ideas into products and services to generate economic growth.\u000a    The REMEDiE report (http:\/\/www.york.ac.uk\/satsu\/remedie\/reports\/)\u000a      has also been utilised in the subsequent development of regenerative\u000a      medicine strategy in the UK. Based on his research expertise, Webster was\u000a      invited to become a member of the Research Councils UK's (RCUK) Key\u000a      Opinion Leaders group during 2011, with a Senior Scientific Officer at the\u000a      MRC commenting that the REMEDiE report provided `an excellent\u000a        foundation for many of the issues we need to consider under the Forward\u000a        Look exercise'. This group met at a workshop to identify the future\u000a      priorities for regenerative medicine research and development, taking into\u000a      account current activities, opportunities, and scientific, clinical and\u000a      commercial relevance.\u000a    This exercise led to the RCUK\/TSB's A Strategy for UK Regenerative\u000a        Medicine 2012. Webster drafted the specific social science\u000a      components that problematize conventional trial design (see 2:2 above) and\u000a      regulatory pathways that are now in the document (p. 17). Commenting on\u000a      Webster's contribution to the strategic plan for regenerative medicine, a\u000a      Senior Scientific Officer of the ESRC has said: \"This [social science\u000a        input into the Strategy for UK Regenerative Medicine] was always going\u000a        to be tough, because social science was seen as a `small player' in a\u000a        field of voluble and powerful big clinical and biological players.\u000a        However, Andrew managed to get key aspects of social science included in\u000a        the policy document. This was facilitated by his ability to provide\u000a        inputs in a way that policy makers can actually use... I then asked him\u000a        to take forward one of the outputs of the strategy, a workshop in an\u000a        area of social science interest, thus his contribution spanned right\u000a        though from drafting the strategy through to practical implementation of\u000a        aspects of it.\"\u000a    In 2013 Webster's work in this field was sufficiently well recognised for\u000a      him to be invited to organise a House of Commons Workshop on regenerative\u000a      medicine for the All-Party Parliamentary Group of MPs for Social Science\u000a      and Policy in order to a) demonstrate how social science can engage with\u000a      complex bioscience issues and b) to inform MPs of future challenges,\u000a      especially in regard to clinical trials evidence, design and patients'\u000a      long-term safety.\u000a    In summary, Webster's long standing engagement in a range of policy fora\u000a      has ensured that those involved in the regulation of, and investment in,\u000a      new biotechnologies take into account the wider socio-political processes\u000a      which shape their emergence and are sensitive to the implications of their\u000a      use in practice.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Andrew Webster's sociological research on developments in\u000a      biomedical science has been impactful in shaping regulatory practice and\u000a      influencing policy in relation to biobanking, stem cell research and\u000a      regenerative medicine.

The research has focused on\u000a      the emergence of biomedical technologies related to biobanking, stem cells\u000a      and regenerative medicine. Professor Webster has been at York since 1999.\u000a    2:1 Between 2006-8 Webster was contracted by the Wellcome Trust,\u000a      acting on behalf of UK Biobank and its Ethics and Governance Council\u000a      (EGC), to undertake primary research to examine public attitudes towards\u000a      third party access to the bank. The findings showed that potential donors\u000a      to biobanks have concerns over security of information. Another concern\u000a      expressed by potential donors was the possibility that they might be\u000a      contacted in the future by the biobank once they had deposited their\u000a      samples. They thought that any re-contact would probably be an indication\u000a      of ill health or increased risk of disease.\u000a    2:2 Between 2005-9 Webster directed the Economic and Social\u000a      Research Council's (ESRC) Stem Cell Initiative, a &#163;3.5m research programme\u000a      that examined the social, regulatory and bioethical aspects of this\u000a      emerging field. Working in collaboration with stem cell scientists (based\u000a      at the University of Sheffield), Webster's own research project focussed\u000a      on the scientific and regulatory problems associated with managing live\u000a      tissue, and explored how this would impact on stabilising evidence which\u000a      is an essential prerequisite for undertaking clinical trials. This work\u000a      showed how standardisation of cell batches is especially pertinent to\u000a      phase III trials, when variation in cell behaviour must be shown to be\u000a      within tolerable limits across multiple clinical sites in order to gain\u000a      regulatory approval. These findings had implications for clinical trial\u000a      design and showed how trials might usefully be redesigned in order to\u000a      incorporate non-trial evidence from hospital treatment. The research also\u000a      raised important issues for patient safety and pointed to the need for new\u000a      models of monitoring clinical trials.\u000a    2:3 In 2008-11, following up on the stem cell work, Webster was PI\u000a      for a European Commission social science project on regenerative medicine\u000a      (REMEDiE) that examined the socio-economic processes in the translation\u000a      from lab to product, including intellectual property rights and business\u000a      models. Three clinical and commercial models were identified that\u000a      illuminated the strategic choices made by organisations in the wider\u000a      context of regulatory environments: (1) a `cells as drugs model', which\u000a      adopts the pharmaceutical industry business model and involves the\u000a      development of a standardized protocol that can be used as a therapy\u000a      across a larger number of patients, and which is therefore potentially of\u000a      greater commercial interest and, via economies of scale, available at a\u000a      lower delivery cost to health services; (2) a `service clinic model' in\u000a      which cell therapies using autologous cell treatments are used on a\u000a      patient-by-patient basis (this approach is akin to the way in which IVF\u000a      clinics operate) and (3) a `repository model' that depends on the use of\u000a      cell storage (cryopreservation) for ready access for patients where a good\u000a      match can be found (here the key to successful clinical outcomes and\u000a      quality of life has been longer term follow up with patients by both\u000a      clinicians and the suppliers). These models of translation from lab to\u000a      product have informed the UK's investment strategy into regenerative\u000a      medicine (see 4:4 below).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43473","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The accumulated understanding and knowledge generated by the research has\u000a      resulted in four broad areas of impact, with the overall aim of\u000a      transforming and informing policy and practice, for a variety of different\u000a      stakeholders, while stimulating an informed public debate.\u000a    A. Care standards and challenging neglect\u000a    An aim of these inter-related impacts &#8212; informed by the research projects\u000a      on faith, on education and the SHIFT Triala,b,c - was to\u000a      establish good, evidence-based practice, accessible to those working in\u000a      health and social care; and to challenge the neglect of sickle cell and\u000a      thalassaemia, while ensuring policy was connected with broader\u000a      (theoretical) debates about choice, preference and identity.\u000a    \u000a      Several impacts challenged the neglect of sickle cell and thalassaemia\u000a        among mainstream service providers working in health and social care,\u000a        while encouraging practitioners to adapt evidence based practice.\u000a        Impacts aimed at generating debate include a fact sheet for the Race\u000a        Equality Foundation (1); an editorial for the National Institute of\u000a        Health Library, in celebration of National Sickle Cell month (2009); and\u000a        an evidence based briefing paper for the National Children's Bureau (No:\u000a        246).\u000a      Atkin was invited to produce a report for the All Party Parliamentary\u000a        Committee on Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia Disorders (chaired by Diane\u000a        Abbott, MP) on the care available to those with sickle cell and\u000a        thalassaemia disorders (2). This informed several parliamentary\u000a        questions and a debate in the House of Lords, initiated by Lady Benjamin\u000a        on sickle cell disorders, in which Atkin was invited to contribute ideas\u000a        to her speech (3). Such activities raised the public profile of the\u000a        conditions.\u000a      Atkin was invited by the Department of Health to become a contributing\u000a        editor to the UK's Standards of Care of Adults with Sickle Cell\u000a        Disorders (4). In addition to advising on the whole document, he\u000a        specifically drafted the chapter on social care. The book offers\u000a        evidence-based advice to health care professionals and commissioners,\u000a        providing a benchmark against which NHS care for SCD and thalassaemia\u000a        should be judged. This document was endorsed by the UK Forum on\u000a        Haemoglobin Disorders, who recommended that it should inform standard\u000a        operating practice for those professionals offering haematological care\u000a        in the NHS.\u000a      During September 2011, Atkin was invited to a closed workshop\u000a        organised by the Dutch Ministry of Health to advise civil servants,\u000a        senior service managers and policy makers on screening policy. This was\u000a        followed up by a symposium, (Testen op HbP Dragerschap vor en tijdens de\u000a        zwangerschap een kwestie van etniciteit) held at Radbound University\u000a        (Nijmegen) in November 2012, to encourage debate among key health care\u000a        managers on how best to offer ante-natal screening in multi-cultural\u000a        societies. Atkin was invited to give the opening talk.\u000a    \u000a    B. Public outreach and raising awareness\u000a    Informed reproductive choice relies on a well-informed `at-risk'\u000a      population. Using insights gained from his programme of research,a,b,d,e\u000a        Atkin has influenced and challenged national policy on screening,\u000a      through his position as Chair of Public Outreach, for the (NHS) National\u000a      Screening Committee for Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia; and as member of the\u000a      advisory group for National NHS Audit of New-born Outcomes (5). Under his\u000a      guidance, the Committee has: established 12 peer educators, working\u000a      throughout England to raise awareness of sickle cell and thalassaemia\u000a      among at-risk communities. To date these peer educators have provided\u000a      face-to-face information to over 1000 people from at-risk communities, who\u000a      in turn have cascaded information through their social networks. Other\u000a      activities include production of a DVD (The Family Legacy) aimed at\u000a      African communities (6), who had been previously neglected by screening\u000a      policies. Community screening and repeated plays on local cable television\u000a      in London (Ghana TV) suggest the DVD has reached 300,000 people (6). The\u000a      Director of Communications of the NHS Screening Programme (Sickle Cell and\u000a      Thalassaemia) Committee wrote: `I would like to thank you in the\u000a        warmest possible terms for everything you have done to support the\u000a        outreach work. You have been an outstanding source of wisdom and\u000a        knowledge and I cannot say how much I have appreciated this'.\u000a    Since 2008, Atkin has been advising NHS Wales on the re-organising of\u000a      screening services. His input, based on the research cited abovea,b,d,e\u000a        has included ensuring any proposed changes in service provision\u000a      are evidenced-based (e.g. the Health Impact Assessment of the proposed\u000a      accommodation changes to the Cardiff Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia Centre\u000a      by Susan Toner: March 2011, which Atkin helped draft). He also worked with\u000a      `Cardiff Friends of Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia' to ensure any changes to\u000a      provision took account of the views of the local community. This included\u000a      co-ordinating and participating in a community conference, Community\u000a        Spirit in Crisis (November 2012), in which 60 lay participants along\u000a      with representatives from commissioners debated proposed changes. An\u000a      outcome was to prevent the closure of a community screening centre in\u000a      Cardiff and its removal to a more impersonal local hospital, which was\u000a      opposed by the community. The conference organiser and community\u000a      development worker for the `Cardiff Friends of Sickle Cell and\u000a      Thalassaemia', said: `Thank you so much for your support...[You have]\u000a        inspired and motivated us, the support group to continue to strive for\u000a        equity of services for Sickle Cell &amp; Thalassaemia patients, carers,\u000a        and at risk communities'.\u000a    The Secretary of State for Health (December 2011) initiated a\u000a      consultation exercise on the re-organisation of screening services in\u000a      England. He requested advice from all the directors of specialist\u000a      screening programmes (such as sickle cell and thalassaemia) on a\u000a      confidential consultation document. The Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia\u000a      Programme Director sought advice of Atkin and used part of his written\u000a      response (informed by the research outlined above) in her evidence to the\u000a      Secretary of State for Health.\u000a    C. Government policy on screening and supporting informed choice\u000a    In 2012, as Chair of Public Outreach, Atkin has used his research on\u000a      faith, involving fathers in ante-natal care and the social consequences of\u000a      being a trait carrier to help draft nationallya,b,d,e\u000a      available, NHS published leaflets for informing `at-risk' communities (7)\u000a      including: an introduction to screening aimed at-risk parents; more\u000a      detailed leaflets outlining the screening process to parents at risk of a\u000a      range of haemoglobinopathies; and a leaflet providing advice to fathers on\u000a      ante-natal screening. These leaflets have been circulated to all primary\u000a      health care professionals in England, with a letter of recommendation from\u000a      the Sickle cell and Thalassaemia Programme Director, explaining their use.\u000a      Atkin's researcha,b,d,e informed the content and style of\u000a      these leaflets. His research also provided evidence on how best to present\u000a      accessible messages, consistent with how individuals make sense of their\u000a      health, in a way that can help them make choices, commensurate with their\u000a      own values and beliefs. The aim was to raise awareness among at-risk\u000a      communities and practitioners, while providing reliable and accurate\u000a      information, thereby facilitating informed choice.\u000a    The widely published SHIFT studyb was the first in the UK to\u000a      provide evidence that current screening targets set by the Department of\u000a      Health are not being met. This challenged policy thinking and informed the\u000a      need for the leaflets outlined above. A letter written by the Sickle Cell\u000a      and Thalassaemia Programme Director also drew the findings to the\u000a      attention of commissioners. It initiated a more pro-active engagement with\u000a      fathers on the part of the Public Outreach Committee, led by Atkin (see\u000a      above). The research also led to the establishment of a national audit on\u000a      new-born outcomes, which will run for three years (2012 to 2015). The\u000a      findings aimed at national policy makers and local health care\u000a      commissioners will inform policy by identifying bottlenecks in the\u000a      screening process and suggesting solutions to overcome them. Atkin was\u000a      invited to join the project steering group to provide independent advice\u000a      on governance.\u000a    D.

Over 17,000 have the conditions making them the most common\u000a      recessive disorders in the UK. There are over 0.5m carriers.\u000a    The research was undertaken between 2005 and 2013 by Atkin (Senior\u000a      Lecturer\/Professor) as either principal investigator (PI) or\u000a      co-investigator (CI), whilst at the University of York. As PI he led\u000a      projects investigating screening policies (and their implementation). As\u000a      CI he was involved in projects that examined school education for people\u000a      affected by sickle cell and thalassaemia. He contributed to the\u000a      preparation of bids, analysis of research data, liaison with stakeholders,\u000a      preparation of publications, and other dissemination materials and impact\u000a      activities with practitioners and policy makers.\u000a    A qualitative project, (2004-2006, Atkin PI, Decision making and\u000a        antenatal screening: to what extent do faith and religious identity\u000a        mediate choice?) interviewed young people, who were thinking about\u000a      starting a family, to find out how faith would influence decisions about\u000a      ante-natal screening (funder: National (NHS) Screening Committee)a.\u000a      The project began at the University of Leeds, with analysis and\u000a      dissemination completed while Atkin was at York (2005\/6). Faith is often\u000a      assumed by policy makers and health practitioners to be a major factor in\u000a      explaining why people refuse ante-natal screening. The research provided a\u000a      more nuanced account1,2 whereby faith beliefs emerged as\u000a      negotiable and did not determine choices. When making decisions, people\u000a      used individually derived interpretations of their faith, alongside\u000a      perceptions about the severity of the condition.\u000a    Atkin was CI and was involved in all aspects of the research on, Education\u000a        for Minority Ethnic Pupils: Young People and Sickle Cell Disease (SCD),\u000a      led by Simon Dyson (De Montfort University), 2005-2011 funded by the ESRCc.\u000a      The project sought the perspectives of children, their parents, teachers\u000a      and policy makers on how best to improve the educational experience of\u000a      those with SCD, by using questionnaires, interviews and focus group\u000a      discussions. The findings demonstrated the difficulties faced by pupils\u000a      and parents in convincing teachers (and Local Education Authorities) to\u000a      take SCD seriously3,5. Few schools had formal policies and good\u000a      practice was the exception rather than the rule. This research concluded\u000a      that pupils with SCD, faced disadvantage when at school, which affected\u000a      their later life chances.\u000a    A randomised control trial led by Theresa Marteau (Kings College, London;\u000a      2005-2010) explored the feasibility of offering ante-natal screening in\u000a      primary care by comparing it to secondary care (The SHIFT Trial)b.\u000a      As CI Atkin (with Mike Calnan) was responsible for the qualitative\u000a      component of the study, which explored the views of pregnant women and\u000a      practitioners4,6. The study showed how Department of Health\u000a      ante-natal screening targets were not being met (27% of women were\u000a      screened within 10 weeks of gestation, compared to the target of 90%), but\u000a      established the effectiveness, acceptability and feasibility of offering\u000a      screening in primary care, from the viewpoint of both practitioners and\u000a      mothers.\u000a    The SHIFT Trial suggested fathers were rarely screened during ante-natal\u000a      screening. Little was known about why. In January 2011, Atkin (PI) secured\u000a      NIHR funding to explore prospective fathers' attitudes to ante-natal\u000a      screening (end date: April 2014)d. Atkin (PI) also secured ESRC\u000a      funding (Jan 2011 to April 2014)e, to explore how people feel\u000a      about being a `healthy' trait carrier; an important area of research since\u000a      screening policies are identifying more carriers than ever before.\u000a      Preliminary findings from these projects have begun to inform policy (see\u000a      below).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43498","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3686110","Name":"Colombia"},{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research carried out by Papadopoulos, especially the development of\u000d\u000a      the Trauma Grid and ASPIS, has had impact throughout the world.\u000d\u000a      Papadopoulos has provided training and influenced the practice of\u000d\u000a      organisations that work with asylum seekers and refugees in the UK,\u000d\u000a      Greece, Sudan, and Colombia.\u000d\u000a    Impact in Europe\u000d\u000a    Refugee Council\u000d\u000a    Papadopoulos has worked with the Refugee Council's Therapeutic Casework\u000d\u000a      Unit (TCU) since 2011 and a Cooperation Agreement was signed between the\u000d\u000a      Refugee Council and the University of Essex in 2013 [corroborating source\u000d\u000a      1].

This was part of the process of information gathering for the\u000d\u000a      RVA project, which focuses on the response to vulnerable asylum seekers in\u000d\u000a      Central Europe. The research conducted by the UNHCR as part of the RVA\u000d\u000a      project found that the ASPIS tool developed by Papadopoulos had been\u000d\u000a      adopted by two organisations in the UK that work with asylum seekers [3]:\u000d\u000a      the Scottish Refugee Council and Asylum Link Merseyside.

Papadopoulos has provided\u000d\u000a      ongoing supervision and consultation to Babel and was twice (in May 2012\u000d\u000a      and April 2013) invited to Greece to provide training &#8212; this involved 25\u000d\u000a      members of Babel staff and 70 participants from other organisations [5].\u000d\u000a      Babel's Director has stated that \"the impact of Professor Papadopoulos'\u000d\u000a      work has been decisive on the way Babel operates. The therapeutic approach\u000d\u000a      we follow (and the one we train others to follow) is based on Professor\u000d\u000a      Papadopoulos' `Trauma Grid' and ASPIS, both from the EVASP research\u000d\u000a      project\" [5]. Babel have used Papadopoulos' approach to train staff in\u000d\u000a      other partner organisations (including KETHEA-Mosaic, Medical\u000d\u000a      Intervention, and Arsis) and have drawn on the EVASP trainers' manual to\u000d\u000a      do so, which they have translated into Greek [5].\u000d\u000a    Global impact\u000d\u000a    Unidad para las V&#237;ctimas, Colombia\u000d\u000a    The Unidad para las V&#237;ctimas is a Bogota-based government agency that\u000d\u000a      works with the victims of the internal armed conflict in Colombia.\u000d\u000a      Papadopoulos visited the newly-established Unidad in August 2012 and gave\u000d\u000a      a series of seminars to members of staff who were in the process of\u000d\u000a      defining the guidelines for its programmes and policies [6]. His visit had\u000d\u000a      two major impacts. Firstly, in working with the Psychosocial Group at the\u000d\u000a      Unidad he shed new light on the concept of victim. The Director of the\u000d\u000a      Unidad writes,\u000d\u000a    \"His work made us rethink the way in which we were conceiving of victims.\u000d\u000a      We learnt they are not&#8212;and cannot be&#8212;passive individuals in their own\u000d\u000a      rights restitution processes. On the contrary, as active agents, the\u000d\u000a      empowerment derived from the victims' actions creates capacities for the\u000d\u000a      individuals and for the community as a whole. These capacities allow\u000d\u000a      victims to take hold of their own reparation processes and make them\u000d\u000a      sustainable over time\" [6].\u000d\u000a    The second main impact of Papadopoulos' visit was to prepare the\u000d\u000a      facilitators that would go on to provide a training programme in\u000d\u000a      psycho-social skills for 300 staff from Unidad and other similar\u000d\u000a      institutions.

He has also developed new instruments to assess the\u000d\u000a      vulnerability of asylum seekers. Papadopoulos' research is premised on the\u000d\u000a      insight that in understanding trauma the person must not be overlooked and\u000d\u000a      treated simply as a product of the trauma. Instead of over-emphasising the\u000d\u000a      trauma, his approach is to consider the whole person, including his\/her\u000d\u000a      strengths and potential.\u000d\u000a    The research developed the concept of `Nostalgic Disorientation'\u000d\u000a      (Papadopoulos, 2002) as a generic (non-psychiatric) condition that asylum\u000d\u000a      seekers develop. It is defined as disorientation that activates the\u000d\u000a      yearning for one specific and tangible state of home and belonging. The\u000d\u000a      research also introduced a specific definition of `Resilience', which\u000d\u000a      refers to the individual's ability to maintain his\/her existing qualities,\u000d\u000a      despite the experience of trauma (Papadopoulos, 2007). Papadopoulos' key\u000d\u000a      research finding is that vulnerability of refugees cannot be understood as\u000d\u000a      an absolute but depends entirely on the given environment, especially the\u000d\u000a      services that are available. For example, a refugee with a disability is\u000d\u000a      not vulnerable because of the disability per se, but may become vulnerable\u000d\u000a      if his\/her disability restricts his\/her opportunities.\u000d\u000a    Papadopoulos' ideas were operationalised through his development of an\u000d\u000a      instrument to assess vulnerability, the Trauma Grid (Papadopoulos, 2007).\u000d\u000a      This provides a comprehensive framework to map out the wide range of\u000d\u000a      refugees' responses to adversity that includes not only the pathological\u000d\u000a      but also positive ones. The unique aspect of this approach is that the\u000d\u000a      existing strengths of the individual are taken into account, and it also,\u000d\u000a      more controversially, considers Adversity Activated Development where it\u000d\u000a      is acknowledged that exposure to adversity may have positive effects for\u000d\u000a      the individual.\u000d\u000a    The need to measure vulnerability was demonstrated by the 2007 European\u000d\u000a      Commission Green Paper on the Future Common European Asylum System,\u000d\u000a      which, inter alia, stressed the need for Member States to have\u000d\u000a      procedures in place to identify vulnerable asylum seekers. Following the\u000d\u000a      Green Paper, Professor Papadopoulos was approached by the International\u000d\u000a      Organisation for Migration (IOM) and asked to lead a four-country project\u000d\u000a      to address the issue of defining vulnerability in asylum seekers:\u000d\u000a      Enhancing Vulnerable Asylum Seekers' Protection (EVASP). Their request was\u000d\u000a      based on their familiarity with his research, including the Trauma Grid.\u000d\u000a      As part of the EVASP project, Papadopoulos produced an EVASP Trainers'\u000d\u000a      Handbook to be used by any suitably qualified individual. The aim of this\u000d\u000a      manual is to equip facilitators with the appropriate knowledge and\u000d\u000a      techniques for providing training to organisations that provide services\u000d\u000a      for vulnerable asylum seekers.\u000d\u000a    Papadopoulos thus engaged in further research as part of the EVASP\u000d\u000a      project, which involved drawing on his theoretical ideas in order to meet\u000d\u000a      the specific task of producing further tools for assessing vulnerability\u000d\u000a      that could be employed in the field and be used by various organisations\u000d\u000a      and agencies working with refugees. This led him to develop the Asylum\u000d\u000a      Seekers Protection Indices (ASPIS), which constitute a comprehensive means\u000d\u000a      of assessing vulnerability by addressing various facets of the\u000d\u000a      individual's life. Ten dimensions are used in order to indicate the\u000d\u000a      vulnerable position of the individual in regard to the environment that he\u000d\u000a      or she inhabits; however, positive factors of each dimension are included\u000d\u000a      alongside these vulnerable positions. The ultimate purpose of this is the\u000d\u000a      protection of the individual.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43501","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact detailed here focuses on the use of BHPS data by government\u000d\u000a      departments and third-sector\u000d\u000a      organisations, either internally or through commissioned reports from 2008\u000d\u000a      onwards.

The statistics\u000d\u000a      and commentary give an\u000d\u000a      insight into the standard of living of the household population in the\u000d\u000a      United Kingdom, focusing on\u000d\u000a      the lower part of income distribution.\u000d\u000a    A lower level of children in persistent poverty is one of four targets in\u000d\u000a      the Child Poverty Act 2010.\u000d\u000a      Although the Act does not make explicit reference to the BHPS it\u000d\u000a      stipulates that the necessary\u000d\u000a      statistical surveys must be used to assess whether the targets are being\u000d\u000a      met &#8212; in the case of\u000d\u000a      persistent poverty the Act stipulates that this must come into force\u000d\u000a      before 2015 [corroborating\u000d\u000a      source 2]. Given the DWP's use of BHPS data to measure persistent poverty\u000d\u000a      rates, it is reasonable\u000d\u000a      to assume that the BHPS constitutes one of the statistical surveys\u000d\u000a      necessary to assess whether\u000d\u000a      the government is meeting this target. Indeed, the current government's\u000d\u000a      Child Poverty Strategy\u000d\u000a      also makes use of BHPS data and explicitly identifies the role for\u000d\u000a      Understanding Society as an\u000d\u000a      indicator for persistent poverty in Annex A [3]. The document also states\u000d\u000a      in paragraph 5.12 that\u000d\u000a      \"We will explore the potential of using longitudinal studies to better\u000d\u000a      capture those who are living in\u000d\u000a      sustained severe poverty (in particular the large scale Understanding\u000d\u000a      Society study)\" as well as\u000d\u000a      making numerous references to BHPS findings [3].\u000d\u000a    The BHPS data that the DWP uses to measure persistent poverty is also\u000d\u000a      used by the Scottish\u000d\u000a      Government in figures on the percentage of children, working-age adults,\u000d\u000a      and pensioners\u000d\u000a      experiencing persistent poverty in Scotland. This measure of persistent\u000d\u000a      poverty was introduced in\u000d\u000a      chapter 4 of the Poverty and income inequality in Scotland: 2009-10\u000d\u000a      report published in 2011 [4].\u000d\u000a      These statistics are used to monitor progress towards Scottish Government\u000d\u000a      targets to reduce\u000d\u000a      poverty and income inequality.\u000d\u000a    The DWP submitted evidence that used BHPS-generated statistics on\u000d\u000a      persistent poverty in\u000d\u000a      pensioners to the 2009 Work and Pensions Committee report Tackling\u000d\u000a        Pensioner Poverty. This\u000d\u000a      evidence relies on BHPS-derived figures on the percentage of pensioners\u000d\u000a      with income 60% below\u000d\u000a      median income in at least three out of four years [5]. BHPS data are also\u000d\u000a      used in Pensim2, the\u000d\u000a      Department's model for simulating the effects of different pension\u000d\u000a      policies. For instance, BHPS\u000d\u000a      figures are used in estimating earnings when modelling future payments to\u000d\u000a      pensioners under\u000d\u000a      different schemes [6]. Trevor Huddlestone, Chief Analyst at the DWP, in a\u000d\u000a      House of Lords Select\u000d\u000a      Committee stated that Pensim2 \"models the life course. In order to do that\u000d\u000a      you need to have the\u000d\u000a      right data and we did have the right data and the right computer power\"\u000d\u000a      [7].\u000d\u000a    The use of BHPS data by other government departments\u000d\u000a    The use of BHPS data has become routine in UK Government departments\u000d\u000a      beyond the DWP and\u000d\u000a      in the period since 2008 we have identified uses by various departments,\u000d\u000a      including HM Revenue\u000d\u000a      and Customs, Department of Business, Innovation and Skills, Department for\u000d\u000a      Education,\u000d\u000a      Department of Health, Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and\u000d\u000a      Department for Communities\u000d\u000a      and Local Government.\u000d\u000a    BHPS-based research has been used by the Cabinet Office and Department\u000d\u000a      for Children Schools\u000d\u000a      and Families in identification of key issues for the development of family\u000d\u000a      policy, especially around\u000d\u000a      the issues of family and family breakdown and the implications for\u000d\u000a      children. BHPS data used in the\u000d\u000a      research underpins the 2008 evidence paper, Families in Britain\u000d\u000a      [8].\u000d\u000a    BHPS findings have been regularly used to inform strategy papers. For\u000d\u000a      instance, the Cabinet\u000d\u000a      Office's 2008 discussion paper on social mobility, Getting on, getting\u000d\u000a        ahead, uses BHPS data in its\u000d\u000a      analysis of opportunities to progress in the workplace [9]. BHPS data is\u000d\u000a      also used to inform\u000d\u000a      Scottish Government strategy and, for instance has informed a paper on the\u000d\u000a      implications of\u000d\u000a      changing household formation on housing policy [10].\u000d\u000a    The use of BHPS data within the third sector\u000d\u000a    The BHPS is used by policy and third-sector organisations for policy\u000d\u000a      evaluation and development.\u000d\u000a      This includes for example, the Low Pay Commission, Institute for Public\u000d\u000a      Policy Research, Equality\u000d\u000a      and Human Rights Commission, Fawcett Society, The National Young\u000d\u000a      Volunteers Service, Centre\u000d\u000a      for Social Justice, The Children's Society, National Council for One\u000d\u000a      Parent Families, Financial\u000d\u000a      Services Authority, and Age UK.\u000d\u000a    BHPS findings are regularly cited by third-sector organisations in their\u000d\u000a      submissions to House of\u000d\u000a      Commons committees. For example, the Resolution Foundation used BHPS data\u000d\u000a      to establish the\u000d\u000a      profile of low earners in evidence submitted to the Treasury Committee's\u000d\u000a      2008 report, Budget\u000d\u000a        measures and low-income households [11]. BHPS data has been used to\u000d\u000a      inform policy reports by\u000d\u000a      organisations such as the Centre for Social Justice on family breakdown\u000d\u000a      [12] and the Children's\u000d\u000a      Society on relationships between fathers and children [13].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The British Household Panel Study (BHPS) is a longitudinal survey that\u000d\u000a      has followed a\u000d\u000a      representative sample of individuals since the early 1990s. The resource\u000d\u000a      is used routinely by\u000d\u000a      government departments (e.g. DWP, HMRC, Cabinet Office) and third-sector\u000d\u000a      bodies (e.g.\u000d\u000a      Children's Society) for their research and for monitoring progress towards\u000d\u000a      policy targets.

The collection of\u000d\u000a      longitudinal data at annual\u000d\u000a      intervals from the set of individuals within the sample was designed to\u000d\u000a      support a wide range of\u000d\u000a      research on persistence of various states (e.g. low income and\u000d\u000a      unemployment) and on the factors\u000d\u000a      associated with transitions in and out of these states.\u000d\u000a    Input into the design of the study came from social scientists who were\u000d\u000a      themselves undertaking\u000d\u000a      high-quality research across a wide range of disciplines, in order to\u000d\u000a      ensure that it could contribute\u000d\u000a      to research in, for example, economics, sociology, demography, psychology,\u000d\u000a      geography, and\u000d\u000a      epidemiology. The case for refunding at each round was greatly\u000d\u000a      strengthened by earlier policy\u000d\u000a      uses, and a number of government departments contributed to the study\u000d\u000a      design on an ongoing\u000d\u000a      basis.\u000d\u000a    The BHPS was established to meet the need for high-quality longitudinal\u000d\u000a      data suitable for the\u000d\u000a      analysis of both the short and long-term dynamics of change and their\u000d\u000a      impact on the well-being\u000d\u000a      and life chances of individuals and households. The study has a nationally\u000d\u000a      representative sample\u000d\u000a      of individuals of all ages with annual interviews of all members of the\u000d\u000a      sample households. The\u000d\u000a      resulting dataset has proved to be one of the richest and most widely used\u000d\u000a      British datasets and\u000d\u000a      continues to be of national and international significance for the\u000d\u000a      promotion and advancement of\u000d\u000a      longitudinal research and methodology.\u000d\u000a    The BHPS has, from 2009, been incorporated into a far larger panel study,\u000d\u000a      called Understanding\u000d\u000a        Society: The UK Household Longitudinal Study. Understanding\u000d\u000a        Society interviews individuals in\u000d\u000a      some 40,000 households across the UK, including the BHPS sample. The fact\u000d\u000a      that this new and\u000d\u000a      far larger household panel survey was commissioned by the ESRC with direct\u000d\u000a      funding from the\u000d\u000a      Department for Business Innovation and Skills (through the Large\u000d\u000a      Facilities Capital Fund) is\u000d\u000a      testament to the success of the BHPS and the value and strategic\u000d\u000a      importance of continuing to\u000d\u000a      provide high-quality household panel data for the academic and policy\u000d\u000a      communities. The influence\u000d\u000a      of the BHPS is long-running and is set to continue through Understanding\u000d\u000a        Society over the coming\u000d\u000a      years. There have been approaching 4,000 BHPS data users, and BHPS data\u000d\u000a      have been used in\u000d\u000a      over 5,500 academic and policy publications. There is substantial\u000d\u000a      international recognition for the\u000d\u000a      quality of BHPS, with large numbers of data users in USA, Europe and\u000d\u000a      beyond.\u000d\u000a    The first Principal Investigator for the BHPS was Professor David Rose,\u000d\u000a      now Emeritus Professor at\u000d\u000a      the University of Essex. He was followed by Professor Jonathan Gershuny,\u000d\u000a      at Essex from 1993-2005.\u000d\u000a      Leadership of the project was handed over to Professor Nick Buck in 2001\u000d\u000a      who continues to\u000d\u000a      direct the successor household panel study, Understanding Society.\u000d\u000a      Other key researchers\u000d\u000a      involved have included Stephen Jenkins (at Essex 1994-2010) and John\u000d\u000a      Ermisch (at Essex 1994-2011).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43502","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The major impacts of Harvey's work have come about through The\u000d\u000a        evasion economy report influencing the policy of the Labour Party,\u000d\u000a      with false self-employment becoming a concern of ministers, and\u000d\u000a      subsequently shadow ministers, following the 2010 General Election.\u000d\u000a    The evasion economy report was presented to the Annual Delegate\u000d\u000a      Conference, Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians, Perth,\u000d\u000a      May 2008 - a conference at which Angela Eagle, the then Treasury Minister,\u000d\u000a      spoke at length about the problem of false self-employment. Following the\u000d\u000a      publication of the report, Harvey attended a series of meetings with\u000d\u000a      Angela Eagle, HMRC, and Treasury officials.\u000d\u000a    In July 2008 the TUC and the Labour Government formed the second `Warwick\u000d\u000a      Agreement' at its National Policy Forum, which included a commitment to\u000d\u000a      eradicate false self-employment in the construction industry. The\u000d\u000a      agreement outlined the commitments that would have formed government\u000d\u000a      policy, had the Labour Party gained a fourth term in office. The agreement\u000d\u000a      was published in the 2008 National Policy Forum Report and the section on\u000d\u000a      Prosperity and Work includes the statement:\u000d\u000a    \"We have acted to protect agency workers but we recognise the damaging\u000d\u000a      effects that false self-employment status can have and will work to\u000d\u000a      eradicate false self-employment: we will put in place a series of measures\u000d\u000a      that will ensure no one is falsely classified self-employed, these will\u000d\u000a      include using procurement rules on all publicly-funded projects.

A senior figure at UCATT has\u000d\u000a      confirmed that \"Mark Harvey's research most certainly assisted UCATT in\u000d\u000a      the formation of the amendments the union submitted to the Prosperity and\u000d\u000a      Work Policy document\" [corroborating source 2].\u000d\u000a    Labour's 2009 budget stated that \"The Government remains committed to\u000d\u000a      addressing false self-employment in the construction industry.

This led to, in July 2009, the Treasury and HMRC\u000d\u000a      circulating a consultation document, False self-employment in\u000d\u000a        construction: taxation of workers, to all stakeholders. The\u000d\u000a      consultation document referred to The evasion economy as its sole\u000d\u000a      academic source. The document states that whilst the Government does not\u000d\u000a      agree with Harvey's figure of 400,000 workers affected by false\u000d\u000a      self-employment, the figure had been revised upwards by 50% to 300,000 (p.\u000d\u000a      12) [4].\u000d\u000a    The most recent Labour Government budget (March 2010), included\u000d\u000a      provisions to change the tax regime with the aim of eliminating false\u000d\u000a      self-employment in the construction industry: \"The Government published a\u000d\u000a      summary of responses to the consultation on false self-employment in\u000d\u000a      construction on 9 March 2010.

Whilst we cannot demonstrate\u000d\u000a      conclusively that the inclusion of false self-employment in this budget\u000d\u000a      was the result of Harvey's work, we do know that the TUC Executive\u000d\u000a      Committee's 2010 Budget Submission made direct reference to The\u000d\u000a        evasion economy (pp. 58-59) [6].\u000d\u000a    More recently, with Labour in opposition, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls'\u000d\u000a      speech to the TUC in September 2012 promised to crack down on bogus\u000d\u000a      self-employment. Balls asked Rachel Reeves, the Shadow Treasury Secretary,\u000d\u000a      to look into the issue [7]. In 2013, a member of the Shadow Cabinet\u000d\u000a      revealed to us that The evasion economy \"has been fed into the\u000d\u000a      work we've been doing on this subject so it has been relevant and useful\"\u000d\u000a      [8]. Labour MP for Streatham, Chuka Umunna, spoke at length about false\u000d\u000a      self-employment in the House of Commons on 4 March, 2011 and explicitly\u000d\u000a      mentioned the University of Essex's research [9]. Later in 2011 he was\u000d\u000a      promoted to Shadow Secretary of State for Business, Skills &amp;\u000d\u000a      Innovation and has continued to speak on false self-employment, including\u000d\u000a      a Commons debate on 23 January 2013 [10].\u000d\u000a    In addition to parliamentary debate, between 2008 and 2010, three Early\u000d\u000a      Day Motions were submitted on the subject of false self-employment, and\u000d\u000a      all three mentioned Mark Harvey by name [11]. The first of these (1669;\u000d\u000a      02.06.08) was signed by 72 MPs, from not only the Labour Party but also\u000d\u000a      Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, and an independent member. In addition, a\u000d\u000a      House of Commons Standard Note (SN\/BT\/196; 20.04.10) sets out historically\u000d\u000a      the issue of false self-employment and cites Harvey's work (p. 7) [12].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Essex research on false self-employment in the construction industry has\u000d\u000a      informed the Labour Party's policy on this issue, both in government and\u000d\u000a      opposition.

Harvey's work on false\u000d\u000a      self-employment has developed themes tackled in Lydia Morris' Social\u000d\u000a        divisions (1995), which focused on the effects of industrial\u000d\u000a      decline. Social divisions focuses on the way sub-contracting, in\u000d\u000a      the context of economic decline, produced broken work histories and\u000d\u000a      intermittent unemployment to which traditional social classifications were\u000d\u000a      insufficiently sensitive. In addition, research by Rose and Pevalin (2002)\u000d\u000a      on `The National Statistics Socio-economic Classification' (NS-SEC) has\u000d\u000a      been concerned to design a system of social classification that is more\u000d\u000a      sensitive to differing employment relations, and better able to\u000d\u000a      accommodate periods of unemployment and some groups outside the labour\u000d\u000a      force.\u000d\u000a    Harvey's work on false self-employment in the construction industry is\u000d\u000a      thus located within a broader tradition of work that seeks to address the\u000d\u000a      terms and conditions of employment as related to definitions of social\u000d\u000a      class. Harvey's research into labour markets and fiscal and legal regimes\u000d\u000a      in the UK construction industry had a specific policy focus. His initial\u000d\u000a      report, The evasion economy: Illegal self-employment in the UK\u000d\u000a        construction industry (2008), was commissioned by the Institute of\u000d\u000a      Employment Rights and the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and\u000d\u000a      Technicians. A further report, Self-employment and bogus\u000d\u000a        self-employment in the construction industry in the United Kingdom\u000d\u000a      (2008), was produced as part of a European Federation of Building and\u000d\u000a      Woodworkers project, partly funded by the European Commission.\u000d\u000a    The research for The evasion economy entailed quantitative and\u000d\u000a      comparative analysis of labour force statistics in four European\u000d\u000a      countries, and detailed analysis of trends in the UK, demonstrating that\u000d\u000a      the UK has uniquely high levels of self-employment, 2 or 3 times the\u000d\u000a      proportion of any other advanced economy, including the flexible markets\u000d\u000a      of the USA. Interviews were conducted with key informants in HMRC,\u000d\u000a      construction contractors, the Construction Confederation, labour law\u000d\u000a      experts, and building workers. Furthermore, the research undertook\u000d\u000a      detailed analysis of the development of case law on self-employment, and\u000d\u000a      of changes in the fiscal regime that were peculiar to the construction\u000d\u000a      industry. Inconsistencies between legal and fiscal regimes then helped in\u000d\u000a      identifying false self-employment and tax evasion.\u000d\u000a    The quantitative analysis was related to changes in legal and fiscal\u000d\u000a      regulation, which provided the most coherent explanation of the rapid\u000d\u000a      growth of self-employment unique to the construction industry, much of it\u000d\u000a      illegal. A conflict between legal and fiscal regulation of employment\u000d\u000a      status revealed a tension between legal and fiscal evolution of\u000d\u000a      self-employment tax status unique to the construction industry. Impacts on\u000d\u000a      migration and skill formation and training were also analysed, including\u000d\u000a      the extent of the skills gap resulting from high levels of false\u000d\u000a      self-employment and the decline of apprenticeship within bona fide firms.\u000d\u000a    The quantitative analysis of labour supply permitted an estimate of the\u000d\u000a      level of false self-employment, which entailed systemic evasion of\u000d\u000a      national insurance payments by employers (the largest portion), and tax\u000d\u000a      and national insurance evasion by the bogus self-employed.

This is a shift towards more ethical, socially-aware and\u000d\u000a      effective care:\u000d\u000a    Participation in this research group with professionals from different\u000d\u000a        sectors and countries has provided us a great number of contributions,\u000d\u000a        debates and perspectives that have enriched us enormously and let us\u000d\u000a        improve with important and different ideas from our daily work.

Shaping corporate investment in biosensing\u000d\u000a    Our contributions to developing more ethical and socially aware forms of\u000d\u000a      telecare and biosensing recently found new reach in the corporate world.\u000d\u000a      In face-to-face and virtual engagements with anthropologists, engineers,\u000d\u000a      designers and managers from Intel Corporation (the microchip-manufacturing\u000d\u000a      multinational), we have exposed the limits and potentials of the use of\u000d\u000a      sensing technologies to collect personal biological data (biosensing) in\u000d\u000a      two fields: reproduction and personalised genomics. Our empirical research\u000d\u000a      and most recent citizen's panel (May 2013) highlight both the potential\u000d\u000a      for biosensing devices to create anxiety in some users and the keen\u000d\u000a      interest that many display in `playing with' personal biological data.\u000d\u000a      Members of the citizen's panel raised concerns around regulation, trust,\u000d\u000a      security, accuracy and personal, familial and societal impact of\u000d\u000a      biosensors. Our research has had a significant impact on Intel's decision\u000d\u000a      to invest in this new field. In face-to-face meetings at Intel, Santa\u000d\u000a      Clara and regular international teleconferences, as well as via written\u000d\u000a      reports, we have provided empirically-informed arguments about the social\u000d\u000a      and ethical implications of particular biosensing practices (for example,\u000d\u000a      our strong concerns about the impact of home ultrasound scanning for\u000d\u000a      pregnant women). These interactions have influenced investment and design\u000d\u000a      decisions at Intel. Dr Dawn Nafus, Intel Lab Biosensors Project Lead,\u000d\u000a      writes,\u000d\u000a    The Living Data project have been close collaborators for Intel, both\u000d\u000a        in its internal R&amp;D capacities and in strategic planning\u000d\u000a        functions... researchers at Lancaster have informed Intel's decisions\u000d\u000a        with respect to a new, and potentially significant market for us:\u000d\u000a        consumer-driven biosensing. This includes decisions we have to take in\u000d\u000a        terms of investments, acquisitions, and technical designs).

This investigation of\u000d\u000a      the social\/ethical implications of remote care technologies worn,\u000d\u000a      installed or embedded in the homes of older citizens involved observations\u000d\u000a      at local authority meetings, social work offices, older peoples' homes,\u000d\u000a      housing association offices, `smart homes', practitioner training meetings\u000d\u000a      and remote care monitoring centres. Building on our sustained dialogue\u000d\u000a      with stakeholders, findings revealed `empirical ethical' concerns, a key\u000d\u000a      divergence\/departure from the more standard `principle ethics' approach.\u000d\u000a      Drawing from Mort &amp; Kashefi's (2004) and Mort &amp; Finch's (2005)\u000d\u000a      engagement with citizens' panels and juries, EFORTT staged 22 older\u000d\u000a      citizens' panels (10 citizens per panel) over 18 months in England,\u000d\u000a      Netherlands, Spain and Norway (2008-10). Participants explored their\u000d\u000a      aspirations for care and the role that care technologies might play in\u000d\u000a      these. Recommendations are now being implemented with major local\u000d\u000a      authority commissioners; older people's NGO providers (AGEUK, Spanish Red\u000d\u000a      Cross; and discussed with lobby groups (Age Platform Europe,). Our Ethical\u000d\u000a      Framework for Telecare is now used in Local Authority telecare service\u000d\u000a      specification and procurement and by AGEUK in its latest knowledge\u000d\u000a      transfer initiative.\u000d\u000a    LIVING DATA: Although industrial\/design advisors (BT, Chubb,\u000d\u000a      Phillips) participated in both MEDUSE and EFORTT, their participation was\u000d\u000a      limited by commercial confidentiality\/government contracting processes. To\u000d\u000a      achieve meaningful routes for our research to influence design,\u000d\u000a      development and practice, a closer relationship with industry was\u000d\u000a      indicated. In 2010, Roberts was invited to bid by Intel Labs, and with\u000d\u000a      Mackenzie and Mort received funds for participatory research and two PhD\u000d\u000a      studentships (Living Data, 2011-14,\u000d\u000a      www.intel.com\/content\/www\/us\/en\/research\/intel-labs-data-society.html).\u000d\u000a      Working with Intel's corporate anthropologists, engineers and designers\u000d\u000a      and an international group of researchers, we have explored the social and\u000d\u000a      ethical aspects of using biosensors to record personal biological data in\u000d\u000a      assisted conception and direct-to-consumer genetic testing. In parallel we\u000d\u000a      ran a two-day Citizens' Panel (May2013) with 15 participants and four\u000d\u000a      expert witnesses to debate ethical and social questions arising from these\u000d\u000a      technologies. Citizens expressed serious concerns and made recommendations\u000d\u000a      for government, NHS\/service commissioners and industry (Intel). As noted\u000d\u000a      below, this work has impacted on Intel's strategic investment decisions in\u000d\u000a      the biosensor arena.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43551","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Research Councils UK","Economic and Social Research Council","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    In addition to wide public dissemination through specialist and generic\u000d\u000a      media coverage (UK and international) there are four key elements to the\u000d\u000a      programme's impact:\u000d\u000a    Changing user community practices: This research\u000d\u000a      programme has involved real world deployments in law enforcement agencies,\u000d\u000a      Children's Social Care and direct engagement with schools, children and\u000d\u000a      young people.\u000d\u000a    The micro-world simulation BRIGIT has been deployed in\u000d\u000a      commissioned work to assist in the reconfiguration of safeguarding systems\u000d\u000a      (Lancashire County Council). Beneficiaries report positive developments in\u000d\u000a      their inspection performance on account of learning gained in respect of\u000d\u000a      practitioner decision-making, with BRIGIT evidencing `proof of concept' in\u000d\u000a      its practical application.\u000d\u000a    An iTunes application, `Child Defence', has been released by Isis\u000d\u000a      Forensics that enables children and young people using mobile phones to\u000d\u000a      check the age of people they are messaging &#8212; potentially protecting them\u000d\u000a      from being groomed by adults posing as children online. Whereas most child\u000d\u000a      protection software will monitor a child's online activity and be\u000d\u000a      controlled by parents, this new software empowers children to protect\u000d\u000a      themselves (5). The first version has been downloaded over 1000 times and\u000d\u000a      an enhanced version is in development.\u000d\u000a    Impact on educational programmes for children and young people (public\u000a        service impact). The collaboration with local schools has also led\u000d\u000a      to significant impact at various levels. The main beneficiaries locally\u000d\u000a      are the two schools we have worked with, in developing and providing\u000d\u000a      Internet safety lessons to over 500 students, which included Turing-test\u000d\u000a      like sessions whereby children chatted with people behind the scenes half\u000d\u000a      of whom were children with the other half adults pretending to be children\u000d\u000a      (allowing them to understand masquerading tactics utilised by offenders\u000d\u000a      online). This led to a strong collaboration with teachers at Queen\u000d\u000a      Elizabeth School to develop comprehensive lesson plans on the broader\u000d\u000a      topic of e-safety for key stages 2-5, lesson plans which we claim are\u000d\u000a      nationally leading. These are now being rolled out across the region\u000d\u000a      through the South Lakes Teaching School Alliance (SLTSA).\u000d\u000a    Adoption by law enforcement agencies: Isis held live\u000a        trials with the London Metropolitan police (2013), as well as the\u000d\u000a      police forces in Kent, Lancashire and Merseyside (2010-2012). The work was\u000d\u000a      also in collaboration with the Child Exploitation and Online Protection\u000d\u000a      Centre (CEOP). Participants agreed that the toolkit works accurately on\u000d\u000a      real data sets and significantly reduces the manual time involved: \"allows\u000d\u000a      all victims to be identified and therefore a full range of offending to be\u000d\u000a      investigated\", \"provides the ability to focus analysis on specific\u000d\u000a      information allows investigations to be more focussed and therefore\u000d\u000a      potential victims of grooming or contact abuse to be identified more\u000d\u000a      easily\", \"the only other option is manual analysis which would be much\u000d\u000a      slower\". This work has transformed strategic thinking on child online\u000d\u000a      protection. To date the primary beneficiary is the Canadian Royal Mounted\u000d\u000a      Police who have licensed the toolkit for use across the country, an\u000d\u000a      approach that they regard as an \"operational necessity\".

A spin-out company was created from the Isis\u000d\u000a      project, Isis Forensics, to license the Isis Toolkit and to exploit the\u000d\u000a      associated IPR. This company employs 4 FTE, has received venture capital\u000d\u000a      of &#163;400,000 and is seen as having very significant growth potential.

Bringing together experts with a child\u000d\u000a      protection background and software developers to address new challenges,\u000d\u000a      the projects act as case studies for software development to reduce child\u000d\u000a      abuse risks that can be applied on an international scale. Isis involved a\u000d\u000a      multi-method approach that included; Turing type whole school experiments\u000d\u000a      (5), natural language analysis, psycho-social and forensic profiling, the\u000d\u000a      development and testing of algorithms and law enforcement groups focused\u000d\u000a      on misuse cases. The research builds on internationally leading work on\u000d\u000a      corpus comparison techniques using statistical natural language analysis\u000d\u000a      [4, 6]. At the heart of the research is a semantic analysis approach that\u000d\u000a      categorises keywords based on contextual information. The specific\u000d\u000a      research challenges involved integrating the statistically sophisticated\u000d\u000a      techniques from authorship attribution with methods from corpus-based\u000d\u000a      natural language analysis and combining the macro level (models of\u000d\u000a      language varieties) with the micro level (models of individual's use of\u000d\u000a      language). Additionally, these methods needed to operate on small\u000d\u000a      quantities of noisy language data observed in online social networks and\u000d\u000a      deal with masquerading or similarly deceptive behaviour that an individual\u000d\u000a      might assume in an attempt to hide his or her identity.

In both\u000d\u000a      cases users (law enforcement, schools, young people, child protection\u000d\u000a      agencies) have been closely involved in the research to trial and refine\u000d\u000a      tools and provide data on their application.\u000d\u000a    b) Researching indirect child protection risk emerging through the\u000d\u000a        application of IT in safeguarding systems\u000d\u000a    Responding to widespread national concerns about the malign effects of\u000d\u000a      the `modernisation' of children's frontline services, our work funded\u000d\u000a      under the ESRC's Public Services Programme (RES-166-25-0048, 2007-2009)\u000d\u000a      drew policy makers' attention to the unintended but negative effects of\u000d\u000a      the application of IT systems in child protection social work. An\u000d\u000a      inter-university team of social and information scientists, including\u000d\u000a      White (Lancaster 2007-2010, now Birmingham University) and Broadhurst\u000d\u000a      (Lancaster 2003-2013, now Manchester University) conducted a multi-site\u000d\u000a      ethnographic study, based in five local authorities in England and Wales\u000d\u000a      and drawing data from fifteen social work duty and assessment teams.\u000d\u000a      Research outputs have brought the language of `latent conditions for\u000d\u000a      error' into mainstream policy debate in child protection in a range of\u000d\u000a      international contexts and contributed to developments in experiential\u000d\u000a      risk theory (1, 2). Design innovation is illustrated through the\u000d\u000a      production of a digital micro-world comprising a portfolio of synthetic\u000d\u000a      practice cases (4).

Through such\u000d\u000a      direct methods of\u000d\u000a      engagement, Shove's work has been taken up and applied: WWF has revised\u000d\u000a      research methods\u000d\u000a      and agendas as a result; AD Research &amp; Analysis (a policy\/research\u000d\u000a      consultancy) has actively\u000d\u000a      promoted practice-theory models, and the IEA now supports research on\u000d\u000a      practice and energy\u000d\u000a      demand.

Shove was\u000d\u000a      invited to present\u000d\u000a      evidence in person to the House of Lords Science and Technology Select\u000d\u000a      Committee in 2010,\u000d\u000a      following a written submission outlining the limitations of the\u000d\u000a      behavioural paradigm and the\u000d\u000a      principles of an alternative `practice theory' approach (3). In addition,\u000d\u000a      researchers and policy\u000d\u000a      consultants have drawn heavily upon Shove's work which is now routinely\u000d\u000a      cited in analyses,\u000d\u000a      reviews and guidance on behaviour\/climate change produced by and for\u000d\u000a      government.

Shove's arguments, and those of her colleagues, have been\u000d\u000a      developed in subsequent\u000d\u000a      publications including 5 other books, and a series articles and book\u000d\u000a      chapters. Recent works\u000d\u000a      include a best-selling book The Dynamics of Social Practice (Shove\u000d\u000a      et al, 2012), and an influential\u000d\u000a      article `Beyond the ABC: climate change policy and theories of social\u000d\u000a        change' (2010) - over 187\u000d\u000a      citations (Google Scholar). These and other writings show policy makers\u000d\u000a      how they can influence\u000d\u000a      the `elements' of which social practices are made and how they can shape\u000d\u000a      the `systems' of practice\u000d\u000a      on which the resource demands of daily life depend.\u000d\u000a    Policy makers and planners charged with the task of reducing CO2\u000d\u000a      emissions routinely suppose\u000d\u000a      that patterns of consumption stem from individual beliefs, actions and\u000d\u000a      lifestyle choices. These\u000d\u000a      assumptions, inspired by dominant paradigms within economics and\u000d\u000a      psychology, underpin a\u000d\u000a      repertoire of policy responses in which people are provided with\u000d\u000a      information about the\u000d\u000a      consequences of their actions and encouraged to change their attitudes,\u000d\u000a      behaviours and choices\u000d\u000a      (ABC). Shove's research develops an alternative approach, drawing on\u000d\u000a      social theories of practice,\u000d\u000a      consumption and technology.\u000d\u000a    This strategy recognises that most environmentally significant forms of\u000d\u000a      consumption occur without\u000d\u000a      reflection and in the course of reproducing taken-for-granted practices\u000d\u000a      and conventions of comfort,\u000d\u000a      cleanliness and mobility. Shove and colleagues provide a conceptual\u000d\u000a      framework for understanding\u000d\u000a      how practices are reproduced and transformed in the detail of everyday\u000d\u000a      life. This involves\u000d\u000a      analysing the materials, meanings and competences on which practices\u000d\u000a      depend and\u000d\u000a      demonstrating how individuals are recruited to, and how they become the\u000d\u000a      `carriers' of practices like\u000d\u000a      those of daily showering, commuting and heating indoor spaces to 222070C.\u000d\u000a      The crucial point is that\u000d\u000a      social practices, their elements, and their evolution over time and space,\u000d\u000a      figure as the central units\u000d\u000a      of analysis and of policy intervention.\u000d\u000a    Through her ESRC fellowship, her involvement in the Manchester-based\u000d\u000a      Sustainable Practices\u000d\u000a      Research Group, and her directorship of the DEMAND Research Centre, Shove\u000d\u000a      has developed an\u000d\u000a      increasingly influential body of work around these core concerns.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43617","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Berthoud's research has had impact across government departments and\u000d\u000a      agencies, the third sector, and the judiciary.

The presentations were based on\u000d\u000a      his work on employment penalties suffered by disabled people, and changes\u000d\u000a      over time in employment trends among disadvantaged groups. A former\u000d\u000a      Economic Advisor at the DWP has confirmed that Berthoud's presentations\u000d\u000a      offered new findings and explanations on key topics, and that he brought\u000d\u000a      the British Household Panel Survey to the DWP's attention.

This\u000d\u000a      involved detailed comment on the whole of the ODI's draft publication, as\u000d\u000a      well as specific advice on analytical issues, and new bespoke analysis of\u000d\u000a      employment penalties for inclusion in the published report (2013). A\u000d\u000a      senior member of the Disability Employment Strategy Team at the ODI has\u000d\u000a      confirmed that Berthoud's research profile and expertise were the reasons\u000d\u000a      for him being asked to contribute to the evidence base and that his\u000d\u000a      publications were reviewed by the team in the early phases of its\u000d\u000a      development [corroborating source 2]. He attended a number of meetings\u000d\u000a      throughout 2012, and the report, Fulfilling Potential: Building a\u000d\u000a        deeper understanding of disability in the UK today, was published in\u000d\u000a      February 2013. This report cited his work on disability employment\u000d\u000a      penalties (2008) and trends in the employment of disabled people (2011a)\u000d\u000a      [3].\u000d\u000a    Informing the judiciary\u000d\u000a    Berthoud was approached by an Upper Tribunal Administrative Appeals\u000d\u000a      Chamber judge in 2011 to give a keynote speech at a judicial training day.\u000d\u000a      The audience consisted of around 25 Upper Tribunal judges and 10\u000d\u000a      registrars. The judge who invited Berthoud to speak did so based on\u000d\u000a      reading his `Trends in the employment of disabled people in Britain' ISER\u000d\u000a      Working Paper, and he also stated that he made the decision due to\u000d\u000a      Berthoud's reputation as the \"top social scientist in this field\" [4].\u000d\u000a      According to the judge, Berthoud's presentation was \"very well received\"\u000d\u000a      and prompted debate from the audience [4]. The rationale for inviting\u000d\u000a      Berthoud to speak was that he could provide an understanding of the\u000d\u000a      broader context of the changes to the ESA benefit system. The judge has\u000d\u000a      explained that Berthoud was successful in fulfilling this aim and that his\u000d\u000a      presentation \"was extremely useful in furthering our understanding of the\u000d\u000a      wider social context and in particular the underlying reasons for trends\u000d\u000a      in receipt of incapacity for work benefits\" [4]. In addition, the judge\u000d\u000a      confirmed that positive feedback was received from the participants in the\u000d\u000a      session, including praise for Berthoud's focus on detailed statistical\u000d\u000a      issues as well as the broader picture he gave of incapacity benefits [4].\u000d\u000a    Informing the Equalities Review and the National Equality Panel\u000d\u000a    Berthoud's research on employment penalties faced by disadvantaged social\u000d\u000a      groups (2008) has informed the work of the Equalities Review (ER) and the\u000d\u000a      National Equality Panel (NEP). The former Head of the Secretariat to the\u000d\u000a      NEP and Lead Analyst for the ER has confirmed that \"I and my team made\u000d\u000a      substantial use of the analysis of Professor Berthoud\" [5]. He also states\u000d\u000a      that \"Professor Berthoud's work on the employment rates of disabled people\u000d\u000a      has been fundamental to the National Equality Panel's analysis of\u000d\u000a      disability and the key role of qualifications\" [5]. Further to this, he\u000d\u000a      states that Berthoud's work on `intersectionalities' between equality\u000d\u000a      strands (including disability) \"has come to define a lot of the equality\u000d\u000a      debate in policy terms\" [5]. Berthoud's work, including his research on\u000d\u000a      the employment rates of disabled people, was referenced numerous times in\u000d\u000a      the National Equality Panel's An Anatomy of Economic Inequalities in\u000d\u000a        the UK report [6].\u000d\u000a    Working with the Citizens Advice Bureau\u000d\u000a    The Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) asked Berthoud to interpret the\u000d\u000a      implications of his empirical research for the possible development of a\u000d\u000a      discretionary \"real world\" test of incapacity, to complement the formal\u000d\u000a      Work Capability Assessment (WCA). In 2010 CAB put forward an initial\u000d\u000a      submission to Professor Harrington, who was chairing a Government review\u000d\u000a      of the WCA. Professor Harrington asked CAB to further investigate the\u000d\u000a      feasibility of developing a \"real world\" test as part of the WCA. This led\u000d\u000a      CAB to approach Berthoud, based on his record of research, to produce a\u000d\u000a      paper for submission to the Harrington Review [7] &#8212; this was later\u000d\u000a      published as an ISER Working Paper and is listed above (Berthoud, 2011b).\u000d\u000a      His paper highlighted that the sliding scale of impact on someone's\u000d\u000a      ability to work at different levels of impairment depended on the level of\u000d\u000a      educational qualifications and experience of the person. A Policy Officer\u000d\u000a      at CAB states that \"his paper was extremely useful evidence on this issue.\u000d\u000a      Unfortunately it became clear that any further exploration of this route\u000d\u000a      was politically unacceptable at that point\" [7].\u000d\u000a    However, the fact that \"real world assessment\" has not been included in\u000d\u000a      the WCA only serves to demonstrate the need for a better means of\u000d\u000a      assessing a person's capability to work. The Policy Officer points out\u000d\u000a      that CAB continues to look at the problems of the WCA and in so doing\u000d\u000a      continues to use Berthoud's research [7].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    There has long been concern about the large number of people claiming\u000d\u000a      incapacity benefits in Britain.

There was a striking increase in the\u000d\u000a      number of claimants of these benefits between the mid-1970s and the\u000d\u000a      mid-1990s, signalling problems for disabled people (exclusion from the\u000d\u000a      labour market, poverty) and problems for government (shrinkage of the\u000d\u000a      labour force, increased public expenditure). A series of reforms\u000d\u000a      implemented by governments of all colours since 1996 seems to have capped,\u000d\u000a      but not reduced, the number of people dependent on these benefits.\u000d\u000a    The strategic policy issue for successive governments has been the\u000d\u000a      question of how to improve the employment rate among disabled people, and\u000d\u000a      thus reduce the number of benefit claimants. The tactical issue has been\u000d\u000a      how to distinguish between those who are capable and incapable of work,\u000d\u000a      and how to enable (or compel) those on the margins of work to re-enter the\u000d\u000a      labour market. There has been some inconsistency of approach, with\u000d\u000a      policymakers responsible for equal opportunities and disability-specific\u000d\u000a      issues focussing on discrimination against disabled people, while\u000d\u000a      policymakers responsible for incapacity benefits (and the media) have\u000d\u000a      demonised claimants as exaggerating their impairments and avoiding a\u000d\u000a      return to work.\u000d\u000a    Berthoud's research has explored these areas and issues and shown that:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      At a theoretical level, neither the medical model of disability, nor\u000d\u000a        the social model, provides a fully effective explanation for disabled\u000d\u000a        people's employment prospects. Both models need to be taken into\u000d\u000a        account, and to inform policy analysis (Berthoud 2008).\u000d\u000a      The `disability employment penalty' varies widely according to the\u000d\u000a        condition, the type of impairment and severity experienced by the\u000d\u000a        individual concerned. Some are unaffected by disability; some have\u000d\u000a        virtually no chance of employment; many are in between and can be\u000d\u000a        thought of as having about a 50:50 probability. This evidence does not\u000d\u000a        fit well with benefit policies, which assume that people are either\u000d\u000a        fully capable, or wholly incapable, of work (Berthoud 2008, 2011a,\u000d\u000a        2011b).\u000d\u000a      Well-educated disabled people living in prosperous regions are not\u000d\u000a        much worse off than non- disabled people with the same characteristics.\u000d\u000a        But under-qualified disabled people living in depressed regions are\u000d\u000a        heavily disadvantaged by their impairments, even in comparison with the\u000d\u000a        relatively poor prospects of their non-disabled peers (Berthoud 2008,\u000d\u000a        2011a).\u000d\u000a      Analysis of survey data on the prevalence of disability, and on the\u000d\u000a        employment rates of disabled people over time, is broadly consistent\u000d\u000a        with official statistics on the number of claimants, but does not\u000d\u000a        support the idea that major changes in benefit rules influenced kinks in\u000d\u000a        the trends (Berthoud 1998, 2011a).\u000d\u000a      Increases in prevalence and reductions in employment rates have\u000d\u000a        affected disabled people at all levels of severity. There is no evidence\u000d\u000a        that the rise in benefit dependence is mainly associated with trivial\u000d\u000a        complaints (Berthoud 2011a).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43630","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact of this research started prior to 2008 as the NS-SEC was\u000d\u000a      introduced as the new sole official government socio-economic\u000d\u000a      classification in 2001 for use in the Census and all ONS surveys. The\u000d\u000a      impact of this research has continued during the period 2008-13, mostly in\u000d\u000a      government departments and agencies. The examples below cover some of the\u000d\u000a      main uses of the NS-SEC during this period and focus largely on the use of\u000d\u000a      NS-SEC by the ONS.\u000d\u000a    Use of the NS-SEC by the ONS\u000d\u000a      The National Statistician has confirmed that \"NS-SEC is an essential tool\u000d\u000a      for generating national statistics, particularly to establish the\u000d\u000a      prevalence and magnitude of inequalities in health across the UK\u000d\u000a      population. The classification is used on all major national surveys\u000d\u000a      conducted by ONS including the 2011 Census\" [corroborating source 1].\u000d\u000a      Questions in the 2011 Census were explicitly designed to be able to derive\u000d\u000a      NS-SEC for use in analysis of the Census data. The Census Order, which\u000d\u000a      includes details of the questions, was laid before Parliament in October\u000d\u000a      2009, with Parliament making the final decisions on the questions that\u000d\u000a      would be asked. The Census questionnaires form part of the Census\u000d\u000a      Regulations, which were approved by Parliament in Spring 2010\u000d\u000a      [corroborating source 2]. The NS-SEC was rebased on the new Standard\u000d\u000a      Occupational Classification 2010 (SOC2010) in preparation for the 2011\u000d\u000a      Census and all government surveys from 2011 onwards [3].\u000d\u000a    The National Statistician states:\u000d\u000a    \"From my perspective as National Statistician the research carried out\u000d\u000a      with the University of Essex to develop the NS-SEC was an excellent\u000d\u000a      example of co-operation that drew on the skills of statisticians within\u000d\u000a      ONS and the theoretical and empirical skills of the research team at the\u000d\u000a      University of Essex. NS-SEC is a vital tool for ONS and more generally for\u000d\u000a      the policy research community and is a measure that is widely used for\u000d\u000a      critical elements of social policy\" [1].\u000d\u000a    The NS-SEC, as the official UK Government social classification, is a\u000d\u000a      vital means through which the ONS establishes the prevalence and magnitude\u000d\u000a      of inequalities in health. The NS-SEC continues to be used as measure of\u000d\u000a      socio-economic position to describe inequalities in, for example, child\u000d\u000a      mortality [4]. In 2011 the ONS launched two consultations on the life\u000d\u000a      expectancy time series and infant mortality statistics proposing to only\u000d\u000a      use the NS-SEC and discontinue producing statistics using the former\u000d\u000a      socio-economic classifications. Both consultations resulted in the sole\u000d\u000a      use of NS-SEC for future official statistics in these two areas [5] [6]\u000d\u000a      [7]. In addition, The 2010 Marmot Review of Health Inequalities used the\u000d\u000a      NS-SEC in its analysis of the state of health inequality in England [8].\u000d\u000a    The use of NS-SEC in producing statistics in higher education\u000d\u000a      The Higher Education Funding Council for England's (HEFCE) Aimhigher\u000d\u000a      programme is a key component of government policy to widen and so increase\u000d\u000a      participation in higher education. The Guidance to Aimhigher partnerships\u000d\u000a      for 2008-11 uses, as one of its criteria, the Full-Time Young\u000d\u000a      Participation by Socio-Eeconomic Classification (FYPSEC) measure. The\u000d\u000a      FYPSEC shows the participation rates of young people from the top three\u000d\u000a      (NS-SEC 1 to 3) and bottom four (NS-SEC 4 to 7) socio-economic classes.\u000d\u000a      Statistics on both groups inform the widening participation debate, as\u000d\u000a      does, more importantly, the gap that exists between the two participation\u000d\u000a      rates [9].\u000d\u000a    The Higher Education Statistics Agency's (HESA) annual widening\u000d\u000a      participation performance indicators provide comparative data on the\u000d\u000a      performance of higher education institutions in recruiting entrants from\u000d\u000a      various under-represented groups. The criteria include the use of the\u000d\u000a      NS-SEC classes 4 to 7 [10]. In addition to this, the Department for\u000d\u000a      Business, Industry and Skills also uses the FYPSEC measure to assess\u000d\u000a      government targets on widening access [11].\u000d\u000a    The use of NS-SEC in measuring economic inequalities\u000d\u000a      The independent National Equality Panel was set up in October 2008 at the\u000d\u000a      invitation of the Rt. Hon. Harriet Harman MP, Minister for Women and\u000d\u000a      Equality. The Panel was asked to investigate the relationships between the\u000d\u000a      distributions of various kinds of economic outcome on the one hand, and\u000d\u000a      people's characteristics and circumstances on the other. The report\u000d\u000a      addresses questions on matters such as how far up or down people from\u000d\u000a      different backgrounds typically come in the distributions of earnings,\u000d\u000a      income or wealth. The report uses NS-SEC to describe and analyse these\u000d\u000a      relationships [12].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research at Essex, commissioned by the Office of Population Censuses and\u000d\u000a      Statistics (now Office for National Statistics), involved the development\u000d\u000a      of a new, theoretically informed, socio-economic classification &#8212; the\u000d\u000a      National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification (NS-SEC).

SC had remained substantively unchanged for 80\u000d\u000a      years and reflected an outdated nineteenth-century view of social\u000d\u000a      structure. SEG did not have a conceptual explanation for its basis and had\u000d\u000a      no rules to guide researchers on how SEGs might best be collapsed for\u000d\u000a      analysis. As both relied on outmoded distinctions&#8212;skill and the\u000d\u000a      manual\/non-manual divide&#8212;the then Office of Population Censuses and\u000d\u000a      Statistics (OPCS) wished to explore whether a new classification should be\u000d\u000a      developed. The OPCS commissioned the ESRC to undertake a review of\u000d\u000a      government social classifications and the ESRC approached Professor David\u000d\u000a      Rose to carry out the preliminary research because of his earlier research\u000d\u000a      on stratification and social class. The NS-SEC is based on employment\u000d\u000a      relations and conditions of occupations and allows for the nested\u000d\u000a      construction of three, five and eight analytical classes. It also allows\u000d\u000a      for the classification of the unemployed and students.\u000d\u000a    The research was conducted in four phases overseen by a Review Committee\u000d\u000a      established by Professor Rose in conjunction with senior management at the\u000d\u000a      OPCS.\u000d\u000a    Phase 1, November 1994-March 1995: The Review Committee invited\u000d\u000a      written evidence from government departments, local authorities,\u000d\u000a      government agencies, employers' and employees' associations, market\u000d\u000a      research organisations, learned societies, and individual experts. By way\u000d\u000a      of this process, the Committee:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Established that there was a continuing overarching need for\u000d\u000a        government socio-economic classifications.\u000d\u000a      Established that there was a need to replace the existing\u000d\u000a        classifications as the two existing classifications had demonstrated\u000d\u000a        weaknesses.\u000d\u000a      Determined the criteria for assessing a revised or new classification.\u000d\u000a      Determined the work required to produce a revised or new\u000d\u000a        classification.\u000d\u000a      Key research output: report to OPCS in 1995, reproduced as Appendix 1\u000d\u000a        in Rose and O'Reilly (1997).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Phase 2, June 1995-March 1997: The Review Committee created a\u000d\u000a      sub-group, led by Professor Rose, to produce a single classification with\u000d\u000a      a clear conceptual rationale, improved population coverage, and\u000d\u000a      operational and maintenance rules. Data were collected from three National\u000d\u000a      Statistics Omnibus Surveys to facilitate the research for this Phase.

Most notably he has\u000a      informed pension policy\u000a      in Ecuador through presenting his research to senior government figures,\u000a      including the country's\u000a      President. He has also addressed various international organisations,\u000a      including the European\u000a      Commission's Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and\u000a      Inclusion.\u000a    Impact in Ecuador\u000a      Blackburn was invited to visit Quito in January 2011 by the government of\u000a      Ecuador to conduct\u000a      seminars over three days for its civil servants, ministers and the\u000a      President, Rafael Correa. These\u000a      consultations were organised by the Ecuadorean government think tank,\u000a      Institute of Advanced\u000a      Studies (IAEN). The seminars were part of the \"The New Left's Frontiers\"\u000a      event, which was\u000a      designed to be a public debate that informed social policy\u000a      decision-making. Blackburn, drawing on\u000a      his research, spoke on the ageing society, pension policy, and the\u000a      financial crisis. The Rector of\u000a      the IAEN has confirmed Blackburn's participation and writes that \"the\u000a      seminar was a big public\u000a      success, attracting many researchers, policy formers and public\u000a      officials... The event culminated in\u000a      a two hour seminar with the President Rafael Correa, who appreciated\u000a      greatly the meeting\"\u000a      [corroborating source 1]. A Minister within the Government of Ecuador has\u000a      stated that the public\u000a      policy debates and discussions involving Blackburn were \"of great value to\u000a      the current structural\u000a      reforms underway in Ecuador\". He adds that Blackburn \"contributed an\u000a      informative survey of social\u000a      policy options\" to the seminars [corroborating source 2].\u000a    The IAEN invited Blackburn back to Ecuador in September 2012. He gave\u000a      seminars and lectures\u000a      on the implications of the financial crisis, which were attended by\u000a      ministers and other high-ranking\u000a      government officials [corroborating source 1]. During this visit, he\u000a      conducted a ninety-minute\u000a      interview with President Correa, which was published in both English and\u000a      Spanish. Blackburn and\u000a      the President discussed inter alia the overhaul of the economic\u000a      system in Ecuador [corroborating\u000a      source 3]. Further evidence of Blackburn's influence in Ecuador is\u000a      demonstrated by his New Left\u000a        Review article, `Crisis 2.0', being published in Spanish in L&#237;nea\u000a        Sur &#8212; the journal of the Ecuadorean\u000a      Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Integration [4].\u000a    Blackburn has undertaken further public engagement related to Ecuador and\u000a      was invited to\u000a      contribute to two events. In December 2012 he spoke at a workshop on\u000a      social justice in Ecuador\u000a      as part of the \"Showing Another World is Possible\" conference on Latin\u000a      American Solidarity. The\u000a      event was attended by over 400 people, including Ken Livingstone and\u000a      Frances O'Grady, the\u000a      General Secretary of the TUC [5]. In January 2013 Blackburn contributed to\u000a      the \"Celebrating\u000a      Ecuador's Citizens Revolution\" public meeting at Bolivar Hall, London,\u000a      where he spoke on the\u000a      economic situation in Ecuador, including the reform of pension provision\u000a      [6].\u000a    International Impact\u000a      Blackburn has spoken on pension provision at a number of high-profile\u000a      international events, most\u000a      notably a conference convened by the EU Commissioner for Employment,\u000a      Social Affairs and\u000a      Inclusion in Brussels, October 2010. The conference was on the Pensions\u000a      Green Paper and\u000a      Blackburn spoke as part of the `The Future of European Pensions' panel,\u000a      which was chaired by\u000a      Commissioner L&#225;szl&#243; Andor and attended by around 700 EU pension experts\u000a      and officials.\u000a      Blackburn spoke on the possibility of an EU-wide pension and his\u000a      contribution was warmly\u000a      received by Georg Fischer (Director within the Commission), who stated:\u000a      \"There was a lively and\u000a      inspiring contribution by one of the panellists, Professor Robin\u000a      Blackburn, who said why speak of\u000a      these technical issues, why don't we have a European Pension scheme &#8212; a\u000a      minimum pension\u000a      scheme that would provide a modest sum for all European citizens\" [7].\u000a    In February 2007 Blackburn spoke at the `How to Devise a Global Pension'\u000a      event organised by\u000a      Global Action on Aging (GAA) for participants in the UN Economic and\u000a      Social Council. This led to\u000a      two further invitations in 2008 to speak at events organised by GAA. The\u000a      first of these (6th March),\u000a      organised in collaboration with UN Commission for Social Development,\u000a      involved Blackburn\u000a      providing a keynote speech on the subject of older women and pensions. At\u000a      the second (22nd April)\u000a      he spoke at a GAA event on the topic of global pensions guaranteeing older\u000a      people a minimum of\u000a      $1 per day [8]. The United Nations' Department of Economic and Social\u000a      Affairs cited Blackburn's\u000a      work in its report, World Economic and Social Survey 2008: Overcoming\u000a        Economic Insecurity. This\u000a      report makes reference to his 2007 piece in New Left Review, which\u000a      addresses the need for a\u000a      global pension fund to administer a universal pension [9].\u000a    Impact in the UK\u000a      In June 2009 Blackburn spoke at a Pensions Initiative seminar on The\u000a      Changing Landscape of\u000a      Public Sector Pension Provision, organised by the LSE Department of\u000a      Management. The event\u000a      was attended by high-profile figures within Whitehall, the City, and\u000a      unions, including\u000a      representatives from the Department for Work and Pensions, National Union\u000a      of Teachers, Institute\u000a      of Fiscal Studies, Royal Bank of Scotland, and Eversheds. Drawing heavily\u000a      on his published\u000a      research, Blackburn spoke on how the financial crisis illustrated the need\u000a      for stronger public\u000a      provision and how the pooling of funds was necessary to spread risk more\u000a      widely. A member of the\u000a      staff from the LSE has confirmed that Blackburn's argument on pooling was\u000a      \"received with great\u000a      interest by participants generally... and [was] particularly true for the\u000a      participants from the\u000a      Pensions Corporation\" [10].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Robin Blackburn has written extensively on pension policy and\u000a      has advocated the need\u000a      for strong public pension provision. Following the financial crisis that\u000a      began in 2008, Blackburn's\u000a      ideas have attracted much interest, especially given that he had\u000a      identified many of the problems\u000a      that would come to afflict private schemes. His work has been recognised\u000a      globally: for example, he\u000a      was invited to speak at a conference organised by the EU Commissioner for\u000a      Employment, Social\u000a      Affairs and Inclusion, and his research has been cited by the United\u000a      Nations' Department of\u000a      Economic and Social Affairs.

Blackburn's approach\u000a      has involved\u000a      extensive analysis of pension provision within the UK, but he situates\u000a      this within a global view that\u000a      considers Asian, European, Latin American, and North American schemes.\u000a    Blackburn's research has demonstrated that private pension delivery is\u000a      inherently costly and is\u000a      likely to be uneven in its coverage. He argues that as long as competent\u000a      and honest public\u000a      administration is available, public pension schemes have proved more\u000a      economical and effective,\u000a      with better coverage and a greater contribution to gender equity. His\u000a      research has stressed various\u000a      problems with private provision, including the heavy cost of customisation\u000a      and `active' fund\u000a      management, patchy coverage, poor prospects offered to women, and fund\u000a      management plagued\u000a      by perverse incentives and hidden risks. Such matters, he argues, had not\u000a      been given adequate\u000a      attention by those framing public policy, as the need for private\u000a      provision had become the received\u000a      view in the UK. However, he notes that the UK's experience is best\u000a      understood as part of a global\u000a      trend, given the World Bank's advocacy for private provision.\u000a    Blackburn's research has drawn on the findings of over a hundred\u000a      different studies, which has\u000a      allowed him to highlight structural flaws with private schemes, especially\u000a      undue reliance on the\u000a      workings of financial markets. He was able to draw attention to the mass\u000a      of evidence that\u000a      vindicates the record of public provision and challenges confidence in the\u000a      financial services\u000a      industry as a reliable and equitable pension provider. The conclusions of\u000a      Blackburn's research\u000a      were set out in Banking on Death (2002) and Age Shock\u000a      (2006), where he argues that private\u000a      pensions would not be able to supply 60% of total pensioner incomes by\u000a      2040 - a promise that\u000a      had been made by the Labour Government in Britain, under the influence of\u000a      the World Bank. He\u000a      showed that private pensions could not be relied upon to cover the\u000a      livelihood of an aged population\u000a      whose numbers were set to double in 30 to 40 years.\u000a    Blackburn's warnings about the problems of private provision were\u000a      particularly prescient given the\u000a      financial crisis that began in 2008, which demonstrated that much trust in\u000a      the financial services\u000a      industry had been misplaced. In recent work he has addressed the impact of\u000a      the crisis and argued\u000a      that the \"privatized model of pension provision has been engulfed by the\u000a      onset of the credit crunch\"\u000a      (2010, p. 389), with schemes losing value and people having to use savings\u000a      in order to meet their\u000a      living expenses. This has vindicated his earlier arguments as countries\u000a      are increasingly looking to\u000a      protect their public schemes, whilst private provision is no longer seen\u000a      as a panacea. As a means\u000a      of protecting funds he has called for the `pooling' of funds in order to\u000a      spread risk. He addresses the\u000a      effect of the crisis in depth in a 2011 article in New Left Review\u000a      and in the revised edition of Age\u000a        Shock (2011), where he also calls for the introduction of a\u000a      non-contributory global pension, largely\u000a      funded by a tax on financial transactions &#8212; a topic he also addressed in a\u000a      2007 New Left Review\u000a      article.\u000a    Blackburn's research in this area is best understood as encompassing\u000a      academic rigour through his\u000a      scholarly publications, but also advocacy for the expansion of public\u000a      provision through his\u000a      engagement with policymakers (most notably Adair Turner, former chair of\u000a      the Pensions\u000a      Commission) and his publication record in newspapers and magazines,\u000a      including The Guardian,\u000a        Financial Times, Times Literary Supplement, and London Review of\u000a        Books.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43693","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Impact arose in two key areas: (a) For the first time, evidence-based\u000d\u000a      policy to improve provision for\u000d\u000a      supporters was introduced to the sector; (b) Research crucially\u000d\u000a      underpinned the development of\u000d\u000a      anti-racism and other equity strategies and initiatives.\u000d\u000a    (a) Providing an evidence base\u000d\u000a    An accurate understanding of a club's fan base underpins today's\u000d\u000a      anti-racism policies and\u000d\u000a      initiatives. The annual national fan surveys compiled for the first time\u000d\u000a      at Leicester in the mid-1990s\u000d\u000a      offered new sociological data to clubs, fans, administrators, sponsors and\u000d\u000a      local authorities about\u000d\u000a      the demographic characteristics of different fan groups. Until then, even\u000d\u000a      major sports clubs around\u000d\u000a      the world knew very little about their own supporters and their habits and\u000d\u000a      attitudes towards their\u000d\u000a      clubs. The research enabled clubs to make evidence-based policy for the\u000d\u000a      first time, shaping crucial\u000d\u000a      policy debates about inter alia transport use, spectator facilities, local\u000d\u000a      and non-local fan\u000d\u000a      communities, family and female fans, fan experiences of racism and\u000d\u000a      hooliganism, and patterns of\u000d\u000a      consumption around different types of English Premier League and Football\u000d\u000a      League clubs and\u000d\u000a      Premier Rugby clubs.\u000d\u000a    The Football Trust was a Government body set up to improve safety at\u000d\u000a      football stadia. The Trust\u000d\u000a      pioneered the use of academic research on football by commissioning the\u000d\u000a      University of Leicester\u000d\u000a      to work on the Digest of Football Statistics. The Trust's former Deputy\u000d\u000a      Chair said: \"A major impact\u000d\u000a      of the Leicester research was to demonstrate beyond doubt to the UK\u000d\u000a      football authorities the\u000d\u000a      relevance and importance of research. This impact is still felt in the\u000d\u000a      modern game &#8212; the Premier\u000d\u000a      League and Football League today are much more research-aware as a result\u000d\u000a      of the Football Trust\u000d\u000a      initiative in partnership with the University of Leicester.'' (A)\u000d\u000a    The Head of Supporter Service at the Premier League also testifies to the\u000d\u000a      impact of this early work\u000d\u000a      into the assessment period: \"The work on National Supporter Surveys\u000d\u000a      initiated and conducted for\u000d\u000a      the Premier League at the University of Leicester was ground-breaking. No\u000d\u000a      other sport anywhere\u000d\u000a      in the world had conducted research of this kind, or in this sort of\u000d\u000a      detail. It certainly has had a major\u000d\u000a      practical impact on the way in which Premier League football clubs\u000d\u000a      understand their supporters\u000d\u000a      and their needs. The importance of research on the demographics of fans\u000d\u000a      and on their match-day\u000d\u000a      habits, pioneered at the University of Leicester, remains something which\u000d\u000a      is central to our current\u000d\u000a      work on developing and improving football supporter services.'' (B)\u000d\u000a    (b) Shaping policy and underpinning anti-racism and equality\u000d\u000a          initiatives\u000d\u000a    Leicester's research has impacted on the national policy work of the\u000d\u000a      Professional Footballers\u000d\u000a      Association (PFA) and The Football Association (FA). Dr Williams has\u000d\u000a      worked closely with the PFA\u000d\u000a      and FA and with national anti-racism organisations Sporting Equals\u000d\u000a      and Kick It Out throughout the\u000d\u000a      assessment period to ensure the findings of Leicester's work are\u000d\u000a      translated into practice. Williams\u000d\u000a      has chaired one of only two major anti-racist strategy groups in England\u000d\u000a      (Foxes Against Racism)\u000d\u000a      and was a founder member of the Asians in Football Forum.\u000d\u000a    Steven Bradbury and Jim Lusted each produced Leicester-based research\u000d\u000a      co-funded by The FA\u000d\u000a      and the PFA, respectively, on racism in football that fed directly into\u000d\u000a      national policy at local and\u000d\u000a      national levels. Williams contributed to research which has informed\u000d\u000a      national policy on sport for\u000d\u000a      people with learning disabilities.\u000d\u000a    A former Chair of the Professional Footballer's Association and the\u000d\u000a      current Governance and\u000d\u000a      Regulation consultant on The FA Group said: \"The work of these colleagues\u000d\u000a      from Leicester has\u000d\u000a      collectively demonstrated the ways in which barriers to progression in\u000d\u000a      football for both black and\u000d\u000a      South Asian people operate in both institutional and very practical,\u000d\u000a      everyday ways... for example, it\u000d\u000a      has indicated definitively that some professional club staff and local\u000d\u000a      football officials still held rather\u000d\u000a      stereotypical views of some ethnic minorities.\u000d\u000a    \"This research was instrumental in the introduction of more race\u000d\u000a      monitoring at football academies\u000d\u000a      and race awareness training in the professional game. It was also\u000d\u000a      instrumental in developing\u000d\u000a      recent `ant-racist' policies, including those adopted by the Professional\u000d\u000a      Footballers Association, to\u000d\u000a      increase the numbers of black coaches in football by proposing that at\u000d\u000a      least one candidate for\u000d\u000a      every senior coaching\/managing job in the professional game is from a\u000d\u000a      minority ethnic\u000d\u000a      background.''\u000d\u000a    He also confirmed that Jim Lusted's work on County FAs had impacted on\u000d\u000a      the development of FA\u000d\u000a      policy for dealing with racism at the local level and fed directly into\u000d\u000a      The FA's policy development on\u000d\u000a      race awareness issues. \"The research indicated how members of local County\u000d\u000a      FAs inadvertently\u000d\u000a      discriminated against ethnic minorities and offered recommendations for\u000d\u000a      change. These\u000d\u000a      recommendations have been instrumental in the establishment, inside The\u000d\u000a      FA, of forums to\u000d\u000a      produce policy on opposing race exclusion in local football. The research\u000d\u000a      has also been central in\u000d\u000a      the establishment of Race Equality Advisory Groups at national and local\u000d\u000a      County FA level, thus\u000d\u000a      ensuring more representation, and more equal treatment, of people from\u000d\u000a      minority ethnic\u000d\u000a      backgrounds in local football.\"\u000d\u000a    He said: \"Williams has also been a key figure in promoting, through his\u000d\u000a      research, better access for\u000d\u000a      young South Asians and (my own) new coach bursary programme, The Whole\u000d\u000a      Game Initiative, has\u000d\u000a      drawn extensively on some of these Leicester findings and will have a\u000d\u000a      major impact in promoting\u000d\u000a      more opportunities in professional football for BME coaches.''

Its impact on Special Olympics and on sport for people with\u000d\u000a      learning disabilities has been to\u000d\u000a      help directly to shape future policy in this area and to help people\u000d\u000a      working in this field develop their\u000d\u000a      strategies on issues such as media coverage of learning disability sport,\u000d\u000a      ethnicity and Special\u000d\u000a      Olympics, the importance of volunteering, and the structure of future\u000d\u000a      games.

It covered economics, attendances, crowd\u000d\u000a      behaviour, player discipline\u000d\u000a      and stadium redevelopment. (1) Between 1994 and 2001, in detailed annual\u000d\u000a      national fan surveys\u000d\u000a      funded by the English Premier League (2) and the Football League (3),\u000d\u000a      Leicester published the first\u000d\u000a      large-scale analyses of the changing national demographics and patterns of\u000d\u000a      consumption and\u000d\u000a      behaviour of sports crowds conducted anywhere in the world.\u000d\u000a    Racism and inequalities in sport\u000d\u000a      Building on the influential work by Prof Eric Dunning and Leicester\u000d\u000a      colleagues on racism in sport\u000d\u000a      (4), the research centre collaborated with the FA Premier League, the\u000d\u000a      Football League, the PFA\u000d\u000a      and the anti-racism body Kick It Out at the turn of the\u000d\u000a      millennium. This new research was initiated\u000d\u000a      to discover the extent to which clubs had responded to specific Task Force\u000d\u000a      recommendations\u000d\u000a      surrounding social inclusion. This work was jointly funded by the\u000d\u000a      Professional Footballers\u000d\u000a      Association and the ESRC. It involved an extensive survey of professional\u000d\u000a      football clubs to\u000d\u000a      investigate the ways in which clubs had attempted to engage with their\u000d\u000a      local minority ethnic\u000d\u000a      communities around issues of playing, scouting, spectating, policing and\u000d\u000a      employment. In total,\u000d\u000a      staff at 88 professional clubs returned completed questionnaires\u000d\u000a      representing a 96% response\u000d\u000a      rate. Effectively, this report (5-7), which was the first of its kind,\u000d\u000a      provided a unique national audit of\u000d\u000a      a series of anti-racist strategies by professional football clubs in\u000d\u000a      England aimed at combating\u000d\u000a      racism and promoting social inclusion within the game. Key findings\u000d\u000a      included:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Whilst around one-third of clubs explained minority ethnic\u000d\u000a        non-attendance at their clubs\u000d\u000a        matches in terms of fan concerns over racism (32%) and also cost (33%),\u000d\u000a        a smaller, but\u000d\u000a        significant number of clubs persisted in using familiar cultural\u000d\u000a        stereotypes, such as views that\u000d\u000a        minority ethnic groups `like other sports' (24%) or that their members\u000d\u000a        are prevented from\u000d\u000a        attending matches because of religious and cultural factors (11%).\u000d\u000a      More than half (57%) of all clubs were unaware of any recent incidents\u000d\u000a        of racism amongst\u000d\u000a        spectators at their home matches. These included some clubs whose\u000d\u000a        supporters had actually\u000d\u000a        been involved in high profile incidents of racist chanting during the\u000d\u000a        1999\/2000 season.\u000d\u000a      Three-quarters (76%) of all clubs felt it unnecessary to do more work\u000d\u000a        specifically with black and\u000d\u000a        Asian fans. Over half (52%) of all clubs also felt they were already\u000d\u000a        open to all fans.\u000d\u000a      Whilst about 10% of young players aged 14+ in youth academies and\u000d\u000a        schools of excellence\u000d\u000a        were black, only 1.6% of these (estimated at 71 young people) were of\u000d\u000a        South Asian origin.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    This research is complemented by John Williams's later equity work at\u000d\u000a      Leicester on gender and\u000d\u000a      fandom and the experiences and demands in sport of people with learning\u000d\u000a      disabilities, and by Jim\u000d\u000a      Lusted's published findings, based on Leicester research, on the\u000d\u000a      implementation of The Football\u000d\u000a      Association's Ethics and Sports Equity Strategy. From 2004, Lusted studied\u000d\u000a      the implementation of\u000d\u000a      The FA's Ethics Equity Strategy, which aimed to tackle inequalities,\u000d\u000a      including racism, in English\u000d\u000a      football, particularly in the often overlooked local, grass-roots form of\u000d\u000a      the game. Case studies of\u000d\u000a      five County Football Associations were undertaken to assess the\u000d\u000a      implementation of the strategy,\u000d\u000a      involving 57 semi-structured interviews with local football stakeholders\u000d\u000a      and participant observation\u000d\u000a      at County FA and National FA offices.\u000d\u000a    Research found resistance to change among long-standing County FA\u000d\u000a      Governance personnel,\u000d\u000a      attributed to components of amateurism including `paternalism',\u000d\u000a      `protectionism' and `fairness'.\u000d\u000a      Here, many saw the equality strategy itself as being unfair and causing\u000d\u000a      fresh problems, as it was\u000d\u000a      argued to support `preferential' treatment of some members over others. It\u000d\u000a      also found that the `club\u000d\u000a      cultures' of County FAs were informed by ideas about `race', often derived\u000d\u000a      from Victorian British\u000d\u000a      colonialism; this, despite widespread denials from key personnel of any\u000d\u000a      racism in the game. (8)\u000d\u000a    Sport and disability\u000d\u000a      Between 2008 and 2010, Williams was the lead researcher in the first ever\u000d\u000a      socio-historical study of\u000d\u000a      sport for people with learning disabilities in the UK and of Special\u000d\u000a      Olympics GB. Using original\u000d\u000a      sources, the research charted SOGB's origins and wider impact, its complex\u000d\u000a      relationship with the\u000d\u000a      IOC, its funding, underpinning philosophy and growth, and also some of the\u000d\u000a      limitations of its\u000d\u000a      training activities and reach. It reflected on the future policy\u000d\u000a      challenges faced by SOGB in a diverse\u000d\u000a      modern Britain and an increasingly harsh economic climate. This work was\u000d\u000a      collaborative with\u000d\u000a      historians at De Montfort University, but Williams led the research group.\u000d\u000a    Funded by Leicester City Council and SOGB the research produced:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The first ever observational and interview-based empirical analysis of\u000d\u000a        the processes involved in\u000d\u000a        bidding for and hosting a `mega-event' of this kind.\u000d\u000a      A qualitative analysis of the experience of athletes, family members,\u000d\u000a        volunteers and spectators\u000d\u000a        at the Games, one which directly addresses critical concerns about the\u000d\u000a        alleged `separatism' of\u000d\u000a        Special Olympics in the wider context of the relationship between\u000d\u000a        learning disability and sport.\u000d\u000a      The first ever quantitative analysis of local public perceptions of\u000d\u000a        the Games and of people with\u000d\u000a        learning disabilities. This involved three local public surveys: six\u000d\u000a        months before the Games;\u000d\u000a        during and immediately after the Games; and six months after the event.\u000d\u000a      A critical discourse and content analysis of the media (especially the\u000d\u000a        television) coverage of the\u000d\u000a        Games. (8)\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    The key Leicester researchers involved in this body of work were:\u000d\u000a      Eric Dunning (1960 - present, currently Emeritus)\u000d\u000a      John Williams (1979 - present)\u000d\u000a      Steven Bradbury (1998-2002)\u000d\u000a      Jim Lusted (2004-2008)\u000d\u000a    Research in the sport and inequality area continues at Leicester. In 2013\u000d\u000a      Williams has been\u000d\u000a      working in with Sporting Equals, the sports equality and policy\u000d\u000a      body, on evaluating equality policies\u000d\u000a      at Premier League football clubs. From Oct 2013 Sporting Equals\u000d\u000a      will co-fund a PhD studentship\u000d\u000a      on the exclusion of British South Asians from UK sport.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43970","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Burdett's work for the UK Government's Urban Task Force and later the\u000d\u000a      London Olympic Delivery Authority (see below) is part of a more sustained\u000d\u000a      engagement with better urban living, brownfield sites re-development, and\u000d\u000a      green city economies that has been carried out by LSE Cities:\u000d\u000a    A. Brownfield Sites and More Liveable Places: The `framework of\u000d\u000a      design principles for creating more liveable places', and criteria for the\u000d\u000a      evaluation of urban proposals developed by Burdett for the UK government's\u000d\u000a      Urban Task Force (of which Burdett was a member), formed the basis of\u000d\u000a      recommendations to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the\u000d\u000a      Regions (DETR) to `revise planning and funding guidance to: discourage\u000d\u000a      `density' and `overdevelopment' as reasons for refusing planning\u000d\u000a      permission' (Urban Task Force, p 85). The findings of Density and\u000d\u000a        Urban Neighbourhoods in London were presented to DETR and Cabinet\u000d\u000a      Office officials in the period leading to the formulation of new policies\u000d\u000a      on urban development. As a result, policy recommendations on `designing\u000d\u000a      for quality' and `making the best use of land' were included in Planning\u000d\u000a      Policy Guidance 3: Housing (PPG3) issued by the DETR in 2000 and\u000d\u000a      subsequent revisions Planning Policy Statement 3: Housing (PPS3) in 2006\u000d\u000a      and 2011 (Source A).\u000d\u000a    These policies signalled a shift in favour of intensification of\u000d\u000a      brownfield sites across English cities, with measurable impacts on urban\u000d\u000a      policy, including the London Plan (the Mayor's strategic development\u000d\u000a      framework). Burdett's research and role as Adviser on Architecture and\u000d\u000a      Urbanism to the Mayor of London (2000-2006) contributed to the GLA policy\u000d\u000a      document Housing for a Compact City (2003, pp. 19 &amp; 21). This\u000d\u000a      forms the basis of the Density Matrix which recommends minimum density\u000d\u000a      levels of new development in sites in relation to their public transport\u000d\u000a      accessibility levels (pg. 26), and has been adopted by the 2004 London\u000d\u000a      Plan (Table 4B.1, pg. 177) and its replacement (Table 3.2, pg. 85, London\u000d\u000a      Plan (2011), (Source B) as well as the London Housing Design Guide (GLA,\u000d\u000a      2010, pg. 29) and Housing Supplementary Planning Guidance (GLA, 2012, pg.\u000d\u000a      32).\u000d\u000a    The direct effect of these policies was to shape local government urban\u000d\u000a      policy in favour of higher density developments in areas with good public\u000d\u000a      transport accessibility. Key examples include revised planning frameworks\u000d\u000a      by the London boroughs of Hackney (Core Strategy: Hackney's strategic\u000d\u000a      planning policies for 2010-2015, 2010, pp. 114-115, 158) and Tower Hamlets\u000d\u000a      (Core Strategy and Development Control Plan, 2007, pp. 291-292). This\u000d\u000a      strategy was adopted in major publically-funded regeneration projects like\u000d\u000a      the 2012 Olympics in East London, endorsed by the Mayor of London in the\u000d\u000a      Olympic Legacy Strategic Planning Guidance (OLSPG, 2012).\u000d\u000a    B. The London Olympics: Burdett played an instrumental role in\u000d\u000a      creating the design brief for the Olympics and legacy masterplan as Chief\u000d\u000a      Adviser on Architecture and Urbanism to the Olympic Delivery Authority\u000d\u000a      (ODA) from 2006 to 2010 (Source C). In this capacity he applied the\u000d\u000a      principles of the `compact and well-connected city model' to the wider\u000d\u000a      Olympic site in East London. He further advised on the design of\u000d\u000a      individual venues, the Athletes' Village and public spaces. The impact has\u000d\u000a      been the delivery of an integrated urban plan that connects the Olympic\u000d\u000a      Park to surrounding areas and existing communities, creating a dense and\u000d\u000a      diverse `piece of city' rather than a gated community, \"making sure that\u000d\u000a      the buildings at the Olympic Park [met] high standard quality of design\",\u000d\u000a      thereby influencing professional standards in architectural practice in\u000d\u000a      the UK (Source D). This approach has been adopted by the London Legacy\u000d\u000a      Development Corporation which oversees development of the Olympic site for\u000d\u000a      the next decades, and is recognised by the London Plan (2011).\u000d\u000a    The positive impact of this methodology led to a series of key policy\u000d\u000a      appointments in the UK and abroad. Burdett was commissioned to lead the\u000d\u000a      development of the city plan for the municipality of Genova (where he was\u000d\u000a      Chief Adviser to the Mayor, 2008-11, (Source E). He carried out a\u000d\u000a      similar role as Scientific Coordinator for the city plan of Parma\u000d\u000a      (2008-2011) and was on the Steering Committee for the Milan Expo from 2008\u000d\u000a      to 2011. In 2012 he became a member of the UK Airports Commission in\u000d\u000a      recognition of his expertise on global cities and their development\u000d\u000a      (Source F).\u000d\u000a    C. Cities and the Green Economy: Rode's research on cities and the\u000d\u000a      green economy has been adopted by the United Nations Environment Programme\u000d\u000a      in its influential Green Economy Report which is designed to motivate\u000d\u000a      policymakers at a global level to create the enabling conditions for\u000d\u000a      increased investments in a transition to a green economy (Source G). A\u000d\u000a      survey by LSE Cities on the way 90 global cities are managing transition\u000d\u000a      to the green economy has stimulated policy debate within ICLEI (Local\u000d\u000a      Governments for Sustainability) while detailed studies on green policies\u000d\u000a      in EU and US cities are being adopted by municipal authorities. Commenting\u000d\u000a      on a study by LSE Cities, the Mayor of Stockholm noted \"The report from\u000d\u000a      the LSE will be a valuable tool in shaping the future Stockholm and in\u000d\u000a      planning for meeting our challenges.\" (Source H).\u000d\u000a    D. Urban Age and Wider Reach: Through conferences, research and\u000d\u000a      outreach activities, the Urban Age (Burdett and Rode) has established a\u000d\u000a      distinctive research agenda and an international network of urban\u000d\u000a      policy-makers and scholars, demonstrating unique reach in the fields of\u000d\u000a      urban planning, sustainable development and governance. 4,600 experts have\u000d\u000a      taken part in 13 major conferences since 2005 (six conferences with 3,000\u000d\u000a      participants during 2008-13).

The research resulted in the\u000d\u000a      formulation of a design methodology founded on `the compact and\u000d\u000a      well-connected city'. This establishes a `framework of design principles\u000d\u000a      for creating more liveable places'. It sets out the criteria for assessing\u000d\u000a      quality in urban proposals and establishes the argument that planning\u000d\u000a      approval should be dependent on minimum levels of density according to\u000d\u000a      levels of public transport accessibility (Reference 1).\u000d\u000a    The Burdett et al study of Density and Urban Neighbourhoods\u000d\u000a        in London provided objective evidence of urban residents' responses\u000d\u000a      to living in higher density in five wards in London (2). The study was\u000d\u000a      based on in-depth interviews with local actors; analysis of the urban\u000d\u000a      layout and public transport accessibility levels; a quantitative survey of\u000d\u000a      1,917 residents; and a literature review. The findings indicate that most\u000d\u000a      residents have ambivalent opinions about density; higher levels of\u000d\u000a      satisfaction are determined by access to public transport, open spaces,\u000d\u000a      shops and social facilities; there is greater dissatisfaction in\u000d\u000a      relatively densely populated wards where high levels of deprivation\u000d\u000a      coincide with concentrations of ethnic minorities, large social housing\u000d\u000a      estates or crowded living conditions.\u000d\u000a    Burdett and Rode have coordinated successive Urban Age conferences and\u000d\u000a      associated research initiatives on the social and spatial dynamics of\u000d\u000a      global cities. Research includes quantitative and qualitative data on\u000d\u000a      urban governance, planning, transport, urban form, social exclusion,\u000d\u000a      health and well-being focusing on formal and informal processes of urban\u000d\u000a      change in 17 global cities in rapidly urbanising regions (3).\u000d\u000a    Rode's work examines the risk-adjusted costs and benefits of green policy\u000d\u000a      frameworks on the sustainable economic growth of cities in geographies at\u000d\u000a      different trajectories of development (4). The findings of the research\u000d\u000a      provide evidence that the physical form and infrastructure of cities are\u000d\u000a      key determinants of their energy consumption footprint and pattern of CO2\u000d\u000a      emissions. In addition, it gives new insights on the effectiveness of\u000d\u000a      urban policies and governance structures in managing the transition to the\u000d\u000a      green economy over a 20-year period in the cities of Stockholm, Copenhagen\u000d\u000a      and Portland (5).\u000d\u000a    Colantonio, Burdett, and Rode's research investigated how the cities of\u000d\u000a      Barcelona, Turin, Munich, and Seoul responded to the economic downturns of\u000d\u000a      the 1980s (6). Based on semi structured interviews with key stakeholders\u000d\u000a      and a review of policy interventions and economic performance, the study\u000d\u000a      demonstrates how aligned and proactive regional and metropolitan\u000d\u000a      governance, integrated spatial planning and economic regeneration, and\u000d\u000a      collaboration between local industries, universities and foundations have\u000d\u000a      a strong impact on fostering more resilient urban economies and job\u000d\u000a      creation.\u000d\u000a    Key Researchers:\u000d\u000a      LSE Cities is an interdisciplinary centre that carries out research\u000d\u000a      linking the physical and social dimensions of cities (Prof Ricky Burdett,\u000d\u000a      Centre Director), sustainable cities and the green economy (Philipp Rode,\u000d\u000a      Senior Research Fellow and Graham Floater, Principal Research Fellow),\u000d\u000a      resilient urban economies (Dr Andrea Colantonio, Research Fellow),\u000d\u000a      economic and urban sociology (Dr Fran Tonkiss, Reader in Sociology) and\u000d\u000a      urban ethnography (Dr Suzanne Hall, Lecturer in Sociology\/Research\u000d\u000a      Fellow).

The definition is now widely cited and Lang's role\u000a      acknowledged (e.g., International Union of Nutritional Science World\u000a      Congress, Burlingame speech, September 2013) [1]. Lang was invited to\u000a      present sustainable diets to the European Commission meeting on\u000a      mainstreaming sustainable lifestyles in Brussels (22.08.11). He gave\u000a      invited papers on sustainable diets to UN bodies (FAO, UN Environment\u000a      Programme, World Health Organization (WHO)) and argued that consumers need\u000a      more coherent advice from industry and government. He addressed WHO's\u000a      planning meetings for the International Conference on Nutrition 2 (ICN2)\u000a      (2013) and the FAO (2013). He gave an invited keynote on the European\u000a      sustainable diets experience (the sole non-US presentation) to the US\u000a      National Academies of Science's Institute of Medicine, Washington DC at a\u000a      two-day science conference preparing for the 5-year review of US dietary\u000a      guidelines (2013) [2]. He addressed governmental meetings on sustainable\u000a      diets: e.g., France DuALINE (Paris, 2010), Netherlands Food Agency 10th\u000a      Anniversary Conference (Rotterdam, 2010) and contributed to the\u000a      Netherlands sustainable food position (2011).\u000a    (b) NGOs\/ Organised Civil Society: The CFP presented at NGO\u000a      meetings between 2011 and 2013 and actively helped to create a 31 NGO Eating-Better\u000a      alliance launched in July 2013. WWF, the world's largest conservation NGO,\u000a      cites CFP as the inspiration for its Livewell project created by\u000a      WWF to link health and environmental criteria in population advice and\u000a      replace the government's Eatwell plate. This is now being rolled\u000a      out across Europe and globally by WWF [3]. Due to his research on public\u000a      procurement, Barling was asked to chair the Good Food on a Public Plate\u000a      Project (public procurement of sustainable local food, 2005 ff) and Good\u000a      Food for Our Money Campaign (2009 ff) at Sustain, shaping public policy\u000a      interest in this sphere, e.g., at the London Olympics on fish policy [4].\u000a    (c) Food Industry: After resistance in the 1990s and 2000s, the\u000a      sustainable diet argument now receives industry attention. Rayner\u000a      (Honorary CFP Fellow) and Lang were invited members of the European Heart\u000a      Network Working Party on working with Industry (2010) and clarified `terms\u000a      of engagement'. Barling and Lang were invited to meet retailers e.g.,\u000a      Marks &amp; Spencer, Waitrose and Tesco regularly (between 2008 and\u000a      2013). In a 2010 article in The Grocer, following summary research\u000a      on declining soil health, Lang challenged retailers to help consumers to\u000a      conserve soil. In 2011, Asda completed its soil guide [5].\u000a    (d) Foundations and Funders: Lang was invited to review nutrition\u000a      and environment work for the Boards of the Wellcome Trust (2011) and\u000a      Carasso Foundation (2013). Lang was invited to join the Carasso Foundation\u000a      (international, Paris-based) Science Committee, which is now exploring the\u000a      CFP's proposal for an international commission on sustainable diets.\u000a    (e) UK Government: Following the SDC sustainable diet\u000a      recommendations, Lang was consulted by the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA),\u000a      Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and Department\u000a      of Health, which led to the FSA creating the Integrated Advice to\u000a        Consumers programme (noted by many government processes in Europe,\u000a      North America, Australia but closed by the UK Government in 2010).[6]\u000a      Between 2011 and 2012 the Environmental Audit Committee held a Sustainable\u000a      Food inquiry and supported the CFP call for clarification of sustainable\u000a      diets.\u000a    Changed localities (Caraher and Lang)\u000a    CFP research on changed localities has achieved impact through:\u000a    (a) Local Authorities: Caraher's mapping of fast food outlets around\u000a      schools (conducted for Preston and City &amp; Hackney) is now being\u000a      replicated in four cities: Glasgow, Sandwell, Oldham and London (in many\u000a      of its boroughs). The Mayor of London worked with the Chartered Institute\u000a      of Environmental Health to produce a Takeaways Toolkit for local\u000a      authority use, citing Caraher (2013) [7]. This work was cited by the UK\u000a      Research Councils as an example of impact. It is also cited in the London\u000a        Health Inequalities Strategy (August 2009), the Greater London\u000a      Authority and Mayor's strategy. Caraher was invited to be a member of the\u000a      London Food Board between 2007 and 2009 and advised the Mayor of London's\u000a      food strategy; Lang stood in for him (2009 ff). Glasgow's Centre for\u000a      Population Health drew on Caraher's work in Tower Hamlets. Caraher's work\u000a      has also emphasised the role of planning to protect consumers from\u000a      excessive fast food offer. It contributed to the development of National\u000a      Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) Public Health Guidance on\u000a      the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease (Caraher was a member of the\u000a      group which developed the Guidance) and also informed a NICE group on\u000a      planning (of which he was also a member) as a public health issue. The\u000a      role of planning is also being developed in Australia, with Caraher\u000a      invited onto the Brisbane Queensland University of Technology planning\u000a      team on health literacy (2012 to 13) and the Melbourne City review (2013)\u000a      [8].\u000a    (b) NGO \/ Civil Society: The CFP is cited as directly inspiring\u000a      the creation of Incredible Edible Todmorden by Pam Warhurst (ex-Forestry\u000a      Commission chair and Todmorden resident) [9]. This is the much-lauded\u000a      civic initiative revitalising a post-industrial Lancashire town through\u000a      citizenship action on food, now an international small town network\u000a      growing food in urban space. It is presented as the urban model in\u000a      Jonathan Porritt's utopian book The World We Made (2013). Lang\u000a      also regularly advises the Transition Towns movement.\u000a    (c) Government: Caraher was invited onto the Scottish\u000a      Government's Food and Drink Policy aiming for sustainable localism. He is\u000a      also a member of the Advisory Committee, Scottish Strategic Research\u000a      Programme 2011-2016; and was a member of the Scottish Government's\u000a      `think-tank' on `Local versus Global for Scottish Food Producers &amp;\u000a      Consumers' (2011).\u000a    Food Citizenship as health literacy (Caraher, Lang,\u000a        Barling)\u000a      The CFP has a long record on the research of health within citizenship.\u000a      Examples include:\u000a    a) Food and Cooking Skills: Caraher and Lang began work on this\u000a      in the 1990s. Between 2008 and 2010 Caraher led a cooking intervention\u000a      trial which became key evidence supporting NGO pressure for cooking to be\u000a      reintroduced in English schools, successfully negotiating the transition\u000a      from Labour to the Coalition. They were consulted in (and informed)\u000a      behind-the-scenes discussions in the Dimbleby and Vincent School Food\u000a        Plan presented to Secretary of State Michael Gove (2012) [10].\u000a      Caraher and Lang are frequently asked to advise those lobbying for reform.\u000a      Since 2008, they regularly meet Jamie Oliver, Raymond Blanc, the Academy\u000a      of Culinary Arts (top chefs) and a wide group of NGO and public health\u000a      bodies. The CFP was invited by Jamie Oliver and the Prince of Wales to a\u000a      stakeholder meeting on cooking and food skills, prior to the School Food\u000a      Plan publication. The CFP hosted its 1st (now annual) Food\u000a      Symposium on Food Skills in October 2010). A day earlier, the UK\u000a      Government launched its own joint Skills Council review of skills needed\u000a      in the food industry which reported in 2011.\u000a    b) Food provenance. Lang's notion of Food Miles continues\u000a      to get traction, both critical and laudatory, in the issue of shortening\u000a      supply chains to build consumer trust. Barling's work on Ethical\u000a      Traceability (EU research and book) informed CFP public engagement\u000a      following the EU horsemeat scandal (2013) which exposed long chain\u000a      failings in governance. Lang undertook 70 media interviews in six weeks.\u000a      Confidential industry engagement followed (e.g., Marks &amp; Spencer,\u000a      Tesco, Asda-Walmart) with Tesco committing to reduce the length and\u000a      complexity of supply chains to meet consumer trust concerns [11].\u000a      Following the National Audit Office report on horsemeat (2013), Lang was\u000a      invited to meet and discuss the citizenship critique with the entire Food\u000a      Standards Agency Board (5th November 2013) and with the Chief\u000a      Executive `one-to-one' in August and November.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The Centre for Food Policy (CFP) at City University London uses applied\u000a      research to develop `public interest' approaches to understanding the\u000a      relations between food systems and consumers. A key focus is the tension\u000a      between `food citizenship' and consumerism. Our research has long asked\u000a      how food policy-makers can address and improve citizenship interests when\u000a      faced with both `old' social divisions (inequalities, poverty, poor market\u000a      access) and `new' pressures (energy-water-biodiversity footprints,\u000a      environmental knowledge deficits, de- and re-skilling). Our impact has\u000a      been in promoting policies to reshape the conditions for good, low impact\u000a      consumption through: (a) generating high-level debate about sustainable\u000a      diets (what to eat) at population and individual levels; (b) identifying\u000a      and mapping the cultural and spatial realities that shape consumer\u000a      choices; and (c) foregrounding the challenge of health literacy.

We conceptualise this relationship as a tension between food\u000a      consumerism and citizenship. In line with our commitment to researching\u000a      the `public interest' in food policy, we are interested in how consumers\u000a      collectively may make the transition to what we term `food democracy'\u000a      (see: www.foodfirst.org\/en\/node\/2868).\u000a      The CFP team comprises Professors Tim Lang and Martin Caraher and Dr David\u000a      Barling. We study specific examples to see where the public interest lies\u000a      and whether problems are framed to support citizenship. Our research may\u000a      be grouped thus:\u000a    a) Re-defining `good diet' as `sustainable diet' (Lang,\u000a        Barling, Caraher)\u000a      Nutritionists and official guidelines recommend consumers eat fish, yet\u000a      fish-stock data justify concerns about unsustainability. The CFP\u000a      researched such examples as evidence of general contradictions between\u000a      evidence and reality in health, environmental and price signals. In Development\u000a        Policy Review (2003), Public Health Nutrition (2005),\u000a        Health Promotion International (2006), Proceedings of Nutrition\u000a        Society (2013), Food Policy (OUP, 2009) and Unmanageable\u000a        Consumer (Sage, 2006), we explored the limitations of choice for\u000a      consumers, prefiguring the `choice-editing' argument adopted by the\u000a      Sustainable Development Commission (SDC). The case that environmental\u000a      impact can lower if health advice is followed was made for SDC's Setting\u000a        the Table (2009), but this would require major behaviour change.\u000a      Following that, Lang developed a `poly-values' or `omni-standards' model\u000a      as a way of capturing the competing and diverse demands on consumer\u000a      choice. Barling explored the food system transitions shaping citizenship\u000a      in two 7th Framework projects, FoodLinks and PureFood\u000a      (see Grants, below). Caraher has injected the local and inequalities\u000a      dimension of the food `offer' (see below). Barling and Lang summarised the\u000a      food waste and sustainable diets challenges for the UN Environment\u000a      Programme (UNEP) (2012) which made sustainable diets a key recommendation.\u000a    b) Changed localities where consumers eat: role of local state\u000a      (Caraher and Barling)\u000a      Barling has researched English local government urban food strategies (EU\u000a      7th Framework Purefood Marie Curie project, 2010 to 2014), with a\u000a      PhD researcher funded for three years. In City &amp; Hackney Health\u000a      Authority London, Caraher mapped fast food sellers in relation to\u000a      proximity to schools, defining the visual and physical walk-to-school\u000a      experience. In Preston, Lancashire, he explored whether consumers could\u000a      access healthy food in local shops and at what cost. In Tower Hamlets, he\u000a      focused on the prevalence and spread of fast food outlets, finding that\u000a      around schools, fast food outnumbered `healthier' outlets five to one. At\u000a      city scale he compared the differential response to fast-food outlet\u000a      proliferation in London and New York (NYC), finding that NYC was more\u000a      active and engaged across multiple fronts (from planning to consumer\u000a      education), whereas London prioritised health education over policy\u000a      intervention. With Machell, then a research assistant (now a PhD student),\u000a      Caraher researched the role of food co-operatives in London and NYC as\u000a      possible ameliorating forces, empowering citizens to eat better and live\u000a      healthier.\u000a    c) Health literacy within food citizenship (Caraher and\u000a        Lang)\u000a      Caraher and Lang began research on the then unfashionable issue of cooking\u000a      skills in 1993 and deepened their analysis between 2008 and 2013. Caraher\u000a      conducted the first intervention trial to see whether teaching cooking\u000a      skills affects children's fruit and vegetables consumption; it does (Appetite\u000a      2012). In Liverpool, he investigated community-based cooking interventions\u000a      with families and schools and found that the impact of intervention lasts\u000a      longer than expected. Caraher was an original (2008 to 2009) and also\u000a      update (2013) co-author of the Hastings systematic review of marketing\u000a      impact on children's food intake. Lang researched the scenarios of\u000a      consumer and food system changes for Chatham House in a small academic\u000a      team (between 2006 and 2009) and theorised the shift from consumers\u000a      seeking `value-for-money' in food to `values-for-money' (Environment\u000a        &amp; Planning A 2010). Caraher conducted studies in Preston (2008)\u000a      and Hackney (Revista Portuguesa de Saude Publica 2009 and since)\u000a      which showed how local environments shape health options by sapping\u000a      children's spending power. In Preston, people's eating habits and\u000a      consequent health were constrained by food costs in local shops. In two\u000a      papers (JHEI of Australia 2011; Food Transgressions 2013),\u000a      he criticises the idea that the lifestyles of low income consumers are to\u000a      blame for poor diets, arguing that resource mal-distribution is more\u000a      significant.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44389","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3057568","Name":"Slovakia"},{"GeoNamesId":"732800","Name":"Bulgaria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"3057568","Name":"Slovakia"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"},{"GeoNamesId":"453733","Name":"Estonia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Many state-of-the-art features of ESS procedures have found their way\u000a      beyond the infrastructure, impacting the methodological standards employed\u000a      by other survey organisations and programmes and feeding into their\u000a      statistical outputs. For instance, a collaborative project led by\u000a      Fitzgerald to develop a new methodology for cross-national pre-testing led\u000a      to much of its approach being adopted from 2009 by a key collaborator in\u000a      the USA, the National Center for Health Statistics. This is America's\u000a      largest health protection agency and conducts national and international\u000a      surveys. ESS methods have also been adopted by major international survey\u000a      programmes. The European Quality of Life Survey, conducted by the European\u000a      Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions\u000a      (Eurofound), used the ESS as a benchmark for improving its methodology in\u000a      20079. The 2011 EQLS benefited from these methodological\u000a      improvements. The work of Eurofound contributes to the planning and design\u000a      of better living and working conditions in Europe via the European\u000a      Commission. The Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE)\u000a      was also influenced by the methodology of the ESS, for example adopting\u000a      its translation approach10, benefiting SHARE fieldwork in 2008\u000a      and 2009. SHARE is Europe's first ERIC and its findings feed into policy\u000a      discussions on the key issue of an ageing society. ESS question modules\u000a      have had impact beyond the ESS. For example, many of the ESS Trust in\u000a      Justice questions have been adopted as part of the EC measures for this\u000a      domain (the Euro-Justis project to assess public confidence in justice),\u000a      providing attitudinal indicators on this key societal issue at a European\u000a      level.\u000a    The ESS methodology has been adopted in specific countries participating\u000a      in the ESS by government departments, commercial fieldwork agencies and\u000a      the private sector. A survey among ESS National Coordinators11\u000a      in 2012 revealed that the Estonian Ministry of Social Affairs and\u000a      Education had benefited from ESS methodology &#8212; seminars about the ESS were\u000a      held in 2009 and learning from the ESS applied to Ministry-funded\u000a      initiatives such as the Programme for the International Assessment of\u000a      Adult Competencies (PIAAC) study in 2011; Polish ESS National Coordinators\u000a      have provided ESS-based training for the National Bank of Poland and ARC\u000a      Market and Opinion, a commercial research institute (in 2011 and 2012,\u000a      respectively); and commercial fieldwork agency GfK Slovakia has since 2011\u000a      adopted the ESS contact form to monitor respondent contacts, a major\u000a      fieldwork agency in Germany (INFAS, INFRATEST DIMAP). The ESS TRAPD\u000a      (translation, review, adjudication, pre-testing and documentation)\u000a      approach to translation was used in a survey of Muslims in North-Rhine\u000a      Westphalia in 2011 and published by the Ministry for Work, Integration and\u000a      Social Affairs.\u000a    ESS has also had a substantive impact. Developing better measures of\u000a      well-being and progress is a shared goal internationally, supported by the\u000a      Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) World Forum\u000a      and European Commission. The UK Government is committed to developing\u000a      wider measures of well-being so that Government policies can be more\u000a      tailored. The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Wellbeing Economics was\u000a      established in 2009 to support this agenda, with the New Economics\u000a      Foundation (`nef') providing the secretariat. nef is a major player in UK\u000a      and international debates in this area and regularly uses ESS data. In\u000a      2006-2007 nef worked with the ESS Director and team to develop an ESS\u000a      module on well-being to inform its National Accounts of Wellbeing project12,\u000a      which calls for governments to directly and regularly measure individuals'\u000a      subjective well-being. The project website was launched in 2010, including\u000a      a tool enabling individuals to measure their own well-being based on ESS\u000a      questions, which were used to create the National Accounts of Well-being\u000a      Indicators. The Office of National Statistics (ONS) Measuring National\u000a      Well-being Programme, which commenced in 2010 and publishes articles and\u000a      reports on its findings, seeks to provide a fuller picture of society by\u000a      supplementing existing economic, social and environmental measures. In\u000a      support of the programme, the ONS has analysed ESS core questionnaire\u000a      items measuring life satisfaction and happiness, and the Round 3 ESS\u000a      module on Well-being. ONS measures of subjective well-being were also\u000a      developed following discussions with nef about its Round 3 ESS findings.\u000a      In addition, the Strategy and Analysis Team at the Cabinet Office has\u000a      deployed evidence from the ESS to mainstream the concept of well-being\u000a      across Government13.\u000a    The ESS module on Experiences and Expressions of Ageism (2008-2009),\u000a      developed by Professor Dominic Abrams (University of Kent), the ESS\u000a      Director and their teams, was used to `reframe the debate' on attitudes to\u000a      ageing, another significant issue for governments worldwide. The module\u000a      was complemented by an in-depth programme of work between the University\u000a      of Kent, Age UK and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)14.\u000a      In 2009 the team approached the DWP about an analysis of the attitudes\u000a      towards ageing data. The DWP commissioned the team to produce reports\u000a      using the ESS ageing data, working in collaboration with a senior\u000a      researcher at DWP. The ESS Director and his team held a seminar at the DWP\u000a      in 2013 on this topic to introduce the DWP and other Government analysts\u000a      to the ESS dataset and present the ESS findings. The Coordinators of the\u000a      EU and UK Year for Active Ageing and Intergenerational Solidarity also\u000a      discussed ESS data at this event, underlining the importance of preparing\u000a      for an ageing society.\u000a    The Round 5 module on Trust in Justice (2010-2011) was developed by Dr\u000a      Jon Jackson (London School of Economics and Political Science), the ESS\u000a      Director and their teams and was designed to provide evidence on\u000a      procedural justice. The research has shown that fairness is not simply a\u000a      desirable feature of justice systems but a precondition for effective\u000a      justice. The project's impact has been to persuade key policy people in UK\u000a      Government and the justice system that institutional legitimacy is central\u000a      to the formation and application of justice policy15. Its\u000a      impact is identifiable by changes in the attitudes of key stakeholders,\u000a      reflected in commendations of the work (National Audit Office)16,\u000a      commissioning of further related work (Ministry of Justice) and\u000a      applications of principles (HM Inspectorate of Constabulary) where\u000a      `legitimacy targets' have been added to senior officers' Key Performance\u000a      Indicators. The work has featured in the broadcast media and in the\u000a      national press. For example, the research has also been taken up in Radio\u000a      4 programmes including Andrew Marr's Start the Week and a\u000a      three-part serial on policing by Mark Easton. The ESS Director and his\u000a      team organised a seminar on the findings, which was hosted by the Centre\u000a      for European Policy Studies, a leading Brussels think-tank, and attended\u000a      by senior officials from the EC. The Director was invited to organise a\u000a      seminar at the UK Cabinet Office on this topic further to discussions\u000a      about the ESS dataset with members of the Well-being and Analysis Unit of\u000a      the Cabinet Office. This took place in October 2012.\u000a    Also within the UK, the National Centre for Social Research, NatCen\u000a      (where the UK ESS National Coordinator is housed) collaborated with Dr Rob\u000a      Ford (University of Manchester) to use ESS immigration questions on the\u000a      2011 British Social Attitudes (BSA) Survey (to be repeated in 2013). When\u000a      published in the 29th BSA report in September 2012, this work\u000a      attracted much comment and debate in the media and policy circles. For\u000a      example, the Migration Observatory prepared a briefing on the issue using\u000a      BSA and ESS data. The Migration Observatory provides authoritative,\u000a      evidence-based analysis of data on migration and migrants in the UK to\u000a      inform media, public and policy debates.\u000a    Tracking the non-academic impact of the ESS datasets beyond the UK is a\u000a      formidable task, but examples show similar processes taking place at an\u000a      international level. For instance, the ESS Director and his team were\u000a      invited to convene a seminar at the OECD in Europe in January 2013 to\u000a      discuss findings from the ESS module on work and the recession, feeding\u000a      into their wider programme of work on this topic. They also convened a\u000a      seminar in December 2012 at the European Policy Centre in Brussels on the\u000a      results of the welfare module, attended by senior EC officials and\u000a      representatives of many third-sector organisations. Examples from a survey\u000a      of ESS National Coordinators (NCs) in 2012 show how ESS findings have been\u000a      used in reports from local administrations in Germany, often as a\u000a      reference distribution for local surveys, for example on migration. ESS\u000a      findings have also appeared in reports by German Federal Offices and\u000a      Ministries. The Bulgarian national team has produced publications to aid\u000a      decisions in diverse policy fields. For example, the book authored by the\u000a      NC, Wellbeing and trust, published in 2010, used ESS data and was\u000a      used in the actualisation of immigration legislation.\u000a    ESS findings have also appeared in the press and are available to the\u000a      general public. The launch in July 2013 of the ESS Findings booklet\u000a      was covered in the UK by The Today Programme, during the CNBC News\u000a      flagship morning news programme and in the Sunday Times and The\u000a        Guardian. The ESS Director and his team gave media interviews. The\u000a      Polish national ESS team held a series of dissemination conferences since\u000a      the third round of the ESS from 2008 onwards for a mixed audience\u000a      involving politicians, representatives of public administrations at all\u000a      levels and NGOs. The Bulgarian national team has organised press\u000a      conferences after each round of ESS that address key areas for policy. For\u000a      example, the release of ESS data and analyses of satisfaction with the\u000a      health service presented in 2011 at a press conference provoked wide\u000a      public debate. The Slovakian NC team has held a similar event to that in\u000a      Bulgaria and made a TV documentary about the ESS in 2012, aired on state\u000a      television, including an interview with the ESS Director.\u000a    The ESS questionnaire, developed by the ESS Director and his City-based\u000a      team in collaboration with other international experts and then fielded\u000a      according to a methodology developed with his CST, has had a direct\u000a      influence on the policy process in the UK17 and across Europe.\u000a      The UK Universities Minister, David Willetts, writing to other Ministries\u000a      represented on the ESS ERIC Steering Committee in June 2011, stated that\u000a      the ESS enables `governments, policy analysts and scholars to keep up with\u000a      societal trends that affect how democracy is working and how European\u000a      citizens perceive their lives, their nation and the world'18\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The European Social Survey (ESS) is a major biennial cross-national\u000a      social survey in which 36 countries in and beyond the European Union have\u000a      participated. It monitors change and stability in the social, moral and\u000a      political fabric of Europe and uses and sets high standards of\u000a      cross-national measurement. Its impact is extensive, both nationally and\u000a      internationally, and occurs in two main domains:\u000a    Improving survey methodology: The ESS sets new and improved\u000a      methodological and coordination standards in cross-national survey\u000a      research, providing higher quality data outcomes for ESS and, through the\u000a      subsequent adoption of these standards and practices by other national and\u000a      international survey programmes, higher standards of measurement in\u000a      policy-oriented surveys and commercial survey practice. As a result the\u000a      ESS methodology has pioneered better quality statistics which contribute\u000a      to improved quality and reliability for outcomes that rely on the data\u000a      across Europe.\u000a    Influencing the policy making process and society: ESS's\u000a      high-quality biennial social survey datasets and associated dissemination\u000a      activities have facilitated immediate and easy use of ESS data and\u000a      findings by a wide variety of stakeholders. Academics worldwide have\u000a      analysed ESS data and research results.

Other key\u000a      researchers in the City team include Rory Fitzgerald (at City since 2004\u000a      and ESS Director since 2012) and Eric Harrison (at City since 2006). The\u000a      ESS Director provides academic leadership across the ESS network, which\u000a      includes a Core Scientific Team (CST) (six leading European social science\u000a      institutions), a Scientific Advisory Board, a Methods Board, Question\u000a      Module Design Teams (leading European social scientists who win a\u000a      competition to design a module in collaboration with the CST) and National\u000a      Coordinators (who realise the ESS in their countries according to the\u000a      Director's specification).\u000a    The underpinning research comprises the rounds of the ESS and the\u000a      substantive analysis and methodological innovation arising from them.\u000a      While ESS outputs are necessarily collaborative, the ESS Director and team\u000a      are the driving force of the enterprise, ensuring extensive pan-European\u000a      collaboration, ensuring high methodological standards and overseeing the\u000a      research agenda. The Director and team have particular responsibility for\u000a      co-designing and pre-testing the question modules. The underpinning\u000a      research is structured as follows.\u000a    Survey methodology: This includes the cumulative effects of the\u000a      ESS methodology, which set new standards in cross-national research1,\u000a      in areas such as sampling, questionnaire design, response measurement,\u000a      fieldwork design, cross-national harmonisation, data archiving and access2.\u000a      Previous cross-national survey enterprises were often blighted by a lack\u000a      of comparability due to poor or non-existent harmonisation and\u000a      coordination. The ESS therefore adopted a more directive approach, with\u000a      the CST working closely with national teams in developing the survey. The\u000a      methodological aspirations of the ESS are summarised in a specification3\u000a      outlining how the survey is to be conducted by each National Coordinator.\u000a      The ESS Director and CST lead the coordination and development of the\u000a      survey's methodology.\u000a    Substantive datasets: These include data from five rounds of the\u000a      ESS along with cumulative datasets4. The datasets are based on\u000a      the ESS core questionnaire (e.g., institutional trust, political\u000a      engagement and well-being) and rotating modules designed with substantive\u000a      experts following a Europe-wide competition (e.g., immigration, democracy\u000a      and health inequalities). The questionnaire takes an average of one hour\u000a      to complete. The ESS Director works closely with the teams, developing\u000a      questions that are effective cross-nationally and meet the underlying\u000a      measurement aims. A new methodology for cross-national pre-testing was\u000a      developed specifically for this5. The ESS Director and team at\u000a      City are also responsible for the content of the core questionnaire. Over\u000a      60,000 users worldwide have registered on the ESS website, around 90% of\u000a      whom are academic users, many then publishing using the data, which in\u000a      turn generates non-academic impact. Around 10% of users are `non-academic'\u000a      users, for example Government, private enterprise, non-governmental\u000a      organisations (NGOs) and private citizens. A major component of the ESS's\u000a      recent outreach strategy since 2010 has been to embed `pathways to impact'\u000a      in the project's arrangements, in particular in producing and\u000a      disseminating results from its rotating modules and core questionnaire.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44390","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The CFP has influenced food policy by injecting ideas into policy\u000d\u000a      discourse and influencing high-level policy-makers and bodies in the UK\u000d\u000a      and internationally. Here we provide seven examples.\u000d\u000a    (i) Establishment of the Council of Food Policy Advisors\u000d\u000a    As a result of proposals in a CFP paper [2005, see section 2], the\u000d\u000a      Council of Food Policy Advisers was created in 2008 by Hilary Benn, then\u000d\u000a      Secretary of State for the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural\u000d\u000a      Affairs (Defra). Council membership represented diverse sectors and\u000d\u000a      experience to help drive Government thinking on how to identify priorities\u000d\u000a      and integrate appropriate policy across sectors. Lang was appointed to the\u000d\u000a      Council. This body was widely credited with championing a new drive for\u000d\u000a      (and integration of) food policy issues in central government, e.g.,\u000d\u000a      generating the Fruit and Vegetables Taskforce, normalising the notion of\u000d\u000a      sustainable diets and helping formulate Defra's landmark Food 2030\u000d\u000a      policy framework to address the impact of food consumption on both human\u000d\u000a      and environmental health and the general unsustainability of the food\u000d\u000a      system [1], [2], [3].\u000d\u000a    (ii) `Food Matters' policy report \u000d\u000a    When he became Prime Minister, Gordon Brown responded to CFP analysis in\u000d\u000a      Social Policy &amp; Administration (2002) by requesting the first\u000d\u000a      UK review of integrated food policy since the Ministry of Food was\u000d\u000a      abolished in 1955. The review prioritised health and environmental\u000d\u000a      outcomes. Lang and Barling were invited to become two of the six-strong\u000d\u000a      advisory group. A civil servant on CFP's MSc was seconded back to co-write\u000d\u000a      the report. The publication of the data summary (January 2008) and the Food\u000a        Matters final report (July 2008 [4]) were widely welcomed in policy\u000d\u000a      circles and fuelled a seven month internal Whitehall debate which resulted\u000d\u000a      in the creation of a new Cabinet Sub-Committee &#8212; the Domestic Affairs\u000d\u000a      (Food) Committee (DA(F)) &#8212; to lead on better integration of industry,\u000d\u000a      health, environment and cultural thinking. The DA(F) was chaired by Hilary\u000d\u000a      Benn at the Ministerial level, with a cross-UK senior civil servant\u000d\u000a      liaison committee created in parallel between England and Devolved\u000d\u000a      Administrations.\u000d\u000a    (iii) Sustainable Development Commission Reports\u000d\u000a    The Prime Minister appointed CFP Director, Lang, to the Government's\u000d\u000a      Sustainable Development Commission (SDC). Lang led and co-authored a\u000d\u000a      series of SDC reports issuing formal advice to Government, including Looking\u000a        Back, Looking Forward: Sustainability and UK Food Policy 2000-2011\u000d\u000a      (March 2011) [5] and Food Security and Sustainability: the perfect mix\u000d\u000a      (July 2009) [6].\u000d\u000a    (iv) Tackling Obesity\u000d\u000a    The CFP accepted an invitation from the Chief Scientist's Foresight\u000d\u000a      programme in December 2005 to summarise the role of policy in tackling\u000d\u000a      obesity. This was the only policy strand of work undertaken in the major\u000d\u000a      \"Tackling Obesities\" project and final report. CFP proposals on the need\u000d\u000a      to address ecological public health and `policy cacophony' helped drive\u000d\u000a      the rare collaboration of three Departments of State and resulted in the\u000d\u000a      &#163;0.3 billion `Healthy Weight Healthy Lives' programme 2007 to 2010 [7].\u000d\u000a      Two CFP members were appointed to the Expert Advisory Group and played\u000d\u000a      active parts in design and delivery until its closure by the Coalition in\u000d\u000a      2011.\u000d\u000a    (v) Influence on Food Companies\u000d\u000a    The CFP is regularly invited to be a `firm but acceptable critic' to food\u000d\u000a      companies by giving speeches, having private meetings, auditing and\u000d\u000a      critiquing industry practice. Examples since 2008 are: meeting Marks &amp;\u000d\u000a      Spencer about Plan A (2009, 2010); speaking at two Waitrose closed\u000d\u000a      strategy meetings (2011 and 2012); addressing the UK grain trade (2013);\u000d\u000a      discussing with IGD (a food industry research body with 750 corporate\u000d\u000a      members) how to address the `omni-standards' for the auditing of food\u000d\u000a      sustainability which are now emerging with WRAP and IGD [8]. To obviate\u000d\u000a      conflicts of interest the CFP does not accept funding from the food\u000d\u000a      industry.\u000d\u000a    (vi) Cabinet Office, Whitehall Briefings and Select Committee\u000d\u000a          Enquiries\u000d\u000a    The CFP has frequently provided private UK Cabinet Office and Whitehall\u000d\u000a      briefings and representation at Select Committee Enquiries. Examples\u000d\u000a      include: (a) Barling advised the creation of new UK food security\u000d\u000a      indicators (2008 to 10); (b) Lang asked to meet the Chair of the\u000d\u000a      Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) before the Food Security inquiry about\u000d\u000a      its remit and goal, after the SDC's closure; (c) appearing before the EAC\u000d\u000a      sustainable food inquiry (CFP Honorary Fellow Clutterbuck was an EAC\u000d\u000a      advisor); (d) appearing before the EFRA committee inquiry into food\u000d\u000a      security [9].\u000d\u000a    (vii) European Union policies\u000d\u000a    The CFP was invited to present a paper on Common Agricultural Policy\u000d\u000a      reform to EU Commissioners for Health and Agriculture by the pan-EU NGO\u000d\u000a      Agriculture and Rural Consortium in 2010 [10]. CFP 6th and 7th\u000d\u000a      Framework projects inform policy-making on environment and knowledge-based\u000d\u000a      bio-economy via EU Directorate General (DG) Research, a long-term impact.\u000d\u000a      Barling was invited to be expert advisor to the DG Sanco food chain\u000d\u000a      committee. Caraher was appointed to Ireland's influential SafeFood\u000d\u000a      Advisory Committee in 2010.\u000d\u000a    (viii) United Nations\u000d\u000a    The CFP's work on integrated policy has been referenced by multiple\u000d\u000a      agencies in the UN system. Professor Olivier De Schutter, Special\u000d\u000a      Rapporteur on Right to Food, read Food Wars as he began his term\u000d\u000a      and says this was one of his early influences [11]. In 2009, he invited\u000d\u000a      Lang to advise on Responsibilities of Transnational Corporations in the\u000d\u000a      food sector, co-organised with the European Centre for Constitutional and\u000d\u000a      Human Rights and supported by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The Centre for Food Policy (CFP) at City University London has analysed\u000d\u000a      the food system's dynamics and impacts and how policy shapes and addresses\u000d\u000a      its challenges. CFP influence has taken two forms:\u000d\u000a    (1) Injecting the case for integrated policy analysis into policy\u000d\u000a          debates. For example:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Establishing Ecological Public Health as a reasoned intellectual\u000d\u000a        framework, for instance in the Chief Scientist's Foresight Obesity\u000d\u000a        project as a unifying perspective, binding different disciplines and\u000d\u000a        data in the much-cited obesity `systems map'.\u000d\u000a      Shaping food policy discourse, manifest in Defra's Food 2030\u000d\u000a        policy framework (2010).\u000d\u000a      Taking the case to the food industry, during and after the food\u000d\u000a        commodity price `spike' (2007 to 2008) and the horsemeat scandal (2013).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    (2) Advising high-level policy-makers. For example:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Proposing in 2005 the creation of and then serving on (2008 to 10) the\u000d\u000a        Council of Food Policy Advisors.\u000d\u000a      Advising the Cabinet Office for its Food Matters policy report\u000d\u000a        (2008) which led to the creation of a Cabinet sub-committee, the\u000d\u000a        Domestic Affairs (Food) Committee (DA(F)), chaired by Hilary Benn.\u000d\u000a      Appointment to the Expert Advisory Group on Obesity (2008 to 2010)\u000d\u000a        following the Foresight obesity project and advising the &#163;0.3bn Healthy\u000a          Weight Healthy Lives programme.\u000d\u000a      Advising United Nations bodies on integrated policy.\u000d\u000a      Being appointed as members of the Cabinet Office review of food policy\u000d\u000a        (2008).\u000d\u000a      Providing `inside track' Whitehall briefings to ministers, civil\u000d\u000a        servants, commissions and Select Committees as requested, e.g., on food\u000d\u000a        security following the commodity price `spike' (2008 to 2009).\u000d\u000a      Prime Ministerial appointment to the UK Sustainable Development\u000d\u000a        Commission enabling leadership and actions inside government e.g., on\u000d\u000a        food security and sustainability.\u000d\u000a      Appointment to Ireland's SafeFood Advisory Committee.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    City University London\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"City University, London","InstitutionName":"City University, London","PeerGroup":"C","Region":"London","UKPRN":10001478}],"Panel":"C         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a1.

This\u000d\u000a      integrated approach demands more robust and contextually-grounded policy\u000d\u000a      frameworks. Accordingly, our modern social science-based policy analysis\u000d\u000a      relocates policy-making from being the prime preserve of governments to a\u000d\u000a      continuing negotiation between multiple actors in potentially (and\u000d\u000a      sometimes actually) contested space. The result is a multi-level and\u000d\u000a      multi-sectoral analysis which captures the dynamics between policy-makers\u000d\u000a      concerning the role of food in society, health, ecosystems, industry and\u000d\u000a      economy. The CFP team (comprising Professors Tim Lang and Martin Caraher\u000d\u000a      and Dr David Barling, with Research Assistants and Honorary Fellows) has\u000d\u000a      researched these dynamics through grant-aided and independent research\u000d\u000a      projects and direct participation. CFP policy is to work with and for the\u000d\u000a      public (non-profit) interest. Since 2002, we have researched:\u000d\u000a    (1) The complexity of food policy analysis (Barling, Caraher, Lang\u000d\u000a          and Honorary Fellows)\u000d\u000a    We have explored how to juxtapose and synthesise disparate bodies of\u000d\u000a      evidence on food's impact on public health, environment, social justice\u000d\u000a      and consumer choice. Our analysis was first mapped out in Social\u000d\u000a        Policy &amp; Administration (2002) and extended in Food\u000d\u000a          Policy (OUP 2009; Highly Commended BMA book awards 2010) and Ethical\u000a          Traceability (Springer 2008). In each, we progressively built\u000d\u000a      the case for food systems change. The `evidence-based policy' approach,\u000d\u000a      epitomised by the medical Cochrane Collaboration thinking, while\u000d\u000a      appropriate for some issues, does not fully capture the realities of food\u000d\u000a      policy change. Our analysis continues (see Grants below). Specifically,\u000d\u000a      Lang co-wrote and led 5 papers at the Sustainable Development Commission.\u000d\u000a      Barling was a member of the EU ESF\/COST Forward Look: European Food\u000d\u000a        Systems in a Changing World (published 2009) where he, Lang and\u000d\u000a      Rayner (CFP Fellow) wrote a `state-of-the-art' paper on European Food\u000d\u000a      Retail and Consumption trends. This work now seeks new metrics as part of\u000d\u000a      a global International Network for Food and Obesity Research, Monitoring\u000d\u000a      &amp; Action Support (INFORMAS) collaboration led by Auckland and Deakin\u000d\u000a      Universities, with an externally funded PhD.\u000d\u000a    (2) Policy analysis of food security as sustainability (Barling and\u000d\u000a          Lang). CFP research contributed to policy thinking about food\u000d\u000a      and sustainability and argued that sustainability requires capacities not\u000d\u000a      just for production and supply but also for environmental and social\u000d\u000a      capacities (Food Wars, 2004). Food Security and Sustainability\u000d\u000a      Policy Research was conducted in (a) funded research reports (Esme&#233;\u000d\u000a      Fairburn Foundation and Soil Association grants, 2006, summarised in J\u000d\u000a        Royal Society Arts, 2008) by Barling and Lang (2006 to 2010) and\u000d\u000a      amplified and deepened with the Chatham House Food Futures project (2006\u000d\u000a      to 2009); (b) the development of a 6-cell `omni-standards' multi-factor\u000d\u000a      check-list for food sustainability, first presented to the Institute of\u000d\u000a      British Geographers, then incorporated and expanded at the Sustainable\u000d\u000a      Development Commission by Lang (2006 to 2011); (c) special research by\u000d\u000a      Barling and Lang for UNEP's Avoiding Future Famines (2012)\u000d\u000a      contribution to the UN Rio+20 conference (2012) on sustainable consumption\u000d\u000a      and production. This work continues (see Grants section).\u000d\u000a    (3) The development of Ecological Public Health (EPH) as an\u000d\u000a          integrating framework for twenty-first century public health (Lang,\u000d\u000a          Rayner, Caraher). EPH is `big picture' theorisation. It\u000d\u000a      suggests that policy-makers need to reconnect the social and biological\u000d\u000a      traditions of ecological thinking. Here CFP has suggested new heuristics\u000d\u000a      for how to deal with complexity. We suggest policy-makers can order what\u000d\u000a      may otherwise appear a policy `jumble' by using four `dimensions' &#8212;\u000d\u000a      material, bio-physiological, social and cultural &#8212; to manage complex\u000d\u000a      information. Our research on EPH began in the early 2000s. It matured in\u000d\u000a      research on obesity for government (Obesity Reviews 2008) and in Food\u000a          Policy (2009, Oxford University Press). It was fully\u000d\u000a      articulated as an intellectual framework in Ecological Public\u000d\u000a          Health (Routledge, 2012; Highly Commended BMA 2013). Lang and\u000d\u000a      Rayner's BMJ (2012) article on EPH has had over 12,000 views\u000d\u000a      online. We are now applying this framework to various policy `hotspots'\u000d\u000a      e.g., (a) antibiotic over-use (Lang and Rayner: forthcoming Public\u000d\u000a        Health special issue, 8 papers); (b) corporate dominance of public\u000d\u000a      governance, e.g., UK Department of Health's Responsibility Deals (papers\u000d\u000a      in The Lancet 2010 and BMJ 2010); (c) Caraher's role in an\u000d\u000a      Australian Health &amp; Medical Research Council Aus$1.5M project on food\u000d\u000a      and obesity.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44512","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"49518","Name":"Rwanda"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"},{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Key findings from the studies outlined above have been shared widely with\u000a      international policy makers, NGOs and social work professionals to effect\u000a      significant changes in policy and practice relating to child welfare. The\u000a      results of the work conducted in Rwanda on family reunification, foster\u000a      care and street children were communicated nationally to government and\u000a      non-governmental agencies in Rwanda and internationally through Unicef,\u000a      Save the Children Alliance and the International Foster Care Association.\u000a      Findings of the study on children outside parental care in Bangladesh were\u000a      disseminated regionally through the Asian Office of Unicef and\u000a      internationally through Save the Children Alliance and the International\u000a      Committee on the Rights of the Child. The research has subsequently\u000a      influenced national policy in Rwanda, professional standards and best\u000a      practice for development workers in Africa and Asia, social work practice\u000a      for professionals in the United Kingdom, and legal representation in the\u000a      USA.\u000a    Impacts on national government policies in Rwanda.\u000a    The research on child protection and social welfare has informed the\u000a      development of policy in post-genocide Rwanda, including the `National\u000a      Policy on Orphans and Other Vulnerable Children' (2003), which draws on\u000a      the study foster care [3] and on findings reported in the study on street\u000a      children [1] in setting out its recommendations [a]. The work on\u000a      foster care particularly informed the strategy set out in section 6.2 of\u000a      that document, which describes the need to establish a legal framework for\u000a      fostering and adoption; raise awareness of the rights of children in\u000a      foster families; and develop effective methods of monitoring, reviewing\u000a      and sustaining care for children, particularly where they had been\u000a      spontaneously fostered. Key findings of an earlier (1998) report by Don&#224;\u000a      and others on street children were summarised in [1] and informed the\u000a      strategy set out in section 6.3 of the National Policy. This sets out\u000a      plans to reinforce existing programmes for the socio-economic and social\u000a      reintegration of street children, and to establish community-level\u000a      prevention mechanisms.\u000a    These policies were discussed and approved by the Rwandan Parliament in\u000a      2003, but have continued to have very significant effects during the\u000a      period of REF assessment. Prior to 2003, Rwanda had no comprehensive\u000a      policy at all addressing the needs of orphans and vulnerable children,\u000a      although the number of such children was &#8212; and remains &#8212; high. In 2011,\u000a      the Rwandan Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion (MGFP) estimated that\u000a      the number of children living in difficult circumstances was approximately\u000a      one million &#8212; one eighth of the population. By informing the\u000a      research-driven policies that continue to frame the social care of those\u000a      children, the recommendations resulting from the research outlined above\u000a      have continued both to feed into existing policy and strategic planning in\u000a      Rwanda and, thereby, to have important impacts on the lives of this large\u000a      proportion of its population. This on-going influence is evident, for\u000a      example, in the 2011 MGFP `Strategic Plan for the Integrated Child Rights\u000a      Policy', Section 2 (on `family and alternative care') and Section 7 (on\u000a      `Child participation'), which clearly reflect and respond to\u000a      recommendations arising from the research [b]. Don&#224;'s emphasis on\u000a      the need for legal frameworks for foster care has been especially\u000a      influential here, but so too has her call for child participation\u000a      throughout the foster care process, a recommendation based on the\u000a      development of the unique participatory methods of child welfare research\u000a      outlined above.\u000a    Impacts on professional standards and best practice: learning and\u000a        advocacy resources for development and social work professionals.\u000a    In addition to its impacts on policy development, that methodology has\u000a      had a significant influence on the training of and services provided by\u000a      professionals working in the field of international child welfare, and\u000a      informed a shift in the approach taken to child welfare by social care\u000a      practitioners around the world. These impacts on training and,\u000a      subsequently, on understanding and practice, arise particularly from best\u000a      practice recommendations made in the studies on foster care [3] and\u000a      children living outside parental care [4]. Since 2008, these have been\u000a      incorporated into training materials produced and used by UN child\u000a      protection officers and non-governmental agency staff working with\u000a      children in post-conflict emergency and development contexts. Thus, for\u000a      example, recommendations in [4] about the mechanisms for family support to\u000a      prevent institutionalisation appear in the 2008 Unicef document `What You\u000a      Can Do About Alternative Care in South Asia: an Advocacy Toolkit' [c].\u000a      The influence of the research is especially evident in the section on\u000a      strategies and tools to prevent institutionalization and family\u000a      breakdowns. The toolkit has been disseminated widely by the Unicef\u000a      Regional Office for South Asia and by the Kenya Network of Careleavers\u000a      (www.kesca.org\/), a youth organisation run by and for young people who\u000a      have grown up or spent part of their life in institutional care or\u000a      rehabilitation centres of some description.\u000a    Recommendations set out in [3] for setting up fostering programmes\u000a      likewise appear in a 2009 Action for the Rights of Children `Resources\u000a      Pack' [d], a capacity-building tool for child protection in and\u000a      after emergencies, which is available to all UN staff and Save the\u000a      Children workers. Guidelines for setting up individual foster and kinship\u000a      care arrangements (such as identifying willing families, providing\u000a      information, undertaking screening, and matching children with caregivers)\u000a      have also been adapted from [3] and incorporated into Save the Children's\u000a      2010 `Alternative Care in Emergencies &#8212; ACE &#8212; Toolkit' [e], which\u000a      was prepared for the Interagency Working Group on Separated and\u000a      Unaccompanied Children. The same study has had further international\u000a      impacts through its citation in the influential 2012 EveryChild document,\u000a      `Making Social Work Work: Improving Social Work for Vulnerable Families\u000a      and Children Without Parental Care Around the World'. Therein, it\u000a      particularly informs the recruitment of foster carers willing to undertake\u000a      short-term placements, as well as a system of effective planning for\u000a      children in foster care [f]. It is likewise used by the Better\u000a      Care Network (http:\/\/www.crin.org\/bcn),\u000a      a website set up by UN agencies and non-governmental agencies to increase\u000a      the global exchange of knowledge and experience about children without\u000a      parental care.\u000a    In addition to informing best practice in contexts of international\u000a      development and emergencies, Don&#224;'s research has also had impacts on\u000a      mainstream social care both in the UK and elsewhere, especially through\u000a      its use as the basis for learning and information resources. Various of\u000a      her publications, including [3] and [6], for example, are available to UK\u000a      professionals through `Social Care Online &#8212; Better Knowledge for Better\u000a      Practice' (www.scie-socialcareonline.org.uk),\u000a      the UK's largest database of information and research on all aspects of\u000a      social care and social work, which is used by childcare and social\u000a      workers. Guidelines on child participation in research have also been\u000a      developed in response to the success of the methodology outlined above.\u000a      These have been used to raise awareness among UK practitioners of the\u000a      importance of making children's voices heard through online advocacy\u000a      resources such as Social Care Online, and of the promotion of public\u000a      involvement in health and social care provided through the UK National\u000a      Health Services (2011) [g].\u000a    Legal practice.\u000a    Beyond its intended impacts on and benefits for both governmental and\u000a      non-governmental organizations in the countries in which it was conducted,\u000a      the research had some more surprising impacts elsewhere. Information on\u000a      customary foster care arrangements in Rwanda resulting from [3] has, for\u000a      instance, underpinned an expert testimony declaration prepared by Don&#224; in\u000a      February 2010 for US Law Firm Latham and Watkins LLP. This testimony was\u000a      submitted to the US Board of Immigration Appeals in support of an asylum\u000a      application from a young Rwandan girl hoping to join her adoptive mother,\u000a      a lawful permanent resident in the USA. On 31st March 2011, the Board of\u000a      Immigration Appeals (BIA) Executive Office for Immigration Review\u000a      overturned an initial decision to refuse asylum, largely on the basis of\u000a      the submission of the affidavit containing Don&#224;'s testimony. The following\u000a      excerpt from an email sent to Don&#224; by Latham and Watkins LLP indicates the\u000a      significance of her research findings for the security and welfare of this\u000a      single individual: `Please let me take a moment to express how very\u000a      appreciative we are of your efforts related to this case!

These were funded\u000a      in various combinations by Unicef, Italian Cooperation, the UK Department\u000a      for International Development, and Irish Aid. They were conducted in\u000a      partnership with the Governments of Rwanda and Bangladesh and with Save\u000a      the Children (UK and Sweden), whose representatives advised on the\u000a      research process, facilitated access to participants, and contributed to\u000a      the dissemination of key research findings. The first two of these\u000a      studies, which focused on family reunification and street children in\u000a      Rwanda, were initiated prior to Don&#224; joining UEL. The study on street\u000a      children (conducted in Rwanda in 1998 but analysed and written up\u000a      predominantly after 2000) was undertaken in partnership with Dr. Veale\u000a      (University College Cork, Ireland). However, a substantial portion of the\u000a      research &#8212; as well as the analysis and majority of the writing up of all\u000a      four studies &#8212; has been conducted since 2000. So, too, has the fieldwork\u000a      for the third and fourth studies, which examined foster care in Rwanda\u000a      (2000) and children living outside parental care in Bangladesh (2001).\u000a      Don&#224; led the studies on family reunification, foster care, and children\u000a      outside parental care. As such, she was responsible for their planning and\u000a      implementation, including the management of research teams, supervision of\u000a      data analysis, writing up of results and dissemination strategy. The\u000a      impacts described here arise particularly from the research conducted for,\u000a      and findings of, the 2000 and 2001 studies.\u000a    Despite their different geographical and situational foci, these studies\u000a      shared a common interest in promoting child protection in post-conflict\u000a      environments and increasing child participation in research, in line with\u000a      Article 3 (best interest of the child), Article 10 (family reunification)\u000a      and Article 20 (children deprived of a family) of the 1989 Convention on\u000a      the Rights of the Child. All four studies deployed a similar and\u000a      distinctive methodology consisting of an initial review of policy\u000a      documents and practice reports, followed by a period of empirical research\u000a      involving interviews, focus group discussions and participatory research\u000a      techniques with children; semi-structured interviews and\/or focus group\u000a      discussions with family and community members; and interviews with\u000a      government officials and service providers. The studies on foster care and\u000a      children outside parental care took a particularly distinctive approach,\u000a      engaging groups of children as advisors throughout the research process.\u000a      In total, 1,728 children and adults participated in the four studies.\u000a    Don&#224;'s research may be distinguished from much of the previous work on\u000a      child protection and social welfare by virtue of this integrative,\u000a      holistic and multi-layered approach, and by its positioning of children's\u000a      experiences in social contexts and in dialogue with those of families,\u000a      service providers and policy makers, rather than in isolation. The studies\u000a      described here explored the experiences, voices and wellbeing of refugee\u000a      and marginalized children generally, and of children in conflict areas\u000a      more specifically. The research included consideration of the life\u000a      experiences, expectations, protection and care arrangements for\u000a      unaccompanied minors in the aftermath of conflict and for children outside\u000a      parental care due to poverty or other family circumstances. Child\u000a      protection issues, humanitarian assistance and development debates were\u000a      all considered within social care frameworks and via participatory\u000a      methodologies.\u000a    Important insights from the studies included: the need to understand\u000a      local contexts (especially post-conflict environments) which influence\u000a      children's preference either for reunification with their families or for\u000a      alternative care; and the value of child participation in research about\u000a      child protection. These have contributed to understandings of child\u000a      protection, children's rights, and welfare in three key ways: first, by\u000a      challenging assumptions about the role and meaning of the `family` and\u000a      `family reunification' in post-conflict societies [1, 2] and of\u000a      `community' in contexts of poverty [1, 4], whilst also problematising\u000a      political, humanitarian and social interventions with children living in\u000a      difficult circumstances. Second, the studies have detailed the strategies\u000a      through which children can participate in decision-making processes on a\u000a      range of issues affecting their lives. This includes their involvement\u000a      throughout the social care process and at all stages of family\u000a      reunification, foster care and general social care [1, 2, 3, 4], and in\u000a      the research process [5, 6]. Finally, the studies have exposed three sets\u000a      of divergent discourses about the ways in which children forced to move as\u000a      a result of conflict or poverty are positioned within the global system of\u000a      nation-states. These are: children as product and\/or threat of\u000a      nation-states; discourses on the political and psychological child, and\u000a      narratives of visible and invisible children [7].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44639","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aGP Communication in Medical Consultations\u000d\u000aThe impacts made following the publication of the research findings contained within the Health\u000d\u000aarticle include:\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000ainfluencing the communication training of GPs with respect to shared decision-making in\u000d\u000aconsultations;\u000d\u000acontributing to a wider debate about the ways in which medics converse with patients and\u000d\u000alisten to their concerns\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aOne of the main findings of this research is that GPs draw upon a range of discursive devices to\u000d\u000aeffectively close off shared decision-making with patients.

His work focuses on the performative nature of these\u000d\u000adiscourses but also functions as a critique of them in terms of their usage as a means of control.\u000d\u000aThere is a strong focus across his work on impacting upon educational policy and pedagogy.\u000d\u000aRoberston et al. (2011) explores some of the ways in which GPs, although ostensibly seeking to\u000d\u000aengage patients in shared decision-making during consultations, nevertheless control the trajectory\u000d\u000aof the interaction through various `discursive devices'. These, in effect, work against shared\u000d\u000adecision-making and close off patient involvement. A major finding of this work is that although\u000d\u000apatients may rate their consultations as participatory and involving an element of shared decision-making,\u000d\u000athe analysis of actual conversations between GPs and patients reveals that this is not the\u000d\u000acase.\u000d\u000aThis draws on collaborative work on medical consultations with colleagues at Tayside Centre for\u000d\u000aGeneral Practice (TCGP) at the University Dundee School of Medicine, Ninewells Hospital in\u000d\u000aDundee. Investigators were awarded a Chief Scientists' Office award (reference: CZS\/1\/8, Title: A\u000d\u000adiscourse analysis of shared decision making in primary care, &#163;45,279) involving a PhD\u000d\u000astudentship. This led to a better understanding of the ways in which GPs and patients\u000d\u000acommunicate with one another in consultations and revealed the impediments to shared decision-making.\u000d\u000aAnother strand of work has focused on the discourse of graduate attributes and personalisation\u000d\u000awithin higher education. The book chapter entitled \"Hyperreal Higher Education\" focuses upon the\u000d\u000away in which higher education is now legitimated through a combination of discourses on graduate\u000d\u000aattributes and personalisation, particularly in relation to digital literacy. These conceptualisations\u000d\u000aare challenged and an argument is made for a more reflexive form of learning about the production\u000d\u000aand consumption of digital media. This work seeks to challenge the ways in which students are\u000d\u000aobjectified by these discourses and how they can be reconceptualised as part of a reflexive project\u000d\u000awith respect to life in a world of digital media and learning. Much of this work has fed into\u000d\u000aconsultancy work undertaken as part of the Scottish Enhancement Themes projects.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"44648","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aWaiton's body of work has had a direct impact on professionals working in social work, youth work\u000d\u000aand community education, including charitable organisations like Play Scotland and the Scottish\u000d\u000aParents Teachers Council (SPTC). It has influenced training, helped develop professional\u000d\u000aresources, informed public and practitioner debates, and contributed to campaigns.1\u000d\u000aThe high number of invited engagements and talks delivered by Waiton, often for voluntary\u000d\u000aorganizations, over a long period of time, demonstrate that he has played a significant role\u000d\u000ainforming public and practitioner debates and practices. In recognition of his role as a public\u000d\u000asociologist Waiton was invited to become a member of the Royal Society of the Arts, enhancing his\u000d\u000areputation as a leading public authority on issues within his field of expertise. This reputation also\u000d\u000aresulted in Waiton being invited to write a monthly column for the Times Education Supplement in\u000d\u000aScotland and subsequently being invited to write a column for the Scotsman. Waiton is also a\u000d\u000aregular contributor to national television and radio debate programmes.\u000d\u000aExamples of practitioner impact include Play Scotland, who reported2 that, `Dr Waiton's ....\u000d\u000aacademic arguments regarding the over regulation of young people's lives have been extremely\u000d\u000auseful for promoting the idea of free play and raising difficult issues and ideas regarding policies\u000d\u000adirected at both adults and children'. The Scottish Parents Teachers Council (SPTC) stated3, the\u000d\u000a`SPTC has found Dr Waiton's work useful for both raising debate amongst the membership and\u000d\u000aalso helping to add weight to concerns we have about aspects of government policy regarding\u000d\u000achildren and parents, issues around which we continue to lobby schools, local authorities and\u000d\u000apolicy makers'.\u000d\u000aAs the education charity Word Write further commented, `Dr Waiton's writings have been of great\u000d\u000abenefit to our education charity's work and stakeholders. His correspondence, articles, and now\u000d\u000abook, looking at the question of sectarianism, racism and the policing of football fans helped us to\u000d\u000adevelop an education and online programme examining the issue of racism and offensiveness in\u000d\u000asociety today'.4\u000d\u000aA Leading academic and youth work trainer5 also commented that, `Dr Waiton's work has been\u000d\u000awidely used. I have often drawn on [his] insights on anti-social behaviour policy in constructing\u000d\u000atraining programmes for youth work and for the police and in KE sessions with police, health\u000d\u000aservice and CLD'. As the head of HM Inspector of Education confirmed: `In 2010 Dr Stuart Waiton\u000d\u000agave an input on the subject \"Scared of the Kids\" to the Community Learning and Development\u000d\u000a(CLD) Professional Group within Education Scotland (formerly HM Inspectorate of Education). The\u000d\u000aCLD professional group is made up of HM Inspectors who have a particular focus on work with\u000d\u000ayoung people, inclusion and community capacity building. Dr Waiton's input was well received and\u000d\u000astimulated lively discussion amongst the group'.6\u000d\u000aWaiton's expertise on issues associated with antisocial behaviour and curfews has also resulted in\u000d\u000ahis work being referenced within government policy research documents7 discussing public space,\u000d\u000ayouth violence and also public perceptions of young people. This also led to Waiton being invited in\u000d\u000a2013 to provide written and oral evidence to the Education and Culture Committee inquiry into\u000d\u000ataking children into care.\u000d\u000aPerhaps most significantly, Waiton's research on the criminalisation of everyday life led to him\u000d\u000abeing invited to a meeting at the Scottish Parliament to discuss the proposed Offensive Behaviour\u000d\u000aat Football Bill. Following a written submission on this topic, Waiton was invited to contribute to the\u000d\u000aJustice Committee review of the Bill.8 The Clerk to the Justice Committee, within the limits of\u000d\u000aParliamentary probity, noted that, Waiton made a `positive contribution to the scrutiny of the\u000d\u000aOffensive Behaviour etc Bill', and that his `media appearances and writings....played a part in\u000d\u000agenerating awareness of the Bill'.9\u000d\u000aAlthough the Act passed, Waiton influenced the nature of the debate around sectarianism and\u000d\u000apolicing. The organiser of the main anti-sectarian body in Scotland, Nil By Mouth, noted that: `It\u000d\u000astruck me that [Waiton] was seeking to `widen' out the sectarianism debate from the narrow\u000d\u000aconfines of football and his contribution touched upon serious moral and ethical issues surrounding\u000d\u000afree speech and what does, or does not, constitute hate crime. Given the severity of the sentences\u000d\u000aunder the new legislation it is extremely important that these issues were raised and reflected upon\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aThis case study describes Waiton's research on `moral panics' around children, young people, and\u000d\u000afootball fans.

At the heart of this is the management of risk, the rise of `safety' based issues such\u000d\u000aas the erosion of `free play' for children, the policing of youth, concerns about adult and young\u000d\u000apeople's relationships, and the perceived `offensiveness' of football fans.\u000d\u000aWaiton's work on the rise of amoral panics has been disseminated widely across non-academic\u000d\u000afields. His major thesis is that as everyday life become `colonised' by professional interest groups,\u000d\u000apublic self-understanding and confidence is undermined. The intense regulation of language and\u000d\u000a`behaviour' concerning `hate', `vulnerability' and `offensiveness' encroaches on wider areas of\u000d\u000apublic life, such as young people and football supporters.\u000d\u000aThemes covered in Waiton's research build on work by others, in particular, Christopher Lasch's\u000d\u000awork on the professionalisation of social relationships, and Frank Furedi's analysis of therapeutic\u000d\u000aculture. Their claim that this represents not the rise of moral self-governance, but rather its erosion,\u000d\u000aprovides the framework for Waiton's Politics of Antisocial Behaviour: Amoral Panics and the\u000d\u000asurveillance paper Big Brother on Prozac.\u000d\u000aThe second edition of Scared of the Kids (2008) contained an introduction from the eminent youth\u000d\u000awork expert, Tony Jeffs, and was written with the specific aim of educating undergraduates\u000d\u000astudying youth, child and community based subjects. Scared of the Kids advances a critique of\u000d\u000acontemporary social policy and politics and proposes alternative approaches to policy practices\u000d\u000aand initiatives. A key idea is that of diminished subjectivity &#8212; the hollowing out of political and public\u000d\u000alife and the consequent undermining of `character' within individuals &#8212; constructed and accelerated\u000d\u000aby the deeper regulation of life, language and behaviour.\u000d\u000aThis theoretical work and policy based critique led to further studies of the English Riots (2011) and\u000d\u000a`intolerance' (2013) in the criminalisation of language and behaviour at football (2012). This\u000d\u000aresearch develops the on-going interest into the practice and consequence of over-regulating\u000d\u000aeveryday life in the construction of an `asocial' society and a `vulnerable public'.\u000d\u000aBased on this research, Waiton was invited to speak at numerous public debates at conferences\u000d\u000aand regular media appearances as a `public sociologist'. Waiton's current scholarship builds upon\u000d\u000athis public engagement and has led to invitations to speak at both public and academic events, and\u000d\u000ato write papers and chapters on these subjects. Most recently, Waiton has been invited to write\u000d\u000aabout intolerance in football, `Governing Through Tolerance', for Football and Bigotry in Scotland:\u000d\u000aPerspectives and Debate, edited by John Flint, Edinburgh University Press, 2013.\u000d\u000a"}]

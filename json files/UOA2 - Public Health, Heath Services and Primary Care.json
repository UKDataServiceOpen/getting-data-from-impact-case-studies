Out\u000d      of a population of 50 million people, 5.6 million are HIV+. On World Aids\u000d      Day in September 2009, South African President Jacob Zuma announced the\u000d      most significant government-led interventions to stem the AIDS epidemic\u000d      since its emergence more than 20 years ago, stating that extraordinary\u000d      measures are needed. He said that \"In order to meet the need for\u000d        testing and treatment, we will work to ensure that all the health\u000d        institutions in the country are ready to receive and assist patients and\u000d        not just a few accredited antiretroviral centres. Any citizen should be\u000d        able to move into any health centre and ask for counselling, testing and\u000d        even treatment if needed\". This research has had major impact on the\u000d      health policy to achieve this. The policy developments are all landmarks\u000d      in primary health policy and provision in South Africa, and have also been\u000d      applied in Gambia, Malawi, Brazil, Mexico and Portugal.\u000d    Because our research had shown PALSA PLUS to be both effective and\u000d      cost-effective, in 2010 the South African National Department of Health\u000d      adopted PALSA PLUS as the primary method of in- service training for nurse\u000d      practitioners in public sector primary care facilities throughout the\u000d      country. To implement this policy it contracted our partner, the Knowledge\u000d      Translation Unit at the University of Cape Town Medical School, to provide\u000d      the training, clinical guidelines and training materials (see\u000d      corroborating source C). By January 2013 the KTU had trained 1500 trainers\u000d      in all 8 provinces in South Africa, who had in turn trained 18,000 primary\u000d      care professionals in 1900 health facilities (of a total of 3500\u000d      nationwide). Supported by the STRETCH trial's evidence, in 2011 the South\u000d      African National Department of Health adopted Nurse-Initiated\u000d      Antiretroviral Treatment (NIMART) as national policy for the nationwide\u000d      expansion of ART in primary care.\u000d    The research programme started in 2000 with a WHO initiative to improve\u000d      tuberculosis control worldwide by increasing detection of infectious\u000d      cases. WHO's Practical Approach to Lung Health (PAL) programme encouraged\u000d      low and middle income countries to implement PAL guidelines for the\u000d      diagnosis and treatment of chronic lung diseases among primary health care\u000d      workers. In collaboration with WHO and South African health departments,\u000d      and with local primary care doctors and nurses, the researchers completely\u000d      redesigned the guidelines and educational methods and implemented them\u000d      throughout one province as PALSA (corroborating source A). After the PALSA\u000d      trial showed that the intervention was effective and highly popular, and\u000d      that large scale expansion was feasible, it became standard practice in\u000d      the Free State province from 2002 on. PALSA was then expanded, as PALSA\u000d      PLUS, to cover nurse-provided care of HIV and sexually transmitted\u000d      infections. After the second trial showed that PALSA PLUS was effective,\u000d      it became standard practice in two provinces in 2009\/10 and then\u000d      nationally in 2011. Subsequently, the researchers were commissioned by the\u000d      South African National Department of Health to expand the clinical\u000d      guidelines and training to include diabetes, hypertension, chronic lung\u000d      disease and depression, and started to evaluate it as the PC101 trial in\u000d      the Western Cape. Preliminary evidence from PC101 and engagement with the\u000d      National Department of Health led to it becoming the standard guidelines\u000d      and educational method for primary care nursing in South Africa\u000d      (corroborating source C).\u000d    Meanwhile the research programme addressed controversial policies on\u000d      antiretroviral treatment (ART) for HIV\/AIDS. KTU was contracted to monitor\u000d      and evaluate the Free State's HIV\/AIDS programme the programme, and to\u000d      manage all electronic medical patient records. Our finding that 53% of\u000d      patients died while awaiting ART but that when ART was received it reduced\u000d      mortality by 87% increased pressure on South African authorities to\u000d      accelerate ART roll-out and to initiate ART promptly in eligible patients.\u000d      A key problem though was the lack of doctors to provide ART, which only\u000d      doctors were authorised to prescribe. The researchers therefore developed\u000d      and helped the Free State provincial Health Department to implement\u000d      STRETCH - a radical breakthrough in enabling primary nurses to treat\u000d      HIV\/AIDS by training and authorising them to prescribe ART, in the face of\u000d      objections by the national Department of Health, HIV physicians, and the\u000d      South African Nursing Council. This intervention was at first permitted\u000d      only because it was implemented as a randomised trial (corroborating\u000d      source B). Nurse Initiated ART (NIMART) became national policy within\u000d      months of the end of the trial and is expected to greatly enhance access\u000d      to ART in South Africa. Any nurse needs to complete our training to be\u000d      authorised to prescribe ART. Between 2010 and 2011, 300,000 more people\u000d      started ART. ART expansion will greatly reduce morbidity and mortality due\u000d      to HIV\/AIDS, and help control the rampant tuberculosis epidemic.\u000d    Our research has also had wider international impact. In 2010 the\u000d      Malawian Ministry of Health began implementing PALM PLUS, a local\u000d      adaptation of PALSA PLUS. In 2011 the Gambian Department of Health &amp;\u000d      Social Welfare began to implement its adaptation of PALSA PLUS, and in\u000d      2012 started implementing NIMART based on the STRETCH model. PALSA PLUS\u000d      guidelines and training materials are also being used in Brazil, Mexico\u000d      and Portugal.\u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    In order to reduce morbidity and mortality from HIV\/AIDS, tuberculosis\u000d      and other chronic diseases, effective and cost-effective interventions to\u000d      strengthen primary care through in-service nurse training were put in\u000d      place as standard practice throughout South Africa (population 50\u000d      million), based on our research. This programme has so far trained 1500\u000d      trainers in all 8 provinces, who in turn have trained 18,000 primary care\u000d      professionals in 1900 of all 3500 clinics nationally.

For over ten years this research provided\u000d      evidence that these educational methods strengthen primary care in African\u000d      countries, with particular focus on HIV\/AIDS, tuberculosis and other\u000d      chronic diseases.\u000d    Practical Approach to Lung Health in South Africa (PALSA)\u000d      (2000-2010): UEA and South African researchers radically changed World\u000d      Health Organisation (WHO) clinical practice guidelines and educational\u000d      methods, aimed at integrating primary care of tuberculosis and other lung\u000d      diseases. A large pragmatic cluster randomised trial showed that the PALSA\u000d      education package, was effective, significantly increasing tuberculosis\u000d      case detection and appropriate emergency referrals and asthma treatment,\u000d      and was cost effective (research references 1-2).\u000d    PALSA PLUS (2004-2011): PALSA was expanded to cover HIV\/AIDS and\u000d      other sexually transmitted infections. A large pragmatic randomised trial\u000d      (research reference 3) showed that PALSA PLUS improved the quality of\u000d      HIV\/AIDS care provided by primary care nurses. The research also showed\u000d      that PALSA and PALSA PLUS increased tuberculosis cure and treatment\u000d      completion rates and reduced patient dropout.\u000d    Antiretroviral treatment (ART) expansion in South African primary care\u000d      (2004-2011): Novel statistical methods were used to evaluate ART\u000d      effectiveness using patient cohort data (research reference 4). This\u000d      provided the first rigorous evidence that ART in Africa could be highly\u000d      effective even when implemented on a large scale. These studies also\u000d      showed extremely high mortality rates among patients because of delays in\u000d      their starting ART.\u000d    Streamlining Tasks and Roles to Expand Treatment and Care for HIV\/AIDS\u000d        (STRETCH) (2007-2012): The PALSA PLUS guidelines and training\u000d      package was extended to cover initiation, monitoring and prescribing of\u000d      ART, and nurse-led HIV\/AIDS care which did not need doctors. This complex\u000d      intervention was compared with South African standard of care in a\u000d      MRC-funded pragmatic randomised trial (research reference 5). The trial\u000d      showed that nurse-led ART was as effective as doctor-led ART in preventing\u000d      deaths and in viral suppression, but was more effective in increasing\u000d      patients' weight and immunity, detecting tuberculosis and improving\u000d      treatment adherence. The cost effectiveness analysis (research reference\u000d      6) showed that STRETCH cost more than standard of care but was reasonably\u000d      cost effective.

There is little objective research evidence on which to base\u000d\u000a      policy and regulations.

These studies were used to show that compliance with microbial\u000d\u000a      indicators is a problem in many small- scale water supplies, resulting in\u000d\u000a      water of a quality that is not safe for consumption and a risk to public\u000d\u000a      health. Their economic assessment of the health benefits of improvements\u000d\u000a      to small water supplies (research reference 3) led directly to WHO\u000d\u000a      publishing guidance on social cost-benefit analysis of drinking-water\u000d\u000a      interventions (corroborating source B).\u000d\u000a    Bathing water legislation\u000d\u000a    It is estimated that, globally, over 120 million gastrointestinal\u000d\u000a      illnesses per year are caused by swimming and bathing in\u000d\u000a      wastewater-polluted coastal waters.

This research was led by Professor Hunter of\u000d\u000a      UEA Norwich Medical School, working with epidemiologists from UEA's\u000d\u000a      Schools of Environmental Science and International Development, and from\u000d\u000a      Europe, the USA and Africa.\u000d\u000a    Small and very small drinking water systems\u000d\u000a    Small and very small drinking water systems supply water from well,\u000d\u000a      borehole, spring or surface water sources instead of from large scale\u000d\u000a      public utilities. Hunter and colleagues at UEA completed a large cohort\u000d\u000a      study that demonstrated that children under 10 years of age in England who\u000d\u000a      are reliant on contaminated private small water supplies have more than 5\u000d\u000a      times the risk of diarrhoea than children whose water is not contaminated\u000d\u000a      (research reference 1). They have also shown that a high proportion of\u000d\u000a      such water systems suffer from microbiological contamination which is much\u000d\u000a      worse than in large, mains drinking water systems (research reference 2).\u000d\u000a      This contamination is highly correlated with environmental and climatic\u000d\u000a      variables.\u000d\u000a    Hunter and colleagues' economic analyses of water interventions to\u000d\u000a      improve small-scale water supplies in developed countries showed that they\u000d\u000a      reduce the direct and indirect costs of illness, outweighing the costs of\u000d\u000a      improving the supplies (research reference 3). Their epidemiological\u000d\u000a      modelling research quantified the impact of community water systems on\u000d\u000a      health in developing countries and highlighted the problems caused by the\u000d\u000a      unreliability of these supplies. It showed that even occasional days of\u000d\u000a      water treatment failure could lead to an almost total loss of the health\u000d\u000a      benefits of setting up these water sytems (research refererence 4).\u000d\u000a      Similar epidemiological modelling was also applied to developed countries\u000d\u000a      such as the UK and France, also highlighting the risks of small water\u000d\u000a      systems.\u000d\u000a    Recreational water quality\u000d\u000a    Hunter and colleagues' epidemiological research on recreational water\u000d\u000a      exposure has included case control and cohort studies, and methodological\u000d\u000a      research on methods of monitoring water quality.

AAAs affect more than 4% of\u000a      British men aged 65-74 and are responsible for over 6,800 deaths annually.\u000a      The MASS trial showed that screening could reduce AAA-related mortality by\u000a      42%. Implementation of the NHS AAA screening programme in started in 2009.\u000a      It was fully implemented in England by Spring 2013, offering `screening to\u000a      around 300,000 men every year during the year they turn 65' (1). Uptake in\u000a      the 2011-12 cohort of men invited for screening was 75%, according to the\u000a      latest report (1). In 2008 the Department of Health's (DH's) Impact\u000a      Assessment considered policy options for AAA screening and estimated that\u000a      each would provide a gain of at least 130,000 quality adjusted life years\u000a      (QALYS) over a 20 year period, and that the net value of the option\u000a      adopted was &#163;3,884million over 20 years, valuing the health benefit at a\u000a      social value of &#163;40,000 per QALY gained (p.3) (2).\u000a    The ministerial commitment to introduce a national AAA screening policy\u000a      was announced in 2008 as part of a statement by the UK Prime Minister on\u000a      the changes that would be made in what was the sixtieth year of the NHS\u000a      (3). The timescales throughout the UK varied slightly. The decision to\u000a      introduce a national screening programme in England had to be subject to\u000a      an Impact Assessment produced by the DH, and signed off by the relevant\u000a      minister (2). Published in July 2008 it explored the options and explained\u000a      why the preferred option was a screening policy for all men aged 65. Major\u000a      evidence references used in the Impact Assessment were the four RCTs\u000a      included in the Cochrane review, but especially the findings from the MASS\u000a      trial. The DH's Impact Assessment's analysis of costs relied heavily on\u000a      work primarily led by HERG in the MASS study: Buxton et al (2002), Kim et\u000a      al (2007). Highlighting the importance of MASS, the Impact Assessment\u000a      stated:\u000a    `The main elements of the cost analysis are therefore based on the\u000a      outputs and subsequent analysis from MASS....The unit costs for screening\u000a      and elective and emergency surgery operations are based on MASS\u000a      trials....An alternative cost base ... was also considered. However, the\u000a      MASS unit costs are more comprehensive and reliable, and are based on a\u000a      detailed bottom-up costing, taking into account patient-specific costs.'\u000a      (paras 44, 48) (3).\u000a    Further evidence to support the importance of the MASS study, and HERG's\u000a      contribution, in the policy decisions to set up a national screening\u000a      programme comes from the DH and MRC. The DH sent a letter on 15 June 2011\u000a      congratulating HERG on the work for Policy Research Programme: `This has\u000a      made a significant contribution to strengthening the evidence-base for\u000a      policymaking through a range of applied economic research. This has\u000a      included important contributions to the consideration of abdominal aortic\u000a      aneurysm (AAA) screening;' (DH, Head of Policy Research Programme) (4). In\u000a      2010 the MRC reported on findings from its first collection of data on\u000a      research impacts. The impact of the MASS stream of work on the\u000a      introduction of the national AAA screening programme was one of just eight\u000a      examples of policy impact that the MRC highlighted (5).\u000a    To get to the position in 2008 where ministers announced the decision to\u000a      introduce the screening policy, Buxton and other MASS team members had\u000a      undertaken extensive dissemination of the findings, both to the National\u000a      Screening Committee, which analysed the data and options in detail, and\u000a      also to relevant clinicians. Following the contribution made by Buxton to\u000a      the AAA screening decision, he was invited to become a member of the UK\u000a      National Screening Committee from 2009. On 31 March 2004 Buxton and others\u000a      addressed many stakeholders at a meeting, `Aneurysm Screening: The Facts\u000a      and the Future' called by the Vascular Surgical Society of Great Britain\u000a      and Ireland. It was widely covered by UK TV and print media, and the\u000a      proceedings were published (6).\u000a    In addition to documented evidence of influence on health policy, and\u000a      cost-effective, improved health services and clinical outcomes in the UK,\u000a      the MASS trial also had extensive international impact on advisory\u000a      committees, guidelines, and policies and helped generate improvements in\u000a      both publicly and privately funded healthcare services. This includes in\u000a      the USA and Europe.\u000a    A 2009 practice guideline from the US Society for Vascular Surgery drew\u000a      on the same four studies as the Cochrane review, and so again the MASS\u000a      study, contributing 67,800 of the 127,891 men included, had the most\u000a      influence. The guideline stated: `We recommend one-time ultrasound\u000a      screening for AAA for all men at or older than age 65' (p.11S). It\u000a      described the level of recommendation as `Strong' and the quality of\u000a      evidence as `High' (7). AAA screening is now widely available in the USA.\u000a      Many of the policies and practices in the period from 2008 drew on a key\u000a      2005 evidence synthesis and Recommendation Statement from the US\u000a      Preventive Services Task Force in its public advisory role. The MASS\u000a      study's importance was highlighted in both the recommendation and the\u000a      synthesis, which have remained in place throughout 2008-13. The latter\u000a      stated: `the detailed micro-costing approach used in the MASS CEA...\u000a      justified a \"good\" quality rating.' (p.3) (8). That review formed the\u000a      basis both for the legislation under which Medicare has offered AAA\u000a      screening throughout the 2008-13 period, and for clinical policy\u000a      statements issued by the healthcare companies, such as Aetna which for its\u000a      22 million members says: `Aetna considers one-time ultrasound screening\u000a      for abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) medically necessary for men 65 years\u000a      of age or older.' (8). Originally published in 2005 the policy was\u000a      reviewed annually and republished, the last time being in December 2012,\u000a      and continues to inform healthcare practice.\u000a    In Sweden, health policy is decided by counties. An assessment by the\u000a      Swedish Council on Health Technology Assessment (SBU) in 2008 came after\u000a      some counties had introduced screening. But it strongly recommended\u000a      screening and drew heavily on `The largest study, the MASS study' (p.2),\u000a      showing over 50% of the men in the review came from the MASS study (9).\u000a      Screening was later adopted by most counties. The 2011 European Society\u000a      for Vascular Surgery guidelines also drew on the four studies in the\u000a      Cochrane study, with the MASS study the largest. It supported population\u000a      screening of older men to reduce `aneurysm-related mortality by almost\u000a      half'. (p.S5) (10).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) affect more than 4% of British men aged\u000a      65-74 and are responsible for over 6,800 deaths annually. The MASS trial\u000a      showed that screening could reduce AAA-related mortality by 42%, and the\u000a      Health Economics Research Group (HERG) demonstrated, through the MASS\u000a      trial, that AAA screening was cost-effective. HERG thus helped inform the\u000a      policy announced by UK ministers in 2008 to introduce a national screening\u000a      programme for all men reaching 65. By Spring 2013 it was fully introduced\u000a      in England &#8212; offering screening to 300,000 men annually; the latest Annual\u000a      Report (2011-12) claimed an uptake rate of 75%. In 2008 the DH estimated\u000a      the health gain from a screening programme would be at least 130,000 QALYS\u000a      over 20 years. Internationally, MASS is the most significant trial of AAA\u000a      screening, and provides the most robust evidence-based model of its\u000a      cost-effectiveness. It extensively influenced AAA screening guidelines,\u000a      policies and services, including in the USA and Europe.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Health","Institution":"\u000a    BRUNEL UNIVERSITY (H0113)\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Brunel University","InstitutionName":"Brunel University","PeerGroup":"C","Region":"London","UKPRN":10000961}],"Panel":"A         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1) Scott RAP, Ashton HA, Buxton M, Day NE, Kim LG, Marteau TM, Thompson\u000a      SG, Walker NM (on behalf of the Multicentre Aneurysm Screening Study\u000a      Group) (2002) The Multicentre Aneurysm Screening Study (MASS) into the\u000a      effect of abdominal aortic aneurysm screening on mortality in men: a\u000a      randomised controlled trial.

He had\u000a      already started working on the costs and cost-effectiveness of AAA\u000a      screening with Alan Scott's leading clinical team at Chichester. For the\u000a      MASS application, the initial collaboration was expanded to include\u000a      trialists and statisticians at the MRC Biostatistics Unit in Cambridge and\u000a      the Psychology and Genetics Research Group at the United Medical and\u000a      Dental School. The comprehensive aims of the MASS trial included:\u000a      estimating the reduction in mortality from rupture of AAA that could be\u000a      achieved by population based screening; assessing the impact of the\u000a      screening programme and treatment criteria on NHS costs, and on patients'\u000a      quality of life; and producing data to allow assessment of the potential\u000a      for a national screening programme.\u000a    The trial was funded in 1996. Buxton was a co-applicant and also a member\u000a      of the Trial Steering Committee. A population based sample of 67,800 men\u000a      aged between 65-74 was recruited from Jan 1997-May 1999, with an initial\u000a      four-year follow-up period. During the stream of work, Buxton and\u000a      colleagues at HERG (principally Stirling Bryan, a named applicant, until\u000a      1997; Helen Campbell,1998-2002; Mathew Glover, 2010-) were responsible for\u000a      analysing the detailed cost data. Buxton was an author on the main\u000a      clinical effectiveness paper, published in Nov 2002 in the Lancet (1),\u000a      which provided `reliable evidence of benefit' from AAA screening aimed at\u000a      reducing the 6,800 annual deaths in England and Wales alone. Buxton was\u000a      lead author on the BMJ cost-effectiveness paper published simultaneously.\u000a      It stated: `Even at four years the cost effectiveness of screening for\u000a      abdominal aortic aneurysms is at the margin of acceptability according to\u000a      current NHS thresholds. Over a longer period the cost effectiveness will\u000a      improve substantially, the predicted ratio at 10 years falling to around a\u000a      quarter of the four year figure.' (p.1135) (2)\u000a    A 2007 Cochrane review included four studies; the MASS study contributed\u000a      67,800 of the 127,891 men. Findings from the Chichester study, one of the\u000a      other three studies, were published in 1995 and described as the first\u000a      ever report of an RCT of a screening programme for AAA; the HERG team led\u000a      on a paper assessing costs to patients (3). The Cochrane review concluded\u000a      that there was significant reduction in mortality from AAA in men who\u000a      undergo ultrasound screening and the cost effectiveness may be acceptable\u000a      but needed further expert analysis. Buxton and Campbell were also\u000a      co-authors on subsequent papers developing Markov modelling of the\u000a      cost-effectiveness of screening, and using the cost data collected in the\u000a      original study (4,5). The continuing follow-up work retained the aim of\u000a      supplying data for a national screening programme &#8212; but increasingly\u000a      helping inform its implementation. The 13-year, and final, follow-up paper\u000a      on the effectiveness shown in the MASS trial, was published in 2012 with\u000a      Buxton as a co-author. It reported `a 42 (95 per cent confidence interval\u000a      31 to 51) per cent reduction' in the AAA-related mortality rate by\u000a      screening men aged 65-74 years (p.1649) (6).

The Payback research provides new\u000d\u000a      evaluation processes that have been applied by organisations nationally\u000d\u000a      and internationally. The impacts were partly generated by extensive\u000d\u000a      stakeholder engagement and dissemination activities by team members (see\u000d\u000a      below). Many stakeholders, in turn, promoted the HERG findings showing the\u000d\u000a      benefits that come from health research, and used this to support their\u000d\u000a      case for continued and\/or increased funding.

Examples include:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The main Canadian public sector, charitable, and commercial\u000d\u000a        organisations funding health research combined to sponsor an expert\u000d\u000a        panel including Buxton. Tasked with identifying a best method to\u000d\u000a        evaluate impacts, it proposed a framework that `builds on the combined\u000d\u000a        logic model and impacts approach of the \"payback model\"'(p.18). The\u000d\u000a        President of Alberta's main health research funding body has described\u000d\u000a        its adoption in provinces of Canada and in Spain. [2]\u000d\u000a      In 2009 ICDDR,B in Bangladesh, one of the leading research centres in\u000d\u000a        low-and-middle- income countries, incorporated the Payback Framework\u000d\u000a        prominantly into its `Strategic Plan 2020' covering 2010-2020 and\u000d\u000a        set out how it would be put into practice.

[8].\u000d\u000a      In 2011\/12 HERG worked with a local team from RSM McClure Watters to\u000d\u000a        apply the Payback Framework to assess the impact of health research\u000d\u000a        funded by the Northern Ireland Executive. Based on that study the\u000d\u000a        Executive changed its policy and announced: `Following consideration of\u000d\u000a        the report, and the benefits outlined in it, the Health Minister has\u000d\u000a        decided to invest &#163;2.6 million' to become a full partner of the National\u000d\u000a        Institute of Health Research (NIHR). [9].\u000d\u000a      Asthma UK funded HERG to lead an evaluation of the impacts of their\u000d\u000a        research funding. They used the analysis of how different funding\u000d\u000a        streams had contributed to impacts to help revise their funding\u000d\u000a        strategies, and hoped the report's publication would boost research\u000d\u000a        funding. [10]\u000d\u000a      When in April 2013 the NBCF in Australia launched the impact\u000d\u000a        assessment conducted by HERG it received a high media profile, which was\u000d\u000a        important to increase public understanding of the charity's\u000d\u000a        achievements, provide accountability for past expenditure, and\u000d\u000a        justification for future funding by supporters. On policies it also\u000d\u000a        stated: `As a consequence of this evaluation process NBCF has decided to\u000d\u000a        take three actions in terms of future investment in research....we have\u000d\u000a        decided to substantially boost our investment in translational\u000d\u000a        research.' [11]\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Extensive dissemination helped generate the full range of these impacts.\u000d\u000a      It included publications, invited presentations, seminars, and advice\u000d\u000a      directly to stakeholders, eg on committees in Canada [2], the EU, Ireland,\u000d\u000a      WHO and the UK. The resulting impact, illustrated by the key examples\u000d\u000a      above, has potentially had even wider implications. The additional\/better\u000d\u000a      organised health research that arose (at least partially) as an impact\u000d\u000a      from HERG's work might, itself, reasonably be expected on occasions to\u000d\u000a      have generated some of the range of wider impacts including on health and\u000d\u000a      welfare.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Globally, many health research-funding organisations, public and\u000d\u000a      charitable, felt the need to demonstrate to policymakers and the public\u000d\u000a      how their investments in research were benefitting society. HERG's\u000d\u000a      research on developing techniques for assessing the payback (or impact)\u000d\u000a      from health research tackled this need. The payback stream of research\u000d\u000a      itself has had significant, wide- reaching and cumulative impacts. First,\u000d\u000a      internationally, health research funding bodies adopted the framework in\u000d\u000a      their evaluation strategies, including to provide accountability.

Third, governments, public research funding bodies and medical\u000d\u000a      research charities, from the UK to Australia, used the findings from\u000d\u000a      payback studies to inform decisions regarding the levels and distribution\u000d\u000a      of health research funding, with the aim of increasing the health and\u000d\u000a      economic benefits that come from investments in research.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    BRUNEL UNIVERSITY (H0113)\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Brunel University","InstitutionName":"Brunel University","PeerGroup":"C","Region":"London","UKPRN":10000961}],"Panel":"A         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a1.

The extensive and original `bottom-up' research\u000d\u000a      calculating the value of health gains from research in two major health\u000d\u000a      care fields (cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mental health), plus the GDP\u000d\u000a      gains from the same research, required publication as a major\u000d\u000a      peer-reviewed report to allow presentation in sufficient detail for full\u000d\u000a      public scrutiny [6]. The study showed that every GBP1.00 invested in CVD\u000d\u000a      research will yield approximately GBP0.39 worth of total benefits - health\u000d\u000a      gain plus GDP - every year.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3067","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"290557","Name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Our research has informed guidelines that address the very early phase of\u000d\u000a      emergency care plus the policy and organisation of that care.\u000d\u000a    Reduced use of 03b2-agonists in patients with ARDS. \u000d\u000a      A UK survey of practice in 2010 (Scally JICS 2010:11, 36-39) reported that\u000d\u000a      `all ITUs regularly prescribed 03b2-agonists for their patients'. A\u000d\u000a      Canadian study (2001-2003) found that at least a quarter of patients with\u000d\u000a      acute lung injury (ALI) received high dose 03b2-agonists. Following the\u000d\u000a      announcement of our results from the BALTI study in December 2011, the\u000d\u000a      Lancet journal editorial concluded `For now, the results of the\u000d\u000a        truncated BALTI-2 trial are sufficient to change practice. 03b2-2\u000d\u000a        agonist treatment in patients with ARDS should be limited to the\u000d\u000a        treatment of clinically important reversible airway obstruction and\u000d\u000a        should not be part of routine care'. a The impact of our\u000d\u000a      study on reducing drug use was demonstrated in an international\u000d\u000a      point-prevalence survey, performed in 2012, which showed that 03b2-agonist\u000d\u000a      use in patients with ARDS had fallen to 7.9% in the UK and 13.9% in China.\u000d\u000a      This study concluded that, based on our extrapolation of study results,\u000d\u000a      389 potential deaths per year could be avoided in the UK alone by ceasing\u000d\u000a      usage of 03b22-agonists for ARDS.b The impact of our research\u000d\u000a      has been further extended through personal communication with the\u000d\u000a      International Surviving Sepsis Guideline group who have now published\u000d\u000a      guidelines, which `recommend against the routine use of beta agonists in\u000d\u000a      ARDS' (Feb 2013). c These guidelines have been endorsed by 30\u000d\u000a      organisations, translated into six different languages and are widely\u000d\u000a      implemented around the world.\u000d\u000a     \u000d\u000a    Improvements to CPR feedback devices. Perkins led the\u000d\u000a      International Liaison Committee for Resuscitation (ILCOR) review of CPR\u000d\u000a      feedback devices (sensor devices that optimize the quality of CPR). The\u000d\u000a      resulting international recommendations, which were published by ILCOR and\u000d\u000a      adopted by the American Heart Association, European, Asian, South Africa,\u000d\u000a      and Australian Resuscitation Councils, drew substantially on the\u000d\u000a      systematic review and primary research undertaken at Warwickd,\u000d\u000a      Implementation of CPR feedback devices into clinical practice has been\u000d\u000a      associated with improved CPR performance and increased survival (adjusted\u000d\u000a      odds ratio of 2.72 (95% CI 1.15 to 6.41). e Our finding that\u000d\u000a      accelerometer-based CPR feedback devices were inaccurate when used on a\u000d\u000a      patient lying on a bed were described as having `an enduring impact on\u000d\u000a        the fundamental understanding of current CPR technology\".e\u000d\u000a      and led to the development (with a Medical Technology Company -\u000d\u000a      PhysioControl) of the new technology TrueCPRTM, which uses\u000d\u000a      magnetic fields to overcome the limitations we identified with\u000d\u000a      accelerometers. TrueCPRTM has been granted CE (Conformit&#233;\u000d\u000a      Europ&#233;enne) mark approval from the EU and approval from the US Food and\u000d\u000a      Drug Administration (USFDA). It is now available for sale in most\u000d\u000a      countries.f Since learning about our findings, Laerdal Medical\u000d\u000a      (Norway) has started developing a smart backboard to overcome the\u000d\u000a      limitations we identified in our research. \u000d\u000a     \u000d\u000a    Improvements to training in CPR. Our research on training\u000d\u000a      and assessment methods for CPR has led to direct changes to the\u000d\u000a      competency-based performance tests used within the Advanced Life Support\u000d\u000a      (ALS) and have been implemented in the UK, Europe and Australia,\u000d\u000a      facilitated by Perkins' leadership of the UK Resuscitation Council ALS\u000d\u000a      Working Group. Our development work on e-learning showed that it was\u000d\u000a      possible to replace face-to-face training with e-learning material, thus\u000d\u000a      reducing the cost of delivering the course without compromising learning\u000d\u000a      quality. This led to the launch of a new course, which draws heavily on\u000d\u000a      the e-learning material developed by our research.g The new\u000d\u000a      course has been delivered to more than 10,000 doctors and nurses in the UK\u000d\u000a      and reduced costs by approximately &#163;3 million in the first 18 months.\u000d\u000a     \u000d\u000a    Improvements to guidelines for emergency care. Our\u000d\u000a      systematic review of emergency care, underpins the Joint Royal College\u000d\u000a      Ambulance Liaison Committee Clinical Guidelines, published in 2013h,\u000d\u000a      for which Matthew Cooke acted as the academic director. These guidelines\u000d\u000a      are used by all NHS ambulance staff (approx. 5000 paramedics) and have\u000d\u000a      been adopted in United Arab Emirates. The Royal National Lifeboat\u000d\u000a      Institute reversed a national policy decision to limit the duration of\u000d\u000a      search and rescue operations to 20 minutes when our evidence showed that\u000d\u000a      survival was possible beyond that time (2011). The new evidence from our\u000d\u000a      systematic review and scoping exercise on falls prevention informed the\u000d\u000a      decision, in 2013, to revise the NICE guidelines for falls prevention by\u000d\u000a      demonstrating the new evidence and the variability in practice.i\u000d\u000a      Our research from the team at Warwick has influenced the evolution of new\u000d\u000a      roles in emergency care, such as emergency care practitioners (Adams,\u000d\u000a      2005) and Advanced Clinical Practitioners (Cooke, in progress, 2013) and\u000d\u000a      an expansion of the workforce by using non-doctors. Our evaluation of the\u000d\u000a      National Emergency Care Practitioner (ECP) Programme demonstrated the\u000d\u000a      safety and clinical effectiveness of this new role led to the\u000d\u000a      dissemination of ECP programmes throughout the UK, with the majority of\u000d\u000a      ambulance services adopting such roles. This programme is widely linked to\u000d\u000a      improved efficiencies such as reduced ambulance transport to the emergency\u000d\u000a      department reducing cost and improving efficiency.\u000d\u000a     \u000d\u000a    Changes to national policy on A&amp;E departments. As\u000d\u000a      National Clinical Director Urgent and Emergency Care, Cooke led the\u000d\u000a      development of new National Quality Indicators for A&amp;E 2010j\u000d\u000a      based on his Warwick research. Many of the results were utilised before\u000d\u000a      publication because of Professor Cooke's national role. Reviews of\u000d\u000a      patients who leave AEDs without being seen (Clarey &amp; Cooke, 2012) and\u000d\u000a      reattend (Trivedy, 2013) informed the development of two of the eight\u000d\u000a      national indicators (i.e. per cent reattending A&amp;E and per cent\u000d\u000a      leaving without being seen). National guidance on reducing waits was\u000d\u000a      informed by a systematic review of effective approaches to wait- time\u000d\u000a      reduction (Cooke et al, 2004), by research on the use of observation wards\u000d\u000a      (Sibly, 2007) and by understanding the types of patients who suffer long\u000d\u000a      delays (Downing, 2004). Work conducted with Bristol University, on walk-in\u000d\u000a      centres (Chalder et al, 2007; Salisbury et al, 2007) has changed policy\u000d\u000a      whereby walk-in centres are no longer considered to be effective in\u000d\u000a      diverting care. The changes implemented on the basis of this research have\u000d\u000a      led to a substantial reduction in waiting times: Department of Health\u000d\u000a      statistics show number of patients seen within four hours increasing from\u000d\u000a      60% in 2002 to 95% in 2013. Others have demonstrated the link between the\u000d\u000a      waiting time and mortality. Cooke's work (2002) provided guidance and\u000d\u000a      support for the implementation of fast- track systems in A&amp;E and is\u000d\u000a      now standard practicek, Multiple studies have showed that this\u000d\u000a      system can reduce waits for those with minor injuries by 50%. l\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The emergency care team at Warwick Medical School has a strong track\u000d\u000a      record of high-quality health sciences research encompassing evidence\u000d\u000a      synthesis, health-services research and clinical trials. Our trials of a\u000d\u000a      03b2-agonist (salbutamol) in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)\u000d\u000a      have influenced therapeutic recommendations in the International Sepsis\u000d\u000a      Guidelines (2013), reducing the use of this potentially detrimental\u000d\u000a      therapy. Our cardiac arrest research informed the 2010 international\u000d\u000a      guidelines on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) led to the generation of\u000d\u000a      new intellectual property, and prompted industrial collaborations to build\u000d\u000a      new technologies, such as TrueCPRTM (2013). These have led to\u000d\u000a      improved CPR practice and improved patient survival.

Our phase\u000d\u000a      II trial in patients with ARDS (03b2-agonist lung injury trial [BALTI-1])\u000d\u000a      found an apparent benefit from the 03b22-adrenergic receptor\u000d\u000a      agonist salbutamol and led to an increase in its use internationally\u000d\u000a      [BALTI-1 was principally conducted elsewhere]. Our subsequent phase III\u000d\u000a      multi-centre, double-blind, randomised controlled trial of intravenous\u000d\u000a      salbutamol in ARDS (a Warwick study) ran from December 2006 to March 2010\u000d\u000a      (Gates, Perkins, Gao, Lamb). 1 It was stopped early after\u000d\u000a      treatment with salbutamol was, found to be poorly tolerated by patients\u000d\u000a      and associated with increased organ failure and mortality (RR 1&#183;47, 95% CI\u000d\u000a      1&#183;03-2&#183;08), leading to calls to discontinue the routine use of\u000d\u000a      03b2-agonists in this condition.\u000d\u000a    Improving the effectiveness of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)\u000d\u000a      Cardiac arrest is the final common event prior to death in a wide range of\u000d\u000a      emergency conditions. To improve patient survival, our team evaluated\u000d\u000a      strategies to improve the effectiveness of CPR. We did an in-depth\u000d\u000a      analysis, which found that the quality of CPR was suboptimal during\u000d\u000a      in-hospital CPR due to compression of the underlying mattress during chest\u000d\u000a      compression (Perkins, Benny, Tweed, 2001 and 2004). We found that\u000d\u000a      recalibration of a device that provides CPR pressure feedback could\u000d\u000a      overcome this problem (Perkins, 2005). Our subsequent systematic review\u000d\u000a      found that such devices could improve CPR quality in a number of settings\u000d\u000a      (Perkins, Yeung, Gao, 2009 and 2010). 2 Furthermore, we\u000d\u000a      identified that a commonly used accelerometer based feedback device failed\u000d\u000a      to differentiate between chest and mattress compression (Perkins, 2009),\u000d\u000a      which led to its redesign, and improvement.\u000d\u000a    CPR education has a key role in transferring the results of research into\u000d\u000a      clinical practice.

Specific projects have addressed the causes behind delays in care\u000d\u000a      and the means for reducing delays, such as the introduction of observation\u000d\u000a      wards (Cooke, 2004) 4, and fast-tracking of individuals with\u000d\u000a      minor injuries (Cooke, 2002). We have also demonstrated more efficient and\u000d\u000a      clinically effective utilisation of new roles for clinicians. For example,\u000d\u000a      1) the development and introduction of emergency care practitioners\u000d\u000a      (Adams, 2005) 5 and Advanced Clinical Practitioners (Cooke, in\u000d\u000a      progress, 2013 but already being across all Accident and Emergency\u000d\u000a      Departments (AEDs) across the West Midlands in 2014 in a project led by\u000d\u000a      Cooke &amp; Swann), and 2) how improved facilities such as walk-in centres\u000d\u000a      can change emergency patient flow (Cooke, 2007) by reducing AED\u000d\u000a      attendances in specific circumstances and by reducing the patients\u000d\u000a      transported to AED by ambulance.6 In an evaluation of these\u000d\u000a      changes, we found a reduction in the number of patients who leave AEDs\u000d\u000a      without being seen (Cooke, 2012) and changes in the causes of reattendance\u000d\u000a      related to initial quality of care and improved access to community\u000d\u000a      services for follow up care.7\u000d\u000a    University of Warwick Medical School staff:\u000d\u000a     \u000d\u000a    Professor Matthew Cooke (Professor of Emergency Medicine,\u000d\u000a      2000-present), Professor Gavin Perkins (Professor of Critical Care\u000d\u000a      Medicine, 2007-present), Dr Mike Tweed (Senior Lecturer in Medical\u000d\u000a      Education, 2000-2003), Professor Jeremy Dale (Professor of Primary\u000d\u000a      Care, 1997- present), Professor Fang Gao (Professor of\u000d\u000a      Anaesthesia, Critical Care and Pain, 2009-2011), Dr Joyce Yeung\u000d\u000a      (PhD Student, 2008-2011), Professor Sallie Lamb (Professor of\u000d\u000a      Rehabilitation and Director of Warwick Clinical Trials Unit,\u000d\u000a      2003-present), Professor Simon Gates (Professor of Clinical\u000d\u000a      Trials, May 2005-present), Dr Chetan Trivedy (Academic Clinical\u000d\u000a      Lecturer in Emergency Medicine, 2012-present) Professor Nigel Stallard\u000d\u000a      (Professor of Medical Statistics, 2005-present), Dr Ann Adams\u000d\u000a      (Principal Research Fellow &amp; Director Research Degrees, 2000-present).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3139","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Preventing Child Deaths project1 carried out from\u000a      2006 to 2007 was the focal point of an ongoing programme of research into\u000a      child death review processes being carried out by the Warwick team. This\u000a      work has had a direct influence on national policy and practice in\u000a      interagency working to safeguard children and has formed the basis of a\u000a      national training programme and templates for use by CDOPs. A\u000a      The basic procedures to be followed in response to a child's death were\u000a      outlined in statutory national guidance (Working Together to Safeguard\u000a        Children) in 2006. This guidance was expanded in 2010B\u000a      and incorporated the templates and tools developed through the `Preventing\u000a      Child Deaths' Warwick research. A further revision in 2013, again draws on\u000a      these research findings, and Dr Sidebotham was involved in the\u000a      consultation on this guidance, and provided advice directly to the DfE. C\u000a    CDOPs have now been established by all 152 Local Safeguarding Children\u000a      Boards (LSCBs) in England, as well as a national panel for Wales. The\u000a      governments in Scotland and Northern Ireland are currently developing\u000a      similar processes, and Dr Sidebotham is currently supporting the\u000a      Safeguarding Board for Northern Ireland as they seek to develop their\u000a      processes. D The research report on Preventing Child Deaths1\u000a      included a series of appendices with examples of terms of reference\u000a      for CDOPs, forms for notification and data collection, a pro forma\u000a      for data analysis, and audit tools for the child death review processes.\u000a      To assist LSCBs in carrying out child death reviews, the DfE commissioned\u000a      Warwick Medical School to lead development work on national templates for\u000a      these reviewsA, recognising the expertise of the research team\u000a      and the learning from this research. These templates, which are available\u000a      on the DfE website A, are now used as the primary data\u000a      collection tools for all 93 CDOPs in England, and form the basis of annual\u000a      returns by CDOPs to the DfE. The website A includes the\u000a      following citation: `In accordance with Working Together to Safeguard\u000a      Children (paragraph 7.2) all Local Safeguarding Children Boards (LSCBs)\u000a      need to keep information about each child's death... `In order to\u000a        assist LSCBs in this task, the Department commissioned Warwick\u000a        University to lead development work on the templates, which can be used\u000a        by all LSCBs.'\u000a    The Preventing Child Deaths research identified a number of learning\u000a      needs for practitioners from all agencies involved in child welfare and\u000a      CDOP members, and in light of this, the government commissioned Warwick\u000a      Medical School to develop national training materials to support the\u000a      introduction of these child death review processes. This led to the\u000a      production of a training CD, which was distributed to all LSCBs in England\u000a      and made available on the DfE website. A In addition, over 800\u000a      professionals from health, police and social care agencies across England\u000a      have attended training courses in child death review at Warwick Medical\u000a      School since it was established in 2007. The outcomes of this work are\u000a      therefore embedded in professional practice in responding to and learning\u000a      from childhood deaths across the country, and are reflected in local\u000a      protocols and in annual reports from the CDOPs. Dr. Sidebotham has helped\u000a      child death review experts from European countries, Australia and the\u000a      United StatesC, and has been invited to deliver seminars in the\u000a      Netherlands, Australia and Northern Ireland on this topic. These seminars\u000a      have contributed to the development of similar processes in the\u000a      Netherlands and Northern Ireland. D\u000a    In 2011, as a result of his expertise in this area, Dr Sidebotham was\u000a      appointed the academic lead for the Health Quality Improvement\u000a      Partnership-commissioned Clinical Outcomes Review Programme, Child Health\u000a      Reviews-UK. E In 2013, he was appointed to a Royal College of\u000a      Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) working group on child mortality, and\u000a      has presented work from this at a RCPCH policy breakfast (April, 2013),\u000a      and at the Conservative Party conference (September 2013).\u000a    Dr Sidebotham's work with Professor Marion Brandon of UEA on fatal child\u000a      maltreatment and Serious Case Reviews has an ongoing influence on wider\u000a      aspects of child protection. This work is cited in Working Together, 2010B,\u000a      is frequently cited in local Serious Case Reviews across the country, and\u000a      features regularly in local and national training programmes in child\u000a      protection. It is cited in the RCPCH Child Protection Companion,\u000a      and the NICE guidance, When to suspect child maltreatment, which\u000a      forms the basis of clinical guidance for paediatricians, GPs and other\u000a      clinicians in recognising and responding to child maltreatment. In 2010 to\u000a      2011, Professor Eileen Munro undertook a review of Children's\u000a        Safeguarding in England, which influenced subsequent Government\u000a      revisions of safeguarding children guidance in England (Working Together,\u000a      2013). Dr Sidebotham contributed evidence to this review and was a member\u000a      of the Learning from Practice review stream. F In 2012 Dr\u000a      Sidebotham was invited by the RCPCH to contribute to its Child Protection\u000a      CompanionF, a working guide for paediatricians, which cites the\u000a      Sidebotham and Brandon research on Serious Case Reviews and other work by\u000a      Sidebotham and his colleagues. The recent review into the death from abuse\u000a      of Daniel Pelka, which cites the Brandon &amp; Sidebotham research, has\u000a      generated a lot of media interest into how we learn from Serious Case\u000a      Reviews. As a result of this, Dr Sidebotham's research was featured in a\u000a      BBC `Inside Out' documentary (9 September 2013, available on request).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Every year over 5,000 children and young people in the UK die. Previous\u000a      research suggests that 20-25% of these deaths may be preventable, and in\u000a      comparison to many other European countries, the UK has higher child\u000a      mortality rates. Child Death Review processes, introduced in the USA in\u000a      the 1970s have been proposed as a means of learning from child deaths and\u000a      driving prevention initiatives. Prior to 2008, the UK had no national\u000a      system for reviewing and learning from children's deaths.\u000a    From 2006 to 2007, a team from Warwick Medical School led by Dr Peter\u000a      Sidebotham undertook government-funded research examining a number of\u000a      Local Authorities across England who had set up pilot Child Death Overview\u000a      Panels (CDOPs). The findings from this research were instrumental in\u000a      developing national policy and procedures for child death reviews. The\u000a      Warwick research emphasised the importance of a multi-agency approach to\u000a      reviewing all child deaths, with a strong public health focus on learning\u000a      lessons for prevention, and robust systems for notification and gathering\u000a      information. This, together with other research by Warwick Medical School\u000a      on fatal child maltreatment published between 2009 and 2011, has\u000a      contributed to updated national policy and interagency practice to\u000a      safeguard children.\u000a    Although it is too early in the process to demonstrate any impact on the\u000a      ultimate goal of reducing preventable child deaths, CDOPs have now been\u000a      established in every Local Authority in England, as well as an all-Wales\u000a      panel, and current work in Scotland and Northern Ireland is considering\u000a      how best to implement such reviews. These panels are reviewing all child\u000a      deaths in England, resulting in local prevention initiatives, and national\u000a      returns enabling a clearer picture of the nature of preventable child\u000a      deaths.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Health","Institution":"\u000a    University of Warwick and Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Warwick (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Warwick","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"West Midlands","UKPRN":10007163},{"AlternativeName":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine","InstitutionName":"Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine","PeerGroup":"G","Region":"North West","UKPRN":10003958}],"Panel":"A         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

Recent National data indicate that 20% of deaths reviewed have\u000a      identified modifiable factors &#8212; a finding that is in keeping with other\u000a      internationally reported studies. The aim of child death review is to\u000a      examine the circumstances of all children's deaths in order to identify\u000a      such modifiable factors, to learn from them, and to inform local and\u000a      national prevention initiatives. Prior to 2006, there were no standardised\u000a      approaches to reviewing child deaths in the UK.\u000a    From 2006 to 2007, we evaluated four basic components of the child death\u000a      review process1: how Local Safeguarding Children Boards (LSCBs)\u000a      went about establishing the overview panels; the systems for notification\u000a      of deaths and data collection; processes for analysing case data; and the\u000a      outputs of the process. The research team identified the importance of\u000a      using multiple sources for notification of child deaths and for gathering\u000a      information about the circumstances and any contributory factors. We made\u000a      recommendations on the structure and membership of panels and developed\u000a      templates for notification, data collection and analysis, and the\u000a      involvement of parents in the process. We identified potential barriers to\u000a      effective working including lack of understanding and cross-boundary\u000a      issues, and how some panels had attempted to overcome these barriers. This\u000a      research tied in with previous research carried out from 2003-2007 by Dr\u000a      Sidebotham with Professor Peter Fleming at the University of Bristol on\u000a      the epidemiology of sudden unexpected death in infancy. As part of this\u000a      research, we developed coordinated procedures for health, police and\u000a      social services in responding to unexpected child deaths. Dr Sidebotham\u000a      analysed further data on how these processes worked at Warwick Medical\u000a      School between 2005 and 2007, focusing in particular on how police\u000a      officers and health professionals could effectively work together in\u000a      investigating unexpected deaths.2 The analysis showed that it\u000a      was possible for police officers and health professionals to respond\u000a      promptly to unexpected child deaths, gather comprehensive information\u000a      about the circumstances of those deaths, and provide ongoing support to\u000a      bereaved families. The approaches used in this research have been adopted\u000a      as national policy in responding to unexpected child deaths (Section 5,\u000a      source B). Since 2010, the Warwick team has been carrying out further\u000a      research through an NIHR doctoral research fellowship to assess how\u000a      parents and professionals perceive these processes, their utility in\u000a      investigating unexpected deaths, and their impact on bereaved parents.\u000a    In 2009 Dr Sidebotham carried out further research at Warwick exploring\u000a      nationwide data on violent child deaths.3 Between 2005 and\u000a      2011, he collaborated with Professor Marian Brandon at the University of\u000a      East Anglia (UEA), carrying out national analyses of data from Serious\u000a      Case Reviews (statutory inter-agency reviews which take place following\u000a      any child death or serious injury from abuse and neglect). 4-7\u000a      Dr Sidebotham was the PI for work looking at the patterns of child\u000a      maltreatment fatalities, comparing different national data sets (from the\u000a      Home Office, Office for National Statistics, and Department for Education)\u000a      to determine the incidence of fatal child maltreatment, and analysing the\u000a      case characteristics of different types of fatal maltreatment. Both these\u000a      pieces of work have been important in providing government with measures\u000a      of the overall incidence and changing patterns of violent child deaths.\u000a      This work has demonstrated that overall numbers and rates of violent child\u000a      deaths have fallen; that declines in rates have plateaued over recent\u000a      years, particularly among teenagers; that different data sources are\u000a      needed for a full understanding of national rates; and that there are\u000a      heterogeneous patterns of violent child deaths requiring different\u000a      approaches to identification and prevention. This work has been widely\u000a      reported in the media and has helped develop our understanding of how we\u000a      learn from Serious Case Reviews. The research has emphasised the\u000a      importance of professionals having an understanding of child development,\u000a      and of taking account of the full context of cases of abuse and neglect,\u000a      including parental characteristics such as domestic violence, mental\u000a      ill-health and substance misuse.\u000a    In 2009, Dr Sidebotham led an assessment of the approaches to carrying\u000a      out Serious Case Reviews.7 This research highlighted the\u000a      ongoing value of Serious Case Reviews in both local and national learning;\u000a      the importance of broadening the scope of national analysis of such\u000a      reviews; and of focusing such reviews on underlying systems issues, not\u000a      just individual practice. It highlighted the value of learning from good\u000a      practice as well as when things go wrong, and that learning should be\u000a      embedded as an ongoing process throughout the review.\u000a    University of Warwick researchers:\u000a    Dr Peter Sidebotham, Associate Professor in Child Health (2005-13) - PI 1,\u000a        3, 7; joint PI 4-6; Collaborator 2\u000a    Catherine Ellis (2010-12) - Research Assistant 5, 7 \u000a    Shahid Perwez (2007-8) - Research Fellow 1\u000a    Janice Koistenen (2007-8) - Project Manager 1\u000a    Ben Atkins (2009) - Medical Student 3\u000a    Jane Hutton, Professor of Statistics (2009) - Collaborator 3\u000a    Colette Solebo (2010) - Research Assistant 7\u000a    External collaborators:\u000a    Professor Jan Howarth, Professor of Child Welfare, Department of\u000a      Sociological Studies.

The LSTM also\u000d\u000a      facilitated, through the work of the TB &amp; Poverty Subgroup of the Stop\u000d\u000a      TB Partnership the further\u000d\u000a      development and publication of the patient costing tool, c used\u000d\u000a      to estimate patients' costs to assess\u000d\u000a      the impact of TB on the welfare of households and individuals. Squire\u000d\u000a      was the Secretary from\u000d\u000a      2007 to 2009.\u000d\u000a    The LSTM were commissioned as members of the core writing team of the\u000d\u000a      2011 normative guide\u000d\u000a      `Priorities in operational research to improve TB care and control',\u000d\u000a      jointly sponsored by the WHO,\u000d\u000a      Stop TB, and the Global Fund for AIDS, TB &amp; Malaria. The opening\u000d\u000a      statement on the WHO\u000d\u000a      website refers to evidence from operational research projects paving the\u000d\u000a      way for ensuring many\u000d\u000a      more people have access to vital TB health services. The LSTM research\u000d\u000a      findings are referenced\u000d\u000a      within the documented linking the LSTM operational research to recommended\u000d\u000a      practice.d\u000d\u000a      The WHO revised the SM definitions for smear-positive TB in 2007e,\u000d\u000a      recommending that the third\u000d\u000a      smear examination could be dropped, based on the evidence presented. The\u000d\u000a      findings of LSTM\u000d\u000a      systematic reviews commissioned in 2010 by the WHO were sent to the expert\u000d\u000a      group who\u000d\u000a      considered available options. Cuevas and Squire were\u000d\u000a      members of the expert groups convened\u000d\u000a      to examine the evidence. The LSTM supported the group as most of the\u000d\u000a      relevant data came from\u000d\u000a      LSTM studies. Cuevas attended the meeting in September 2009, where\u000d\u000a      the evidence was\u000d\u000a      discussed and then again at the STAG with Squire where the expert\u000d\u000a      committee report was\u000d\u000a      approved as policy.f The revised policy for same-day diagnosis\u000d\u000a      includes the revised definitions and\u000d\u000a      an accelerated method for collecting specimens as conducted in the LSTM\u000d\u000a      studies. Although\u000d\u000a      implementation of policies takes time, several countries (for example,\u000d\u000a      Nigeria, Somalia and\u000d\u000a      Tanzania) and international organisations (for example, Doctors Without\u000d\u000a      Borders (Medicins Sans\u000d\u000a      Frontieres)) are already implementing this approach. Although it is too\u000d\u000a      early to document impact at\u000d\u000a      the population level, the US Agency for International Development (USAID)\u000d\u000a      has funded the LSTM\u000d\u000a      (2010-present) to model the medium-to-long-term cost and\/or health\u000d\u000a      benefits of these approaches.\u000d\u000a    Practice: The National TB Programme in Malawi is currently\u000d\u000a      engaging informal providers in\u000d\u000a      recognising disease and referring patients as part of national policy. The\u000d\u000a      Nigerian National TB and\u000d\u000a      Leprosy Control programme is exploring whether the Global Fund could\u000d\u000a      provide financial support\u000d\u000a      to include Community-based approaches within its programme, a\u000d\u000a      statement can be provided from\u000d\u000a      the National Coordinator to corroborate Nigerian approaches.g\u000d\u000a      The Ethiopian Regional and\u000d\u000a      National Health services are expanding a Community-based approach from a\u000d\u000a      base of three million\u000d\u000a      to seven million population as a package of the regional and national\u000d\u000a      Health Extension\u000d\u000a      Programme. Our work engaging community health workers has been described\u000d\u000a      as a `pathfinder for\u000d\u000a      TB' by the WHO. Work in Ethiopia was highlighted on the WHO website in\u000d\u000a      2013, where the,\u000d\u000a      Executive Secretary of the Stop TB Partnership said: \"To stop TB, we\u000d\u000a        must bring quality TB care to\u000d\u000a        poor and marginalized communities we can capitalize on two of the\u000d\u000a        world's greatest resources -\u000d\u000a        people and communities - to ensure that no one gets left behind.

In 2012, an estimated 8.6 million people developed TB and 1.3\u000d\u000a      million died from the\u000d\u000a      disease. Three million of the annually estimated 8.6 million cases of TB\u000d\u000a      are missed by healthcare\u000d\u000a      services. National surveys establish the population prevalence of TB. Data\u000d\u000a      are also collected at\u000d\u000a      health centres on cases diagnosed and treated. The gap of three million\u000d\u000a      cases is the difference\u000d\u000a      between the expected prevalence and the reported number of diagnoses\u000d\u000a      (surveillance data). It is\u000d\u000a      thus a combination of cases missed and cases not notified. Increasing case\u000d\u000a      detection is therefore\u000d\u000a      an international priority. Smear microscopy tests (the main test used for\u000d\u000a      diagnosis) have a low\u000d\u000a      acquisition cost and have low sensitivity. For several decades, because of\u000d\u000a      the low sensitivity of\u000d\u000a      SM, patients have had to provide three separate sputum samples for\u000d\u000a      examination. This process\u000d\u000a      requires several visits and substantial out-of-pocket expenditure.\u000d\u000a      According to WHO definitions,\u000d\u000a      sputum smears had to contain at least 10 bacilli (bacteria) and at least\u000d\u000a      two of the three smears had\u000d\u000a      to yield a positive result in order for a patient to be considered\u000d\u000a      smear-positive.\u000d\u000a    Problems with diagnosis and access to service\u000d\u000a    Work in Malawi led by Squire (Professor of Tropical Medicine,\u000d\u000a      1995-present) assessed patient\u000d\u000a      and household direct and opportunity costs of accessing TB services. To do\u000d\u000a      this his team surveyed\u000d\u000a      TB patients, sampled from all health facilities in Lilongwe. This\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that poor patients (an\u000d\u000a      income of &lt;US$0.25\/day) needed to spend 244% of their monthly income\u000d\u000a      accessing TB healthcare\u000d\u000a      services. In contrast, non-poor patients (an average income of US$1.23 per\u000d\u000a      day) `only' needed to\u000d\u000a      spend 129% of their income accessing TB services.1 The LSTM\u000d\u000a      were the first to use a validated\u000d\u000a      measure of poverty based on questions regarding a limited range of assets\u000d\u000a      as a proxy for income.2\u000d\u000a      Research in Ethiopia and Nigeria led by Cuevas (Professor of\u000d\u000a      Epidemiology, 1993-present)\u000d\u000a      reported similar difficulties in accessing services in Ethiopia,\u000d\u000a      concluding that patient and household\u000d\u000a      costs of TB diagnosis are prohibitively high even where services are free.\u000d\u000a      In both settings, many\u000d\u000a      patients stopped attending the services before achieving a diagnosis.\u000d\u000a    Solution 1: Improving case definitions, diagnosis and detection of\u000d\u000a          TB\u000d\u000a    Studies to improve SM-based diagnosis with the goal of diagnosis in a\u000d\u000a      single day were conducted\u000d\u000a      by Cuevas, Squire, Theobald (LSTM Reader in Social Science,\u000d\u000a      1999-present), Yassin (LSTM\u000d\u000a      Epidemiologist 2003-2010) and Ramsay (LSTM Fellow 2001-2008,) in\u000d\u000a      Nigeria, Ethiopia, Nepal,\u000d\u000a      Yemen, Brazil, Cameroon and Malawi (2006-2013). The LSTM demonstrated that\u000d\u000a      most patients\u000d\u000a      are diagnosed by the first two smears3; smears with low\u000d\u000a      numbers (1-10) of bacilli are true-positive\u000d\u000a      results; SM has high specificity.4 One positive smear is\u000d\u000a      sufficient for a positive SM diagnosis; and\u000d\u000a      that diagnosis can be reached in one day (same-day diagnosis).\u000d\u000a        4 Previous to these studies, it was\u000d\u000a      perceived that smears with very few bacilli could be false positive, and\u000d\u000a      thus the control\u000d\u000a      programmes required that patients have at least two smears with few\u000d\u000a      bacilli. By demonstrating\u000d\u000a      this, control programmes could consider one smear with few bacilli as true\u000d\u000a      positive. The LSTM\u000d\u000a      conducted multi-country evaluations in Nepal, Nigeria, the Yemen and\u000d\u000a      Ethiopia, which\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that single-day diagnosis had the same level of performance\u000d\u000a      as older schemes. In\u000d\u000a      total, 6,627 patients were enrolled; 6,466 had culture tests of which\u000d\u000a      1,526 were positive.5 We also\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that this approach could be used in conjunction with the new\u000d\u000a      LED fluorescence\u000d\u000a      microscopes.6 We conducted a systematic review of same-day SM\u000d\u000a      and presented data to the\u000d\u000a      WHO to inform development of policy guidance.7 A study in 2009\u000d\u000a      modelled that the implementation\u000d\u000a      of the new WHO recommendations on smear microscopy and LED based\u000d\u000a      fluorescence microscopy\u000d\u000a      combined would result in substantial increases in smear positive\u000d\u000a      case-detection using existing\u000d\u000a      human resources.8\u000d\u000a    Solution 2: Community-based approaches to improve access to\u000d\u000a          diagnosis and treatment\u000d\u000a    From 2008 to 2013, Squire and Theobald led work in Malawi\u000d\u000a      demonstrating that engaging\u000d\u000a      informal providers (shopkeepers) in recognising disease and referring\u000d\u000a      patients doubled TB case\u000d\u000a      detection and reduced the time delay to diagnosis by 75%. 9\u000d\u000a      Since 2009, Cuevas and Theobald\u000d\u000a      have led studies engaging village-based health extension workers (HEWs) to\u000d\u000a      facilitate access to\u000d\u000a      diagnosis and treatment in Ethiopia. HEWs identify individuals with\u000d\u000a      symptoms of TB and collect\u000d\u000a      and prepare smears and transport to the diagnostic laboratories.10\u000d\u000a      In the Yemen, HEWs visited the\u000d\u000a      homes of adults with TB to identify secondary cases that had not consulted\u000d\u000a      healthcare services\u000d\u000a      and, in Nigeria, HEWs visited households in slums and tested specimens. In\u000d\u000a      Ethiopia these\u000d\u000a      approaches have led to a greater than 100%, increase in case detection3,\u000d\u000a      and in Nigeria, to a 70%\u000d\u000a      increase.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3148","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"934841","Name":"Swaziland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3374766","Name":"Cape Verde"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aSeveral factors have made malaria control difficult in sub-Saharan Africa and led to substantial\u000d\u000aincreases in malaria burden on the continent during the 1980s and 1990s. The first was the\u000d\u000awidespread emergence of resistance of P. falciparum, particularly to chloroquine (CQ), then the\u000d\u000amost commonly used anti-malarial drug.

The WHO technical report (page10) refers to the reviews leading to the\u000d\u000arecommendation that amodiaquine be added to the Model List as a core list medicine.a, b In 2006,\u000d\u000aWHO guidelines recommended amodiaquine combined with artesunate as one of the three ACTs\u000d\u000afor malaria treatment in Africa.c As a result, it is currently estimated that amodiaquine-containing\u000d\u000aACT accounts for 30% of ACTs taken by adults with malaria in Africa. The 2008 Global Malaria\u000d\u000aAction Plan states \"There has been a remarkable adoption of ACTs in sub-Saharan African\u000d\u000acountries: in 2003, only two sub-Saharan African countries had adopted ACTs; as of September\u000d\u000a2007, all sub-Saharan African countries except Swaziland and Cape Verde have adopted ACT\u000d\u000apolicy.\"d This is having an on-going impact on the treatment of uncomplicated malaria across\u000d\u000aAfrica.\u000d\u000aWHO recommendation for replacement of monotherapy with ACTs in P. falciparum malaria.\u000d\u000aThe analysis of ACT safety and efficacy in 2004 provided unequivocal evidence (70% more\u000d\u000apatients cured with artesunate combination treatments than with monotherapy; meta-analysis of 16\u000d\u000atrials) that ACT was more effective in treating malaria than the single antimalarial drugs alone. This\u000d\u000aled the WHO Expert Panel to recommend strongly in its 2006 guidelines that countries should stop\u000d\u000ausing monotherapy.c Garner was the methodologist on the WHO Guideline Panel and drafted the\u000d\u000aevidence box for these guidelines. Evidence provided by the LSTM team led to the Global\u000d\u000aRecommendation in 2010 to replace monotherapy with combination therapy and also supported\u000d\u000aother WHO recommendations for treating uncomplicated and complicated malaria.e, f Introduction\u000d\u000aof ACTs is the most important treatment advance in malaria this century. This decision led to a\u000d\u000amassive increase in the manufacture and testing of co-formulated products and has probably been\u000d\u000acritical in reducing mortality from malaria globally. There were an estimated 11 million ACT\u000d\u000atreatment courses purchased in 2005, an estimated 287 million ACT treatments were purchased in\u000d\u000a2011 as documented in UNITAID's Malaria Response.g (UNITAID is a global health organisation\u000d\u000ahosted by the WHO that uses innovative financing to increase funding for greater access to\u000d\u000atreatments and diagnostics for HIV\/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in low-income countries).\u000d\u000aDihydroartemisinin-piperaquine added as a treatment option for malaria. During the\u000d\u000adevelopment of the WHO malaria guidelines, the LSTM team was commissioned to assess new\u000d\u000aACT treatment options. In the Cochrane review prepared for the WHO Guidelines panel, the\u000d\u000aanalysis showed clearly that the dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine combination drug had failure rates\u000d\u000aof less than 10% and consistently performed as well as and often better than other ACTs, which\u000d\u000aled the panel to recommend it as a new option for treating malaria. The Medical Officer from the\u000d\u000aWHO's Global Malaria Programme confirms the new recommendations in the 2010 addition of the\u000d\u000aMalaria Treatment Guidelines, are based on the findings of these systematic reviews. h\u000d\u000aArtesunate recommended for severe malaria. At the 2010 Guideline review panel, the Cochrane\u000d\u000aReview of artesunate versus quinine was considered; this review showed that artesunate produced\u000d\u000aa 38% reduction in mortality in adults with malaria, when compared with quinine. Thus, the WHO\u000d\u000aMalaria Guidelines Panel in 2010 recommended that artesunate be used instead of quinine for\u000d\u000asevere malaria in adults. In 2011 a trial of artesunate in children was published and quickly added\u000d\u000ato the meta-analysis, providing additional data on children; this summary was considered by the\u000d\u000aPanel, who then recommended its adoption in children. f, i\u000d\u000aDirect impact on the decision-making process of the technical expert group on malaria\u000d\u000achemotherapy and beyond.\u000d\u000aPaul Garner introduced systematic reviews and meta-analysis to malaria, against all the advice of\u000d\u000aexperts in the field (who said that malaria was so varied that the methods were not appropriate).\u000d\u000aThe early reviews on the efficacy and safety of amodiaquine and ACT indicated that rigorous up-to-date\u000d\u000ascientific reviews could drive policy and led the WHO to move from consensus decision\u000d\u000amaking to evidence-informed approaches. Whilst this is part of a global movement, the LSTM team\u000d\u000awas instrumental in the introduction of evidence-informed approaches to decision making on\u000d\u000amalaria guidelines.h, j This is reflected by the fact that WHO routinely turns to the LSTM for\u000d\u000aCochrane reviews, summaries and GRADE analyses. Importantly, malaria guidelines that are\u000d\u000abased on an externally validated tool have been demonstrated to be among some of the best WHO\u000d\u000aguidelines in terms of quality, as indicated by high quality scores using an international assessment\u000d\u000atool (AGREE).j\u000d\u000aThe reputation of the LSTM led the Director-General's office of the WHO to ask the team to\u000d\u000aevaluate progress in evidence-based guideline development across the whole organization.

Meta-analysis can generate new knowledge by\u000d\u000acombining data from a number of smaller studies; and can demonstrate consistency of findings\u000d\u000aleading to unequivocal global policy recommendations. Before this period, the World Health\u000d\u000aOrganization and other guideline groups rarely used systematic reviews and concise summaries of\u000d\u000afindings for developing recommendations. Instead, processes usually relied heavily on experts in a\u000d\u000aparticular specialty, rather than methodologists specialising in synthesis and interpreting evidence,\u000d\u000aor representatives of those who will have to live with the recommendations. The LSTM have forged\u000d\u000aa relationship with the World Health Organization (WHO) in tropical diseases to ensure that the\u000d\u000aright policy questions are being addressed by LSTM reviews. LSTM staff who conducted this body\u000d\u000aof research has included Professor Paul Garner the Co-ordinating Editor of the Cochrane\u000d\u000aInfectious Diseases Group CIDG and the LSTM Evidence Synthesis for Global Health Group since\u000d\u000a(1994 - present,) David Sinclair, Clinical Lecturer, Author and Editor with the Cochrane Infectious\u000d\u000aDiseases Group (2007-present) and Helen Smith, Lecturer in Research Methods (1998 - present.)\u000d\u000aIn 1994 Paul Garner engaged Dr Piero Olliaro at WHO in a meta-analysis of data from 40 malaria\u000d\u000atrials to compare the therapeutic efficacy of amodiaquine with that of chloroquine in patients with\u000d\u000amalaria. Chloroquine was failing as a treatment due to parasite drug resistance in Africa and\u000d\u000aamodiaquine was a cheap potential alternative. Garner and Olliaro wrote a protocol and identified\u000d\u000aall available malaria trials, including trials published in French, and unpublished studies obtained\u000d\u000afrom pharmaceutical companies. These approaches were ground-breaking, and the analysis\u000d\u000arevealed new findings from combining many small studies-that amodiaquine was clearly much\u000d\u000amore effective than chloroquine, the results published in the Cochrane Library and the Lancet.1\u000d\u000aLSTM was also commissioned to evaluate amodiaquine safety as it had been suggested it had\u000d\u000aserious adverse effects. In 2003, the systematic review of over 370 studies (in all languages)\u000d\u000ashowed that the risk of severe adverse effects in patients treated with amodiaquine is not higher\u000d\u000athan that in patients treated with chloroquine.2\u000d\u000aSubsequently, the LSTM worked with Dr Olliaro and Abdel Babiker (MRC Trials Unit in London) to\u000d\u000acarry out a prospective meta-analysis of individual patient data from all trials that compared\u000d\u000aartemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) with existing antimalarial treatments given by\u000d\u000athemselves. The LSTM research team contributed to the WHO template used by investigators to\u000d\u000aplan each randomised controlled trial (RCTs). The LSTM organised the individual patient data\u000d\u000aanalysis across all these studies, a much more substantive analysis were all the data are managed\u000d\u000ain a single data base and analysed together; they engaged the researchers in the analytical plan\u000d\u000aand co-ordinated the analysis and interpretation of the data. The LSTM organised the investigators\u000d\u000ameeting of the International Artemisinin Study Group in WHO Geneva in 2002 to discuss the\u000d\u000afindings and their interpretation.3 The analysis included results from a number of trials that had not\u000d\u000apreviously been published. The overall analysis showed there was no doubt that adding artesunate\u000d\u000asubstantially increased cure rate, whatever drug it was added to.\u000d\u000aIn 2008, the WHO asked the LSTM to summarise the relative effectiveness of various ACTs. The\u000d\u000aanalysis showed that a new ACT, dihydroartemisinin piperaquine, which at that time was not pre-qualified,\u000d\u000awas at least as good as, and probably better than, the other ACTs that were currently in\u000d\u000ause. Cochrane methods combined with the grades of recommendation, assessment, development\u000d\u000aand evaluation (GRADE) approach were used to assess the quality of evidence.4 Subsequently,\u000d\u000anew evidence on the efficacy of ACTs in children with severe malaria was published, and the WHO\u000d\u000aasked the LSTM to rapidly incorporate this with existing trials of ACT for severe malaria in children\u000d\u000aso that the WHO were able to change its global guidelines to strongly recommend ACTs rather\u000d\u000athan quinine for treating severe malaria in children.5, 6\u000d\u000aIn 2012, the LSTM's reputation with the malaria panel led the WHO Director Generals' office\u000d\u000aasking LSTM to evaluate how well the organization was meeting current methodological standards\u000d\u000afor guideline development.7 This analysis showed that WHO guideline development methods in all\u000d\u000atopic areas had become more transparent since 2007, but that some departments were bypassing\u000d\u000aprocedures, and that the quality assurance standards set were not fully embedded in the\u000d\u000aorganization.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"3349","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Three sets of impact has been established by this research:\u000a    1) Changes to DoH guidelines. In June 1998, the UK government's Committee\u000a      on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment\u000a      (COT) published a report on recommending that ``pregnant women who are\u000a      atopic or for whom the father or any sibling of the unborn child has an\u000a      atopic disease, may wish to avoid eating peanuts and peanut products\u000a      during pregnancy and breast feeding.'' This advice was given in the\u000a      absence of any robust studies on the prevalence of peanut allergy and its\u000a      trend, and in the absence of any link between maternal peanut consumption\u000a      and peanut allergy in their offspring. The House of Lords, Science and\u000a      Technology Committee report on Allergy (6th Report, Session\u000a      2006-7) reviewed the evidence in the area and recommended \"that this\u000a      advice should be withdrawn immediately pending a comprehensive review by\u000a      the Food Standards Agency and the COT\". COT's Statement on the review of\u000a      the 1998 COT recommendation on peanut avoidance stated that \"Since the COT\u000a      recommendations were made, there have also been several studies published\u000a      on the frequency of sensitisation and allergy to peanuts, which could\u000a      inform understanding of whether the prevalence of this allergy is\u000a      increasing. It was therefore considered timely to re-assess the current\u000a      state of scientific knowledge in this area and, based on the evidence now\u000a      available, to re-consider whether the 1998 COT dietary recommendations\u000a      remain appropriate\" (CS1: http:\/\/cot.food.gov.uk\/pdfs\/cotstatement200807peanut.pdf).\u000a      Nine out of the 14 UK studies examined, originated from the Isle of Wight\u000a      Team (http:\/\/cot.food.gov.uk\/pdfs\/cotstatement200807peanut.pdf\u000a      page 12) illustrating the major contribution the team has made to the\u000a      evidence base. Following this review COT Committee concluded that \"the\u000a      previous dietary recommendations are no longer appropriate because of a\u000a      shift in the evidence base (CS2)\". The roll out of their revised guideline\u000a      and advice has benefitted groups along the entire healthcare supply chain:\u000a      individual parents, GPs and allergy services. The revised advice is also\u000a      being included within general advice given to mothers about pregnancy and\u000a      development of their baby, including the `Pregnancy' and `Birth to Five'\u000a      books (http:\/\/www.nhs.uk\/Conditions\/pregnancy-and-baby\/pages\/foods-to-avoid-\u000a      pregnant.aspx#Peanuts)\u000a      (CS3).\u000a    2) Provision of evidence that food allergy levels have not increased. The\u000a      birth cohort established by Professor Dean is the only birth cohort\u000a      worldwide set up specifically to investigate epidemiology of food allergy\u000a      using objective measures and her findings provided the first demonstration\u000a      that unlike other manifestations of allergic disorders (eg Asthma) the\u000a      rates of food allergy has not increased. This key evidence has informed\u000a      policy (CS4,5) as well as the advice that allergic consumers receive from\u000a      healthcare professionals and supporting organisations. As a result Prof\u000a      Dean and Dr Venter have delivered expert advice to bodies including the\u000a      European Food Safety Authority, the National Institute of Clinical\u000a      Excellence, the Royal College of Paediatrics and the European Academy of\u000a      Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Their prevalence data has significant\u000a      reach and has been included in 2010 US Food Allergy Guidelines (CS6). The\u000a      impact of this work has been confirmed by the chief executive of\u000a      Anaphylaxis Campaign (CS7): \"Their research is in these areas is world\u000a      leading in part because they are in a unique position to perform\u000a      longitudinal cohort studies with very little attrition. In the Allergy\u000a      world `Isle of Wight cohorts' are recognised by all\".\u000a    3) Changes in public awareness with respect to the prevalence of food\u000a      allergy. Since the publication of their findings Professor Dean and Dr\u000a      Venter have contributed to numerous public engagement exercises (e.g.\u000a      Focus on Health: Asthma and Allergy in your Family, http:\/\/www.port.ac.uk\/uopnews\/2012\/11\/29\/expert-advice-for-asthma-and-allergy-sufferers\/)\u000a      and training events for healthcare professionals (e.g. Allergy Academy\u000a      flagship training event for all healthcare professionals http:\/\/allergyacademy.org\/),\u000a      ensuring there is widespread awareness that prevalence of food allergy has\u000a      not increased. As stated in a letter by the director of Allergy Academy\u000a      (CS8), which has led the delivery of education in Allergy to over 5000\u000a      healthcare professionals, \"The information on prevalence of food allergies\u000a      as provided by Professor Taraneh Dean and her team has been used to inform\u000a      many of the educational sessions given at the Allergy Meeting.\u000a    4) The paper: Venter, C.; Pereira, B.; Voigt, K.; Grundy, J.; Clayton, C.\u000a      B.; Higgins, B.; Arshad, S.

The main\u000a      co-investigator for this research is Dr Carina Venter (University of\u000a      Portsmouth)\u000a    Food hypersensitivity (FHS) is an adverse reaction following food\u000a      ingestion that can be either a food allergy (if immunologically mediated)\u000a      or a non-allergic FHS. It is important that those producing guidance or\u000a      developing education programmes have robust population-based\u000a      epidemiological data regarding prevalence and risk factors of FHS to key\u000a      food allergens in children and other age groups.\u000a    Whilst there is evidence demonstrating increasing prevalence of other\u000a      manifestations of allergies such as asthma and atopic dermatitis, there\u000a      had been a paucity of studies, investigating the prevalence of FHS.\u000a    Following a competitive call Professor Dean was commissioned1\u000a      by the Food Standards Agency to establish the first UK birth cohort with\u000a      the specific aim of establishing prevalence of FHS using the objective\u000a      outcome measure of food challenges2. The team specifically\u000a      investigated the prevalence of peanut allergy, which is the most common\u000a      cause of food induced anaphylaxis in children, in a whole population birth\u000a      cohort (total 969 children) born between 2001 and 2002. This cohort was\u000a      compared with previous cohorts of children born in the same geographical\u000a      location, Isle of Wight, UK. The cohort was recruited ante-natally and\u000a      followed up at 1, 2 and 3 years of age: the 10 year follow up is the\u000a      subject of a current NIHR Fellowship. Prevalence of FHS to peanuts and\u000a      other foods was 1.9%, 3.8% and 4.5% at ages 1, 2 and 3 respectively. Based\u000a      on double-blinded, placebo-controlled, food challenge (DBPCFC), a gold\u000a      standard methodology used for such studies, and a good clinical history,\u000a      the cumulative incidence of FHS was 5.0% (48\/969, 95% CI: 3.7-6.5).3\u000a    The research team also established, using a validated food frequency\u000a      questionnaire for consumption of allergenic foods, that maternal dietary\u000a      intake of food allergens, and peanut in particular, during pregnancy and\u000a      breast-feeding did not influence subsequent development of FHS in children4.\u000a      We also discovered that the governmental advice to avoid peanuts was\u000a      actually followed by mothers regardless of their family history of\u000a      allergy, which could have had a detrimental effect and actually increase\u000a      the prevalence of allergic disorders in children5. The team was\u000a      able to use this evidence, based on their robust methodology, to call into\u000a      question results from previous studies. Overall, 33.7% of parents reported\u000a      a food-related problem and, of these, only 12.9% were diagnosed with FHS\u000a      by DBPCFC and history. Consequently, the results from this study\u000a      challenged the previously-held perception that peanut allergy and other\u000a      food allergies are increasing.6 The team demonstrated that\u000a      peanut allergy prevalence has changed over time, with a peak in peanut\u000a      sensitisation and reported allergy in children born in 1994-1996, but,\u000a      since the late 1990's, this seems to have stabilised.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3408","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a      The first UK child protection clinical guidelines\u000a      The Cardiff systematic reviews have directly informed five national\u000a        guidelines in the field child `protection:\u000a      \u000a        The first NICE evidence-based maltreatment guidelines (2009)[5.1].\u000a        The first joint guidelines published by the Royal College of\u000a          Radiology and Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) in\u000a          2008.

Commenting on\u000a        Core-Info, the former president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and\u000a        Child Health noted: \"This resource does not only allow easy access\u000a          for improved clinical decision-making, the evidence base also\u000a          underpins improved expert evidence in courts around the world\"\u000a        [5.7]. The influence of Cardiff's work has also been highlighted by the\u000a        American Academy of Pediatrics [5.6].\u000a      Core-Info analytics show that the website is used by 100,000 health\u000a        professionals, social workers, law enforcement, the judiciary and\u000a        researchers from 40 countries annually. A recent survey of child\u000a        protection paediatricians in the UK and Australia confirms that\u000a        Core-Info is used by 60% of these professionals to inform clinical\u000a        decisions, provide continuing professional development and education\u000a        material, inform legal reports and give scientific validation to expert\u000a        opinion. It is considered to be \"one of the most important\u000a          developments in the field, supporting better clinical decision making,\u000a          training and expert opinion in court, and increasing overall\u000a          confidence of paediatricians\" [5.5].\u000a      Six Core-Info leaflets developed jointly by the Cardiff team and the\u000a        NSPCC (2007-2013) translate key research findings into practice for\u000a        allied professionals in child protection. Since 2008, approximately\u000a        200,000 hard copies (plus numerous downloaded copies) have been sold to\u000a        non-specialists who work with, or come into contact, with children. The\u000a        Core-Info leaflets are regularly updated to reflect the latest evidence\u000a        and are widely used for national training (Levels 1-2) and as a quick\u000a        reference source for health visitors, social services, general\u000a        practitioners and police.\u000a      Impact on practitioners and services &#8212; an evidence base for clinical\u000a          practice\u000a      As a consequence of the wide-spread national and international\u000a        dissemination of CCPSR's research findings through national guidelines\u000a        and training, child health professionals now base assessments, diagnoses\u000a        and court evidence on scientifically informed and clinically validated\u000a        models and practices. The significance of this shift in practice is\u000a        summarised by the National Clinical Director for Children at the\u000a        Department of Health: \"This work is at the forefront in supporting\u000a          evidence based practice in a sensitive clinical field of great\u000a          importance\" [5.8].\u000a      The evidence base provided by the Cardiff group has helped child\u000a        protection professionals and expert witnesses to re-establish trust. The\u000a        standardised evidence-based practice means that convictions in court and\u000a        child-protection interventions are more reliable, with a lower\u000a        likelihood of wrongful convictions.\u000a      Impact on child health and welfare\u000a      The ultimate beneficiaries of this work are the children who are being\u000a        abused. Through the adoption of national guidelines and the\u000a        implementation of standardised evidence-based practice across the UK, it\u000a        is now more likely that abuse will be recognised and appropriately\u000a        investigated and abused children are more likely to be protected from\u000a        future harm.\u000a      The Deputy High Court Judge in the Family Division and Recorder in the\u000a        Crown and County Court states that one of the major benefits of\u000a        Cardiff's work has been the improvement in the scientific validation and\u000a        quality of expert opinion presented in Family and Criminal Child\u000a        Protection Court Cases, in particular the eradication of police and\u000a        paediatricians using colour to estimate the age of a bruise [5.9].\u000a      In 2013 the CCPSR group won the BMJ Child Health Team of the Year in\u000a        the BMJ Improving Health Awards [5.10].\u000a      ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Responding to the crisis in confidence amongst clinicians involved in\u000a      child protection, Cardiff University developed the world's first research\u000a      programme to provide the scientific basis for more reliable clinical\u000a      assessments of child abuse and neglect. The programme, which involves 21\u000a      systematic reviews (updated annually) and related primary studies, has\u000a      directly informed five national clinical guidelines, the National Child\u000a      Protection training program and the first NICE guidance on child\u000a      maltreatment. Through the Core-Info website, the evidence base created by\u000a      the Cardiff team is accessed each year by 100,000 users. Key messages from\u000a      their research have been published in a series of Core-Info leaflets which\u000a      have reached more than 250,000 allied professionals nationally. The\u000a      Cardiff research informs standardised national clinical practice, training\u000a      and legal decisions, ultimately improving the recognition and protection\u000a      of children from abuse or neglect.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Societal","Institution":"\u000a    Cardiff University\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Cardiff University","InstitutionName":"Cardiff University","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"Wales","UKPRN":10007814}],"Panel":"A         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a      \u000a1.

When cases went to court, expert medical opinions were provided\u000a      by a handful of clinicians who relied on their clinical experience, rather\u000a      than scientific evidence. Clinicians were accused of misrepresenting\u000a      evidence and being instrumental in the wrongful prosecution of mothers for\u000a      causing the deaths of their babies. Media and legal criticism led to a\u000a      lack of confidence in and amongst clinicians working in child protection.\u000a    An evidence base for the recognition and assessment of child abuse.\u000a    In 2002 Professor Alison Kemp (Senior Clinical Lecturer 1993-2005, Reader\u000a      2005-2009, Professor \/ Program Director 2009-present) and Dr Sabine\u000a      Maguire (Clinical Lecturer 2002-2008, 2008-present Principle Investigator)\u000a      established Cardiff Child Protection Systematic Reviews (CCPSR), funded by\u000a      the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, to develop\u000a      a scientific foundation for child protection policies and practice. The\u000a      research team includes two researchers, an information specialist from\u000a      SURE (Support Unit for Research Evidence at Cardiff University), a\u000a      statistician and a national panel of expert reviewers trained in critical\u000a      appraisal methods.\u000a    By 2013, CCPSR had completed 21 systematic reviews critically appraising\u000a      the world literature relating to the recognition and investigation of\u000a      child abuse. The group has published 28 peer- reviewed papers.\u000a    Methodological developments have included a novel ranking system for the\u000a      security of diagnosis of child abuse; this system has been adopted\u000a      internationally by other child protection research groups.\u000a    Key findings\u000a    Some of the most significant findings into clinical approaches and\u000a      practices regarding suspected cases of child abuse and neglect, are\u000a      summarised below:\u000a    \u000a      Ageing of bruises: In 2005 Maguire and colleagues from CCPSR\u000a        concluded that it is not possible to age bruises in children\u000a        accurately with the naked eye [3.1].\u000a      Ageing of fractures: Responding to the paucity of scientific\u000a        evidence, CCPSR carried out a primary study (2010-12) which concluded\u000a        that it is possible to age fractures within broad time frames\u000a        [3.2].\u000a      Characteristics of abusive bruises: In 2005 the Cardiff team showed\u000a        that in non-mobile infants, bruises over soft tissue areas that carry\u000a        the imprint of an implement were indicators of abuse, as were multiple\u000a        bruises of uniform shape [3.3]. This review led to the group's\u000a        successful application for the first MRC-funded study on bruising in\u000a        children (2007-12).\u000a      Abusive fractures: A CCPSR review (2008) found that rib fractures,\u000a        fractures to the shaft of the humerus in infants and femoral fractures\u000a        in non-mobile babies have a high probability of being caused by abuse\u000a        [3.4].\u000a      Abusive head trauma (AHT): The CCPSR created a database of\u000a        individual patient data collected from six international studies\u000a        (2009-11). The team developed a method for `individual patient data\u000a        analysis' and proposed a model to estimate the probability of AHT (a\u000a        contentious diagnosis) from clinical features [3.5]. The model has\u000a        subsequently been validated in clinical practice to improve the early\u000a        recognition of cases of suspected AHT.\u000a      Retinal haemorrhages are important features of AHT; the AHT\u000a        systematic reviews identified a lack of internationally recognised\u000a        reporting standards for haemorrhagic retinopathy in cases of AHT.\u000a        The CCPSR researchers developed and validated such a tool (2010-12)\u000a        [3.6].\u000a    \u000a      The quality of the group's work on bruising was cited in a Lancet\u000a        editorial (Cabinum-Foeller, E. and L.

The following examples have\u000d\u000a      been selected because they provide precise links between Cardiff research\u000d\u000a      and impact.\u000d\u000a    Example 1: AETNA Health Insurance Organisation: Prof. K. Resnicow\u000d\u000a      (Michigan, USA, 2010) used Cardiff health care textbooks, and the\u000d\u000a      agenda-setting and importance-confidence strategies within them, in the\u000d\u000a      training of trainers within AETNA, a company with over 36 million members.\u000d\u000a      The focus was on behaviour change among members with a chronic disease.\u000d\u000a      Between 2010 and September 2012, 83+ trainers in health care MI were\u000d\u000a      trained, along with 2,210 clinical staff worldwide, with a reported 43%\u000d\u000a      increase in engagement in the disease management programme and a 55%\u000d\u000a      decrease in drop-outs [5.3]. Professor Resnicow notes, \"The impact of\u000d\u000a        Rollnick and Butler's seminal research in Cardiff goes beyond the\u000d\u000a        private sector and is all but immeasurable. Leading US government and\u000d\u000a        professional bodies, e.g. the American Medical Association, the American\u000d\u000a        Academy of Pediatrics, and the US Preventive Task Force, have adopted\u000d\u000a        healthcare MI for the prevention and management of chronic disease\"\u000d\u000a      [5.4].\u000d\u000a    Example 2: Emergency &amp; Public Health Medicine in USA:\u000d\u000a      Healthcare strategies evaluated in Cardiff (\"pros and cons\", \"elicit-provide-elicit\")\u000a      for very brief emergency room consultations with alcohol and drug problems\u000d\u000a      were used in 1994 by Bernstein (Boston, USA) and Rollnick to\u000d\u000a      develop a 3-5 minute intervention, Brief Negotiation Interview\u000d\u000a      (BNI) [5.5]. Bernstein established effectiveness in numerous randomised\u000d\u000a      trials, and set up a BNI ART Institute. Since 2008 they\u000d\u000a      have trained 1525 clinicians across North and Central America. Data\u000d\u000a      obtained by Bernstein from the small Boston-based cohort of 52\/1525\u000d\u000a      clinicians (only 3.4% of the total), reveal that in 2011 alone,\u000d\u000a      BNI was used with 5,158 patients. For the longer period 2008-2012,\u000d\u000a      Bernstein estimates that these 52 clinicians saw a total of 44,983\u000d\u000a      patients, all of whom received BNI, a method of proven effectiveness. The\u000d\u000a      programme has been endorsed by the National Registry of Evidence-based\u000d\u000a      Programs [5.6]. Bernstein notes, \"Rollnick's research on brief MI has\u000d\u000a        had a direct and measurable impact on the delivery of brief intervention\u000d\u000a        in emergency room settings in North America from Bethel Alaska to\u000d\u000a        Bayamon Puerto Rico to Yale New Haven and Boston Medical Centers. The\u000d\u000a        benefit to patients emerged from our numerous controlled trials.\u000d\u000a        Implementation of this respectful and effective intervention now extends\u000d\u000a        way beyond the boundaries of our work here in Boston to many scores of\u000d\u000a        thousands of patients across the USA and in other countries.\" [5.7]\u000d\u000a    Example 3: Swedish Quitlines for tobacco and alcohol: Dr Astri\u000d\u000a      Brandell Eklund and colleagues, used a health care text and the strategies\u000d\u000a      of \"agenda-setting\" and \"importance and confidence\" in the training of\u000d\u000a      staff of these two national telephone services. Between January 2008 and\u000d\u000a      June 2012 counselling contact was made with 8,066 people on the alcohol\u000d\u000a      line, and 17,407 on the smoking line, with a reported quit rate of 36% for\u000d\u000a      the latter [5.8].\u000d\u000a    Example 4 - UK Family Nurse Partnership Programme [5.9]: The\u000d\u000a      founder of this intensive home-visiting programme for pregnant teens in\u000d\u000a      deprived settings bought 2,500 copies of the Rollnick\/Miller\/Butler Motivational\u000a        Interviewing in Health Care book for distribution among its home\u000d\u000a      visiting nurses tackling a wide range of behavioural issues (alcohol;\u000d\u000a      drugs; safe sex). Rollnick was contracted to provide training and support\u000d\u000a      to the UK rollout of this programme. Since 2008, the strategies developed\u000d\u000a      in Cardiff have been integrated into the training and supervision of 1000+\u000d\u000a      nurses who have delivered the programme to 9,207 families up to the end of\u000d\u000a      2012.\u000d\u000a    Example 5: African low resource settings [5.10] Paediatric Aids\u000d\u000a      Treatment in Africa (PATA &#8212;www.teampata.org) brings together HIV-AIDS\u000d\u000a      treatment teams for training from across the Continent.

People don't\u000d\u000a      respond uniformly well to being advised to change. This challenge is even\u000d\u000a      more marked in specialist addiction treatment, where a counselling method\u000d\u000a      was developed with a different goal - to avoid direct persuasion and\u000d\u000a      elicit peoples' own motivation to change.\u000d\u000a    Rollnick was the co-founder of this specialist method, Motivational\u000a        Interviewing (MI), defined as a counselling style for helping people\u000d\u000a      resolve ambivalence about behaviour change. In 1993,\u000d\u000a      Rollnick (Research Fellow [1993] - current Professor [2013]) and Stott\u000d\u000a      (Professor [1993] - current retired [2013]) considered this question for a\u000d\u000a      programme of research: Can MI be simplified for everyday practice in\u000d\u000a        hospitals and clinics, in which patients clarify for themselves why and\u000d\u000a        how they might change their behaviour?\u000d\u000a    20 years of research\u000d\u000a    Butler (1993, Clinical Fellow &#8212; current Professor) joined the team,\u000d\u000a      and for the first time, a careful study of the consultation on health\u000d\u000a      behaviour change emerged. All research was conceived and executed\u000d\u000a      in the Cardiff University's School of Medicine Cochrane Institute of\u000d\u000a      Primary Care and Public Health (CIPCPH).\u000d\u000a      There followed 20 years of research on specific brief consultation\u000d\u000a      strategies:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \"Pros &amp; Cons\" The patient describes the benefits and\u000d\u000a        drawbacks of change\u000d\u000a      \"Importance &amp; Confidence\" Specific questions to address the\u000d\u000a        \"why\" and \"how\" of change\u000d\u000a      \"Elicit-Provide-Elicit\" A new framework for exchanging\u000d\u000a        information with patients\u000d\u000a      \"Agenda-setting\" A method for deciding with patients which\u000d\u000a        behaviour change to focus on\u000d\u000a        These strategies were developed, tested, and published in papers and\u000d\u000a        textbooks for clinicians.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Smoking &amp; lifestyle change\u000d\u000a    Butler &amp; Rollnick (mid-1990s) conceived the \"importance\u000d\u000a        &amp; confidence\" strategy in experimental consultations with\u000d\u000a      smokers [3.1]. Its use by GPs achieved significantly better outcomes when\u000d\u000a      compared to advice-giving [3.2]. It was integrated into a larger\u000d\u000a      counselling method, along with \"pros and cons\" and the \"elicit-provide-elicit\"\u000d\u000a      strategy, published in two textbooks for clinicians, and then evaluated in\u000d\u000a      a MRC-funded, multi-site trial of effectiveness for promoting lifestyle\u000d\u000a      change [3.3].\u000d\u000a    Diabetes: Agenda-setting &amp; multiple-behaviour consultations\u000d\u000a    In 1993 Rollnick, Stott &amp; colleagues used a MRC grant\u000d\u000a      to develop and evaluate \"agenda-setting\" in adults with poorly\u000d\u000a      controlled diabetes [3.4]. This strategy for deciding what\u000d\u000a      behaviour change to focus on was then applied to children with Type 1\u000d\u000a      diabetes: Gregory (2002, Reader- current Professor), Rollnick,\u000d\u000a      Channon (2002 Consultant Clinical Psychologist &#8212; current, the same)\u000d\u000a      &amp; Robling (2003 Research Fellow &#8212; current Reader) began with a\u000d\u000a      pilot and successful trial of MI delivered by a psychologist [3.5]; they\u000d\u000a      then worked with parents and children to develop a child-friendly visual\u000d\u000a      agenda-setting chart and evaluated its use by doctors and nurses in a\u000d\u000a      multi-site controlled trial across UK services [3.6].\u000d\u000a    Integrating the research\u000d\u000a    This research on brief strategies for helping patients with behaviour\u000d\u000a      change was not only reported in journals, but integrated into the first\u000d\u000a      (and only) two MI healthcare textbooks for clinicians, and two subsequent\u000d\u000a      editions of the parent text of the broader MI method (2002 &amp; 2012).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3410","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The findings and recommendations of the Cardiff research team have\u000d\u000a      provided the basis for new educational materials, training programmes and\u000d\u000a      other decision management tools used by clinicians in the UK and abroad.\u000d\u000a      The Cardiff research has also informed new clinical guidelines in the UK\u000d\u000a      and elsewhere on the management of RTI. The widespread dissemination of\u000d\u000a      Cardiff's research is helping to improve antibiotic stewardship across\u000d\u000a      Europe. Our four trials (see Section 3) all demonstrated the effectiveness\u000d\u000a      of different tools to reduce antibiotic prescribing. The reductions ranged\u000d\u000a      from 32% to 67% in trial participants and a 4.2% reduction in overall\u000d\u000a      antibiotic prescribing (and a 5.5% reduction in antibiotic dispensing\u000d\u000a      costs) over a one-year period at the whole general practice level. This\u000d\u000a      equates to a saving of &#163;830 per annum for an average sized UK general\u000d\u000a      practice. Given the widespread adoption of Cardiff's tools and training in\u000d\u000a      NHS initiatives to reduce GP antibiotic prescribing (see below), if 50% of\u000d\u000a      all UK GP practices achieved just half of the average savings observed in\u000d\u000a      the trials, the direct costs savings across the country since publication\u000d\u000a      of the NICE guidelines would total &#163;9 million.\u000d\u000a    Guidelines\u000d\u000a    The NICE guidelines on managing acute RTI were published in 2009 and were\u000d\u000a      distributed to all GPs in the UK. They highlighted the importance of\u000d\u000a      eliciting patient expectations; GPs are encouraged to achieve a shared\u000d\u000a      understanding regarding the management and treatment of the infection.\u000d\u000a      This recommendation stems directly from the Cardiff research, which is\u000d\u000a      cited in the NICE publication [5.1]. Aspects of Cardiff's research have\u000d\u000a      also informed a revision of the Dutch national guidelines on RTIs [5.4].\u000d\u000a    Patient educational materials\u000d\u000a    In 2009 the Cardiff team published the results of a trial revealing that\u000d\u000a      use of the interactive booklet for children about RTIs, which was\u000d\u000a      developed by the Cardiff team, resulted in a two-thirds reduction in\u000d\u000a      antibiotic use [3.5, see `What this study adds' summary, p7]. The results\u000d\u000a      were picked up by the UK medical media, including Pulse, Healthcare Today\u000d\u000a      and Onmedica; the publicity stimulated widespread uptake of the booklet\u000d\u000a      around the UK. The booklet has been available for purchase at the Royal\u000d\u000a      College of GPs bookshop since 2010. Over 90,000 copies have been purchased\u000d\u000a      by or sent to general practices since 2009. In September 2009, for\u000d\u000a      example, NHS Forth Valley highlighted the `When Should I Worry?' booklet\u000d\u000a      as a potential aid to management of self- limiting upper respiratory\u000d\u000a      infections through the Whole System Working initiative in 2009-10. 27,000\u000d\u000a      copies of the booklet have been distributed to practices to date [5.2]. In\u000d\u000a      2012, Welsh Government sent 30,000 copies to all general practices in\u000d\u000a      Wales as part of European Antibiotic Awareness Day activities [5.3].\u000d\u000a    Training clinicians\u000d\u000a    The evaluation of Cardiff's training package showed that communication\u000d\u000a      skills training (to improve interactions with patients and enhance their\u000d\u000a      experience) and the promotion of a point-of-care blood test, used alone or\u000d\u000a      in combination, led to significant reductions in antibiotic prescribing.\u000d\u000a      The results of this study led directly to a change in the Dutch national\u000d\u000a      guidelines on lower respiratory tract infections; a training package on\u000d\u000a      the updated guidelines was sent to 11,000 GPs [5.6] and made freely\u000d\u000a      available online [5.4, 5.5]. The study also helped convince the Dutch\u000d\u000a      health insurance system to pay for C-reactive protein (CRP) point of care\u000d\u000a      testing [5.6].\u000d\u000aCardiff developed a blended learning package (e-learning,\u000d\u000a      practice based outreach, experiential learning, and reflections) about\u000d\u000a      antibiotic prescribing for RTIs. Research demonstrated this approach\u000d\u000a      reduced practice-level antibiotic prescribing, not just in those patients\u000d\u000a      included in the trial. The Cardiff team's research, including the learning\u000d\u000a      package, formed the basis of the Royal College of General Practitioners\u000d\u000a      Managing Acute Respiratory Tract Infections (MARTI) course, which by\u000d\u000a      December 2012 had been completed by over 4,300 clinical users and results\u000d\u000a      in an average 24% increase in test scores between pre and post course\u000d\u000a      evaluation [5.7]. A contract has just been signed where Cardiff's SME\u000d\u000a      partners involved in the trial of the blended learning are investing\u000d\u000a      &#163;50,000 in further development and its commercialisation. Cardiff's\u000d\u000a      research has influenced national and international antimicrobial\u000d\u000a      stewardship programmes and campaigns. For example, Cardiff's interactive\u000d\u000a      booklet for children and training in its use, and the MARTI module form\u000d\u000a      part of the TARGET antibiotic toolkit [5.8], which was developed in 2012\u000d\u000a      by the Antimicrobial Stewardship in Primary Care collaboration (ASPIC) and\u000d\u000a      has been accessed by more than 5,400 unique users since November 2012.\u000d\u000a    Public awareness and policy\u000d\u000a    The Cardiff team's development and trial of the blended learning package\u000d\u000a      were picked up by local and national media. Articles in The Telegraph\u000d\u000a      [5.9] and Professor Chris Butler's contributions to discussions on Radio\u000d\u000a      4's Women's Hour [5.10], Radio 4's Inside Health, and BBC Wales's Jason\u000d\u000a      Mohammed Show all helped to disseminate the message about reducing\u000d\u000a      antibiotic prescribing for RTIs to the general public. Butler, Francis and\u000d\u000a      Stanton also advise the Health Protection Agency, the Department of\u000d\u000a      Health, the Advisory Committee on Antimicrobial Resistance and Healthcare\u000d\u000a      Associated Infection, and the Welsh Antimicrobial Resistance Programme.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research by Cardiff University is contributing to initiatives within the\u000d\u000a      NHS and across Europe to safely reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing\u000d\u000a      and thus help contain antimicrobial resistant bacteria. Our researchers\u000d\u000a      conducted observational studies of prescribing patterns linked to local\u000d\u000a      resistance data and qualitative research with GPs and patients on their\u000d\u000a      perceptions of acute respiratory tract infections and antibiotic use and\u000d\u000a      resistance. This enabled the Cardiff team to develop clinician training\u000d\u000a      and patient education resources (covering issues such as communication\u000d\u000a      skills, point of care testing, and typical duration of infections) to\u000d\u000a      reduce unnecessary prescribing.

This research, published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in\u000d\u000a      1998, revealed several drivers for inappropriate prescribing, including GP\u000d\u000a      perceptions that community antibiotic prescribing was incidental to\u000d\u000a      resistance (`resistance is not a problem in my practice') and a lack of\u000d\u000a      tools to support clinicians to change their prescribing habits.\u000d\u000a    Butler, Dunstan and colleagues then produced the first ever evidence that\u000d\u000a      showed antibiotic use was linked to antibiotic resistance at a local\u000d\u000a      (practice) level. Analysing data from urine samples submitted by Welsh\u000d\u000a      GPs, they found that antibiotic resistance was common in primary care;\u000d\u000a      patients infected with resistant strains were sicker for longer and\u000d\u000a      consumed more healthcare resources compared to patients infected with\u000d\u000a      bacteria sensitive to antibiotic treatment. The research also revealed\u000d\u000a      that reducing antibiotic prescribing was associated with reduced\u000d\u000a      resistance at the general practice level [3.2].\u000d\u000a    In 2003 and 2006 Butler and Francis produced new data on the normal\u000d\u000a      illness course of upper RTIs in children and acute sore throat in adults.\u000d\u000a      This data is used to help set realistic expectations about likely illness\u000d\u000a      course. Butler, Francis, Wood and colleagues also conducted qualitative\u000d\u000a      research to describe the perceptions of both general practitioners (GPs)\u000d\u000a      and the general public regarding antibiotic use and resistance, including\u000d\u000a      interviews with GPs about their rationale for using broad-spectrum\u000d\u000a      antibiotics (which generally cause greater `collateral damage') and\u000d\u000a      parents about their information needs regarding their child's RTI.\u000d\u000a    Butler (as a work package leader), supported by others from Cardiff,\u000d\u000a      played a central role in the EU-funded FP6 project `Genomics to combat\u000d\u000a      resistance to antibiotics in Community-acquired lower respiratory tract\u000d\u000a      infections in Europe' which ran from 2006 to 2011. This project provided\u000d\u000a      evidence that there is `unhelpful' variation in the antibiotic prescribing\u000d\u000a      practices of doctors between 14 European sites. The project has produced\u000d\u000a      the most reliable data so far on the prognostic value of signs, symptoms\u000d\u000a      and point of care testing for RTIs in primary care [3.3], as well as trial\u000d\u000a      data on the effectiveness of antibiotics in adults with acute cough [3.4].\u000d\u000a    Evaluation of tools\u000d\u000a    From 2005-2011 the Cardiff team collated the insights from their\u000d\u000a      empirical investigations. Informed by complementary research strengths in\u000d\u000a      motivational interviewing, shared decision making, and other behaviour\u000d\u000a      change theories, the team developed a set of communication skills\u000d\u000a      strategies to help clinicians adopt a non-prescribing approach while\u000d\u000a      enhancing patient empowerment and maintaining patient satisfaction. Output\u000d\u000a      from this work included a communications skills training programme [3.3],\u000d\u000a      a blended learning package (http:\/\/www.stemmingthetide.org\/) [3.6], and\u000d\u000a      interactive patient information booklets, supported by online clinician\u000d\u000a      training, for children (www.whenshouldiworry.com) [3.5] and adults [3.7]\u000d\u000a      with RTIs.\u000d\u000a    The team also led or played a central role in four major trials of the\u000d\u000a      tools developed by the research. The tools under investigation included\u000d\u000a      `blended learning' (combining multi-media and interactive learning),\u000d\u000a      enhanced communication skills training, point of care testing, and\u000d\u000a      interactive booklets. The trials demonstrated statistically significant,\u000d\u000a      clinically important, safe, and acceptable reductions in antibiotic\u000d\u000a      prescribing through use of the tools [3.3, 3.5-3.7].

Capewell's seminal\u000d\u000a      work has been widely cited. He has also received invitations to talk to\u000d\u000a      politicians and policy\u000d\u000a      makers in London, the European Parliament in Brussels and the World Health\u000d\u000a      Organisation\u000d\u000a      (details below), plus presentations to lecture in prestigious academic\u000d\u000a      settings in the UK, Europe,\u000d\u000a      the USA (Harvard, Yale etc), and Australia (Sydney &amp; Melbourne\u000d\u000a      universities).\u000d\u000a    Proof of contribution\u000d\u000a      Capewell's research has been seen as a key contributor to CVD prevention\u000d\u000a      policy for well over a\u000d\u000a      decade. Capewell and colleagues have extensively disseminated their\u000d\u000a      findings internationally\u000d\u000a      including to policy makers and politicians. This led in 2008 to an\u000d\u000a      invitation to Capewell from NICE\u000d\u000a      (The National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence) to write a\u000d\u000a      specification for a full guidance\u000d\u000a      review on Cardiovascular disease prevention at the population level.\u000d\u000a      [7]. This was subsequently\u000d\u000a      supported by the NICE Topic Review Group, and then approved by ministers.\u000d\u000a      This then led to the\u000d\u000a      formation of the NICE Programme Development Group (PDG) in 2009. Capewell\u000d\u000a      was appointed\u000d\u000a      as PDG Vice Chair. He also served as a topic expert, authoring three NICE\u000d\u000a      evidence papers which\u000d\u000a      were subsequently cited as evidence in the final NICE publication in 2010\u000d\u000a      [8].\u000d\u000a    The NICE Guidance was published in June 2010 [8]. Fully implemented, the\u000d\u000a      recommendations\u000d\u000a      could prevent up to 40,000 premature cardiovascular deaths each year. The\u000d\u000a      NICE Guidance\u000d\u000a      received extensive positive media coverage including the Telegraph (front\u000d\u000a      page), The Times, BBC,\u000d\u000a      ITV etc. Altogether totaling over 150 separate news items, plus invited\u000d\u000a      editorials for Capewell in\u000d\u000a      the New Scientist, JAMA, European Heart J and Heart (all 2010), thus\u000d\u000a      influencing the wider clinical\u000d\u000a      community.\u000d\u000a    The 2010 NICE guidance has now been endorsed and extended in the 2012\u000d\u000a      NICE Commissioning\u000d\u000a      Guide on CVD prevention [9].

That specifically recommended\u000d\u000a      reductions in dietary salt and\u000d\u000a      tobacco which were subsequently actioned by the World Health Organisation\u000d\u000a      [11, 12].\u000d\u000a    Capewell's research has also translated into UK Faculty of Public\u000d\u000a        Health Position papers.\u000d\u000a      These are used as authoritative guidance by public health practitioners\u000d\u000a      across the UK. Capewell\u000d\u000a      has been notably active in co-authoring and advocating improvements in\u000d\u000a      food policy, specifically\u000d\u000a      around European subsidies from the Common Agricultural Policy, and front\u000d\u000a      of pack Traffic Light\u000d\u000a      Labelling to better inform consumers [13, 14].\u000d\u000a    Capewell was also invited as the sole public health expert on the Academy\u000d\u000a      of Medical Royal\u000d\u000a      Colleges Obesity Review [15].

His team has included UoL Senior Lecturers Martin O'Flaherty and\u000d\u000a      David Taylor-Robinson\u000d\u000a      (since 2006), plus many other UK and international colleagues.\u000d\u000a    Capewell's policy model, IMPACT, has been progressively developed and\u000d\u000a      refined at the UoL since\u000d\u000a      2000. The IMPACT model is comprehensive, synthesising data on all standard\u000d\u000a      treatments in all\u000d\u000a      patient groups, plus changes in all the major risk factors. It has been\u000d\u000a      tested, refined and validated,\u000d\u000a      particularly since 2008. IMPACT is the most widely used comprehensive CVD\u000d\u000a      policy model in the\u000d\u000a      world. It can now estimate deaths prevented or postponed,\u000d\u000a      life-years-gained, the cost-effectiveness of\u000d\u000a      different interventions, and the future deaths prevented by different\u000d\u000a      prevention policies (such as\u000d\u000a      increases in specific treatments or decreases in particular risk factors\u000d\u000a      [1,2] ).\u000d\u000a    IMPACT results have now been used to help to explain Coronary Heart\u000d\u000a      Disease (CHD) mortality\u000d\u000a      trends in over twenty very different populations, including England and\u000d\u000a      Wales, Scotland, Northern\u000d\u000a      Ireland, Ireland, Finland, Sweden, Iceland, Poland, the Czech Republic,\u000d\u000a      Italy, Spain, Syria,\u000d\u000a      Palestine, Tunisia, Turkey, China, New Zealand, Canada and the USA\u000d\u000a      [1,4,5].\u000d\u000a    The consistent findings from the IMPACT studies are that the largest\u000d\u000a      component of the widespread\u000d\u000a      declines in cardiovascular mortality rates reflects population-wide\u000d\u000a      improvements in major risk factors &#8212; notably\u000d\u000a      smoking, blood pressure and cholesterol (mainly reflecting diet).\u000d\u000a      Additional important\u000d\u000a      contributions then coming from specific medical treatments for acute cases\u000d\u000a      and thereafter for patients\u000d\u000a      with chronic cardiovascular disease [1-6].\u000d\u000a    Worryingly, the recent rises in obesity and diabetes prevalence have\u000d\u000a      generated additional deaths in the\u000d\u000a      UK and far beyond [4]. Westernisation of diet has been particularly\u000d\u000a      powerful and damaging in low and\u000d\u000a      middle income countries (such as China, Syria &amp; Tunisia) which are now\u000d\u000a      suffering dramatic and costly\u000d\u000a      increases in non-communicable disease burdens (notably cardiovascular\u000d\u000a      disease and diabetes) [5].\u000d\u000a    Since 2006, this MRC-funded research programme has been exploring the\u000d\u000a      complex relationships\u000d\u000a      between evidence, policy makers and decision making [3]. Collaborations\u000d\u000a      with UCL since 2010 have\u000d\u000a      produced IMPACTsec. This is the first comprehensive CHD policy model able\u000d\u000a      to quantify trends in\u000d\u000a      specific socio-economic groups. These studies confirmed the more powerful\u000d\u000a      effects of major risk\u000d\u000a      factors in deprived groups. Happily, they also demonstrated remarkably\u000d\u000a      equitable treatments across\u000d\u000a      all socioeconomic groups [4]. From 2010 onwards, Capewell's group has also\u000d\u000a      developed increasingly\u000d\u000a      refined food policy models. Results suggest that reducing dietary intake\u000d\u000a      of salt, transfats and saturated\u000d\u000a      fats and increasing fruit and vegetable consumption could massively reduce\u000d\u000a      death rates [6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"3866","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"1643084","Name":"Indonesia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"3077311","Name":"Czech Republic"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"},{"GeoNamesId":"290557","Name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The team not only conducted high quality research on misoprostol, but\u000d\u000a      have also provided practitioners worldwide with high-quality,\u000d\u000a      evidence-based guidelines to ensure effective and safe misoprostol use in\u000d\u000a      pregnancy.\u000d\u000a    National and International Guidelines\u000d\u000a    The `Bellagio guidelines' that came out of the UoL led expert reviews in\u000d\u000a      2007 were the first international guidelines to address the appropriate\u000d\u000a      dosages of misoprostol in pregnancy. A recognition of their importance led\u000d\u000a      to their adoption by the International Federation of Gynecology and\u000d\u000a      Obstetrics (FIGO) in 2009. This is the only organisation that brings\u000d\u000a      together professional societies of obstetricians and gynaecologists on a\u000d\u000a      global basis. The adopted guidelines were disseminated at the 2009 FIGO\u000d\u000a      World Congress in South Africa at a special session chaired by Prof Weeks.\u000d\u000a      The congress was attended by 6,400 delegates from 158 countries, and\u000d\u000a      misoprostol dosage packs, produced for the event, were placed in the\u000d\u000a      delegates' conference bags.

Prof Alfirevic\u000d\u000a      was on the expert group that developed the 2008 NICE Guidelines for\u000d\u000a        Induction of Labour [10] (and his work referenced in the final\u000d\u000a      report), Prof Weeks was on the committee that developed the WHO\u000d\u000a        recommendations for induction of labour [11] (3 of his publications\u000d\u000a      are referenced in the final report), and Prof Neilson chaired the expert\u000d\u000a      group that developed the WHO Recommendations for the prevention of\u000d\u000a        postpartum haemorrhage (WHO 2006, updated in 2012 [12]). The team's\u000d\u000a      work has also been heavily cited in the successful application to place\u000d\u000a      misoprostol on the core list of the 18th WHO Model List of\u000d\u000a      Essential Medicines for use in postpartum haemorrhage. Profs Weeks or\u000d\u000a      Alfirevic were cited 4 times in the original application [13], and 6 times\u000d\u000a      in the formal safety review commissioned by WHO [14].\u000d\u000a    Website\u000d\u000a    In 2002 Prof Weeks set up a website (www.misoprostol.org)\u000d\u000a      to disseminate information related to misoprostol in pregnancy. The\u000d\u000a      University of Liverpool has subsequently funded multiple revisions and\u000d\u000a      updates. It now contains 169 documents and 58 pages and includes the FIGO\u000d\u000a      guidelines, an extensive bibliography of over 1800 references, and\u000d\u000a      information on availability, dangers and protocols. Dosage posters are\u000d\u000a      also available for download and the main pages are translated into Dutch,\u000d\u000a      Spanish and Russian.\u000d\u000a    The website is used extensively throughout the world. It currently\u000d\u000a      receives around 16,500 visits per month (an increase of 45% from 2011) and\u000d\u000a      tops the Google search for misoprostol. Visitors to the site come from all\u000d\u000a      over the world: for example in September 2013 the top 15 countries were\u000d\u000a      India, Mexico, Australia, Brazil, Germany, Canada, UK, South Africa, Czech\u000d\u000a      Republic, Turkey, Indonesia, United Arab Emirates, Poland, Columbia and\u000d\u000a      Kenya. Most visitors are directed from search engines, but 10% directly\u000d\u000a      type `www.misoprostol.org'. 74% of the visits are to the home page or main\u000d\u000a      dosage page. The website is also referenced in guidelines including the\u000d\u000a      Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guideline on Late\u000d\u000a      Intrauterine Fetal Death and Stillbirth [15].\u000d\u000a    Leading opinion change amongst practitioners\u000d\u000a    The guidelines have also been spread to practitioners through the\u000d\u000a      production of highly cited articles.

The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth\u000d\u000a      Group is based in the department with Profs Neilson and Alfirevic as\u000d\u000a      co-ordinating editors. Prof Weeks joined the Department in 2003.\u000d\u000a    Misoprostol was originally developed for the prevention of stomach\u000d\u000a      ulcers, but is used world-wide in pregnancy off-label for miscarriage\u000d\u000a      management, labour induction and bleeding after childbirth. The\u000d\u000a      sensitivity of the uterus to misoprostol increases markedly through\u000d\u000a      pregnancy. In early pregnancy 800mcg is often needed, whilst in late\u000d\u000a      pregnancy the as little as 50 mcg may be too high dose. Thus the use of\u000d\u000a      the correct dose, route and frequency of administration is very important.\u000d\u000a      However, the lack of a mainstream licensed product for reproductive health\u000d\u000a      use and its wide availability on the black market mean that it is commonly\u000d\u000a      used at inappropriate or dangerous dosages (Deole &amp; Weeks, Int J\u000d\u000a        Gynecol Obstet 2010;109:71). The use of excessive doses has been\u000d\u000a      responsible for many maternal deaths from ruptured uterus in South Africa\u000d\u000a      (see 5th report into Confidential Enquiries in Maternal Deaths\u000d\u000a      in South Africa). A review in 2005 reported that in 1998 over 700,000\u000d\u000a      pregnancies were induced with misoprostol in the USA despite causing\u000d\u000a      uterine rupture, maternal and fetal deaths, and brain damage in newborn\u000d\u000a      infants.\u000d\u000a    For many indications, the appropriate dosage remained unknown. This\u000d\u000a      prompted the UoL to conduct randomised trials to find the optimal regimens\u000d\u000a      in terms of efficacy and safety for incomplete miscarriage (Uganda,\u000d\u000a      2001-5) [1] and three more to define the optimal dosage and route for\u000d\u000a      labour induction (multicentre 2003-6 [2] and 2006-8 [3], Libya\u000d\u000a      2009-11 [4]). These studies have clarified that low doses of oral and\u000d\u000a      vaginal misoprostol (20-25mcg) are not only effective for labour\u000d\u000a      induction, but reduce the rate of uterine over-contraction and fetal heart\u000d\u000a      rate abnormalities.\u000d\u000a    These trials feed into Cochrane reviews that address misoprostol use,\u000d\u000a      including those on oral misoprostol for induction of labour (Alfirevic\u000d\u000a      &amp; Weeks, 2006, under active revision in 2013), medical treatment for\u000d\u000a      early fetal death (Neilson et al, 2006) and medical treatments for\u000d\u000a      incomplete miscarriage (Neilson et al 2013). Other systematic reviews have\u000d\u000a      also been conducted by the UoL on misoprostol for the induction of labour\u000d\u000a      [5,8] and on the effect of dosage variation on misoprostol side effects\u000d\u000a      [6].\u000d\u000a    In 2007, Prof Weeks set up and chaired an international expert conference\u000d\u000a      to develop consensus guidelines on misoprostol dosages jointly funded by\u000d\u000a      the World Health Organisation and Rockefeller Foundation. Key\u000d\u000a      international researchers from 13 countries undertook data synthesis and\u000d\u000a      held a joint meeting to produce robust and high quality evidence.

This drug was demonstrated to be clinically\u000a      and cost effective to the NHS. SANAD also identified valproate as the most\u000a      effective treatment for patients with generalised epilepsy. A network\u000a      meta-analysis of similar antiepileptic drug trials provides the best\u000a      overview of currently available evidence. Prognostic modelling of these\u000a      data allow the identification of patients at differing risk of seizure\u000a      remission, allowing stratification for outcomes in patient consultations.\u000a    This work had the following impacts:\u000a    \u000a      SANAD triggered an update of the NICE epilepsy guideline which was\u000a        published in 2012 [7].

Identifying topiramate and gabapentin\u000a        as poor choices for monotherapy has resulted in significant savings for\u000a        the NHS.\u000a      SANAD underpins guidance in other countries (e.g. German epilepsy\u000a        guidelines [8], International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE guidelines)\u000a        [9].\u000a      SANAD allows better understanding of the impacts of taking\u000a        antiepileptic drugs, including: that there are few important differences\u000a        between drugs in quality of life outcomes; and that cognitive impairment\u000a        associated with epilepsy is more likely related to underlying pathology\u000a        than the drugs.

These studies have quantified risk to cognitive development\u000a      associated with a number of antiepileptic drugs and identify sodium\u000a      valproate as the drug with the greatest risk. Data allow better informed\u000a      decision making and have informed guidelines, and regulators.\u000a    This work has had the following impacts:\u000a    \u000a      Altered prescribing practices in the UK and US: There has been a\u000a        substantial reduction in the prescribing of valproate to women with\u000a        epilepsy of child bearing age and a subsequent increase in alternative\u000a        drugs including lamotrigine and levitaricatem [5,6,15].\u000a      The recommendations of the Federal Drugs Administration [13] \"The\u000a          U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is informing the public that\u000a          children born to mothers who take the anti-seizure medication\u000a          valproate sodium or related products (valproic acid and divalproex\u000a          sodium) during pregnancy have an increased risk of lower cognitive\u000a          test scores than children exposed to other anti-seizure medications\u000a          during pregnancy.

It\u000a      addresses the key clinical questions: when to start treatment and which is\u000a      the appropriate treatment. These questions require assessment of both\u000a      benefit and harm.\u000a    Key researchers from the UoL are Profs A Marson, G Baker, P Williamson, A\u000a      Jacoby, D Chadwick (retired) and Dr C Tudur-Smith. The MRC Multicentre\u000a      Study of Early Epilepsy and Single Seizures (MESS 1993-2000) recruited\u000a      1,400 patients and compared the policies of immediate and deferred\u000a      treatment for patients presenting with single seizures and early epilepsy.\u000a      This trial provides the best evidence worldwide to inform decisions about\u000a      when to start treatment. Results showed that early treatment reduced the\u000a      risk of a recurrence but had no effect on longer term seizure outcome or\u000a      quality of life; and ends the long-standing debate that `seizures beget\u000a      seizures' in early epilepsy. Predictive modelling of data identified\u000a      patients at low, medium and high risk of recurrence, informing risk\u000a      prediction and thus clinical decisions. Data have also been modelled to\u000a      underpin driving policy in the UK and EU following a process to harmonise\u000a      legislation across the EU. Models identified time points at which it is\u000a      appropriate to allow patients to return to driving and identified patients\u000a      at higher risk.\u000a    The NIHR Health Technology Assessment Programme funded study of Standard\u000a      and New Antiepileptic Drugs (SANAD 1998-2006) compared clinical, quality\u000a      of life and cost effectiveness outcomes for standard and new antiepileptic\u000a      drugs for patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy. This trial provides the\u000a      best evidence worldwide to inform decisions about which is the drug of\u000a      choice for particular patients. This trial identified lamotrigine, a new\u000a      drug, as a first line treatment for newly diagnosed focal epilepsy, being\u000a      as effective as the standard treatment, carbamazepine, but better\u000a      tolerated, and cost effective. For generalised epilepsy patients,\u000a      valproate, the standard treatment, was identified as the most effective\u000a      treatment. This poses a significant challenge for the management of a\u000a      particular patient subgroup, women of child bearing potential, for whom\u000a      there is growing evidence that valproate is associated with a higher\u000a      teratogenic risk.\u000a    This challenge is being addressed through the Liverpool group's\u000a      collaboration with colleagues in Manchester and the US in a series of\u000a      cohort studies assessing outcomes in children exposed to antiepileptic\u000a      drugs in utero. In their large prospective study the Liverpool Manchester\u000a      Neurodevelopment Group found a significant impact of sodium valproate\u000a      exposure on cognitive development, particularly verbal IQ, in children\u000a      assessed up to the age of 2 years. The NEAD study group (a UK\/US NIH\u000a      funded collaboration) found that in utero exposure to sodium valproate had\u000a      a significant and negative impact on the IQ of children when assessed at\u000a      age 3 and 6 years in comparison to children exposed to other antiepileptic\u000a      drugs (carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and phenytoin). Further, the UoL UK\u000a      study demonstrated significant risks associated with in utero exposure to\u000a      Sodium Valproate in comparison with control children across key areas of\u000a      neuropsychological functioning, as well as an association with autism.\u000a    The Cochrane Epilepsy Group has its editorial base in Liverpool (NIHR\u000a      funded, Marson Coordinating Editor, Tudur Smith Statistical Editor) has\u000a      produced over 60 systematic reviews, focussing on drug treatments and\u000a      other interventions for epilepsy.

These approaches were\u000d\u000a      developed by specialist teams of psychologists and physiotherapists, and\u000d\u000a      applied more broadly to primary care. Our back pain trial (Hay et al.\u000d\u000a      2005) showed that our training and mentoring programme enable primary care\u000d\u000a      physiotherapists to successfully deliver psychologically informed\u000d\u000a      physiotherapy, encouraging patients to alter unhelpful attitudes and pain-\u000d\u000a      related fears, increasing activity, and supporting self-management and\u000d\u000a      return-to-work. By integrating these research findings into routine health\u000d\u000a      services, we have ensured more immediate improvements in the care provided\u000d\u000a      for back pain patients. Our staff have led and collaborated on the\u000d\u000a      development of back pain and chronic pain management (`IMPACT') services,\u000d\u000a      which continue to offer enhanced approaches to pain management.

This is strong justification for the\u000d\u000a      focus of our research on the impact, long-term outcomes, and optimal\u000d\u000a      management of back pain, strongly supported by patient and public\u000d\u000a      involvement from our dedicated Research User Group. This research has\u000d\u000a      generated over 190 peer-reviewed publications since 1994. Based on large\u000d\u000a      primary care-based cohort studies funded by Arthritis Research UK,\u000d\u000a      Wellcome Trust and National Institute of Health Research (NIHR), we have\u000d\u000a      improved current understanding of the impact and prognosis of back pain.\u000d\u000a      The research outputs overturned the commonly held belief that back pain\u000d\u000a      patients have a good prognosis and highlighted the multidimensional\u000d\u000a      consequences of pain. Croft (Keele University, Professor of Primary Care\u000d\u000a      Epidemiology, 1995-present) conducted one of the first population-based\u000d\u000a      studies of back pain using linked medical record data, and demonstrated\u000d\u000a      that 75% of patients still experience pain and disability one year after\u000d\u000a      consultation in primary care, with psychological and social factors\u000d\u000a      predicting poor long-term outcome (references 1,2). Using novel\u000d\u000a      statistical approaches to analysing longitudinal data, Dunn (Wellcome\u000d\u000a      Trust Reader in Epidemiology, Keele University, 2008-2014) identified\u000d\u000a      distinct back pain trajectories characterised by increasing psychosocial\u000d\u000a      consequences and risk of poor long-term outcome (reference 3). These\u000d\u000a      insights instigated a shift in the classification of back pain from a\u000d\u000a      focus on current pain duration and diagnosis to a prognostic definition\u000d\u000a      based on assessment of key physical and psychosocial factors to estimate\u000d\u000a      risk of poor outcome, and initiated the development and validation of a\u000d\u000a      brief screening tool for use in clinical practice (STarTBack Tool,\u000d\u000a      reference 4). This research has been pivotal in the development of new\u000d\u000a      approaches to the management of back pain.\u000d\u000a    In a National Lottery funded randomised trial Hay (Professor in Community\u000d\u000a      Rheumatology, Keele University, 1994-present) demonstrated that\u000d\u000a      appropriately trained physiotherapists can adopt and incorporate\u000d\u000a      psychosocial approaches in the management of back pain, and that such a\u000d\u000a      pain management approach can be delivered in fewer sessions and with equal\u000d\u000a      effectiveness compared to a standard package of physiotherapy (reference\u000d\u000a      5). Key findings from this trial and our prognostic studies underpinned a\u000d\u000a      new programme of research funded by Arthritis Research UK, the Health\u000d\u000a      Foundation and the NIHR, developing and testing a model of stratified care\u000d\u000a      based on patients' prognosis. In this model, patients at low risk of poor\u000d\u000a      outcome are supported to self- manage, while those at medium and high risk\u000d\u000a      access treatment that target their key physical and psychosocial obstacles\u000d\u000a      to recovery. We provided robust evidence that stratified care is superior\u000d\u000a      to best current care in a large randomised trial (STarTBack trial,\u000d\u000a      reference 6) where subgrouping using the STarTBack screening tool and\u000d\u000a      matched treatments improved patients' clinical and work outcomes with\u000d\u000a      clear cost-savings for the NHS and society. A subsequent impact study\u000d\u000a      (Foster, NIHR Professor of Musculoskeletal Health in Primary Care, Keele\u000d\u000a      University, 2012-17) confirmed that stratified care can be implemented in\u000d\u000a      primary care, leading to improvements in patient outcomes including\u000d\u000a      disability and days lost from work at similar healthcare costs.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6284","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    Key insight: Osteoarthritis as a clinical syndrome of persistent joint\u000d        pain and disability\u000d    Our epidemiologic estimates of joint pain, osteoarthritis, and severity of\u000d    disability have informed central government and directed the\u000d      commissioning of clinical services for osteoarthritis across England\u000d    by underpinning the costing reports and templates produced by NICE and\u000d    rolled out nationally [1].

We have combined\u000d      evidence synthesis, analysis of routine recording in a network of general\u000d      practices (registered population=100,000) with new population surveys of\u000d      35,959 residents of North Staffordshire, to provide accurate, national\u000d      estimates of the burden of painful osteoarthritis and associated\u000d      disability [1]. [Programme Grants from the Medical Research Council\u000d      (Croft) and Arthritis Research UK (Peat); 2000-2012].\u000d    (ii) Identify possible contributing causes. Our studies have\u000d      focused on lifestyle factors. Between 1993 and 2001, Croft (Professor of\u000d      Primary Care Epidemiology, Keele University, 1995-) and collaborators in\u000d      Southampton University discovered several high-risk occupations (farming,\u000d      mining, carpet-fitting) and demonstrated that prolonged kneeling and\u000d      squatting were specific, potentially modifiable exposures associated with\u000d      developing knee osteoarthritis [2].\u000d    (iii) Develop and test new methods for improving patient assessment\u000d        in primary care. Pain and its effects on individuals with\u000d      osteoarthritis are often under-recognised in general practice. Our\u000d      clinical studies, using intensive clinical and imaging assessments in over\u000d      2000 adults with joint pain, developed and validated new and practical\u000d      tools to support assessment in primary care. We recently demonstrated that\u000d      3 simple questions asked by the GP during the consultation can improve\u000d      their judgement of whose symptoms are unlikely to respond to routine care\u000d      [3] [402 patients, 5 GP practices, ARUK Primary Care Fellowship,\u000d      2004-2008: Mallen].\u000d    (iv) Evaluate and implement new interventions aimed at more effective\u000d        primary care management.\u000d      Care was traditionally focussed on what the general practitioner and the\u000d      orthopaedic surgeon could offer. Our TOPIK trial [325 patients, 15 GP\u000d      practices, 2001-2004; ARUK project grant: Hay] was undertaken in response\u000d      to gaps in evidence identified by local clinicians. Short-term\u000d      improvements in health outcomes, reduced use of anti-inflammatory drugs,\u000d      and high patient satisfaction were achieved by giving patients with knee\u000d      osteoarthritis greater access to community physiotherapy (individualised\u000d      exercise programme; advice on activity and pacing), and pharmacists\u000d      (face-to-face medication review and advice) [4]. In separate trials we\u000d      have confirmed the benefits of advice and exercise for knee\u000d      osteoarthritis, that acupuncture yields no additional benefit [5] [352\u000d      patients, 37 NHS physiotherapy centres, 2003-2005; ARUK project grant:\u000d      Hay], and that for hand osteoarthritis joint protection education offered\u000d      by occupational therapists is beneficial [6] [257 patients, 5 general\u000d      practices, 2008-2009; ARUK project grant: Dziedzic].\u000d    We are now combining qualitative interviews and observations with\u000d      practitioners and patients with large-scale trials to evaluate approaches\u000d      to enhance adherence to exercise [526 patients, 55 NHS physiotherapists],\u000d      and implement NICE recommended management into everyday routine primary\u000d      care [525 patients, 8 GP practices] [2008-2013; NIHR Programme Grant for\u000d      Applied Research: Hay].\u000d    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6304","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    It has been estimated that globally there are almost as many mobile phone\u000a      subscriptions as there are people. Rigorous, high quality, independent\u000a      research is vital for governments and agencies responsible for\u000a      safeguarding public health against a background of increasing concern over\u000a      potential harms.\u000a    Impacts on health and welfare and public policy and services\u000a     \u000a    International policy\u000a    The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) produces\u000a      monographs on environmental factors and the risk of human cancer providing\u000a      scientific support for action taken by national health agencies tasked\u000a      with preventing exposure to potential carcinogens. The long-awaited\u000a      monograph evaluating the carcinogenicity of mobile phone exposure was\u000a      delayed more than two years to ensure the inclusion of evidence from\u000a      Interphone [A].\u000a    Primary evidence from Interphone showed that overall, mobile phone users\u000a      had no increased risk of brain tumours (although in a single small\u000a      subgroup of those with the highest cumulative call time, a raised glioma\u000a      risk was seen). No trend in increasing risk was observed for cumulative\u000a      call time or for increasing numbers of calls or years of mobile use. The\u000a      World Health Organization (WHO) website [B] notes `Based largely\u000a        on these [Interphone] data, IARC has classified radiofrequency\u000a        electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B)',\u000a      a low risk category which also includes coffee consumption. It also cites\u000a      Interphone (the only individual study discussed) as `the largest\u000a        retrospective case-control study to date ... showing no increased risk\u000a        of glioma or meningioma with mobile phone use of more than 10 years'.\u000a    The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection\u000a      (ICNIRP) is an independent international body that publishes Exposure\u000a        Guidelines for Non-Ionising Radiation, endorsed by the WHO, and\u000a      which includes radiofrequency fields from mobile phones. These guidelines\u000a      are on the radiation protection agenda of virtually every country\u000a      worldwide. They have been formally adopted as national standards in over\u000a      50 countries including Australia, Canada, many countries in Europe, Latin\u000a      America and SE Asia, and form the basis of the US and Japanese guidelines.\u000a      In 2010\/11, ICNIRP published specifically on Interphone [C],\u000a      commenting on its large size and noting that `Interphone added greatly\u000a        to the volume of evidence available' and that the outcomes include\u000a      an important contribution to the evidence base for the ongoing review of\u000a      international exposure guidelines.\u000a    The ICNIRP Standing Committee on Epidemiology states `the accumulating\u000a        evidence is increasingly against the hypothesis that mobile phones cause\u000a        brain tumours in adults'. It adds, \"importantly, Interphone has\u000a        provided valuable methodological insights aiding the interpretation of\u000a        epidemiological research into mobile phones and health\" [D].\u000a    UK Government policy\u000a    The Health Protection Agency (HPA), now part of Public Health England,\u000a      has a statutory responsibility to advise the Department of Health on\u000a      health effects related to mobile phones and has adopted the ICNIRP\u000a      standards on radiation protection exposure for mobile phones. In their\u000a      public health advice, the HPA quote their independent Advisory Group on\u000a      Non-Ionising Radiation (AGNIR) which states: `T he INTERPHONE\u000a        study ... has contributed importantly to our understanding of possible\u000a        health risks from use of mobile phones' [E]. A dedicated web\u000a      section on Interphone on the HPA website has seen approximate 200 visitors\u000a      a month since April 2010 (E). A major HPA report on radiofrequency\u000a      electromagnetic fields published in 2012 addresses Interphone in detail\u000a      and concludes there is no convincing evidence that mobile phone\u000a      technologies cause adverse effects on human health [F].\u000a    Public debate and awareness\u000a    A measure of the significance of the impact of both the UK and the\u000a      Interphone studies for the general public was the management of media\u000a      dissemination by the Science Media Centre, London [G], an\u000a      organisation that independently promotes the voices and views of the\u000a      scientific community to the news media. McKinney gave press and TV (BBC,\u000a      ITV, Sky News) briefings (e.g. Mobile phones 'unlikely' to cause\u000a        cancer, BBC News), and we are aware of over 75 news articles,\u000a      including articles in all the UK national broadsheets (e.g. Mobile\u000a        phone study finds no solid link to brain tumours, The Guardian) and\u000a      across the international press (including the New York Times and Reuters)\u000a      that reported on Interphone.\u000a    Impact on commerce\u000a    Reassurance for industry\u000a    Interphone has enabled governments in over 50 countries worldwide to\u000a      adopt scientifically validated exposure guidelines that have allowed\u000a      continued expansion of the mobile phone industry, leading to major\u000a      economic benefits. Without Interphone results, as one UK AGNIR committee\u000a      member points out: `There would have been pressures to restrict\u000a        exposures to the radiofrequency radiation from mobile phones on a\u000a        precautionary basis' [H]. He added that Interphone\u000a      results have `helped to allay public anxieties about mobile phone\u000a        technology' potentially increasing their commercial value.\u000a    The mobile phone industry is forecast to have a global market value of\u000a      $334.8 billion in 2015. Mobile phone network operators and manufacturers\u000a      both in the UK and worldwide have committed over $13.4 billion since 2000\u000a      towards investigating health impacts of mobile phone usage. Funding to the\u000a      University of Leeds and Interphone was `firewalled' to ensure the\u000a      independence of the academic researchers but the results were\u000a      unsurprisingly welcomed by the industry [I]. The UK Mobile\u000a      Operators Association, a consortium of all UK network operators, stated\u000a      that `Interphone is likely to be recognised as an important part of the\u000a        wider scientific evidence' underpinning the WHO policy advice on RF\u000a      Environmental Health Criteria [J].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    More than 6.5 billion people worldwide use mobile phones, and\u000a      identification of any associated health risks is of vital importance to\u000a      global public health.

Once shown to be viable, the multinational Interphone study was set\u000a      up to determine whether mobile phone use increased the risk of brain\u000a      tumours. McKinney played a key role in establishing and implementing\u000a      Interphone from its inception in 2000 and was one of five scientists on\u000a      the epidemiology committee, formulating the scientific direction and\u000a      conduct of the research (1). Also in 2000 in Leeds, Parslow managed the\u000a      design and programming of the common data collection tool (the computer\u000a      assisted personal interview (CAPI)) used by all 13 countries in Europe,\u000a      North America, Asia and Australia contributing to Interphone.\u000a    As part of the UK North study in Leeds, work was done to validate how\u000a      accurately individuals remember their past use of mobile phones by\u000a      comparing individual `recall' with mobile phone records (2). The results\u000a      showed reported use may not represent actual use, a finding replicated in\u000a      Interphone, using validation data from Leeds and 10 other international\u000a      centres (3). Leeds also ran a pilot study, provided the only UK data, and\u000a      consulted on data analysis, for Interphone research of mobile phone power\u000a      output, leading to a new exposure assessment for mobile phone radio-\u000a      frequency radiation (4). Through this key validation work, Parslow and\u000a      Sarah Hepworth (University of Leeds; Research Fellow, 2002-05,\u000a      Senior Research Fellow 2005-date) made the only UK contribution to a\u000a      series of studies (2,3,4) that enhanced the scientific robustness of\u000a      Interphone.\u000a    In 2006, independently of Interphone, an academic collaboration between\u000a      the UK North study in Leeds and the UK South study (run by Professor\u000a      Anthony Swerdlow, Institute of Cancer Research, London) published national\u000a      results showing that overall mobile phone use was not associated with an\u000a      increased risk of developing a brain tumour (5). This was led by Leeds\u000a      (Hepworth and McKinney, first and last authors) who contributed 60% of the\u000a      brain tumour cases in the study.\u000a    This UK data combined with that from 12 other countries was used to\u000a      create an Interphone dataset on over 5,000 brain tumours. Leeds was the\u000a      largest Interphone study centre contributing 23% of overall cases. Results\u000a      from Interphone published in 2010 showed no evidence of an increase in\u000a      risk of developing a brain tumour as a result of using a mobile phone (6).\u000a      Interphone remains the largest and most comprehensive case control study\u000a      of different independent populations.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"6305","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1168579","Name":"Pakistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1282988","Name":"Nepal"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Our work has directly led to changes to government policy and public\u000a      service guidelines and\u000a      practices for TB control across Nepal and Pakistan, improving care for\u000a      more than 300,000 people\u000a      with TB annually, and helping to protect nearly 200 million people from TB\u000a      annually. The strategies\u000a      we developed and demonstrated were effective, which have been rolled out\u000a      since 2008, have led\u000a      to improved quality of life for patients through reduced financial burden,\u000a      better treatment outcomes,\u000a      reducing risk of TB spread and development of drug resistant strains of\u000a      TB. Without our research,\u000a      and development support, it is unlikely that any change to care would have\u000a      occurred. These\u000a      strategies have also been adopted in other low-income countries, such as\u000a      Swaziland.\u000a    Impacts on international development\u000a      From the outset, to ensure our research influenced policy and practice at\u000a      large scale, we adopted\u000a      a deliberate strategy of working closely with National TB Programmes. This\u000a      strategy develops\u000a      trust; ensures our research addresses national priorities; ensures\u000a      findings are relevant for policy\u000a      makers; promotes policy-makers' ownership of the research findings; and\u000a      encourages joint\u000a      development of subsequent policy, operational guidelines and training\u000a      methods and materials.\u000a      Much of our research uptake was made possible through our partnership with\u000a      in-country research\u000a      and development NGOs, set up by ex-students\/employees of the University of\u000a      Leeds. TB\u000a      Programme Managers and members of their teams were involved from\u000a      conception (responding to\u000a      their prioritisation of the problems) to completion. This included joint\u000a      development of the\u000a      interventions to be tested, regular briefings and discussions of likely\u000a      implications of findings.\u000a    Our research and research uptake strategy have together led directly to\u000a      better, evidence-informed,\u000a      public policy and improved public services in Nepal and Pakistan for\u000a      people with TB. We were\u000a      involved in the development of draft national policy and operational plans\u000a      published since 2008.\u000a      National guidelines adopted since 2008 have been revised to take account\u000a      of our findings, and our\u000a      patient-friendly approaches have been implemented in both in Nepal (A-G)\u000a      and Pakistan (H-J).\u000a    We have also jointly developed training materials and courses that have\u000a      been used by the TB\u000a      Programmes from 2008 onwards to train health workers in the new\u000a      strategies. Walley and Newell\u000a      have provided on-going advice and support to the NTPs throughout the\u000a      assessment period.\u000a      More widely, the research influenced key WHO\/Stop TB Partnership (www.stopTB.org)\u000a      documents\u000a      (K-M) (including the Stop TB strategy 2006), in which the\u000a      requirement for DOT has been replaced\u000a      by a more patient-centred approach of `supervision and patient support'.\u000a      Although publication of\u000a      these documents falls outside the assessment period, their influence in\u000a      encouraging adoption of\u000a      this strategy across low-income countries has continued throughout the\u000a      assessment period.\u000a    Impacts on health and welfare\u000a      Our research and our research uptake strategy have together led to 100%\u000a        reach across our\u000a        intended target populations - the (overwhelmingly poor) people of\u000a      Nepal and Pakistan receiving\u000a      care for TB - starting in 2008 and continuing to date. This means improved\u000a      care for 30,000 people\u000a      with TB in the mountain\/hill districts of Nepal annually, helping protect\u000a      30 million people from TB\u000a      infection in Nepal (A-G); and improved care for 300,000 people with\u000a      TB in Pakistan annually,\u000a      helping protect 177 million people in Pakistan (H-J) (based on WHO\u000a      statistics on numbers at risk).\u000a    Our research has also contributed to improved TB treatment outcomes in\u000a      both countries (N).\u000a    \u000a      in Nepal, the TB treatment success rate was 48% (case detection 56%)\u000a        in 1995 prior to our\u000a        research, and 85% (case detection 71%) in 2011: mortality fell by 900 to\u000a        7,000.\u000a      in Pakistan, the TB treatment success rate was 70% (case detection\u000a        4.5%) in 1995, and 91%\u000a        (case detection 65%) in 2011: mortality fell by 31,000 to 59,000.\u000a    \u000a    Our research has also led to significantly improved quality of life\u000a        for people with TB in Nepal and\u000a      Pakistan, who no longer need to attend a clinic daily, and can therefore\u000a      continue their usual\u000a      employment\/duties and follow normal lives (4), reducing the burden\u000a      and costs of TB.\u000a    \u000a      In Nepal, we estimated costs to patients using family\/community health\u000a        worker DOT were\u000a        US$32 lower than using standard health centre DOT (a reduction of nearly\u000a        50%) (5). To put this\u000a        in context, the average annual income (2001) was US$400 and 55% of the\u000a        population earned\u000a        less than the international poverty line (IPL) of US$1.25 per day.\u000a      in Pakistan, we estimated costs to patients using family\/community\u000a        health worker DOT were\u000a        US$27 lower than using standard health centre DOT (a reduction of 50%) (3).\u000a        The average\u000a        annual income (2001) was US$750 and 23% of the population earned less\u000a        than the IPL.\u000a    \u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Leeds research has led to adoption of effective, patient-friendly\u000a      tuberculosis (TB) care delivery in\u000a      Nepal and Pakistan, relaxing the global TB treatment strategy's\u000a      requirement that (generally very\u000a      poor) patients attend a health centre every day for 2 months for\u000a      supervision and support that led to\u000a      unemployment, poverty and debt. This impact has reach across the more than\u000a      300,000 people a\u000a      year treated for TB in Nepal and Pakistan; and its significance is that\u000a      patients can retain their usual\u000a      employment yet still have a high likelihood of cure.

Until 2006, the TB\u000a      control policy recommended\u000a      by WHO included Direct Observation of Treatment (DOT) by a health worker\u000a      at a health centre\u000a      daily for at least the first 2 months of treatment. We observed that this\u000a      strategy caused substantial\u000a      hardship to poor patients, severely disrupting their ability to work,\u000a      since health centres are\u000a      generally only open during working hours. During treatment, many employed\u000a      TB patients lost their\u000a      jobs; daily labourers could not get work; farmers struggled to access\u000a      clinics; household duties\u000a      including childcare were disrupted; and school and college students had\u000a      difficulties continuing their\u000a      studies. Health centre DOT ignores the imperatives of daily survival for\u000a      poor people, and forces\u000a      many people to seek care in the private sector, which has poor treatment\u000a      outcomes, leading to\u000a      further illness and death, and continuing transmission of TB.\u000a    Despite being part of global policy, there was no evidence to support the\u000a      use of health centre DOT\u000a      rather than more flexible ways of encouraging continuation and completion\u000a      of treatment. We\u000a      hypothesised that flexible strategies could produce cure rates as good as\u000a      or better than daily\u000a      health centre DOT and be more patient-friendly. We planned from the outset\u000a      that if the context-\u000a      appropriate strategies we developed proved effective, we would use our\u000a      good relationships with\u000a      National TB Programmes to encourage changes in policy and help implement\u000a      such strategies.\u000a    From 1996 to 2000, our research team at the University of Leeds carried\u000a      out an individually\u000a      randomised controlled trial in Pakistan to compare treatment outcomes and\u000a      patient satisfaction\u000a      using daily health centre DOT with those obtained using more\u000a      patient-friendly strategies of\u000a      treatment supervision and patient support by community health volunteers\u000a      or family members at or\u000a      near the patient's home. The team was led by John Walley\u000a      (Professor of International Public\u000a      Health, employed by UoL 1992-) with James Newell (Professor of\u000a      International Public Health,\u000a      1995-) and Amir Khan (UoL PhD graduate, who set up a Pakistani NGO - the\u000a      Association for\u000a      Social Development - to operationalize the research and development).\u000a    The trial demonstrated that patient-friendly approaches led to higher\u000a      cure rates than daily health\u000a      worker DOT (1). Our development of these approaches was guided by a\u000a      social science study\u000a      identifying constraints to TB control from patients' and providers'\u000a      perspectives (2); and we also\u000a      carried out a study demonstrating the cost-effectiveness of the approaches\u000a      (3).\u000a    We then carried out the first cluster-randomised controlled trial to\u000a      investigate the impact of patient-\u000a      friendly strategies for treatment supervision and patient support. The\u000a      trial randomised districts in\u000a      hill and mountain areas of Nepal, where standard daily health centre DOT\u000a      was clearly not feasible\u000a      because of the unavailability of accessible clinics. This trial\u000a      demonstrated that under normal health\u000a      service conditions, patient supervision at home by a family member or by a\u000a      community health\u000a      volunteer achieved cure rates of 89% and 85% respectively (4),\u000a      higher than the international target\u000a      of 85%; and patient satisfaction was high. A subsequent costing analysis\u000a      demonstrated that the\u000a      costs of the two strategies were similar, and affordable to the Nepal NTP\u000a      (5). The research team\u000a      was led by James Newell and included Sushil Baral (UoL PhD\u000a      graduate, who set up a Nepali\u000a      NGO - the Health Research and Development Forum - to operationalize the\u000a      research and\u000a      development); Tolib Mirzoev (Senior Lecturer, 2004-) and Andrew\u000a        Green (Professor of\u000a      International Health Planning, 1983-2004).\u000a    Our contribution to the field of study was that, at the time, although\u000a      there had been a small number\u000a      of studies comparing DOT to non-DOT (unsupervised self-administered) TB\u000a      care, our studies were\u000a      the only ones comparing different DOT strategies and demonstrating their\u000a      effectiveness.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"9535","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"149590","Name":"Tanzania"},{"GeoNamesId":"1168579","Name":"Pakistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2328926","Name":"Nigeria"},{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    National Impact:\u000d\u000a      The Royal College of Obstetricians &amp; Gynaecologists incorporated the\u000d\u000a      findings into their clinical guidelines (2006) for the management of both\u000d\u000a      severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, and these continued to be the national\u000d\u000a      guidance followed until 2010 [A].

Usually preceded by pre-eclampsia, eclampsia is\u000d\u000a      characterised by grand mal seizures, coma, hypertension, proteinuria and\u000d\u000a      oedema, and can lead to maternal death. In 1992, with 383 affected women\u000d\u000a      nationally, an Oxford-led study demonstrated that the rate of eclampsia\u000d\u000a      was 5 per 10,000 women delivering in the UK. One in 50 of these affected\u000d\u000a      women died from the disorder [1]. During this period eclampsia was a\u000d\u000a      leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality globally, responsible\u000d\u000a      for an estimated 50,000 maternal deaths annually worldwide. Standard\u000d\u000a      treatment at that time in the UK and many other countries was with an\u000d\u000a      anticonvulsant such as diazepam or phenytoin, whereas in North America,\u000d\u000a      magnesium sulphate was principally used. Clinicians elsewhere were\u000d\u000a      sceptical about the efficacy of magnesium sulphate as there was\u000d\u000a      insufficient randomised controlled trial evidence to support its use.\u000d\u000a    In 1995, the Collaborative Eclampsia trial of magnesium sulphate for the\u000d\u000a      treatment of women having an eclamptic fit was led by Dr Lelia\u000d\u000a      Duley and co-ordinated from the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit\u000d\u000a      (NPEU), University of Oxford. In this international multi-centre\u000d\u000a      randomised controlled trial, conducted in nine countries, 1,687 women\u000d\u000a      having an eclamptic fit were randomised to receive magnesium sulphate,\u000d\u000a      diazepam or phenytoin [2]. The trial demonstrated a statistically\u000d\u000a      significant halving in the recurrence of seizures for women treated with\u000d\u000a      magnesium sulphate compared with diazepam and phenytoin. There were also\u000d\u000a      non-significant reductions in maternal mortality, severe maternal\u000d\u000a      morbidity, and fetal and neonatal effects.\u000d\u000a    The Oxford-led `Magpie Trial', published in 2002, was a multi-centre\u000d\u000a      international randomised controlled trial of magnesium sulphate for the prevention\u000d\u000a      of eclampsia. This trial also demonstrated the benefits of magnesium\u000d\u000a      sulphate in halving the risk of eclampsia in women with pre-eclampsia who\u000d\u000a      were treated with magnesium sulphate [3]. In the absence of an existing\u000d\u000a      preventive therapy, 10,141 women with pre-eclampsia across 33 countries\u000d\u000a      were randomised to receive either magnesium sulphate or placebo. A\u000d\u000a      cost-effectiveness study was subsequently conducted, using the Magpie\u000d\u000a      Trial data. This demonstrated that the number of women with pre-eclampsia\u000d\u000a      who needed to be treated to prevent one case of eclampsia was 324 in high\u000d\u000a      resource settings, 184 in medium and 43 in low resource settings [4]. When\u000d\u000a      treatment was used for severe pre-eclampsia the incremental cost (that is\u000d\u000a      the amount of additional spending on magnesium needed) of preventing one\u000d\u000a      case of eclampsia was $12,942 in high resource settings, $1,179 in medium\u000d\u000a      resource settings and $263 in low resource settings.\u000d\u000a    A national study conducted by the NPEU in 2005 demonstrated a halving in\u000d\u000a      the observed incidence of eclampsia in the UK following the introduction\u000d\u000a      of magnesium sulphate treatment for severe pre-eclampsia, with a\u000d\u000a      two-thirds reduction in the incidence of the associated severe maternal\u000d\u000a      morbidity [5]; the effect sizes were at the level predicted by the\u000d\u000a      original Eclampsia Collaborative and Magpie trials.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"9536","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Research into the benefits and risks of antiplatelet therapy has shown\u000a      that long-term antiplatelet therapy reduces the risk of heart attacks,\u000a      strokes and deaths due to vascular disease in a wide range of high-risk\u000a      people.

As a consequence there was considerable uncertainty about which\u000a      types of patients benefited from such treatment. In order to provide\u000a      better guidance for doctors and patients, the University of Oxford's CTSU\u000a      initiated collaborative meta-analyses (studies which combine data from a\u000a      group of original studies) of all trials involving an antiplatelet regimen\u000a      for the prevention of serious vascular events (heart attacks, strokes and\u000a      of deaths from vascular disease). The outcome of this effort was the\u000a      publication by the Antiplatelet Trialists' (APT) Collaboration in 1994 of\u000a      a series of three important papers, dubbed \"The Aspirin Papers\" [1-3] by\u000a      the British Medical Journal. The first of these papers showed conclusively\u000a      that a prolonged course of antiplatelet therapy could reduce the risk of\u000a      serious vascular events by about one quarter among a wide range of\u000a      patients at high risk of vascular disease [1]. The other papers\u000a      supplemented this evidence by showing also that antiplatelet therapy\u000a      reduced the risk of vascular occlusion among patients undergoing a\u000a      vascular procedure [2], and that it reduced the risk of deep venous\u000a      thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients at risk of venous\u000a      thromboembolism [3].\u000a    The recognition of the importance of arterial thrombosis as a cause of\u000a      death and disability led to a substantial increase in the number of trials\u000a      involving antithrombotic agents. In 2002, the Antiplatelet Trialists'\u000a      Collaboration, renamed the Antithrombotic Trialists' (ATT) Collaboration,\u000a      updated the worldwide evidence from these trials [4]. The ATT\u000a      Collaboration's analyses reaffirmed the benefits of a prolonged course of\u000a      antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of serious vascular events, and\u000a      also demonstrated that intensification of antiplatelet therapy (by adding\u000a      a second antiplatelet agent to aspirin) yielded further benefits that\u000a      exceeded any additional risks of bleeding [4]. This strategy was studied,\u000a      for example, in CTSU's own CCS2-COMMIT (2005) trial of clopidogrel plus\u000a      aspirin versus aspirin alone among Chinese patients with suspected acute\u000a      heart attack, which showed that adding clopidogrel to aspirin therapy\u000a      resulted in additional benefits [5].\u000a    Whereas these studies showed clearly that the benefits of aspirin greatly\u000a      exceed the bleeding risks among patients at high risk of a heart attack or\u000a      stroke, considerable controversy remained as to whether the benefits\u000a      exceeded any risks among healthy people. In 2009, the ATT Collaboration\u000a      published a meta-analysis of six primary prevention trials of aspirin\u000a      versus placebo, using detailed data on individual participants, in order\u000a      to quantify the benefits and risks of aspirin at different levels of\u000a      predicted vascular disease risk [6]. This research showed clearly that the\u000a      vascular benefits of aspirin do not clearly exceed any bleeding hazards,\u000a      even among those with risk factors for cardiovascular disease. One reason\u000a      for this is that the risks of bleeding in an individual tend to mirror\u000a      their risks of coronary heart disease, so patients deriving greater\u000a      coronary benefits from aspirin also tend to suffer from greater risks of\u000a      bleeding [6]. Like earlier work from the ATT, this research has been\u000a      influential in guiding clinical practice and has been incorporated into\u000a      clinical guidelines.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"9537","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Taken together, the CTSU's Heart Protection Study, Cholesterol Treatment\u000d\u000a      Trialists' Collaboration, SEARCH and SHARP studies have shown that\u000d\u000a      lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or `bad' cholesterol with a statin\u000d\u000a      regimen, or a statin-based regimen, reduces the risk of heart attacks,\u000d\u000a      strokes and revascularisation procedures in both high-risk and healthy\u000d\u000a      people, and that more intensive statin regimens lead to further reductions\u000d\u000a      in risk.

SHARP\u000d\u000a      has also strongly influenced other guidelines, including the Canadian\u000d\u000a      Cardiovascular Society (CCS) Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of\u000d\u000a      Dyslipidaemia [G], most particularly by helping to identify CKD as an\u000d\u000a      important risk factor for cardiovascular disease.\u000d\u000a    The NHS reports that there has been a 40% reduction in deaths from heart\u000d\u000a      disease in people under 75 since 2000, and estimates that statins\u000d\u000a      currently save around 7,000 lives a year in the UK [H]. CTSU's work on\u000d\u000a      ensuring that statin therapy is used appropriately widely has undoubtedly\u000d\u000a      contributed to this saving of lives during the REF 2014 period. Indeed,\u000d\u000a      NICE guidance throughout the REF period recommended the HPS regimen of\u000d\u000a      simvastatin 40mg as their first line treatment for cardiovascular disease\u000d\u000a      prevention in high-risk patients [B]. Due to the major public health\u000d\u000a      impacts of CTSU's research into the safety and benefits of statin use,\u000d\u000a      this work has also been featured prominently both on the internet and in\u000d\u000a      print versions of mainstream newspapers.

At about the same time that the HPS began, CTSU set up a\u000d\u000a      collaborative meta-analysis called the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists'\u000d\u000a      (CTT) Collaboration, with the aim of providing more reliable information\u000d\u000a      about the effects of lowering LDL cholesterol on vascular and non-vascular\u000d\u000a      outcomes. The first CTT report in 2005 included data from around 90,000\u000d\u000a      patients in 14 randomised trials, and provided comprehensive information\u000d\u000a      that has helped to guide the use of statin therapy internationally [2]. It\u000d\u000a      showed that treatment with a statin reduces the risk of heart attacks,\u000d\u000a      strokes and coronary revascularisation procedures, as well as the overall\u000d\u000a      risk of death, in a wide range of patients at risk of cardiovascular\u000d\u000a      disease. It also refuted previous concerns that statin therapy might\u000d\u000a      increase the risk of cancer, and non-cardiovascular causes of death [2].\u000d\u000a    In 2010, CTSU published the results of its Study of the Effectiveness of\u000d\u000a      Additional Reductions in Cholesterol and Homocysteine [SEARCH] trial [3]\u000d\u000a      comparing 80 mg versus 20 mg simvastatin daily among 12,000 heart attack\u000d\u000a      survivors. It showed that simvastatin 80mg produced further reductions in\u000d\u000a      major vascular events, but that the risk of myopathy was increased. In\u000d\u000a      tandem with this publication, the CTT published a meta-analysis of the\u000d\u000a      five major trials of intensive versus standard statin regimens (including\u000d\u000a      SEARCH), showing that more intensive regimens yield additional benefits,\u000d\u000a      and that this could be achieved safely with regimens other than\u000d\u000a      simvastatin 80mg. [4]\u000d\u000a    Recently, there has been controversy over whether statins are effective\u000d\u000a      for the prevention of first heart attacks and strokes in apparently\u000d\u000a      healthy people. In 2012, however, the CTT published a meta-analysis\u000d\u000a      showing definitively that the benefits of statin therapy clearly outweigh\u000d\u000a      the hazards in people at low risk of cardiovascular disease [5].\u000d\u000a    In addition to its work on the CTT collaboration, CTSU has also provided\u000d\u000a      the first reliable evidence that lowering cholesterol reduces the risk of\u000d\u000a      heart attacks and strokes among kidney patients. Its Study of Heart and\u000d\u000a      Renal Protection (SHARP) was the largest study of its kind, and included\u000d\u000a      over 9000 kidney patients in 380 hospitals from 18 countries. This study\u000d\u000a      showed that lowering cholesterol with the combination of a statin and a\u000d\u000a      drug that blocks cholesterol absorption, ezetimibe can reduce heart\u000d\u000a      attacks and strokes safely by about one quarter in kidney patients [6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"9538","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The key to being able to rapidly mount a study of pregnant women,\u000a      hospitalised with 2009\/H1N1 pandemic influenza, was the prior\u000a      establishment in 2005 of the novel UKOSS system, which allows for rapid\u000a      institution of research into pregnancy complications in the event of a\u000a      public health emergency such as this. For the influenza study, data were\u000a      analysed cumulatively on a monthly basis, enabling Professor Knight to\u000a      feedback results in real-time via weekly teleconferences and monthly\u000a      meetings at the Department of Health. In this way the UKOSS findings were\u000a      central to immediate policy development, for guidance on the management of\u000a      pregnant women infected the with 2009\/H1N1 virus, as the course of the\u000a      pandemic evolved [A, B, C]. The UKOSS results indicated that pregnant\u000a      women treated earlier with antiviral therapy had better maternal and\u000a      perinatal outcomes than those treated later in their clinical course or\u000a      not at all. National advice and the clinical algorithm was changed as a\u000a      result leading to the earlier initiation of antiviral therapy particularly\u000a      for pregnant women and action by the Department of Health to ensure the\u000a      availability of antiviral therapy to pregnant women through the National\u000a      Pandemic Flu Service and Antiviral Collection Points [C].\u000a    The extent of maternal morbidity, and maternal and perinatal deaths\u000a      quantified by the UKOSS study, contributed to the change in immunisation\u000a      policy in the UK during the course of the pandemic to actively offer\u000a      pregnant women immunisation. This policy change has now been adopted as an\u000a      on-going recommendation that annually all pregnant women should be\u000a      immunised against seasonal influenza [D, E]. The number of pregnant women\u000a      immunised against influenza in England has subsequently increased, from\u000a      118,000 in 2009\/10, to 124,000 in 2010\/11 and 196,000 in 2011\/12 [F].\u000a    The impact of the research was achieved by the direct input of real-time\u000a      research results by Professor Marian Knight into the decision making\u000a      systems at the Department of Health for England. Results were also shared\u000a      with the Influenza planning group at the Royal College of Obstetricians\u000a      and Gynaecologists during the course of the evolving pandemic. Later\u000a      impact is demonstrated by the subsequent recommendation, which\u000a      incorporated the study data, issued by the European Centre for Disease\u000a      Control and Prevention (ECDC). The recommendation states that universal\u000a      influenza immunisation for pregnant women should be offered throughout\u000a      Europe [G].\u000a    Once the pandemic had abated it became clear from data collected by UKOSS\u000a      and the National Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths that 13\u000a      pregnant women in the UK had died as a direct result of 2009\/H1N1\u000a      influenza virus infection. These deaths could have been prevented by prior\u000a      immunisation. In addition, the study results suggested that early\u000a      treatment with antiviral medication led to a 90% reduction in the odds of\u000a      admission for critical care. The resulting substantial changes in\u000a      practice, which were instituted as a result of the UKOSS study findings,\u000a      were, and continue to be, instrumental in preventing the deaths and\u000a      serious morbidity for pregnant women and their babies in the UK and\u000a      elsewhere. The study is referenced in guidance for critical care\u000a      clinicians [H]. It is also referenced in current media campaigns to\u000a      highlight the importance of on-going immunisation to women [I], and in\u000a      policy documents recommending immunisation against influenza in pregnancy\u000a      in countries other than the UK [J].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Researchers at the University of Oxford instituted a rapid study of\u000a      pregnant women hospitalised across the UK with 2009\/H1N1 infection, which\u000a      demonstrated that early antiviral treatment improved maternal outcomes of\u000a      infection and led to actions by the Department of Health to ensure rapid\u000a      availability of antivirals specifically for pregnant women.

The existence of UK\u000a      Obstetric Surveillance System (UKOSS) [1] developed and led by Professor\u000a      Marian Knight and colleagues at the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit,\u000a      University of Oxford, enabled the rapid initiation of a study of pregnant\u000a      women hospitalised across the UK with 2009\/H1N1 infection [2]. Data were\u000a      analysed on a monthly basis to inform the development of on-going policy\u000a      and guidance issued by the Department of Health. This allowed for\u000a      real-time changes to policy and guidelines as the data accumulated,\u000a      enabling a rapid response to the emerging pandemic.\u000a    The study findings demonstrated that early antiviral treatment for\u000a      pregnant women led to a 90% reduction in the odds of admission for\u000a      critical care. This resulted in actions by the Department of Health to\u000a      ensure rapid availability of antivirals specifically for pregnant women,\u000a      through the modification of the clinical algorithms in use, enabling\u000a      availability of antivirals for pregnant women through the National\u000a      Pandemic Flu Service. Guidance for obstetricians and other clinicians\u000a      involved in the care of pregnant women was also modified [2].\u000a    The poor maternal and perinatal outcomes identified by the study, showing\u000a      a five times increase in the risk of perinatal death and a more than three\u000a      times increase in the risk of premature birth amongst the infants of\u000a      infected women, also led to a change in immunisation policy in the UK\u000a      during the course of the pandemic. The updated policy classified pregnant\u000a      women as an \"at-risk group\" eligible for influenza vaccination [3,4].\u000a    These data have also led to an on-going policy change, so that all\u000a      pregnant women in the UK are now recommended to receive an annual\u000a      immunisation against seasonal influenza. The European Centre for Disease\u000a      Control and Prevention (ECDC) also issued a subsequent recommendation,\u000a      based on UKOSS data, that universal influenza immunisation for pregnant\u000a      women should be offered throughout Europe [see reference G in impact\u000a      section].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"9539","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Results from the University of Oxford's Million Women Study, have changed\u000d\u000a      attitudes towards HRT\u000d\u000a      dramatically, leading to significant changes in public policy and HRT use\u000d\u000a      around the world.

At the\u000d\u000a      turn of the 21st Century these\u000d\u000a      fears were supported by a number of studies showing the correlation\u000d\u000a      between HRT and cancer, in\u000d\u000a      particularly the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study, which took place\u000d\u000a      in the United States.\u000d\u000a    Initially dismissed in the United Kingdom, due to the WHI study not being\u000d\u000a      based on European\u000d\u000a      women's health, the need for a similar epidemiological study to reflect\u000d\u000a      the risk factors of HRT\u000d\u000a      among women in Europe became a high priority.\u000d\u000a    Setting out to understand the health impacts of HRT from a European\u000d\u000a      perspective, a team\u000d\u000a      coordinated by Professor Dame Valerie Beral of the University of Oxford's,\u000d\u000a      Cancer Epidemiology\u000d\u000a      Unit, began recruiting a large number of UK women to investigate how\u000d\u000a      reproductive history can\u000d\u000a      affect women's health &#8212; focusing particularly on hormone replacement\u000d\u000a      therapy.\u000d\u000a    The Million Women Study, launched in 1997, has since recruited 1.3\u000d\u000a      million UK women over the\u000d\u000a      age of 50, through NHS breast screening centres. It is the largest study\u000d\u000a      of its kind in the world [1],\u000d\u000a      with one in four UK women in the target age group participating.\u000d\u000a    Results of the study have been published in more than 50 papers since\u000d\u000a      1998 [2], primarily\u000d\u000a      examining the effect of HRT on the development of breast, endometrial and\u000d\u000a      ovarian cancer.\u000d\u000a    Breast Cancer: In a landmark paper published in 2003, the Million\u000d\u000a      Women Study showed that\u000d\u000a      women taking HRT were at an increased risk of developing breast cancer,\u000d\u000a      with an estimated\u000d\u000a      20,000 UK women aged 50-64 having potentially developed the disease due to\u000d\u000a      HRT use [3]. The\u000d\u000a      study also showed that the risk of side effects increased the longer a\u000d\u000a      woman used HRT, but\u000d\u000a      dropped to a normal level five years after the use of HRT had ceased.\u000d\u000a      Analyses in the Million\u000d\u000a      Women Study have also demonstrated that the effects of HRT vary\u000d\u000a      considerably by pattern of use\u000d\u000a      and tumour subtype [4].\u000d\u000a    Endometrial Cancer: In 2005 the Million Women Study confirmed that\u000d\u000a      post-menopausal women\u000d\u000a      who have not had a hysterectomy (and are taking oestrogen-only HRT), are\u000d\u000a      at an increased risk of\u000d\u000a      endometrial cancer [5]. The study also showed that the risk of endometrial\u000d\u000a      cancer increases in\u000d\u000a      women who take the HRT drug tibolone, but may be reduced in women taking\u000d\u000a      combined\u000d\u000a      oestrogen-progestogen HRT. Interestingly, they also found that these\u000d\u000a      effects were dependent on a\u000d\u000a      woman's body mass index, with cancer risk being greater in thinner women\u000d\u000a      than in those who were\u000d\u000a      obese [5], as had been observed for breast cancer risk [3].\u000d\u000a    Ovarian Cancer: Results of the Million Women Study published in\u000d\u000a      2007 showed that women taking\u000d\u000a      HRT were at a slightly higher risk of ovarian cancer [6]. The study\u000d\u000a      analysing 948,576 post-menopausal\u000d\u000a      women over five years found that for every 1,000 women taking HRT, 2.6\u000d\u000a      developed\u000d\u000a      ovarian cancer, compared to 2.2 in those not taking HRT [6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"9540","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Impact on International Policy\u000a      Work from UoA2 at Oxford University has provided a spectrum of studies\u000a      ranging from\u000a      epidemiological evidence of the hazards of smoking through to evidence of\u000a      the effectiveness of\u000a      quitting and the best available evidence of the success of interventions\u000a      that encourage quitting.\u000a      These studies have strongly influenced international policy on tobacco\u000a      control. In 2008 the WHO\u000a      adopted a set of 6 strategic recommendations for tobacco control, which\u000a      they refer to as\u000a      MPOWER: Monitor tobacco use and prevention policies, Protect people, Offer\u000a      help to quit, Warn,\u000a      Enforce bans, Raise taxes [A]. Many of the key epidemiological statistics\u000a      on tobacco hazards in the\u000a      report that defined the MPOWER strategy derive from NDPH work. The central\u000a      claim, that during\u000a      the 20th Century the tobacco epidemic killed 100 million\u000a      worldwide and that during the 21st Century\u000a      it will (on current smoking patterns) kill about one billion people, is\u000a      derived from NDPH work. The\u000a      MPOWER package has, since 2008, been the main vehicle by which WHO has\u000a      encouraged\u000a      tobacco control.\u000a    Similarly, the nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation review\u000a      (NRT) provided evidence\u000a      for a 2008 proposal for the inclusion of NRT in the World Health\u000a      Organization (WHO) list of\u000a      essential medicines. The WHO reports the review as \"the largest database\u000a      on the effectiveness of\u000a      NRT\" [B], approving the proposal in May 2009 supported by\u000a      CTARG's \"high-quality evidence of\u000a      effectiveness\" [C]. The WHO website predicts that inclusion of NRT on the\u000a      essential medicines list\u000a      will advance guideline development and improve access to NRT in developing\u000a      countries [C].\u000a    Impact on International Guidelines\u000a      The CTARG's NRT review has been cited in three key UK national guidelines\u000a      in recent years, and\u000a      continues to shape practice today. The evidence review [D] underpinning\u000a      NICE guidance on Brief\u000a      Interventions and Referral or Smoking Cessation recommends the use of NRT\u000a      based on the\u000a      Cochrane review. Guidelines published from the US and Australia also cite\u000a      the review, using it as\u000a      consistent evidence for use of NRT to aid smoking cessation and using it\u000a      to support the specific\u000a      recommendation that heavily dependent smokers use higher doses of oral NRT\u000a      [E, F].\u000a    Many physicians were initially reluctant to advise patients not to smoke,\u000a      as they doubted the\u000a      efficacy of the approach and were concerned it would affect the\u000a      doctor-patient relationship. The\u000a      Cochrane review of physician advice for smoking cessation has been used in\u000a      many guidelines as\u000a      evidence for the efficacy of this approach. The NICE Rapid Review of Brief\u000a      Interventions and\u000a      Referral for Smoking Cessation [D], the US Public Health Service\u000a      guidelines [E] and the Australian\u000a      Royal College of General Practitioner guidelines [F] all cite the review\u000a      as evidence that brief advice\u000a      from a physician is effective and should form part of routine clinical\u000a      care. The Australian guidelines\u000a      cite the Cochrane review as the key evidence against the belief that \"I am\u000a      not effective\", one of 7\u000a      barriers to engagement of health professionals with smoking cessation\u000a      identified by the guideline.\u000a    Impact on Smoking Prevalence and Subsequent Mortality\u000a      Though the direct relationship between research, subsequent guidelines,\u000a      practice, smoking\u000a      prevalence (and thereafter mortality) cannot be quantified, both smoking\u000a      prevalence and male\u000a      mortality have fallen in the UK and in many other European countries\u000a      during the REF reference\u000a      period. In the 1990's, the decline in UK smoking prevalence that began in\u000a      the 1970's had stalled. In\u000a      1996, 28% of the adult population smoked and there had been no decline in\u000a      prevalence from 1992,\u000a      In response, the UK government published its 1998 White Paper `Smoking\u000a      Kills' which set out a\u000a      range of interventions for reducing smoking prevalence in the UK,\u000a      including a substantial\u000a      investment in smoking cessation services. This White Paper was based on UK\u000a      national guidelines\u000a      [I] based on evidence from CTARG's reviews. In the subsequent 14 years,\u000a      the prevalence of adult\u000a      smoking in the UK has fallen to 20%, with over two million fewer adult\u000a      smokers in the UK [G].\u000a      Similarly, before the mid-1990s there was no material decrease in EU-wide\u000a      tobacco-attributed\u000a      mortality, but in recent years male tobacco-attributed mortality in the EU\u000a      has decreased by about\u000a      10% every 5 years [H].\u000a    There is substantial evidence of the impact of the Oxford's UoA2\u000a      researchers on the policies that\u000a      have been implemented during this period, and the above highlights the use\u000a      of selected research\u000a      outputs and Cochrane reviews in recent (and current) guidelines and\u000a      practice shaping documents.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Oxford's research has helped reduce smoking prevalence and\u000a      tobacco-related mortality worldwide.\u000a      Our epidemiological studies have documented the varied ways in which\u000a      smoking causes death in\u000a      many countries, as well as the large benefits of smoking cessation, and\u000a      have strongly influenced\u000a      the WHO\/Bloomberg 2008 MPOWER package, the key document guiding\u000a      governmental tobacco\u000a      policy worldwide.

Following\u000a      major epidemiological studies of smoking in developed countries in the\u000a      1970s and 1980s, the\u000a      Nuffield Department of Population Health (NDPH, Peto, Co-Director CTSU)\u000a      developed its work\u000a      throughout China, showing that smoking was far more important than all\u000a      other known causes of\u000a      cancer combined. This affected UK, US and Chinese tobacco control\u000a      strategies. The families of\u000a      one million dead people across China were interviewed to determine the\u000a      decedent's smoking\u000a      habits and relate them to the disease that caused death, showing that\u000a      smoking was already\u000a      causing 12% of all deaths in Chinese men [1]. In collaboration with\u000a      others, this method of\u000a      interviewing families of large numbers of decedents was extended to Hong\u000a      Kong (showing that the\u000a      epidemic there was at a more advanced stage than in mainland China), to\u000a      South India (showing\u000a      that smoking was a major cause of death from TB), and then to a random\u000a      sample of all adult\u000a      deaths in India [2] (showing that the main diseases by which smoking kills\u000a      in rural and urban India\u000a      are, respectively, TB and heart attacks, and that smoking is causing\u000a      almost one million deaths per\u000a      year in India alone).\u000a    As well as assessing the full hazards of lifelong smoking among men and\u000a      among women in many\u000a      different populations, retrospective studies of lung cancer and the\u000a      50-year results of Richard Doll's\u000a      prospective study of smoking and death among male British doctors have\u000a      established the lifelong\u000a      benefits of cessation at various different ages [3, 4]. Both demonstrated\u000a      that stopping smoking\u000a      before age 40 avoided more than 90% of the excess risk among those who\u000a      continued to smoke.\u000a      This epidemiological research has been complemented by the work of the\u000a      Cochrane Tobacco\u000a      Addiction Review Group (Lancaster, CTARG Director) within the Department\u000a      of Primary Health\u000a      Care Sciences, Oxford University. Since 1995, CTARG has provided reliable,\u000a      regularly updated\u000a      summaries of the evidence for interventions designed to help tobacco users\u000a      to quit, and to prevent\u000a      people from taking up tobacco. The CTARG produces systematic reviews,\u000a      including meta-analyses\u000a      where appropriate, of individual and population-based interventions for\u000a      tobacco control. More than\u000a      60 reviews were completed within the reference period.\u000a    Examples of this work include:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aSystematic review of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT): The\u000a        first version of the Cochrane\u000a        review assessing the evidence for NRT was published in 1996 and has\u000a        grown from 72\u000a        studies at inception to over 150 studies now. This work has investigated\u000a        different forms,\u000a        delivery methods and settings, schedules, and dosages of NRT in a range\u000a        of subgroups,\u000a        and has shown definitively that all commercially available forms of NRT\u000a        increase the\u000a        proportion of people able to quit smoking (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.53 to 1.68)\u000a        [5].\u000a      \u000aSystematic review of physician advice: Despite many doctors'\u000a        initial reluctance, physician\u000a        advice to quit has become part of everyday practice. The Physician\u000a        advice review was first\u000a        published in 1996, been updated eight times, and currently includes 41\u000a        trials. It shows that\u000a        brief clinical advice significantly increases the rate of quitting (RR\u000a        1.66, 95% CI 1.42 to\u000a        1.94). In addition, the effect was found to be stronger with more\u000a        intensive advice [6].\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"13835","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2623032","Name":"Denmark"},{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2264397","Name":"Portugal"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"458258","Name":"Latvia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The State of Men's Health in Europe report was launched at the European\u000d\u000a      Parliament by the European Commissioner, who has referred to the\u000d\u000a      importance of the report in several speeches1.

Further research on the patterns of\u000d\u000a      mortality in men and women aged 15-44 years across 44 countries2\u000d\u000a      led by White built on this work and again highlighted high levels of\u000d\u000a      premature death in men.\u000d\u000a    In 2009 White was successful in tendering to complete the State of Men's\u000d\u000a      Health in Europe Report3 for the European Commission, covering\u000d\u000a      the 34 countries of the European Union, EFTA countries and accession\u000d\u000a      countries and involved 36 academic partners from across Europe, including\u000d\u000a      Hogston and Raine from Leeds Metropolitan University. Findings here\u000d\u000a      indicated that changes are occurring with the structure of the male\u000d\u000a      population that will result in a smaller working age population supporting\u000d\u000a      a burgeoning older population. In addition, the study gave further\u000d\u000a      evidence of high levels of premature deaths in men across the spectrum of\u000d\u000a      conditions that should affect men and women equally, with 630,000 male\u000d\u000a      deaths as compared to 300,000 female deaths across the EU27 within the age\u000d\u000a      range 15-64 years. The study also gave a much clearer picture of the\u000d\u000a      impact of major social change on men's health, with over 40% of male\u000d\u000a      deaths in the working age (15-64 years) being seen in Lithuania, Estonia\u000d\u000a      and Poland as opposed to less than 18% in Sweden. The study noted that\u000d\u000a      much of men's premature death is avoidable and as much a problem of\u000d\u000a      inequity as biological inevitability.\u000d\u000a    A follow on study, led by White, analysed trends in life expectancy at\u000d\u000a      birth in 19 EU member states between 1999 and 2008 using the Pollard\u000d\u000a      Decomposition method. The study, which explored the impact of changes in\u000d\u000a      health over the last ten years revealed that most improvements in life\u000d\u000a      expectancy are happening over the age of 65 years with little effect on\u000d\u000a      rates of premature death4.\u000d\u000a    In addition, analysis of cancer data in the UK highlighted a higher\u000d\u000a      incidence and rate of premature deaths from those cancers that should not\u000d\u000a      be seen as sex specific. Further examination of cancer deaths was\u000d\u000a      undertaken by White in collaboration with CRUK and the NCIN resulting in\u000d\u000a      two influential reports on the burden of cancer in men5,6. This\u000d\u000a      work highlighted that men had a 70% higher risk of dying prematurely from\u000d\u000a      those cancers that are not sex specific and a 60% higher risk of\u000d\u000a      developing these cancers. This work is on-going with further sex-specific\u000d\u000a      analysis of trends over time, routes to diagnosis and stages of cancer at\u000d\u000a      diagnosis currently underway.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"13837","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The NIHR `People in Public Health' study provided a foundation to develop\u000d\u000a      understanding around lay health worker roles and related programme\u000d\u000a      support. This was a high profile study that involved extensive public\u000d\u000a      engagement and the production of outputs for practitioners and policy\u000d\u000a      makers.

The community health\u000d\u000a      champions approach was highlighted as a case study in the White Paper `\u000d\u000a      Healthy lives, healthy People' where it was noted that there was `a sound\u000d\u000a      practical evidence base for the approach' [p. 43].

A\u000d\u000a      focused programme of research on community participation and lay health\u000d\u000a      workers was developed within the CHPR, initially through the work of one\u000d\u000a      member of staff (J. South). Early work involved evaluations of innovative\u000d\u000a      public health programmes, which later led to further partnerships, new\u000d\u000a      research grants and transfer of knowledge to practice. Examples included:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a       Development and evaluation of Bradford health trainers, one of the\u000d\u000a        first health trainer pilots in England (2005-7).\u000d\u000a       Evaluation of a community health apprentices project in Bradford\u000d\u000a        (2007)\u000d\u000a       Evaluation of a social prescribing pilot (2005).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Publications resulting from this work explored various mechanisms to\u000d\u000a      strengthen community-state relationships [1 &amp; 2]. The strong links\u000d\u000a      with practice and the growing base of community research led to the award\u000d\u000a      of a NIHR SDO grant to examine lay roles in public health. The `People in\u000d\u000a      Public Health' study (2007-9) made a major contribution to understandings\u000d\u000a      of lay health worker roles and the support processes required to initiate\u000d\u000a      and sustain health programmes involving the public. The systematic scoping\u000d\u000a      review led to new categorisations of roles, including definitions of lay\u000d\u000a      status [4]. Three national expert hearings were held in June 2008, giving\u000d\u000a      the university a leading role in this field [3]. An accessible report was\u000d\u000a      later produced to highlight key issues for policy and practice and this\u000d\u000a      was disseminated throughout different practice networks. Overall results\u000d\u000a      identified key factors for the development of lay health worker programmes\u000d\u000a      and volunteering activity. Research findings have been published in\u000d\u000a      international journals and presented at various national and international\u000d\u000a      conferences [4-5]. In 2010, in recognition of the significance of the\u000d\u000a      research, the Department of Health (DH) awarded a grant for the\u000d\u000a      `Production and dissemination of accessible research-based information to\u000d\u000a      support better engagement with citizens to co-produce better health and\u000d\u000a      well-being outcomes'.\u000d\u000a    Lay engagement in public health and the wider issue of volunteering in\u000d\u000a      health feature prominently in UK policy.

The research has been viewed as relevant\u000a      and timely and has generated significant interest. The following summary\u000a      provides evidence of impact of the research undertaken.\u000a    The APPLES study was cited in NICE guidance on Obesity (1); WHO report on\u000a      Childhood Obesity (2) and included in numerous systematic reviews\u000a      including Cochrane (3) and the Centre for Reviews and Databases.\u000a    Dissemination and sharing of good practice in child weight management was\u000a      led by Professor Sahota through organisation at LeedsMet of 2 national\u000a      meetings (June 2006 and May 2009) that brought together leading academics\u000a      and practitioners involved in treatment programmes. This resulted in the\u000a      formation of the first ever group dedicated to childhood obesity\u000a      interventions, Childhood Obesity Research Group (CORG). The meetings\u000a      established a case for development of standard evaluation approaches for\u000a      child weight management programmes. Professor Sahota was subsequently\u000a      invited by the National Obesity Observatory to join a working group for\u000a      the development of the Standard Evaluation Framework (4) which is the\u000a      recommended evaluation framework across the UK, thereby facilitating\u000a      evidence from a wide range of programmes to contribute to the broader\u000a      evidence base. Additionally CORG provided a consultation base for e.g.\u000a      establishing the National Child Measurement Programme.\u000a    P. Sahota (PI) undertook a costing study of WATCH IT, a community-based\u000a      childhood obesity treatment programme which has been used by commissioners\u000a      of weight management services (5). The programme is on the list of 10\u000a      approved programmes by the DH and is currently being commissioned in Leeds\u000a      and other PCT's e.g. Birmingham and Coventry with the emerging data making\u000a      a major contribution to the understanding effectiveness of community-based\u000a      interventions (6.)\u000a    In March 2011, the HELP programme, an early intervention aimed at parents\u000a      of young children was submitted to the Centre for Excellence and Outcomes\u000a      in Children and Young People's Services (C4EO) (www.c4eo.org.uk)\u000a      of the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER). The Centre\u000a      evaluates examples of effective local practice that provide demonstrable\u000a      evidence of improving outcomes for children, young people and\u000a      their families and aims to inform decision and policy making, and to share\u000a      and disseminate effective practice with others working across the\u000a      children's sector. HELP was judged as promising practice and is published\u000a      on the C4EO website under this category. This has resulted in the\u000a      programme and the accompanying resource manual being made available\u000a      practitioners (7), and thereby influencing practice by improving the\u000a      quality of advice and support offered to parents of young children.\u000a    The extensive experience in the development of child weight management\u000a      programmes and the access to a network of academics and practitioners in\u000a      obesity management led to the team being commissioned by NHS Health\u000a      Scotland to undertake an evidence-review of effective behavioural\u000a      strategies for childhood obesity programmes, (2010, NHS Health Scotland).\u000a      The aim of this review was to aid the development of effective weight\u000a      management programmes in Scotland. However there has been wider interest\u000a      in these findings and their application to practice and evidence was also\u000a      submitted to the House of Lords. Science and Technology Committee on\u000a      Behaviour Change (8).\u000a    The research on factors influencing uptake of free school meals in Dec\u000a      2010 has resulted in a new policy launched on 15 December 2010 for all\u000a      Leeds secondary schools which improves access to healthy food and makes\u000a      free school dinners more widely available. The research suggested many\u000a      children who are eligible for free school meals fail to take up their\u000a      entitlement and instead snack on unhealthy food during morning break time.\u000a      The new policy allows pupils to pre-order 'grab bags' &#8212; consisting of a\u000a      sandwich, dessert and drink which can be eaten at break-time when they are\u000a      hungry and thereby taking advantage of their entitlement.\u000a    In Jan 2012 research undertaken by the team resulted wide media coverage\u000a      on the role of family mealtimes in encouraging fruit and vegetable\u000a      consumption http:\/\/thefamilydinnerproject.org\/the-fruit-and-veggie-boosting-effects-of-family-dinner-2\/\u000a      (9)\u000a    As an acknowledgement of Professors Sahota's expertise in the field of\u000a      Childhood Obesity she was invited to:- join the International Scientific\u000a      Committee for the European Congress on Obesity (May 12-15 2013); join the\u000a      DH Expert Working Group in Nov 2012 to develop commissioning guidance for\u000a      Child Weight Management Programmes which are now available; in Feb 2013 to\u000a      present an Expert Testimony to the Programme Development Board on child\u000a      weight management programmes (10); the House of Commons to the launch of\u000a      the All Part Parliamentary Group on Obesity 16.4.13.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research in the area of childhood obesity has focussed on the\u000a      development, implementation and evaluation of interventions.

Pragmatic trials have been\u000a      designed and implemented within existing infrastructures with robust\u000a      evaluations to inform both practice and policy. The APPLES study (1, 2)\u000a      was one of the first to highlight the increasing prevalence of childhood\u000a      obesity within the UK in the late 1990's (3). Staff are recognised for\u000a      their expertise in generating evidence to inform better quality\u000a      interventions. Publications and conference presentations resulting from\u000a      this work have attempted to explore effective approaches in the prevention\u000a      and treatment of childhood obesity across a range of age groups and\u000a      settings. The applied nature of the research has focussed on improving the\u000a      quality of interventions and services through links with PCT\u000a      commissioning, other researchers and DH obesity policies resulting in a\u000a      number of grants being awarded. Building on this experience further\u000a      intervention studies have been undertaken which focus on the early\u000a      prevention of childhood obesity contributing to current evidence that the\u000a      early years are a critical period to address obesity risk factors.

The main project was undertaken between 1999 and 2002 at\u000d\u000a      the University of\u000d\u000a      Sheffield's School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR) by John Brazier\u000d\u000a      (1989-), Jennifer\u000d\u000a      Roberts (1997-2003) and Mark Deverill (1995-2002), funded by a grant from\u000d\u000a      GlaxoWelcome (R1).\u000d\u000a    The SF-6D was derived from the SF36 (http:\/\/www.sf-36.org),\u000d\u000a      a widely used patient reported measure\u000d\u000a      that assesses health across 8 dimensions. The SF-36 does not enable\u000d\u000a      trade-offs between them\u000d\u000a      (e.g. pain vs. physical functioning), or between quality and length of\u000d\u000a      life and so could not be used\u000d\u000a      to assess cost-effectiveness. The SF-6D index was developed in order to\u000d\u000a      overcome these\u000d\u000a      limitations.\u000d\u000a    The main project (1999-2001) involved 3 stages:\u000d\u000a    1) Revising the SF-36 using psychometric methods to a 6 dimension\u000d\u000a      classification (physical\u000d\u000a      functioning, role limitation, social functioning, pain, mental health and\u000d\u000a      vitality) amenable to\u000d\u000a      valuation.\u000d\u000a    2) Obtaining population preferences for the 6 dimensions for a sample of\u000d\u000a      states via face-to-\u000d\u000a      face interviews with a representative sample of the UK general population\u000d\u000a      (n=836) using\u000d\u000a      standard gamble, a choice based method for measuring preferences under\u000d\u000a      uncertainty.\u000d\u000a    3) Estimating values for all 18,000 health states defined by the SF-6D\u000d\u000a      using econometric\u000d\u000a      modelling techniques.\u000d\u000a    The resulting algorithm generates an index for health anchored at 0\u000d\u000a      (equivalent to being dead),\u000d\u000a      and 1 (full-health), with negative values denoting states worse than being\u000d\u000a      dead. This algorithm\u000d\u000a      shows how much value people place on different health limitations and how\u000d\u000a      they trade-off between\u000d\u000a      them (e.g. how much vitality they will sacrifice for a reduction in pain).\u000d\u000a    The main research was published in 2002 (R2) and since then the SF-6D has\u000d\u000a      become widely used\u000d\u000a      around the world. The SF-6D has a number of advantages over the previously\u000d\u000a      used main health\u000d\u000a      valuation measure the EQ-5D: it has a richer descriptive system (with\u000d\u000a      18,000 states as opposed to\u000d\u000a      only 243 for the EQ-5D), it is more sensitive to health changes\u000d\u000a      particularly for milder states (R3)\u000d\u000a      and it covers a broader range of health dimensions by including role\u000d\u000a      limitations, social functioning\u000d\u000a      and vitality. The SF-36 is often used in clinical studies and so this\u000d\u000a      algorithm enables QALYs to be\u000d\u000a      estimated without the need for additional data collection.\u000d\u000a    There have been 4 main extensions to increase impact: 1) The development\u000d\u000a      of an algorithm for the\u000d\u000a      SF-12 (a reduced version of the SF-36), thus increasing the reach of the\u000d\u000a      work (R4). 2) The\u000d\u000a      development of an improved algorithm using Bayesian methods (R5), allowing\u000d\u000a      decision makers to\u000d\u000a      take better account of differences across patients. 3) The development of\u000d\u000a      valuation algorithms for\u000d\u000a      SF-6D in other countries including Japan (R6), Brazil, China (Hong Kong),\u000d\u000a      Australia, Portugal and\u000d\u000a      Spain. It has also been used to derive an index from the VR-12 for use in\u000d\u000a      Medicare data sets in the\u000d\u000a      USA. 4) The development of algorithms for condition specific measures of\u000d\u000a      health, extending the\u000d\u000a      reach to health problems and trials where generic measures have not been\u000d\u000a      used or are not\u000d\u000a      appropriate.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14525","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The impact of this research is on national policy and public services\u000d\u000a    Pathway to impact\u000d\u000a      A report was produced in April 2011 [R1] and this was presented to the DoH\u000d\u000a      Hospital Mortality committee chaired by Sir Bruce Keogh (Medical Director\u000d\u000a      of the NHS) in May 2011.The key insights were that a relatively simple\u000d\u000a      combination of age, sex, diagnosis on admission, method of admission\u000d\u000a      (emergency or elective) and comorbidity score produced a useful and stable\u000d\u000a      model which could be used to calculate how many deaths would have been\u000d\u000a      expected in a hospital, given its particular case-mix. Using random\u000d\u000a      effects model and funnel plots to identify unexplained variation, limits\u000d\u000a      were drawn for the ratio of the observed to expected number of deaths, and\u000d\u000a      above or below these limits a hospital was deemed to be an `outlier'.

We also advised that the index should be used in\u000d\u000a      conjunction with other indicators, and that avoidable mortality was only a\u000d\u000a      small proportion of the total deaths in a hospital.\u000d\u000a    The hospital morbidity indicator developed by Sheffield has been rolled\u000d\u000a      out across the NHS.

Since 2001, the\u000d\u000a      Department of Health (DoH) used the Hospital Standardised Mortality Ratio,\u000d\u000a      developed by commercial company Dr Foster. In 2010 the DoH decided it\u000d\u000a      needed its own index and after a competitive tendering round, the\u000d\u000a      University of Sheffield was commissioned to develop this. During the early\u000d\u000a      part of 2011 the ScHARR team had regular meetings with the DoH in London\u000d\u000a      and Sheffield as they worked on the project.\u000d\u000a    The research team was led by Mike Campbell (Professor of Medical\u000d\u000a      Statistics) and all the team were based in ScHARR.\u000d\u000a    The research question was this: When explainable factors such as the age\u000d\u000a      of the patient and method of admission are taken into account, is there\u000d\u000a      unexplainable variation remaining between hospitals in mortality in\u000d\u000a      hospital and 30 days after discharge?\u000d\u000a    The project was a major data processing and statistical exercise [R1]. It\u000d\u000a      led to two papers in mainstream journals [R2,R4] and an international\u000d\u000a      speaking invitation [R3]. It involved linking hospital and national\u000d\u000a      mortality data from 2005 to 2010 from the Office of National Statistics\u000d\u000a      (92 million records). There were considerable logistical problems to be\u000d\u000a      overcome in fitting statistical models to such large data sets. The\u000d\u000a      analysis used data from all deaths both in hospital and within 30 days of\u000d\u000a      discharge. The 30 day post discharge period is to try and discourage\u000d\u000a      hospitals from discharging patients who are likely to die within 30 days\u000d\u000a      so that the deaths no longer count in their mortality figures. The key\u000d\u000a      insight was that certain hospitals had mortality rates well above that\u000d\u000a      which could be accounted for by chance, even when known risk factors were\u000d\u000a      accounted for.\u000d\u000a    The key innovations are:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      The SHMI uses all deaths in hospital and deaths 30 days after\u000d\u000a        discharge rather than only 80% of in-hospital deaths used by the Dr\u000d\u000a        Foster model\u000d\u000a      It is robust to practices such as coding patients as `palliative care'\u000d\u000a      The limits are calculated using a `random effects' model\u000d\u000a      It is updated every three months, but with the weights calculated from\u000d\u000a        12 months of data, which means that seasonality is not a problem.\u000d\u000a      The weights are available on the NHS Information Centre Website and so\u000d\u000a        are open to scrutiny (unlike other competing models).\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Our report's specification was accepted by the DoH and was implemented\u000d\u000a    nationally in October 2011.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14536","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Our research directly informed changes to national and international\u000a      guidelines for the diagnosis of\u000a      DVT. Diagnostic assessment is undertaken in the UK using NICE guidelines\u000a      [S1] and\u000a      internationally using ACCP guidelines [S2].\u000a    Impact in the UK\u000a    NICE published its DVT guideline in 2012 (Clinical Guideline 144) [S1],\u000a      with the aim of reducing the\u000a      current high toll of long-term ill health or death caused by venous\u000a      thromboembolic diseases by\u000a      clarifying &#8212; for the first time &#8212; what combination of tests and treatments\u000a      results in the most cost-effective\u000a      diagnosis and management of these conditions. Specifically, the guidelines\u000a      provide an\u000a      algorithm to guide DVT diagnosis in the NHS and evidence-based guidance on\u000a      the use of clinical\u000a      probability scoring, D-dimer and ultrasound in the diagnosis of DVT.\u000a    The estimates of sensitivity and specificity, and the evidence statements\u000a      provided in the guidelines\u000a      are based upon our meta-analyses of these approaches\/methodologies. The\u000a      NICE DVT guidelines\u000a      recommend the algorithm identified in our analysis as being most likely to\u000a      be cost-effective and\u000a      feasible in the NHS.\u000a    Implementation of the NICE guidance will improve outcomes for patients\u000a      with suspected DVT by\u000a      reducing misdiagnosis and will result in more cost-effective care. NICE\u000a      claimed that the clinical\u000a      guideline would save lives by improving the diagnosis and management of\u000a      blood clots [S3]. This\u000a      will be achieved through NICE Quality Standard 29, Quality Statement 2\u000a      (Diagnosis of DVT), which\u000a      promotes implementation of NICE Clinical Guideline 144 [S4].\u000a    NICE Clinical Knowledge Summaries provide primary care practitioners with\u000a      a readily accessible\u000a      summary of the current evidence base and practical guidance on best\u000a      practice in respect of over\u000a      300 common and\/or significant primary care presentations. The NICE\u000a      Clinical Knowledge\u000a      Summary for predicting who is at risk for DVT [S5] cites data from our\u000a      meta-analysis [R1] and\u000a      economic analysis [R6] to guide practitioners.\u000a    Around 140,000 people are investigated for suspected DVT each year in the\u000a      UK. It is difficult to\u000a      estimate the impact of new guidance on health outcomes and costs since\u000a      practice varied\u000a      substantially prior to implementation of the guidance [S6]. However, on\u000a      the basis of our economic\u000a      model we estimate that adopting the NICE recommended algorithm instead of\u000a      using ultrasound for\u000a      all cases would result in a net benefit of &#163;42,919 per 1000 patients with\u000a      suspected DVT (i.e. per\u000a      year at a large hospital), assuming health outcomes are monetised with an\u000a      estimated value of\u000a      &#163;20,000 per QALY.\u000a    International impact\u000a    ACCP guidance is produced in the United States and Canada, and is used in\u000a      many other\u000a      countries. Updated ACCP guidelines for diagnosing DVT were published in\u000a      2012 [S2].\u000a      Recommendations in the guidance for the use of Wells score, D-dimer and\u000a      ultrasound all cited our\u000a      meta-analyses. Furthermore, as a direct result of our research the ACCP\u000a      Guideline Development\u000a      Group asked us to provide updated systematic reviews of CT and MR scanning\u000a      specifically for this\u000a      guideline. We were also asked to use our decision-analytic model to\u000a      estimate the probability of\u000a      adverse outcomes for commonly used diagnostic strategies. These estimates\u000a      were published in\u000a      the ACCP guidance.\u000a    The ACCP and NICE take different approaches to providing guidance, but\u000a      both based their\u000a      recommendations on our analyses. Whereas NICE recommends a specific\u000a      algorithm, the ACCP\u000a      guidance provides physicians with estimates of the likely consequences of\u000a      different diagnostic\u000a      approaches and leaves the choice of strategy to the physician. Our\u000a      approach to analysis allowed\u000a      us to adapt our outputs to the needs of both organisations. For NICE we\u000a      identified the strategy\u000a      most likely to be feasible and cost-effective in the NHS. For the ACCP we\u000a      estimated the likely\u000a      consequences of alternative diagnostic strategies.

Patients with DVT are at substantial risk of death if they are\u000a      not correctly diagnosed\u000a      and treated. The diagnostic assessment of DVT has changed dramatically\u000a      over the last 10-20\u000a      years, from being inpatient-based using contrast venography to becoming\u000a      outpatient-based using a\u000a      variety of non-invasive tests. The development of clinical prediction\u000a      scores, D-dimer blood testing,\u000a      ultrasonography, computed tomographic (CT) imaging and magnetic resonance\u000a      (MR) imaging,\u000a      alongside older tests such as plethysmography, had until 2005 led to\u000a      confusion over the best test\u000a      to use and different testing strategies being used in different hospitals.\u000a    Between 2005 and 2007, researchers from the School of Health and Related\u000a      Research (ScHARR)\u000a      at the University of Sheffield, led by Professor Steve Goodacre, undertook\u000a      an evidence synthesis\u000a      project funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health\u000a      Technology Assessment\u000a      programme. The project aimed to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of tests\u000a      for DVT and identify\u000a      the most cost-effective diagnostic strategy. It consisted of systematic\u000a      reviews, meta-analysis,\u000a      decision-analysis modelling of cost-effectiveness, and a national survey.\u000a    Goodacre and Fiona Sampson (ScHARR, University of Sheffield, since 1996)\u000a      undertook the\u000a      systematic reviews of the diagnostic accuracy of tests, and with\u000a      statistical support from Professor\u000a      Alex Sutton of the University of Leicester, conducted meta-analysis to\u000a      provide clinically useful\u000a      estimates of sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios. The\u000a      systematic reviews showed that\u000a      individual clinical features were of limited diagnostic value, while the\u000a      Wells clinical probability score\u000a      (a structured patient assessment that estimates the probability of DVT)\u000a      stratified proximal, but not\u000a      distal DVT [R1]. D-dimer had good sensitivity, but limited specificity for\u000a      DVT [R2]. Plethysmography\u000a      techniques had modest sensitivity and specificity. Ultrasound had good\u000a      sensitivity for proximal\u000a      DVT, modest sensitivity for distal DVT, and good specificity [R3]. CT and\u000a      MR imaging both had\u000a      similar diagnostic accuracy to ultrasound, but these estimates were based\u000a      upon limited data\u000a      [R4,R5].\u000a    Professor Matt Stevenson (ScHARR, University of Sheffield, since 1996)\u000a      developed the decision-\u000a      analysis model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies\u000a      for DVT. Goodacre and\u000a      Sampson undertook the national survey and a literature review in 2005 to\u000a      identify potential\u000a      diagnostic strategies. They then applied estimates of sensitivity and\u000a      specificity from the meta-\u000a      analysis to the strategies to estimate the outcomes in terms of overall\u000a      diagnostic accuracy.\u000a    Stevenson then used modelling to estimate the costs incurred and\u000a      quality-adjusted life years\u000a      (QALYs) gained by each strategy, along with the net benefit of each\u000a      strategy assuming willingness\u000a      to pay in accordance with NICE guidance. The analysis showed that the most\u000a      cost-effective and\u000a      feasible strategy involved a combination of Wells clinical probability\u000a      score, D-dimer and\u000a      compression ultrasound [R6].\u000a    In 2008-9, at the request of the ACCP Guideline Development Group,\u000a      Goodacre updated the\u000a      systematic reviews of CT and MR scanning and Stevenson used the\u000a      decision-analysis model to\u000a      estimate the risk of adverse outcome for various commonly used diagnostic\u000a      strategies for DVT.\u000a      The findings were published in 2012 in the ACCP Evidence-Based Clinical\u000a      Practice Guidelines for\u000a      the diagnosis of DVT.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14543","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Our research led to a substantial change in the treatment of acute\u000a      ST-elevation MI in the NHS. Primary angioplasty has replaced thrombolysis\u000a      as the standard treatment. This has resulted in improved outcomes for\u000a      people with ST-elevation MI.\u000a    Impact on policy\u000a    In 2008 the National Service Framework for Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)\u000a      was updated to set out the new national strategy using primary angioplasty\u000a      instead of thrombolysis [S1]. We reported our research directly to the\u000a      Department of Health CHD Policy Team and as a result the update cited our\u000a      independent research (pages 10-11) that concluded that national roll-out\u000a      of primary angioplasty was feasible and likely to be cost-effective. NHS\u000a      Improvement was then tasked with facilitating the national roll-out of\u000a      primary angioplasty for patients with ST-elevation MI [S2].\u000a    Impact on practice\u000a    \u000a      Treatments provided: National audit data show that following our\u000a        research, primary angioplasty replaced thrombolysis as the standard NHS\u000a        treatment for people with ST-elevation MI. The Myocardial Infarction\u000a        National Audit Project (MINAP) is a national audit of management of MI\u000a        in England, Wales and Northern Ireland [S3]. According to the Tenth\u000a        MINAP Public Report published in 2011 [S4], 82% of patients in England\u000a        who received any reperfusion treatment between April 2010 and March 2011\u000a        received primary angioplasty compared to 63% in 2009\/10. Increases were\u000a        also seen in Wales (22% to 30%) and Belfast (59% to 99%). An interim\u000a        report on the national roll-out of primary angioplasty published by NHS\u000a        Improvement in 2010 [S5] and based on MINAP data showed that between\u000a        2008 and 2010 the proportion of patients in England receiving any\u000a        reperfusion treatment who were treated with primary angioplasty\u000a        increased from 42% to 73%.\u000a      Patient management pathways: In accordance with findings from our\u000a        economic analysis the model for providing primary angioplasty proposed\u000a        by the National Service Framework and promoted by NHS Improvement\u000a        involved direct transfer of patients to the catheter laboratory of\u000a        specialist hospitals. This represents a substantial change from previous\u000a        practice of taking all patients with MI to the nearest hospital\u000a        emergency department. According to the MINAP report [S4] 75% of patients\u000a        that were treated with primary angioplasty in 2010-11 were admitted\u000a        directly to a specialist hospital with a catheter laboratory in England,\u000a        79% in Wales and 60% in Belfast.\u000a      Achieving time targets: In 2010-11 90% of eligible patients in\u000a        England, 68% in Wales and 87% in Belfast were treated with primary\u000a        angioplasty within the target of 90 minutes of arrival at the heart\u000a        attack centre [S4]. Furthermore, 81% of eligible patients in England,\u000a        75% in Wales and 90% in Belfast were treated with primary angioplasty\u000a        within 150 minutes of calling for professional help. The findings of the\u000a        organisational evaluation assisted the process of implementation and\u000a        helped to ensure that time targets for providing primary angioplasty\u000a        were achieved.\u000a    \u000a    Impact on patient outcomes\u000a    After our findings were reported and implemented through the National\u000a      Infarct Angioplasty Pilot in 2007, mortality from ST-elevation MI in the\u000a      NHS fell from 10.6% in 2006-2007 to 8.7% in 2010-11 [S4]. Randomised\u000a      trials have shown that primary angioplasty reduces mortality compared to\u000a      thrombolysis, so although other factors may have contributed to this\u000a      improvement, it is reasonable to attribute some of the improvement to\u000a      increased use of primary angioplasty.\u000a    Economic impact\u000a    An impact assessment based on our cost-effectiveness analysis was\u000a      undertaken by the Department of Health in 2008 [S7] and estimated that\u000a      over three years the policy would cost &#163;44.4 million and would yield\u000a      &#163;337.9 million in benefits, measured as discounted quality-adjusted life\u000a      years (QALYs) to patients and monetised on the basis of an estimate of\u000a      social value of a QALY at &#163;40,000.\u000a    Impact on older patients\u000a    Primary angioplasty has not been restricted on the basis of age and\u000a      reductions in mortality have been seen in older people with ST-elevation\u000a      MI. In-hospital mortality reduced from 30.1% in 2003 to 19.4% in 2010 in\u000a      those aged 85 or more (relative risk = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.38-0.75, P&lt;\u000a      0.001) [S6].\u000a    Impact on the wider clinical community\u000a    Although implementation of primary angioplasty is driven by national\u000a      policy, we believe that it is important to engage the clinical community.\u000a      Thus, in addition to publications in clinical journals outlined above, we\u000a      have produced an overview of our findings for ambulance paramedics [S8]\u000a      and have engaged directly with clinicians through presenting our findings\u000a      at clinical conferences, such as the College of Emergency Medicine Annual\u000a      Scientific Meeting [S9,S10].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Between 2006 and 2008 an evaluation carried out by the University of\u000a      Sheffield of the National Infarct Angioplasty Pilot showed that primary\u000a      angioplasty for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (heart attack) is\u000a      feasible, cost-effective and acceptable to patients and carers.

Randomised controlled trials undertaken in a number of\u000a      international centres showed that primary angioplasty could produce better\u000a      outcomes than intravenous thrombolysis, provided reperfusion with\u000a      angioplasty was achieved within 90 minutes of when it could have been\u000a      achieved by thrombolysis. However, research was necessary to determine\u000a      whether primary angioplasty could be delivered in an acceptable, effective\u000a      and cost- effective manner.\u000a    The National Infarct Angioplasty Pilot was funded by the Department of\u000a      Health to test the feasibility of implementing primary angioplasty for\u000a      acute ST-elevation MI at ten pilot hospitals in the UK. The National\u000a      Institute for Health Research funded Professor Steve Goodacre (ScHARR\u000a      since 1999) and colleagues from ScHARR between 2006 and 2008 to undertake\u000a      [R1]:\u000a    \u000a      Descriptive analysis of the data from these pilot sites\u000a      Cost-effectiveness modelling using data from the ten pilot sites and\u000a        four control sites\u000a      Exploration of patient and carer perspectives.\u000a    \u000a    ScHARR researchers also collaborated with researchers from the Institute\u000a      of Work Psychology at the University of Sheffield to assess organisational\u000a      and workforce issues. Fiona Sampson (ScHARR, since 1996) undertook the\u000a      descriptive analysis and showed that primary angioplasty was provided in a\u000a      timely manner when patients were transported directly to the catheter\u000a      laboratory of a specialist hospital, but not when transported via other\u000a      hospitals or departments [R2].\u000a    Professor Allan Wailoo (ScHARR, since 2000) undertook the economic\u000a      analysis and showed that primary angioplasty-based care was more expensive\u000a      than thrombolysis-based care, but at &#163;4,520 per quality-adjusted life year\u000a      gained would be considered cost-effective by the NHS [R3]. Cost-\u000a      effectiveness of angioplasty was only assured if direct transport to a\u000a      specialist hospital catheter laboratory was used.\u000a    Fiona Sampson and Professor Alicia O'Cathain (ScHARR, since 1997)\u000a      undertook analysis of patient and carer satisfaction, and showed high\u000a      overall levels of satisfaction with primary angioplasty and\u000a      thromoblysis-based care [R4]. Patients at pilot sites reported higher\u000a      levels of satisfaction than control sites with the time waited (80% v 67%\u000a      rated excellent, p&lt;0.001) and the efficiency of treatment (83% v 74%,\u000a      p=0.009), whereas satisfaction with information given on how to manage the\u000a      condition in the future was lower in pilot sites than control sites (38% v\u000a      46%, p=0.049). Interviews undertaken by Sampson identified important\u000a      issues for patients and carers, and provided insights into their\u000a      perceptions of primary angioplasty [R5].\u000a    The organisational study undertaken in collaboration with Dr Angela\u000a      Carter from the Institute of Work Psychology [R6] showed that establishing\u000a      the full 24-hour primary angioplasty service from the start appeared to\u000a      work better than incremental expansion, identified requirements for staff\u000a      working patterns, training, pay and conditions, identified potential\u000a      knock-on effects and highlighted the importance of on-going audit.\u000a    Our studies showed that primary angioplasty could be implemented\u000a      successfully with acceptable time delays, was likely to be cost-effective\u000a      in most circumstances, was acceptable to patients and carers, and\u000a      identified key workforce and organisational issues that need to be\u000a      addressed during implementation.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14565","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research study was used to inform a policy decision to implement a\u000a      national bowel cancer screening programme which in turn has led to\u000a      improvements in the prognosis of patients with diagnosed bowel cancer\u000a      (S6,S7). Whilst there is not yet direct evidence of patient benefit from\u000a      the programme itself, other evidence suggests that earlier diagnosis is\u000a      associated with improved survival (S7) and improved health-related quality\u000a      of life (S8). Analyses from RCTs and the English bowel cancer screening\u000a      programme indicate that screening results in earlier diagnosis, thus\u000a      patient benefit is fully expected.\u000a    This research study provided the key evidence which was reviewed by the\u000a      English Bowel Cancer Advisory Group in 2004 in formulating recommendations\u000a      to the Secretary of State for Health for colorectal cancer screening in\u000a      England (this can be corroborated by Professor Sir Mike Richards &#8212; See\u000a      coversheet).The commissioning of this options appraisal was cited in\u000a      Parliament in 2004 (S1) and its relationship to the policy decision is\u000a      cited in advice to the NHS on bowel cancer screening (S2).\u000a    The work was presented by Dr Tappenden to the English Bowel Cancer\u000a      Advisory Group in 2004. In 2005, the Secretary of State for Health\u000a      announced that a national screening programme involving FOBT for\u000a      individuals aged 60-69 would be launched in England. The NHS Bowel Cancer\u000a      Screening Programme launched an FOBT-based programme in 2006 and this is\u000a      now fully rolled out across England.\u000a    This policy decision resulted in a substantial service change for the NHS\u000a      requiring the establishment of whole new system infrastructures (screening\u000a      hubs, laboratory testing etc.) and their integration with existing\u000a      services for endoscopy. The screening programme is available to all men\u000a      and women in England from the date of their 60th or 61st,\u000a      birthday. An extension has recently been rolled out to include individuals\u000a      up to the age of 74 years of age. The government is also planning to\u000a      include an additional screening FSIG for individuals aged 55 years of age\u000a      (S3). This policy option was re-evaluated retrospectively in a Department\u000a      of Health funded project using the original ScHARR options appraisal\u000a      model.\u000a    The introduction of a national screening programme has also changed the\u000a      agenda for health intervention in this area, with a new focus on\u000a      increasing participation in screening and promoting the earlier diagnosis\u000a      of the disease.\u000a    At this time, it is difficult to assess the direct health impact of\u000a      introducing bowel cancer screening in England as cancer incidence and\u000a      mortality fluctuate year on year and other changes to the health system\u000a      may account for some additional benefits. There is also a time lag in the\u000a      availability of national mortality data from the Office for National\u000a      Statistics.\u000a    There is, however, an evident trend towards increased incidence (~13% in\u000a      the UK between 2006 and 2008) since the rollout of the programme; this\u000a      reflects additional cases of preclinical cancer that would otherwise have\u000a      been likely to have been diagnosed later, potentially at a more advanced\u000a      stage. Research evidence from randomised controlled trials has shown that\u000a      FOBT can reduce colorectal cancer mortality (approximately 16%) and that\u000a      FSIG can reduce both incidence and mortality (23% and 31% respectively).\u000a      Statistics from Cancer Research UK indicate that the mortality rate for\u000a      bowel cancer in the period 2008-2010 was 14% lower than the rate in the\u000a      period 1991-1999. It is likely that a proportion of this benefit is\u000a      attributable to the introduction of the screening programme (http:\/\/www.cancerresearchuk.org\/cancer-info\/cancerstats\/types\/bowel\/incidence\/uk-bowel-cancer-incidence-statistics).\u000a      The available evidence (see Section 5) indicates that the screening\u000a      programme has had a positive impact upon the prognosis of patients with\u000a      screen-detected colorectal cancer and a mortality reduction of\u000a      approximately 16% is estimated on the basis of this evidence; this\u000a      suggests around 2,500 colorectal cancer deaths are expected to be avoided\u000a      each year (S5).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research undertaken at the University of Sheffield in 2005 to evaluate\u000a      the cost-effectiveness and resource implications of potential screening\u000a      programmes for colorectal cancer informed the decision to launch a\u000a      national colorectal cancer screening programme in England. Upon their\u000a      60th\/61st birthday, all individuals in England are now invited to\u000a      participate in biennial bowel cancer screening using faecal occult blood\u000a      testing (FOBT) until the age of 74. The programme identifies individuals\u000a      with less advanced colorectal cancer and there is emerging evidence that\u000a      it has led to an overall improvement in prognosis.

Evidence\u000a      suggests that colorectal cancer screening may reduce incidence, morbidity\u000a      and mortality associated with the disease.\u000a    Between 2004 and 2005, the School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR)\u000a      at the University of Sheffield undertook a Colorectal Cancer Screening\u000a      Options Appraisal on behalf of NHS Cancer Screening Programmes and the\u000a      Department of Health. The work was undertaken by a team led by Dr Paul\u000a      Tappenden (Reader in Health Economic Modelling); other team members\u000a      included Hannah Sakai (Research Assistant, left 2004), Simon Eggington\u000a      (Research Associate, left 2006) and Jim Chilcott (Professor of Health\u000a      Economics and Decision Modelling).\u000a    The objective of the project was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and\u000a      resource implications of potential screening programmes for colorectal\u000a      cancer to inform decisions about whether the NHS should adopt a bowel\u000a      cancer screening programme and, if so, which test modalities, population\u000a      and frequency should form the basis of the programme.\u000a    The research study included a review of existing randomised trials of\u000a      alternative screening modalities, a model-based health economic evaluation\u000a      and an analysis of resource implications for alternative options.\u000a    The team developed a health economic model to simulate the life\u000a      experience of a hypothetical cohort of individuals without polyps or\u000a      cancer through to the development of adenomas and malignant carcinoma and\u000a      subsequent death in the general population of England. The costs, health\u000a      effects and resource impact of five screening options were evaluated using\u000a      this model: (a) biennial FOBT for individuals aged 50-69; (b) biennial\u000a      FOBT for individuals aged 60-69; (c) once-only FSIG for individuals aged\u000a      55; (d) once-only FSIG for individuals aged 60; and (e) once-only FSIG for\u000a      individuals aged 60, followed by biennial FOBT for individuals aged 61-70.\u000a    Each option was compared in terms of expected health benefits\u000a      (survival\/quality-adjusted life years [QALYs] gained), costs and resource\u000a      implications. The economic analysis suggested that screening using FSIG\u000a      with or without FOBT was likely to produce cost-savings and additional\u000a      health benefits compared against no screening. However, the accompanying\u000a      resource use analysis suggested that the considerable endoscopy capacity\u000a      requirements associated with the FSIG screening options may make them\u000a      infeasible given capacity constraints.\u000a    The original work was presented by Dr Tappenden to the English Bowel\u000a      Cancer Working Party and was later discussed in Parliament. The study was\u000a      published as a peer-reviewed report which is hosted on the NHS Cancer\u000a      Screening Programmes website. A series of subsequent peer-reviewed\u000a      publications followed directly from this modelling work and from\u000a      subsequent research projects initiated by the original options appraisal.\u000a    Following the options appraisal, several further related research\u000a      projects have been undertaken by ScHARR using the bowel cancer screening\u000a      model including:\u000a    \u000a      Department of Health &#8212; an assessment of early awareness campaigns for\u000a        colorectal cancer\u000a      Department of Health &#8212; re-appraisal of colorectal screening options\u000a        following publication of the FSIG trial\u000a      HIQA &#8212; an appraisal of colorectal cancer screening options in Ireland.\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"14566","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research has had an impact on health and welfare, by informing NICE\u000a      guidance on treatment to prevent fractures due to osteoporosis in\u000a      post-menopausal women and thereby influencing treatment for this patient\u000a      group.\u000a    Process to impact:\u000a    The model, developed by the University of Sheffield researchers, was used\u000a      to draw up the NICE guidance TA87, released in 2005. Prior to this,\u000a      prescribing patterns and the use of bone mineral density tests were not\u000a      standardised across the country and had not been subjected to\u000a      cost-effectiveness analyses. In 2008, NICE released new guidance, TA160\u000a      and TA161 [S1 and S2], which used the same cost-effectiveness model\u000a      developed in Sheffield, updated by the Sheffield team to include the new\u000a      treatment, strontium ranelate.\u000a    In 2009, the guidance was taken to judicial review following complaints\u000a      by a number of stakeholders, and NICE was asked to review the model on\u000a      which their decisions had been based.

The Committee confirmed that the model\u000a      provided a suitable framework to allow it to make recommendations on the\u000a      cost-effective use of treatment for women at risk of fracture... Therefore\u000a      the Committee concluded that the recommendations based on the Assessment\u000a      Group's model were appropriate, and that the recommendations should remain\u000a      unchanged.'

Where women are unable to take\u000a      alendronate, the guidance specifies whether alternative treatments can be\u000a      prescribed based on age, clinical risk factor and bone mineral density\u000a      characteristics (T-Score).

(R1)\u000a    Professor Stevenson developed a new model, which was the first to combine\u000a      screening and treatment within one algorithm and provided a much more\u000a      granular categorisation of the population than had been attempted before,\u000a      incorporating: eight separate age bands (range 50-85 years); 13\u000a      classifications of a measure of bone fragility, (T-Score- ranging from 0\u000a      to &#8212;5 standard SD) and four classifications of number of risk factors\u000a      (range 0-3).\u000a    The aim was to develop a model which would not only identify which risk\u000a      factors made which treatments cost-effective, but to determine the\u000a      cost-effectiveness of screening for those risk factors. In order to create\u000a      a model which was able to deal with the complexity of so many different\u000a      factors, Professor Stevenson applied a Gaussian process technique which\u000a      had not been used previously in health economics. (R2, R3)\u000a    Prior to this research, there were few treatment algorithms and few\u000a      screening algorithms for people suspected of being osteoporotic. Where\u000a      algorithms did exist, they were simplistic, broad in nature and none had\u000a      been formulated explicitly within the context of a cost-effectiveness\u000a      framework.\u000a    For each combination of age, bone fragility measurements (T-Score) and\u000a      number of risk factors, Professor Stevenson's mathematical model was able\u000a      to assess the likelihood of hip, vertebral, wrist, and proximal humerus\u000a      fractures, nursing home admission and death. These data were combined with\u000a      cost and utility values derived from literature reviews to determine the\u000a      costs and benefits of treatment. From this, the model could estimate the\u000a      cost per quality adjusted life year in each of the age, T-Score and risk\u000a      factor combinations.\u000a    For each age and number of risk factor combination, the additional\u000a      expected costs of screening using a bone mineral density scan were\u000a      included to estimate if a combined policy of screening and treatment was\u000a      cost-effective. This step is required as it may be cost-effective to treat\u000a      a woman in isolation, but the costs of identifying the individual within a\u000a      group of seemingly homogeneous women may be prohibitive.\u000a    Between 2006 and 2007, Professor Stevenson updated his model to take into\u000a      account a new treatment, strontium ranelate whilst also updating, as\u000a      appropriate, the data within the model.

Technology Appraisal 96. (January 1996) [S1].\u000a      The guidance resulted in an increase in the number of people benefitting\u000a      from statin prescribing. Previously statins had been prescribed to people\u000a      with a history of a CVD event (secondary prevention), but the guidance led\u000a      to statin prescribing to include \"healthy\" populations at high risk of\u000a      future events (primary prevention) [S2], subsequently to diabetics [S3]\u000a      and to individuals at high genetic risk of coronary disease [S4].\u000a    The guidance resulted in an additional 3.3 million people in England and\u000a      Wales becoming eligible for statin treatment.[S2] In 2006 Professor David\u000a      Barnett, Chair of the independent NICE Appraisal Committee that developed\u000a      the TA94 guidance, predicted that \"In terms of potential impact this\u000a      guidance is arguably one of the most significant to have come out of NICE\u000a      since it started over six years ago.\"\u000a    The volume of statin prescriptions in England has increased year on year\u000a      since the guidance was issued in 2006, up by 44% between 2005 and 2008\u000a      (from 33,772,000 to 48,717,000) and up by 70% (to 57,454,000) between 2005\u000a      and 2011 (the latest year for which prescription data are available).[S5]\u000a      The Health Survey for England (HSE) 2006 reported that use of statins and\u000a      other lipid-lowering drugs was 73% in men and 65% in women with\u000a      self-reported doctor diagnosed ischaemic heart disease (IHD) or stroke.\u000a      [S5] This had increased to 79% of men and 72% of women over 35 with\u000a      self-reported doctor-diagnosed IHD or stroke, based on the HSE 2011. [S6]\u000a    Cardiovascular related mortality rates per 100,000 have reduced from\u000a      approximately 310 for males (approximately 180 for females) in 2004 to\u000a      approximately 250 for males (approximately 120 for females) in 2009.[S8]\u000a      Treatment with lipid lowering drugs, particularly statins, enables\u000a      effective reduction in LDL, and, therefore, total cholesterol levels, with\u000a      resulting reductions in CVD incidence and deaths, and overall\u000a      mortality.[S6] A gradual decrease in mean total cholesterol levels in both\u000a      sexes between 2006 and 2011 [S6] has occurred. Mean total cholesterol\u000a      levels have reduced by 4% (from 5.2 and 5.0 mmol\/l) in men and by 6% (from\u000a      5.4 and 5.1 mmol\/l) in women between 2008 and 2011.[S6] Every 1% fall in\u000a      mean population total cholesterol levels decreases CVD mortality by\u000a      approximately 2.5%. [S7]\u000a    Economic impact\u000a    Our research was the first research study to compare directly the five\u000a      statins available to the NHS in 2004 within the same systematic review and\u000a      economic model. The systematic review concluded that evidence from the\u000a      placebo-controlled trials did not indicate any difference between the\u000a      clinical efficacy of atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin and\u000a      simvastatin. The NICE guidance on statins, informed by this research, was,\u000a      therefore, able to recommend that \"when the decision has been made to\u000a        prescribe a statin, the therapy should usually be initiated with a drug\u000a        with a low acquisition cost (taking into account required daily dose and\u000a        product price per dose).\" [S1] A shift to prescribing the low cost\u000a      statin, simvastatin, has been seen in prescribing patterns since the\u000a      introduction of the guidance in 2006. [S9] Nationally, lower cost statins\u000a      have increased as a percentage of total statin prescriptions. The impact\u000a      of this has been to reduce the cost of statin prescribing per patient in\u000a      the NHS. The NAO reported savings of &#163;323 million achieved by cost\u000a      effective prescribing of statins in 2009 (relative to a 2005 baseline).\u000a      [S9]\u000a    CVD cost the health care system in the UK around &#163;8.6 billion in 2009.\u000a      [S10] The cost of hospital care for people who have CVD accounts for 50%\u000a      of these costs. [S10] Treating people with statins leads to large savings\u000a      in hospitalisation costs for all vascular events amongst a wide range of\u000a      high risk individuals. [S11]. For example, statins prescribing has\u000a      contributed to a fall in the incidence of hospitalised acute myocardial\u000a      infarction between 2008 and 2010 from 98 to 86 per 100,000 for men and\u000a      from 138 to 133 per 100,000 for women.

In addition, they developed an economic model to explore the\u000a      cost-effectiveness of the five statins which were licensed for use in\u000a      England and Wales in April 2004. The research was undertaken in 2004 and\u000a      2005 and was funded by the Heath Technology Assessment (HTA) Programme,\u000a      part of the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), on behalf of\u000a      the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in order to\u000a      compare directly the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different\u000a      statins for the first time and to assess the impact of statins in patients\u000a      who had not previously experienced a CVD event. The HTA programme\u000a      commissions research where there are uncertainties surrounding the\u000a      clinical and cost-effectiveness of interventions used in the NHS.\u000a    Statins help lower rates of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol\u000a        in the blood, by reducing the production of LDL cholesterol inside\u000a      the liver. High levels of LDL cholesterol can lead to hardening and\u000a      narrowing of the arteries (atherosclerosis) which increase the risk of CVD\u000a      events such as heart attack and stroke. The systematic review on clinical\u000a      effectiveness, conducted at ScHARR by Myfanwy Lloyd Jones (at ScHARR\u000a      between 1996 and 2012) and Abdullar Pandor (at ScHARR since 1999),\u000a      identified and evaluated all literature relating to the effectiveness of\u000a      the five statins for the prevention of coronary events. This comprehensive\u000a      review was unique, looking at the efficacy and safety (including\u000a      post-market surveillance) of all RCTs (published and unpublished) of the\u000a      five statins in primary and secondary prevention of CVD. Previous reviews\u000a      had only focused on secondary prevention, had only considered large trials\u000a      and had undertaken only a limited review of adverse events.\u000a    The review concluded that there was robust evidence to suggest that\u000a      statin therapy is associated with a statistically significant reduction,\u000a      as high as 33%, for some events, in the risk of primary and secondary\u000a      cardiovascular events compared to placebo when assuming a class effect for\u000a      all statins and doses. The evidence from the placebo-controlled trials\u000a      indicated that the four statins with hard clinical endpoints of morbidity\u000a      and mortality (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin)\u000a      demonstrated a very similar beneficial effect. The evidence base for\u000a      rosuvastatin was less well developed. Limited evidence from direct\u000a      comparisons between statins suggested that atorvastatin may be more\u000a      effective than pravastatin in patients with symptomatic CHD. The review\u000a        also concluded that statins were generally well tolerated, with a\u000a      good safety profile.\u000a    A new health economic model was developed by Sue Ward (Senior Operational\u000a      Research Analyst), Roberta Ara (Operational Research Analyst) and Mike\u000a      Holmes (Operational Research Analyst) at ScHARR to predict the\u000a      cost-effectiveness of statin therapy over a patient's lifetime. This was\u000a      the first economic analysis to compare the five different statins within\u000a      the same economic model. The model used clinical events to measure\u000a      effectiveness rather than the surrogate endpoint of cholesterol lowering\u000a      which had been used in previous models. (NICE guidance section 4.3.6) The\u000a      effect of statins on the reduction of events was based on relative risks\u000a      of coronary and cardiovascular outcomes estimated by a pioneering Bayesian\u000a      meta-analysis. Cost-effectiveness of statins within both secondary\u000a      prevention (for those who had already experienced a CHD event) and primary\u000a      prevention (for those at high risk of experiencing a first event) were\u000a      evaluated within the same model for the first time. For primary prevention\u000a      the cost-effectiveness was examined on the basis of decreasing risk in a\u000a      stepwise manner (for example, from a threshold of 3% annual risk to 2%\u000a      annual risk) to demonstrate the true incremental cost-effectiveness of\u000a      treating decreasing levels of absolute risk.\u000a    The economic modelling work showed that the incremental\u000a      cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in secondary prevention of CVD increased\u000a      with age varying between &#163;8,000 and &#163;13,000 per quality adjusted life year\u000a      (QALY) for ages 45 and 85 respectively and, therefore, statin therapy was\u000a      likely to be considered cost-effective based on the accepted\u000a      cost-effectiveness threshold values of &#163;20,000 in England and Wales. In\u000a      primary prevention, the cost-effectiveness ratios were shown to be\u000a      dependent on the level of CVD risk and age. At 3% risk the ICERs remain\u000a      below &#163;17,000 for all ages whereas at 0.5% CHD risk the ICERs reach as\u000a      high as &#163;50,000. The analysis also suggested that that statin therapy was\u000a      cost effective in people with diabetes, who have a higher absolute risk of\u000a      CVD compared to those without diabetes.\u000a    This research was used by the NICE Appraisal Committee to inform their\u000a      guidance on statin prescribing in England and Wales. ([R2 Section 4.3.6\u000a      and Appendix B]. The research report was also cited in the subsequent\u000a      Lipid Modification Clinical Guideline CG67, issued in May 2008. This\u000a      research also led to two further high quality research projects in the UK,\u000a      led by Roberta Ara at ScHARR. Firstly, a Health Technology Assessment on\u000a      the clinical and cost-effectiveness of ezetimibe in patients with primary\u000a      hypercholesterolaemia (funded by the NIHR in 2007).

The research\u000d\u000a      has also stimulated and advanced public debate in the UK and\u000d\u000a      internationally.\u000d\u000a    Our research has been central to policy decisions:\u000d\u000a    Scotland. 2009: The Scottish Government used\u000d\u000a      English SAPM results to support its decision to\u000d\u000a      pursue MUP policies and commissioned a Scottish model adaptation. Results\u000d\u000a      were presented to\u000d\u000a      the Scottish Ministerial Advisory Committee on Alcohol. 2010: We\u000d\u000a      served as expert witnesses in\u000d\u000a      the Alcohol Bill (Scotland) enquiry, Scottish Parliament Health and Sport\u000d\u000a      Committee. Also in 2010,\u000d\u000a      a first attempt at MUP legislation failed in Parliament. 2011: The\u000d\u000a      new majority SNP Government\u000d\u000a      introduced fresh MUP legislation. In the bill's explanatory notes [S1],\u000d\u000a      SAPM results feature on 13 of\u000d\u000a      24 pages. 2012: We appeared before the Scottish Parliament Health\u000d\u000a      and Sport Committee and\u000d\u000a      SAPM results were referenced in the Committee's report [S2]. The Alcohol\u000d\u000a      (Minimum Pricing)\u000d\u000a      (Scotland) Act 2012 was passed. A legal challenge by the Scotch Whisky\u000d\u000a      Association centred, in\u000d\u000a      part, on a critique of the evidence. A Scottish Government rebuttal used\u000d\u000a      SAPM results. 2013:\u000d\u000a      SARG submitted an expert witness report to the Court of Session, which\u000d\u000a      dismissed the legal\u000d\u000a      challenge. SAPM evidence was referred to by the judge to reject claims of\u000d\u000a      a poorly-targeted policy\u000d\u000a      [S3].\u000d\u000a    Our research has stimulated and informed policy debate:\u000d\u000a    England. 2008: Evidence briefings were invited by\u000d\u000a      policymakers in the Department of Health, by\u000d\u000a      the Prime Minister's Special Advisors at No 10, and by the Chief Medical\u000d\u000a      Officer (CMO). 2009: The\u000d\u000a      latter influenced the CMO's Annual Report, which cites SAPM findings and\u000d\u000a      lobbies strongly for a\u000d\u000a      MUP [S4]. SARG also gave oral evidence to the House of Commons Health\u000d\u000a      Select Committee,\u000d\u000a      and SAPM estimates are cited in the final report [S5]. 2010: SAPM\u000d\u000a      findings were used directly by\u000d\u000a      NICE in recommending MUP. SARG briefed senior Westminster civil servants\u000d\u000a      from the Cabinet\u000d\u000a      Office, Treasury, Department of Health, Home Office, DCMS, DCSF, and\u000d\u000a      DEFRA. 2011: SARG\u000d\u000a      was invited to a Government Engagement Workshop to discuss the draft\u000d\u000a      Alcohol Strategy. 2012:\u000d\u000a      The Alcohol Strategy 2012 included a commitment to introducing MUP, and\u000d\u000a      SAPM findings were\u000d\u000a      cited by the Prime Minister in his foreword [S6]. A 2012 House of Commons\u000d\u000a      Health Select\u000d\u000a      Committee report noted \"The debate so far is based almost entirely on the\u000d\u000a      work of the Sheffield\u000d\u000a      Alcohol Research Group\" [S7]. SAPM results have been cited prominently by\u000d\u000a      a range of bodies\u000d\u000a      engaging in public debate on alcohol policy, including the British Medical\u000d\u000a      Association, Alcohol\u000d\u000a      Concern [S8] and the Alcohol Health Alliance (which includes the Royal\u000d\u000a      Colleges of Physicians,\u000d\u000a      General Practitioners, Nursing and Psychiatrists, Cancer Research UK). 2013:\u000d\u000a      The Impact\u000d\u000a      Assessment accompanying the Government's consultation on the Alcohol\u000d\u000a      Strategy drew heavily on\u000d\u000a      SAPM results. In response to stakeholder engagement with the Home Office\u000d\u000a      and Department of\u000d\u000a      Health SARG published new evidence on the equality aspects of MUP. SARG\u000d\u000a      also published\u000d\u000a      rebuttals to several industry-funded reports critiquing SAPM. In July, the\u000d\u000a      UK Government replaced\u000d\u000a      the MUP commitment with an alternative floor price (level of alcohol duty\u000d\u000a      attracted by a product,\u000d\u000a      inclusive of VAT). According to ministers, MUP remains under consideration\u000d\u000a      as a future policy.\u000d\u000a    The research team have worked to advance public debate thorough regular\u000d\u000a      appearances across\u000d\u000a      all major UK print and broadcast media from 2009 to 2013. Examples of\u000d\u000a      public exposure to the\u000d\u000a      issues around alcohol MUP and its effects are evident from our engagement\u000d\u000a      with flagship radio\u000d\u000a      and television programmes, e.g. BBC 10 o'clock news (27\/09\/2009,\u000d\u000a      28\/09\/2009, 23\/03\/2012),\u000d\u000a      Question Time (26\/05\/2011), Panorama (28\/09\/2012), Daily Politics\u000d\u000a      (23\/03\/2012), BBC Radio 4\u000d\u000a      Today programme (18\/01\/2011) and You &amp; Yours (08\/06\/2010).

The model first\u000d\u000a      uses econometric methods to link changes in alcohol price to changes in\u000d\u000a      consumption, and then\u000d\u000a      epidemiological modelling to link changes in consumption to changes in\u000d\u000a      harm [R2]. A strength of\u000d\u000a      SAPM is its capability to consider policy effects on population subgroups,\u000d\u000a      by drinking level, age,\u000d\u000a      gender and income [R3]. Key methodological work involved the integration\u000d\u000a      of disparate evidence\u000d\u000a      sources, including data from cohort studies, surveys, administrative data\u000d\u000a      and the published\u000d\u000a      literature, and accounting for underlying time trends in consumption and\u000d\u000a      harm [R4, R5]. Several\u000d\u000a      international adaptations were undertaken. The interdisciplinary team uses\u000d\u000a      methods from\u000d\u000a      epidemiology, systematic reviewing, systems engineering, econometrics, and\u000d\u000a      health economics.\u000d\u000a    Main findings: The model's most prominent use has been to estimate\u000d\u000a      the potential impact of\u000d\u000a      different minimum unit pricing policies (MUP) for alcohol which had not\u000d\u000a      previously been subject to\u000d\u000a      empirical analysis [R1]. These policies link alcoholic beverage prices to\u000d\u000a      their ethanol content by\u000d\u000a      setting a floor price below which a unit of alcohol cannot be sold.\u000d\u000a    1) Introducing a 50p minimum unit price in England would lead to 15,000\u000d\u000a      fewer alcohol-related\u000d\u000a      deaths and 480,000 fewer alcohol-related hospital admissions over the\u000d\u000a      first ten years of the\u000d\u000a      policy.\u000d\u000a    2) This is associated with a &#163;1.6bn saving over that period in direct\u000d\u000a      costs to the health service and\u000d\u000a      a &#163;9.7bn saving across all outcomes.\u000d\u000a    3) Minimum unit pricing is well-targeted: it reduces consumption and harm\u000d\u000a      by heavy drinkers, but\u000d\u000a      has only minor effects on those who drink within government guidelines.\u000d\u000a    4) Minimum unit pricing has difficult equity implications: the poorest\u000d\u000a      heavy drinkers reduce their\u000d\u000a      consumption more than more affluent heavy drinkers, but most of the health\u000d\u000a      gains are also\u000d\u000a      experienced by this group.\u000d\u000a    The model was also used to provide evidence for the cost-effectiveness of\u000d\u000a      screening and brief\u000d\u000a      intervention programmes for alcohol users in primary care [R6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18133","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a4a. Informing public and professional debate on a sensitive issue\u000d\u000aThe findings emerged in the context of some high-profile deaths of Black men in UK psychiatric\u000d\u000ahospitals, and raised awareness of ethnic inequalities in mental health. Prior to this research, the\u000d\u000aprevailing paradigm for explaining these inequalities was `racism'. Not only was this an inaccurate\u000d\u000ainterpretation of the evidence; it also diverted policy attention into simplistic solutions (eg tick-lists\u000d\u000aof `cultural competencies' in which staff would need to be trained), and to undermine efforts of NHS\u000d\u000aorganisations and staff to provide effective and personalized care taking account of culture.\u000d\u000aResearch in Queen Mary has steadily shifted this paradigm towards more nuanced and socio-\u000d\u000aculturally informed perspectives. For example, the excess of compulsory detentions of Black men\u000d\u000afor psychosis may be due in small part to `racism' or `cultural stereotyping', but a full explanation\u000d\u000amust include other interacting variables, including poverty; educational background; stress and\u000d\u000adiscrimination in the workplace; cross-cultural differences in expressions of distress; differences in\u000d\u000afamily support and help-seeking behaviour; and medication adherence. The findings of this\u000d\u000aresearch and evaluation of the national programme [7] led to the recognition among policymakers\u000d\u000athat solutions must go beyond a behaviourist emphasis on `racial awareness' to embrace\u000d\u000aorganisational and systemic changes as well as personal culture and poor cultures of care.\u000d\u000a4b.

The findings, cited in the consultation documents [8],\u000d\u000ahelped halt legislation that was feared to risk greater ethnic inequalities in use of the Mental\u000d\u000aHealth Act. The final Bill was modified in a way that was unlikely to further increase inequalities\u000d\u000ain detention, and further research is investigating what explains increasing levels of compulsory\u000d\u000adetention in hospital in all groups, and the persistent excess among black patients.\u000d\u000aProf Bhui was invited to draft national policy in 1999-2004; this work produced a 5 year plan\u000d\u000a(`Delivering Race Equality 2005-2010' [9]) incorporating new service models, training and\u000d\u000afurther research. Many impacts resulted from this policy in 2008-13. In many localities,\u000d\u000acommunities had a greater say in local services and were more engaged with NHS services by\u000d\u000ainforming the implementation of the Race Relations Amendment Act and by promoting more\u000d\u000asophisticated models of workforce development to meet the needs of culturally diverse\u000d\u000apopulations. Most importantly, every trust was charged with improving their delivery of care to\u000d\u000aminority ethnic groups and to show this in inspections to the Regulator. Other impacts include:\u000d\u000aProf Bhui co-authored a report to the Department of Health on suicides in Black and Minority\u000d\u000aEthnic (BME) groups [10], contributing to the emphasis in the newly launched (Sept 2012)\u000d\u000aNational Suicide Prevention Strategy and to the work of the 2006 strategy as part of the\u000d\u000a`Delivering Race Equality' programme.\u000d\u000aA national Race Equality &amp; Cultural Competence programme (RECC) was mandated for all\u000d\u000amental health professionals, driven by strategic health authorities (SHAs) [11]. It led to\u000d\u000ainclusion of training by the Care Quality Commission in a race impact assessments of SHAs.\u000d\u000a\u000aFive hundred `race equality leads', a new workforce, were introduced nationally requiring\u000d\u000aeach Strategic Health Authority to develop an action plan [12].\u000d\u000aAs part of developing a competent and informed workforce to reduce inequalities, with pump-\u000d\u000apriming funds from Department of Health, Bhui set up an MSc in 2002 (plus Certificate and\u000d\u000aDiploma) in Transcultural Mental Health, delivered in an innovative online format to 80\u000d\u000astudents annually, now drawn from over 38 countries.

Informing and developing national and international guidelines\u000d\u000aThis work has been cited by, and strongly influenced, guidelines by the National Institute of Health\u000d\u000aand Clinical Excellence on schizophrenia, for which Bhui chaired the access and engagement\u000d\u000apanel [14]; the World Psychiatric Association Guidelines on Mental Health of Migrants [15];\u000d\u000aEuropean Union Guidelines on Healthcare of migrants: EU-COST action [16]; and European\u000d\u000aPsychiatric Association guidelines on Public Mental Health [17].\u000d\u000a4d: Implementing and evaluating new care pathways in the NHS\u000d\u000aThe action research project led by Queen Mary (2005-2007) `Enhancing Pathways Into Care'\u000d\u000a(EPIC) in four NHS trusts illustrated a range of ways of changing pathways into care and engaging\u000d\u000ahard-to-reach groups to improve access, often through partnerships between voluntary and\u000d\u000astatutory sector agencies [18]. For example, a Pakistani Muslim Centre developed a joint\u000d\u000aassessment protocol with an early intervention team in order to improve access to psychiatric care\u000d\u000afor women from this otherwise isolated population. In one site (Sheffield) local audits showed a\u000d\u000asmall reduction in the average duration of admissions among Black people. The evaluation showed\u000d\u000aclinical leadership, transformational leadership and cultural confidence were key ingredients to the\u000d\u000agenuine change in services. The graph below (from a peer-reviewed publication in Transcultural\u000d\u000aPsychiatry) shows one example of reduction in average length of stay in Black patients on\u000d\u000aadmissions on wards in Sheffield in a participating unit in the EPIC project in 2005-7.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a4e: Informing and influencing training and workforce development\u000d\u000aThe Queen Mary team were commissioned by NHS Tower Hamlets (&#163;450K) to provide the\u000d\u000aCultural Consultation Service to address intersectional inequalities arising in clinical practice.\u000d\u000aBhui set this up to provide individual staff training in holistic, socio-culturally informed care as well\u000d\u000aas organisational and system-level support and guidance to NHS organisations seeking to reduce\u000d\u000ainequalities in mental health service provision [19]. This is built on anthropological understandings\u000d\u000aof culture, which notes the significance of beliefs, arts, laws, morals and behaviours found in all\u000d\u000aethnic groups. The model uses patient and staff narratives of care as the basis for intervention\u000d\u000aalongside ethnographic research methods for evaluation. The team imported and adapted a\u000d\u000aCanadian model to provide a new service, including in-service workforce development by teaching\u000d\u000astaff how to use a cultural formulation, and addressing commissioning, management and team\u000d\u000ainfluences. This and the narrative approach permitted more negotiated care plans for patients who\u000d\u000awere disengaging or stuck in assertive outreach or other specialist psychiatric teams. The service\u000d\u000aalso included organizational analyses to assist the services and teams to adapt their ways of\u000d\u000aworking to reduce inequalities. Bhui led an audit of this service showing over 900 contacts, and\u000d\u000athat cultural competency of staff improved [20]. Among a small sample of complex patients (n=36)\u000d\u000aneeding specialist and in-depth work, there were significant cost savings (&#163;18K total) at three\u000d\u000amonth follow up. Patient functioning improved and trends showed fewer unmet needs.\u000d\u000a4f: Informing further research\u000d\u000aThe overall picture nationally from the Care Quality Commission is that despite an evidence-based\u000d\u000aintervention based on this research, there has been no overall reduction in ethnic inequalities in\u000d\u000adetentions, ie that dramatic improvements in some areas (see graph above) are counterbalanced\u000d\u000aby worsening inequalities in other areas. This has prompted new collaborative NIHR-funded\u000d\u000aresearch studies to explore variations in compulsory admissions across the country [21].\u000d\u000aHypotheses include various geographical factors and social determinants of health.\u000d\u000a4g: Oral and written evidence to Home Office and Government: Bhui's team undertook\u000d\u000aresearch on Khat (widely used in some minority ethnic groups and linked to mental health\u000d\u000aproblems) and presented the case for it being made illegal [22].\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aResearch by Bhui 1996-2013 showed striking differences by ethnic group in diagnosis and\u000d\u000amanagement of mental health disorders due to a complex interplay of socio-cultural factors and\u000d\u000adifferent perspectives of patients and professionals.

Since the mid-1990s Professor\u000d\u000aKamaldeep Bhui's team have conducted research at Queen Mary on cross-cultural psychiatry\u000d\u000aaiming to identify and explore these ethnic differences and ensure that patients receive best care\u000d\u000aand achieve optimum outcome whatever their ethnic group, social class, language, culture or\u000d\u000areligion. The research can be divided into four broad groups:\u000d\u000a2a: Descriptive epidemiology (research conducted 1996-98). Prof Bhui showed that Black\u000d\u000aCaribbean people were more likely than Whites to enter care through forensic and psychiatric\u000d\u000aroutes, more likely to be detained under the Mental Health Act, and more likely to be diverted to\u000d\u000ahospital from prisons, suggesting that their illness was less likely to be noticed by police or courts\u000d\u000a[1]. His team also showed that South Asians are less likely to be referred to specialist psychiatric\u000d\u000acare, despite seeing their GPs more often than other ethnic groups for all health problems [2].\u000d\u000aThese findings were partly, but not fully, explained by differing expressions of distress as well as\u000d\u000adifferent thresholds (irrespective of GP ethnicity) for recognition of common mental disorders [2].\u000d\u000a2b: Systematic review of compulsory detention (2001-02). A systematic review of 38 papers\u000d\u000aand meta-analysis of 13 suitable studies quantified the excess detentions (odds ratio for being\u000d\u000acompulsorily detained under mental health legislation if Black vs White = 4.3) [3].\u000d\u000a2c: Quantitative surveys of socio-cultural determinants of mental health inequalities (2001-\u000d\u000a08). Bhui et al undertook a series of surveys of discrimination \/ work stress and common mental\u000d\u000adisorders, of which one secondary analysis showed that discrimination was an important risk factor\u000d\u000afor common mental disorders [4]. Other studies implicated explanatory models and coping; and\u000d\u000asocio-economic risk factors of common mental disorders [4]. This involved developing and\u000d\u000avalidating new survey instruments (eg the Barts Explanatory Model Interview) [5].\u000d\u000a2d. Analysis of national suicide statistics by ethnic group (2006-07). Bhui led a national\u000d\u000aevaluation of suicide and ethnicity [6] that documented a highly significant excess of suicide in\u000d\u000ayoung (13-24 year old) black Caribbean and African men compared to white British men of the\u000d\u000asame age. These findings were evident in both community and inpatient settings. The team also\u000d\u000ashowed that, in contrast to previous studies, South Asian women did not have significantly higher\u000d\u000arates of suicide. In a report to the Department of Health, the team demonstrated a near-absence of\u000d\u000acommunity-based suicide prevention initiatives, and notably none aimed at high-risk Black men.\u000d\u000aQueen Mary researchers included Professors Bhui, Stansfeld, Priebe, and Feder and Hull.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"18134","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    QRisk had an impact in five areas: implementation and use of QRisk in UK\u000d\u000a      primary care (GP surgeries and pharmacies); direct uptake and use by the\u000d\u000a      public and patient organisations; informing policy on NHS Health Checks;\u000d\u000a      informing methodological work on risk score development and validation;\u000d\u000a      and inspiring further research on the use of QRisk-type scores for other\u000d\u000a      chronic conditions. We consider these in turn below.\u000d\u000a    4a: Implementation and routine use of QRisk in UK primary care\u000d\u000a      The success of QRisk has depended both on its robust scientific basis and\u000d\u000a      on intensive efforts on the implementation of the score in front-line\u000d\u000a      general practice. The effort included:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Dr Robson worked with the GP system supplier EMIS to ensure that the\u000d\u000a        risk score was fully integrated in GP computer software to give a\u000d\u000a        `one-click' QRisk calculation covering 55% of the English population.\u000d\u000a      An accessible website (www.qrisk.org)\u000d\u000a        including a user-friendly risk calculator aimed at both health\u000d\u000a        professionals and the public. The website currently receives ~25,000\u000d\u000a        visits per month (around 2 million visits to date).\u000d\u000a      Dr Robson advised the DH and a London-wide team on QRisk\u000d\u000a        implementation. Locally in east London, he was a member of the North\u000d\u000a        East London Cardiac Network Board, CVD lead for Tower Hamlets PCT and\u000d\u000a        advisor to other local PCTs in east London.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Using QRisk rather than Framingham as the risk score on GP computer\u000d\u000a      systems is more equitable for the needs of high risk ethnic minorities,\u000d\u000a      the socially disadvantaged and is estimated it will prevent 3,000 more CVD\u000d\u000a      events in five years in those at high risk in England because QRisk\u000d\u000a      identifies a risk group that is on average, at higher risk than that those\u000d\u000a      identified by Framingham. In people found to be at high CVD risk, events\u000d\u000a      will be further reduced by targeting treatment for high blood pressure and\u000d\u000a      earlier identification of diabetes.\u000d\u000a    Dr Robson collaborated with Prof Hippisley-Cox to design the QRisk\u000d\u000a      calculator and website and worked with EMIS, the largest UK computer\u000d\u000a      supplier to integrate QRisk in their electronic record using minimal\u000d\u000a      additional data and no duplicated entry. This was complex, requiring\u000d\u000a      automated on- line real-time connection to a remote `cloud' calculator,\u000d\u000a      which returns the score to the GP record within milliseconds in a seamless\u000d\u000a      electronic tool for busy clinicians and their patients in the consulting\u000d\u000a      room. An app is now available. The new QRisk-lifetime score was presented\u000d\u000a      by the Joint British Societies to replace the previous Framingham score as\u000d\u000a      their preferred risk engine [9].\u000d\u000a    QRisk has now been implemented by all GP system suppliers in England and\u000d\u000a      Wales. Other system suppliers use QRisk in community and pharmacy contexts\u000d\u000a      including Oskis, Wellpoint (kiosk\/pharmacies), Telehealth\u000d\u000a      (kiosk\/pharmacies), Cumbria Mental Health Trust, Informatica, Health\u000d\u000a      Diagnostics and Health Smart. These pharmacy and other community schemes\u000d\u000a      use QRisk as part of the NHS Health Checks programme (see below).\u000d\u000a    By 2011 the NHS Health Checks programme had identified 2.8 million people\u000d\u000a      at high CVD risk who have been started on statins &#8212; most of whom are\u000d\u000a      likely to have been identified with QRisk (as EMIS covers 60% of GP\u000d\u000a      practices and QRisk is implemented on all other major computer systems) &#8212;\u000d\u000a      though some will have been identified with Framingham. As statins reduce\u000d\u000a      CVD events by 25% and the average risk of those identified is around 10%,\u000d\u000a      it is estimated that this programme is preventing 9,000 CVD deaths or\u000d\u000a      events every year &#8212; about 50,000 since the programme started in 2009. This\u000d\u000a      is a major public health achievement [10].\u000d\u000a    4b: Uptake and use by the lay public and patient organisations\u000d\u000a      A key aspect of the QRisk website is that it can be used by an untrained\u000d\u000a      layperson to calculate their own cardiovascular risk, allowing\u000d\u000a      self-diagnosis and prompting people to attend their GP or pharmacist for\u000d\u000a      further investigation and advice. Public dissemination has been extensive\u000d\u000a      and QRisk is included on a number of websites including Patient UK,\u000d\u000a      National Prescribing Centre, NHS Health Check and NHS Improvement\u000d\u000a      websites. It was endorsed by the Director of the British Heart Foundation\u000d\u000a      and is included in their factsheets. The QRisk website is now being\u000d\u000a      accessed about 300,000 times a year, including 40,000 visits from outside\u000d\u000a      the UK.\u000d\u000a    4c: Informing policy on NHS health checks\u000d\u000a      Dr Robson has been an advisor to the Department of Health on NHS Health\u000d\u000a      Checks and a member of the London NHS Health Checks Implementation Group.\u000d\u000a      The NICE guideline [1 above], chaired by Dr Robson, provided the\u000d\u000a      scientific rationale and recommendation that underpinned the 2009 national\u000d\u000a      NHS Health Checks programme, which offers cardiovascular risk assessment\u000d\u000a      to all adults aged 40-74 years in England. On publication of NICE guidance\u000d\u000a      in 2007, the Department of Health endorsed QRisk for CVD risk estimation\u000d\u000a      in its NHS Checks programme [11,12] and used it to develop the economic\u000d\u000a      modelling underpinning the NHS Checks programme in 2008 [13]. This\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that QRisk potentially provided better value than Framingham\u000d\u000a      for the &#163;200m annual cost of NHS Health Checks [13]. In 2010, NICE revised\u000d\u000a      their original guidance to support the use of QRisk2 [14]. QRisk\u000d\u000a      technology integrated into the GP electronic record has been an essential\u000d\u000a      component of implementation and instrumental to widespread adoption.\u000d\u000a    4d: Informing methodological work on risk scores\u000d\u000a      QRisk development has contributed to the discussion on validation and\u000d\u000a      statistical comparison of models to predict risk, and to debates on\u000d\u000a      multiple imputation. For example, QRisk was a case study in a workshop\u000d\u000a      convened by the Foundation for Genomics and Population Health, Cambridge\u000d\u000a      [15,16]. The debate around the use of routine GP data for predictive\u000d\u000a      purposes has highlighted the potential of large primary care datasets for\u000d\u000a      research purposes (eHealth records research capacity and capability MRC\u000d\u000a      2011). The open source QRisk calculator has been downloaded from the QRisk\u000d\u000a      website by over 500 separate organisations in the last year and has been\u000d\u000a      used by a number of UK universities (including SCHARR for the health\u000d\u000a      economic modelling for NICE), Cambridge and Imperial. QRISK&#174; is\u000d\u000a      a registered trademark and IP is protected by GNU licences. QRisk has had\u000d\u000a      an international impact &#8212; for example, an American paper on health\u000d\u000a      economic assessment used QRisk in an Austrian population [17] and an\u000d\u000a      American review highlighted the importance of socio-economic data in\u000d\u000a      predicting individual and population CVD risk [18].\u000d\u000a    4e: Promoting development of further risk prediction scores\u000d\u000a      The principles behind the development of QRisk &#8212; using readily available\u000d\u000a      data items on GP systems to calculate real-time risk scores to inform\u000d\u000a      treatment decisions with patients and public health planning &#8212; have been\u000d\u000a      applied to other chronic conditions. These include diabetes risk scores\u000d\u000a      (with Dr Robson QDiabetes 2011 www.qdscore.org)\u000d\u000a      and cancer, osteoporotic fracture, renal disease and thrombosis risk tools\u000d\u000a      (Hippisely-Cox J www.QCancer.org).\u000d\u000a    Prizes, awards and grants\u000d\u000a      In 2011, Dr Robson received a NICE Shared Learning Award for his work\u000d\u000a      implementing NICE guidance on cardiovascular disease and the John Perry\u000d\u000a      Award of the British Computer Society for his work on this topic. In 2011,\u000d\u000a      he was awarded a two-year NIHR grant to evaluate the NHS Health Checks\u000d\u000a      programme, which will study the extent to which QRisk has been\u000d\u000a      implemented.

In 1997, Dr Robson\u000d\u000a      (based at Queen Mary throughout) implemented the first UK electronic\u000d\u000a      version of a CVD risk score (Framingham) on the leading GP computer system\u000d\u000a      (EMIS), which allowed GPs to use two keystrokes for an `automated' risk\u000d\u000a      score. However, the Framingham score was derived from research undertaken\u000d\u000a      in the 1970\/80s in one small, relatively affluent and largely white US\u000d\u000a      town. Framingham score substantially overestimates overall UK CVD risk and\u000d\u000a      underestimates this risk in South Asian and socially disadvantaged people.\u000d\u000a    Inaccurate estimates lead to poorly targeted interventions, including\u000d\u000a      lifetime statin treatment, and impact on equitable provision and outcomes.\u000d\u000a      The Framingham score targets 3 million people in England for preventive\u000d\u000a      therapy while QRisk targets 2 million more accurately. QRisk identifies\u000d\u000a      300,000 people who would miss out on treatment if CVD risk were calculated\u000d\u000a      with Framingham score, many of whom are South Asians and \/ or in\u000d\u000a      socio-economically disadvantaged groups.\u000d\u000a    QRisk: In 2004-08, the NICE guideline development group CG67,\u000d\u000a      chaired by Dr Robson, reviewed risk scores including Framingham, and\u000d\u000a      identified the need to develop more contemporary scores that included\u000d\u000a      minority ethnic groups, social disadvantage and family history of\u000d\u000a      premature CVD [1]. In 2007, Dr Robson worked with Prof Hippisley-Cox's\u000d\u000a      team in Nottingham to develop QRisk [2-4]. This was the first use of\u000d\u000a      routine GP records for risk prediction and the first to include socio-\u000d\u000a      economic status. The tool was validated in an internal subset and an\u000d\u000a      independent external dataset. QRisk reallocates treatment assignment in\u000d\u000a      1\/3 of those who would previously have been identified at high risk (1.3\u000d\u000a      million individuals), impacting significantly on individuals, equity and\u000d\u000a      resource use.\u000d\u000a    Validation: An international statistical and epidemiological panel\u000d\u000a      commissioned by NICE including Peto (Oxford) and Jackson (New Zealand)\u000d\u000a      recommended use of QRisk to the NICE guideline group. Despite this, the\u000d\u000a      group initially failed to reach agreement on QRisk. In 2008, a third\u000d\u000a      independent validation, carried out by Collins and Altman at DOH's\u000d\u000a      request, confirmed the methods, validation and superiority of QRisk\u000d\u000a      compared to the historically popular Framingham score [6,7]. In 2008, a\u000d\u000a      refined version of the score, QRisk2, was accepted as a major improvement\u000d\u000a      and the first independently validated score to include ethnic group. An\u000d\u000a      updated version was developed in 2010 [5] and externally validated in 2012\u000d\u000a      [8].\u000d\u000a    Updating: To avoid overestimation, the QRisk score equation is\u000d\u000a      regularly updated and modified using accessible real-time GP data &#8212;\u000d\u000a      important to maintain accurate prediction given continuing changes in\u000d\u000a      population behaviour (smoking\/diet) and falling trends in CVD risk. It\u000d\u000a      also allows periodic statistical refinements to the score (eg addition of\u000d\u000a      new components, revisions in the weightings assigned to each component).\u000d\u000a      In contrast, the Framingham score, based on an historical cohort, has led\u000d\u000a      to major inaccuracy in contemporary European populations.\u000d\u000a    The team that developed QRisk included the following academics:\u000d\u000a      Prof J Hippisley-Cox (U of Nottingham).

Funding was from local NHS trusts, Queen Mary, and\u000d\u000a      Universities of Nottingham and Edinburgh.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"18135","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3144096","Name":"Norway"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    4a: Informed and affirmed NICE guidelines for CFS and ME\u000a    As a major recommendation within its guidelines, NICE recommends: \"Cognitive\u000a        behavioural therapy and\/or graded exercise therapy should be offered to\u000a        people with mild or moderate CFS\/ME and provided to those who choose\u000a        these approaches, because currently these are the interventions for\u000a        which there is the clearest research evidence of benefit.\" (page 30)\u000a      [7]. There have been no trials of GET in severe CFS\/ME. However, partly\u000a      because of an open study conducted at Queen Mary, showing that GET helps\u000a      severely disabled patients (Essame CS et al. Journal of\u000a        Chronic Fatigue Syndrome 1998; 4: 51-60), NICE recommend an activity\u000a      management programme for such patients that \"draws on the principles\u000a        of CBT and GET.\" Since publication of the PACE trial in 2011, NICE\u000a      have publicly affirmed their recommendation of GET (and CBT) [8].\u000a    4b: Graded exercise therapy has been adopted as a standard treatment\u000a        for CFS in the UK\u000a    The British Association for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome\/ME (BACME) \"champions\u000a        evidence-based approaches to the treatment of CFS\/ME\" and represents\u000a      clinicians of NHS specialist services in the UK [9]. BACME welcomed the\u000a      findings of the PACE trial saying: \"The PACE trial ... provides\u000a        convincing evidence that GET and CBT are safe and effective therapies\u000a        and should be widely available for patients with CFS\/ME.\"\u000a    BACME is supported by the National Outcomes Database [9], which holds\u000a      clinical assessment and outcome data on ~9,000 NHS patients, to allow\u000a      benchmarking of effectiveness. Crawley and colleagues compared patient\u000a      outcomes across six of the largest NHS services against outcomes after\u000a      both CBT and GET in the PACE trial. Three of the services used GET; three\u000a      used activity management incorporating the principles of GET. Symptomatic\u000a      improvement was similar to that achieved after GET provided within the\u000a      PACE trial [10]. However, the mean improvement in physical disability was\u000a      about a quarter of the size achieved by GET in the trial, which may be\u000a      partly explained by the fidelity of the intervention not always being\u000a      optimal when implemented outside a trial setting. One obvious difference\u000a      is that some services deliver interventions in a group setting, rather\u000a      than individually as in the trial [10].\u000a    4c: Graded exercise therapy has been adopted internationally as a\u000a        treatment of CFS\u000a    Permission has been granted for both translation into German and the use\u000a      of the PACE trial GET manuals for a trial in neuromuscular disease, and\u000a      for use in an Australian trial of rehabilitation for patients with\u000a      traumatic brain injuries. The PACE trial treatment manuals are free to\u000a      download from the trial website: www.pacetrial.org\/trialinfo.\u000a      The site was accessed by 6,672 people between June 2012 and 21 August\u000a      2013, particularly from the UK, USA, Australia, Germany, and Canada\u000a      (source &#8212; Google Analytics), this monitored period being more than a year\u000a      after the main results were published [11].\u000a    4d: Graded exercise therapy is included in guidelines for treatment of\u000a        CFS internationally\u000a    Guidelines published in other countries recommend GET. For example:\u000a    \u000a       In USA, the Mayo Clinic states: \"The most effective\u000a          treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome appears to be a two-pronged\u000a          approach that combines psychological counseling with a gentle exercise\u000a          program.\" [12]\u000a       Also in USA, the Centers for Disease Control recommend GET;\u000a        specifically White's clinical website: \"The GET Guide 2008 by Chronic\u000a          Fatigue Syndrome\/ME Service at St. Bartholomew's Hospital can be\u000a          helpful in structuring your graded exercise plan.\" [13]\u000a       Australian clinical guidelines for ME\/CFS recommend GET \"unless\u000a          severely affected\" [14]\u000a       The Norwegian Knowledge Centre for Health Services,\u000a        commissioned by their government, concluded: \"Cognitive behavioural\u000a          therapy and graded exercise therapy is likely to be effective for\u000a          people with chronic fatigue syndrome.\" [15]\u000a    \u000a    4c: Engagement with `lay epidemiology' and improving public\u000a        understanding of science\u000a    This research succeeded in spite of considerable opposition from\u000a      activists. Some people in the CFS\/ME community have developed a `lay\u000a      epidemiology' comprising purely organic explanations and hypotheses for\u000a      the condition, and view psychological hypotheses as dismissive of\u000a      patients' `real' experiences. A vocal minority has actively opposed any\u000a      research into this condition with a psychological component and has even\u000a      sought to sabotage such studies [16]. Pressure from such activists\u000a      (including threats of violence) has led some researchers to pull out of\u000a      researching CFS altogether. The approach taken at Queen Mary, as described\u000a      in Section 2, has been to seek dialogue with patients, carers and the lay\u000a      public, engage with their concerns, try to understand their explanations\u000a      and seek as far as possible to work with them rather than against them.\u000a    CFS is so controversial that the House of Lords held a debate about the\u000a      PACE trial in February 2013 [17]. One peer was critical, but seven others\u000a      supported the trial. Baroness Northover replied for the Government, and\u000a      later wrote to White: \"PACE was an example of a well conducted, robust\u000a        research study. It is with thanks to you and your team that we now have\u000a        some very good evidence that CBT and GET are moderately effective when\u000a        provided alongside specialist medical care.\" [18] As part of a\u000a      public relations policy to disseminate the PACE trial results, The Science\u000a      Media Centre hosted a press conference for the main paper [19]. This led\u000a      to positive, world-wide coverage, including almost all UK national\u000a      newspapers as well as the New York Times, Wall Street Journal,\u000a      Sky, BBC, and ITV, and radio stations in the UK, USA and Australia.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a disorder of unknown cause affecting\u000a      1% of people.

Back in 1993, CFS, sometimes called myalgic\u000a      encephalomyelitis (ME), was far from an established condition and those\u000a      who did believe in the condition thought it untreatable. In a series of\u000a      studies at Queen Mary, Prof White led work that established the separate\u000a      existence, incidence and prognosis of the syndrome after an infection, and\u000a      also showed that physical deconditioning predicted it [1]. On that basis,\u000a      White (with Fulcher, an exercise physiologist) designed graded exercise\u000a      therapy (GET), based on the existing literature (Richard Edwards had\u000a      already published an open study of exercise for \"effort syndrome\"). White\u000a      then led the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) of GET to show that\u000a      it was more effective than a non-specific therapy time-control\u000a      intervention for patients with CFS, whether or not this followed an\u000a      infection [2].\u000a    This work has been successfully replicated four times; systematic reviews\u000a      and meta-analyses of these studies have confirmed the efficacy of GET for\u000a      CFS. White went on to show (unexpectedly) that the effect of GET on global\u000a      improvement was not mediated by a physical training effect [2], a finding\u000a      since replicated by others. However, increased exercise tolerance,\u000a      measured objectively, was mediated by increased fitness after GET [3].\u000a      This suggested that GET works as much as a behavioural graded exposure\u000a      therapy as a physical training programme; something that was incorporated\u000a      into later designs of GET trials.\u000a    In spite of this scientific support, several surveys by patient\u000a      organisations claimed that GET was often damaging, and that \"pacing\"\u000a      (living within the limits of the illness) was most helpful. White\u000a      therefore approached a patient charity, Action for ME, who agreed\u000a      to help him design and implement an RCT to compare specialist medical care\u000a      (SMC) alone against such care supplemented by either adaptive pacing\u000a      therapy (APT), GET or cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), the last of which\u000a      had also been shown to be effective and was recommended by NICE\u000a      (www.pacetrial.org) [4].\u000a    The PACE trial recruited 640 UK participants from secondary care [4].\u000a      Physiotherapists delivered GET, designed to increase exercise duration and\u000a      then intensity in a gradual and symptom-contingent manner, based on the\u000a      principles of behavioural graded exposure therapy (www.pacetrial.org). The\u000a      primary outcomes of fatigue and physical disability were significantly\u000a      improved in those who had received either GET or CBT, compared to those\u000a      who had received either APT or SMC; effect size was moderate (between 0.4\u000a      and 0.8) with similar effect sizes for both GET and CBT [4]. The pacing\u000a      approach of APT was no more effective than SMC. The patterns of results\u000a      were similar however CFS or ME were defined, as well as in those with a\u000a      comorbid depressive illness. Serious adverse events and reactions were\u000a      uncommon and equally distributed across the four treatment arms. CBT was\u000a      the most cost-effective, followed by GET [5]. At a societal level both GET\u000a      and CBT paid for themselves due to reductions in informal social care. 22%\u000a      of patients in the trial recovered their health after either of these\u000a      treatments, compared to 7% following SMC alone [6].\u000a    White et al concluded that individually delivered CBT and GET\u000a      were safe, effective and cost-effective when added to SMC, and should be\u000a      offered to all secondary care patients with CFS, however defined. In a\u000a      nutshell, gradually doing more is better for CFS than staying within\u000a      limits imposed by the illness. Consequent research includes an NIHR-funded\u000a      RCT of guided self-help using GET for patients with CFS (White is the PI).\u000a      The Cochrane Collaboration have a systematic review update of GET for CFS\u000a      in review, and an individual patient data meta-analysis is due for\u000a      submission this year (White is a co-author).\u000a    The trial was coordinated at Queen Mary and sponsored by them.

AE represents an important public\u000d\u000a      health issue due to its\u000d\u000a      impact on quality of life and its socio-economic burden. The economic\u000d\u000a      burden of AE in UK is high,\u000d\u000a      with an estimated total annual expenditure of &#163;465million in 1996.\u000d\u000a      Treatment options for childhood\u000d\u000a      eczema have focused on topical medications, with corticosteroids being the\u000d\u000a      mainstay of treatment,\u000d\u000a      along with the regular use of emollients. Many parents, however, worry\u000d\u000a      about the side effects of\u000d\u000a      the medications. Although side effects such as skin thinning and growth\u000d\u000a      retardation, have not been\u000d\u000a      supported by long-term studies, it is important to recognise these\u000d\u000a      concerns and to look for other\u000d\u000a      ways of treating eczema.

Work was then\u000a      undertaken to raise the profile of AAA screening as a matter for public\u000a      debate, and in particular to increase awareness amongst policy makers and\u000a      politicians. Also during 2006-07 Thompson and Kim refined the estimates of\u000a      the long-term cost-effectiveness of an AAA screening programme in the UK,\u000a      made the NSC aware of this work, and worked with health economic modellers\u000a      at the Department of Health to answer questions about the health service\u000a      impacts of such a programme. In January 2008, the prime minister Gordon\u000a      Brown announced the introduction of a national AAA screening programme, in\u000a      line with the NSC's original recommendation [impact ref 2].\u000a    As a result, the NHS AAA Screening Programme (NAAASP) was initiated in\u000a      2009, in four geographical centres in England [impact ref 3].

An issue crucial to the success of NAAASP in\u000a      terms of delivering the anticipated reduction in AAA-related mortality was\u000a      that the mortality from elective AAA operations was kept as low possible,\u000a      as had been achieved in the MASS trial. For this purpose, and after much\u000a      debate, it was decided that AAA surgery should be concentrated into larger\u000a      centres where surgical experience would be greater, excellence could be\u000a      more easily achieved, and monitoring could be more effective [impact ref\u000a      4].\u000a    NAAASP currently (August 2013) covers the whole of England [impact ref\u000a      3], with identical programmes being initiated in the devolved\u000a      jurisdictions of Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland [impact refs 5,6].\u000a      It is anticipated that full UK-wide coverage will be achieved in 2015. The\u000a      uptake of the screening invitation in NAAASP has been 75%, only slightly\u000a      lower than the 80% achieved in the MASS trial, and the elective surgical\u000a      mortality rate for large AAAs has been kept low (&lt;2%) [3]. Surveillance\u000a      for small AAAs follows the protocol and intervals developed for the\u000a      Cambridge-led MASS trial, but may be slightly relaxed in the future in\u000a      response to the publication [research ref 6] from the RESCAN Collaboration\u000a      on the effects and cost-effectiveness of alternative surveillance\u000a      intervals.\u000a    AAA screening leads to improved patient outcomes through the monitoring\u000a      of those at risk with a small AAA, and by offering elective surgery to\u000a      those with a large AAA. Based on the MASS trial and the three other\u000a      smaller randomised trials of AAA screening that are available\u000a      internationally, it is anticipated that mortality from AAA should be\u000a      reduced by about a half in men aged over 65 through the introduction of\u000a      NAAASP. Given current mortality rates, this corresponds to 1300 deaths\u000a      prevented per year in the UK [impact ref 3].\u000a    At international meetings in London (2012) and Budapest (2013),\u000a      representatives from 12 different countries worldwide compared their\u000a      prospects for initiating AAA screening programmes. Outside the UK,\u000a      screening programmes have started in Sweden [impact ref 7], New Zealand\u000a      and parts of Italy, while initiation is being actively discussed in\u000a      Denmark, Norway and Finland [impact refs 8,9]; in the USA, ultrasound AAA\u000a      screening is now recommended for all men aged over 65 who have ever smoked\u000a      [impact ref 10]. These changes in international policy have been driven by\u000a      the results from the MASS trial, as well as the early experience of NAAASP\u000a      in the UK.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a major cause of death in older men,\u000a      in the UK and elsewhere.

Thompson was the lead applicant on grants (funded by\u000a      MRC) to extend the follow-up of the trial's participants from the initial\u000a      4 years to 13 years of follow-up. For the other studies mentioned below,\u000a      Thompson was the lead statistician and co-investigator in the national\u000a      trials of treatment of AAA (funded by MRC and NIHR HTA), and the principal\u000a      investigator of the international RESCAN Collaboration which aimed to\u000a      provide a better evidence-base for the choice of small AAA surveillance\u000a      intervals (funded by NIHR HTA). In Cambridge, Thompson supervised Lu Gao,\u000a      Anthony Brady and Dr Michael Sweeting for these studies.\u000a    Research undertaken: Uncertainty over the potential benefits of\u000a      screening for AAA in the 1990s led to the initiation of the UK Multicentre\u000a      Aneurysm Screening Study (MASS, started in 1997 with follow-up until\u000a      2013). This randomised trial recruited a population-based sample of 68,770\u000a      men aged 65-74, randomised to either invitation to ultrasound screening\u000a      (with surveillance follow-up for small AAAs detected, and surgical\u000a      intervention for large AAAs) or no invitation to screening. The University\u000a      of Cambridge led the trial's protocol development, its randomisation, data\u000a      management and patient recall systems, and supervision of statistical\u000a      analyses. MASS remains the largest trial that has been conducted to date,\u000a      and together with crucial long-term follow-up data has provided the\u000a      majority of the worldwide randomised evidence on the benefit of AAA\u000a      screening. Of the men invited, 80% attended screening, and 5% of these had\u000a      a latent AAA detected. The early results at 4 years of follow-up showed\u000a      that invitation to AAA screening led to a halving of AAA-related mortality\u000a      (relative risk reduction 42% amongst those invited, 53% amongst those\u000a      attending), as well as a halving of non-fatal AAA ruptures [research ref\u000a      1, Cambridge authors Day, Kim, Thompson, Walker]. This impressive\u000a      reduction resulting from invitation to once-only screening was maintained\u000a      in the longer term, despite some increase in the rate of AAA ruptures\u000a      during the later years in those originally screened as normal [research\u000a      ref 2, Cambridge authors Thompson, Gao]. In a linked health economic\u000a      assessment, it was shown that offering AAA screening to 65-year old men\u000a      was likely to be highly cost-effective in the long-term, with an estimated\u000a      cost of &#163;2970 per quality-adjusted year of life gained [research ref 3,\u000a      Cambridge authors Kim, Thompson].\u000a    Additional research to optimise impact: To underpin policy on\u000a      screening and treatment of AAA, Thompson and colleagues conducted large\u000a      nationally-based UK randomised trials to compare: (i) surveillance versus\u000a      early surgery for small AAAs based on 1090 patients recruited in 1991-95\u000a      and followed up until 2005 [research ref 4, Cambridge authors Brady,\u000a      Thompson], and (ii) open surgery versus endovascular aneurysm repair\u000a      (EVAR) for large AAAs amongst 1252 patients recruited in 1999-2004 and\u000a      followed up until 2009 [research ref 5, Cambridge author Thompson]. In the\u000a      RESCAN Collaboration, Thompson and colleagues also collated individual\u000a      longitudinal data on small AAA growth and rupture for 15,000 patients from\u000a      18 studies in different countries, with up to 8 years of follow-up, and\u000a      undertook a detailed individual patient data meta-analysis in order to\u000a      refine the choice of surveillance intervals [research ref 6, Cambridge\u000a      authors Sweeting, Thompson].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"19668","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    The impact of CFAS on policy, service and society can be seen widely,\u000d      e.g. through citations in policy documents, clinical guidance and the\u000d      quoting of findings in public discourse.\u000d    Epidemiology of dementia\u000d    \u000d       CFAS provided the core prevalence estimates for dementia in the UK\u000d        population in Dementia UK (2007), e.g. \"In terms both of sample size\u000d          and scope the evidence base is dominated by the Medical Research\u000d          Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study\" (page 10, reference\u000d        1, section 5).

In CFAS, survey methods have\u000d      measured prevalence and incidence of dementia in the UK population, and\u000d      have been applied to generate population representative findings for\u000d      detailed neuropathology and molecular analyses. CFAS is a longitudinal\u000d      study, with 18,000 subjects recruited at baseline in 1989\/1991, and new\u000d      generation studies (CFAS II) and CFAS Wales) which began in 2008 to test\u000d      differences in prevalence across the two decades. CFAS I subjects have\u000d      been surveyed at least three times since initial interview (in 1994, 1997\u000d      and 2001) and in CFAS II at two years, with continued follow up of those\u000d      from CFAS I consenting to brain donation. To date, 47,000 interviews have\u000d      taken place using standardised assessment for health, dementia, and\u000d      measures of health and social care services utilisation. There are\u000d      currently more than 560 brain donations from study participants.\u000d    Key findings and outcomes of the research include the following:\u000d    \u000d       Dementia prevalence. Before CFAS there were no population\u000d        figures which could be confidently applied nationally and to specific\u000d        geographical areas. CFAS showed that dementia is common, more prevalent\u000d        than previously thought (overall prevalence of dementia in the 65+\u000d        population, 6.6%), and increases as the population ages (prevalence in\u000d        the 85-89 population, 25.3%). Differences were tested across six sites,\u000d        enabling estimates to be made for different parts of the UK as well as\u000d        for the institutional care population. (Section 3. Research ref 1 and 3)\u000d       Care utilisation and cost. The study demonstrated the high\u000d        cost of informal care in supporting people with dementia, which was much\u000d        greater than previously estimated. The group was also able to predict\u000d        future demand for long term care and likely associated costs. Modelling\u000d        long term care needs and forecasting costs have been invaluable tools\u000d        for policy makers.

Thus there was a\u000d\u000a      clinical need for an equivalent model, based on and validated using UK\u000d\u000a      data that was flexible and able to incorporate additional prognostic\u000d\u000a      variables.\u000d\u000a    The PREDICT model was based on survival-time data on 5,700 women with\u000d\u000a      early breast cancer treated between 1999 and 2003. These data were\u000d\u000a      obtained through the Eastern Cancer Registration and Information Centre\u000d\u000a      and used to determine the influence of key prognostic variables on\u000d\u000a      survival [1]. The model was then validated using an independent data set\u000d\u000a      from the West Midlands Cancer Intelligence Unit [1]. The PREDICT web\u000d\u000a      interface was developed in 2010 and is hosted by the Eastern Cancer\u000d\u000a      Registration and Information Centre.\u000d\u000a    In order to compare directly the performance of Adjuvant! Online and\u000d\u000a      PREDICT, a second validation of PREDICT was carried out using the same\u000d\u000a      data set. While both models performed well, the breast cancer specific\u000d\u000a      survival calibration for PREDICT was better than that of Adjuvant! Online\u000d\u000a      with similar discrimination [2].\u000d\u000a    In parallel with the PREDICT model development work, Profs Caldas and\u000d\u000a      Pharoah have led a research programme investigating the molecular\u000d\u000a      pathology of breast cancer in collaboration with other groups from the\u000d\u000a      international Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). This research\u000d\u000a      has enabled further development of PREDICT in response to feedback from\u000d\u000a      clinicians and requests for additional features in the model. In\u000d\u000a      particular, there were many requests to incorporate tumour HER2 and KI67\u000d\u000a      status into the model. Results from one of the BCAC projects were used to\u000d\u000a      enable the incorporation of HER2 into the model [3], with the new PREDICT\u000d\u000a      model being further validated using the British Columbia data set used to\u000d\u000a      validate the original model [4]. More recently, the results from another\u000d\u000a      of our molecular pathology studies has informed the incorporation of\u000d\u000a      tumour KI67 status into the model [5].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"19672","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aThe programme of research addressing strategies for the prevention of type 2 diabetes has had its\u000d\u000aimpact through the publication of NICE Public Health Guidance in 2011 and 2012. The NICE Public\u000d\u000aHealth programme produced two pieces of guidance. The first focussed on the prevention of\u000d\u000aprogression from high risk state to diabetes (NICE guidance. Preventing type 2 diabetes: risk\u000d\u000aidentification and intervention for individuals at high risk. NICE Public Health Guidance 38, 2012,\u000d\u000a(section 5, ref 1). The second guidance examined population and community-level interventions in\u000d\u000ahigh risk groups and the general population (NICE guidance. Preventing type 2 diabetes:\u000d\u000apopulation and community-level interventions in high risk groups and the general population. NICE\u000d\u000aPublic Health Guidance 35, 2011, (section 5, ref 2).\u000d\u000aThe research described in this impact statement is cited in both NICE reports. The guidance on\u000d\u000ainterventions in high risk individuals (section 5 ref 1) focused on two main activities: Identifying\u000d\u000apeople at risk of developing type 2 diabetes using a staged (or stepped) approach using a\u000d\u000avalidated risk-assessment score and a blood test (either the fasting blood glucose or the HbA1c\u000d\u000atest) to confirm high risk and the provision to those at high risk of a quality-assured, evidence-based, intensive lifestyle-change programme to prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. The\u000d\u000aNICE guidance cites evidence from the EPIC-Norfolk cohort in which the incidence of diabetes by\u000d\u000alevel of HbA1c is described, justifying the category of 6.0-&lt;6.5% as a high risk category in which\u000d\u000athe risk of progression to diabetes is 15 times greater than in those individuals with an HbA1c\u000d\u000a&lt;5.0% (research reference 6). In describing the range of possible validated risk-assessment tools,\u000d\u000athe NICE guidance cites the original paper on the Cambridge Risk Score (research reference 1)\u000d\u000awhich has subsequently been shown not only to predict prevalent undiagnosed diabetes but also\u000d\u000aincident diabetes (research reference 5).\u000d\u000aThe second piece of NICE Public Health Guidance examined strategies for prevention at the\u000d\u000apopulation level. Evidence of the incidence of diabetes in the UK is cited from the paper on the Ely\u000d\u000aStudy by Forouhi et al (research reference 4). The report cites the paper by Simmons et al\u000d\u000a(research reference 2) as the justification for recommending the focus of prevention at the\u000d\u000apopulation level on the same 5 behavioural targets that have been shown to be effective among\u000d\u000athe high risk population. It also cites the analysis in the EPIC-Norfolk study (research reference 3)\u000d\u000awhich demonstrates that although the high risk approach may be effective in the relatively small\u000d\u000agroup of individuals to whom it is targeted, greater public health potential comes from the\u000d\u000aapplication of strategies that attempt to address the same behaviours at the population level.\u000d\u000aThe guidance concludes that when developing national strategy to target non-communicable\u000d\u000adiseases with a major link to diet, physical activity and obesity (for example, type 2 diabetes,\u000d\u000acardiovascular disease, certain cancers), policy makers should consider integrating the strategy\u000d\u000awith other relevant national actions to prevent related non-communicable diseases addressing the\u000d\u000akey risk factors (for example, being overweight or obese, a sedentary lifestyle and an unhealthy\u000d\u000adiet) highlighting the contribution that partners in national and local government, industry,\u000d\u000ahealthcare and the voluntary sector can make by working together to reduce the risk of non-communicable diseases for the population as a whole taking account of variations in different\u000d\u000apopulation subgroups (for example, by ethnicity, age or gender) linking to targets and outcomes for\u000d\u000areducing the key risk factors for type 2 diabetes and other non-communicable diseases.\u000d\u000aThe work on the overall approach to prevention has contributed to strategic discussions beyond\u000d\u000aNICE through Wareham's contribution to the work of the International Diabetes Federation in\u000d\u000aformulating its Global Diabetes Plan 2011-2021 in the run up to the UN summit on non-communicable disease in 2011 (section 5, ref 3). The research into specific risk factors also has\u000d\u000aan impact through dissemination in the public media, with the findings from the large scale pan-European cohort study InterAct led by Wareham (research reference 7) on the association of\u000d\u000asugar-sweetened beverages and incident diabetes (research reference 8), for example, being\u000d\u000awidely discussed and informing public policy debates about actions that might limit consumption\u000d\u000a(section 5, ref 4).\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aResearch founded on population-based cohort studies has directly informed NICE Public Health\u000d\u000aguidance on the prevention of diabetes.

These cohort studies have been used not\u000d\u000aonly to describe the relationship between aetiological factors and risk of diabetes (e.g. Romaguera\u000d\u000aet al, 2013) but also to address key questions that inform strategies for the prevention of diabetes.\u000d\u000aPrevious randomised controlled trials (RCT) have shown that lifestyle intervention can halve risk of\u000d\u000aprogression to diabetes among people at high risk. However, these explanatory trials are not easily\u000d\u000atranslated into everyday practice and our research has aimed at identifying barriers to successful\u000d\u000atranslation and at potential solutions.\u000d\u000aFirstly, the explanatory RCTs define individuals as being at high risk on the basis of demonstrable\u000d\u000anon-diabetic hyperglycaemia defined using the time consuming oral glucose tolerance test. In\u000d\u000aanalyses using the prospective EPIC-Norfolk cohort study commenced by the University of\u000d\u000aCambridge in 1990 (Principal Investigators Professors Khaw and Wareham), the MRC\u000d\u000aEpidemiology Unit has shown that easily measured risk factors such as family history and obesity\u000d\u000aare strongly predictive of risk and that information on them is readily available in General Practice\u000d\u000anotes. When combined together in a simple risk score, these factors not only predict prevalent\u000d\u000aundiagnosed diabetes (Griffin et al, 2000) but are also predictive of future diabetes (Rahman et al,\u000d\u000a2008). The advantage of this form of pragmatic risk score is that it can be deployed in primary care\u000d\u000awithout the necessity for acquisition of additional information. Thus it can be used as the initial step\u000d\u000ain a combined approach to detect previously undiagnosed diabetes and those at risk of future\u000d\u000adisease in whom additional testing and intervention would be warranted.\u000d\u000aSecondly the Unit has investigated the utility of simpler methods for defining diabetes than can be\u000d\u000aused in place of the time consuming oral glucose tolerance test. The measurement of HbA1c in the\u000d\u000aEPIC-Norfolk study has allowed investigation of its relationship to cardiovascular disease incidence\u000d\u000aand mortality which are part of the argument justifying the change in criteria to allow diabetes to be\u000d\u000adefined on the basis of HbA1c levels. In 2011 the Unit described the incidence of diabetes using\u000d\u000athe new diagnostic criteria showing that individuals with an HbA1c greater than 6.0% but less than\u000d\u000athe threshold for diabetes of 6.5% had a 3 year risk of progression to diabetes of 7 per 100 person\u000d\u000ayears of follow up. 36% of incident cases came from this category, justifying it as a target for\u000d\u000aindividualised preventive interventions (Chamnan et al, 2011).\u000d\u000aFinally the Unit has investigated alternative approaches to prevention. In the Finnish Diabetes\u000d\u000aPrevention program, the achievement of five key behavioural targets (reducing weight, increasing\u000d\u000aphysical activity, reducing total fat, reducing saturated fat and increasing dietary fibre) was strongly\u000d\u000aassociated with a reduction in the risk of developing diabetes. The Unit has shown that the same\u000d\u000atargets were strongly inversely associated with risk in the general population (Simmons et al, 2006)\u000d\u000aand that they should therefore be the main behavioural recommendations for the population as a\u000d\u000awhole, not just for high risk individuals. The Unit also demonstrated that focusing prevention efforts\u000d\u000aonly on individuals at high risk was a less effective strategy than a population-wide approach to\u000d\u000aprevention (Harding et al, 2006).\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"19676","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The establishment of a suite of instruments by the MRC Epidemiology Unit\u000a      between 1993 and 2010 for measuring physical activity in different\u000a      population groups and settings and the production of an on-line DAPA\u000a      toolkit led by the Unit for the MRC Population Health Sciences Research\u000a      Network in 2011 to facilitate methodological knowledge exchange (1) has\u000a      promoted the use of measurement tools that are fit-for-purpose. For\u000a      example, in its report on Measuring diet and physical activity in weight\u000a      management programme, the National Obesity Observatory cites the DAPA\u000a      toolkit as a source of information on questionnaires (2). It also cites\u000a      validation work on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire\u000a      (IPAQ) (Ekelund et al, Public Health Nutrition 2006), a widely used\u000a      instrument for assessing the prevalence of inactivity which was used\u000a      recently in an analysis of global physical activity levels.\u000a    Although instruments such as IPAQ are useful for surveillance, there was\u000a      a need for a simple quick assessment tool that can be used in primary care\u000a      to identify inactive individuals as part of the assessment of risk. The\u000a      short version of the EPIC-Europe questionnaire that was validated by\u000a      comparison to repeated measures of objectively assessed energy expenditure\u000a      (Wareham et al, Public Health Nutrition 2003) has formed the basis of the\u000a      General Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPPAQ) recommended by\u000a      the Department of Health (3) as a screening tool to be used in routine\u000a      general practice to provide a simple physical activity index. The validity\u000a      of the instrument provides one justification for its use, but the\u000a      Department of Health report also cites the evidence from the Unit's\u000a      research showing that this simple tool independently predicts events such\u000a      as cardiovascular incidence and mortality (Khaw et al, Int J Epidemiol\u000a      2006).\u000a    The MRC Epidemiology Unit's research on physical activity, sedentary\u000a      behaviour and different outcomes has contributed to the recent revision of\u000a      the UK Chief Medical Officers' recommendation on physical activity (4)\u000a      with the work in adults ( Ekelund et al, Am J Clin Nutr 2008) and children\u000a      (Steele et al, Am J Clin Nutr 2009) being cited in the review of the\u000a      current scientific evidence relating sedentary behaviour to obesity (5)\u000a      which was undertaken as part of the work leading to the formulation of the\u000a      new guidelines which place a greater emphasis on the avoidance of\u000a      prolonged periods of sedentary time.\u000a    A number of pieces of NICE Public Health guidance have emerged over the\u000a      past 5 years aimed at describing the effectiveness of different approaches\u000a      to promoting physical activity. The NICE Public Health Guidance (6) on\u000a      physical activity and the environment cites the Unit's analysis of\u000a      temporal trends in physical activity in the United Kingdom (Stamatakis et\u000a      al, 2007). The more recent guidance on promoting walking and cycling (7)\u000a      cites the Unit's systematic review of interventions to promote cycling\u000a      (Yang et al, BMJ 2010) in the supporting evidence for the guidance\u000a      including Expert Testimony Paper 5 &#8212;Programmes to promote cycling. The\u000a      recommendations for future research in this guidance draw heaving on\u000a      Expert Testimony Paper 3 which cites multiple publications from CEDAR to\u000a      demonstrate an approach to the evaluation of infrastructure developments\u000a      which have the potential to integrated walking and cycling into people's\u000a      daily routines. This includes the evaluation of interventions such as\u000a      CONNECT2, a SUSTRANS project funded by the Big Lottery Fund to transform\u000a      everyday travel for local people in communities across the UK, creating\u000a      new bridges and crossings to overcome busy roads, rivers and railways, and\u000a      linking these to networks of walking and cycling routes, making it easier\u000a      for millions of people to walk and cycle for everyday journeys (8).\u000a    Evaluations of this type are able to demonstrate impact of overall and\u000a      domain-specific physical activity levels but are unlikely to be able to\u000a      demonstrate an impact on health outcomes, which need to be modelled rather\u000a      than directly observed (Jarrett et al, Lancet 2012). The papers describing\u000a      the results of these models have contributed to analyses not only of the\u000a      benefits of promoting physical activity on health outcomes but are cited\u000a      in more extensive analyses of the health effects of climate change (9)\u000a      since physical activity, transportation, energy use, pollution and climate\u000a      change are closely linked issues.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Physical inactivity is strongly related to coronary heart disease, type 2\u000a      diabetes, osteoporosis and some cancers.

These methods include subjective and objective\u000a      approaches which can be used in different settings, different population\u000a      groups and for different purposes. These purposes include the descriptive\u000a      epidemiology of physical activity (1), aetiological investigation of the\u000a      association between activity and health outcomes, assessment of activity\u000a      as part of risk stratification (2) and measurement of activity change in\u000a      intervention studies. Between 1993 and 2010, the Unit has developed and\u000a      validated a suite of instruments that are fit for purpose, has published\u000a      validation studies (e.g. 1,2) and made the methods widely available by\u000a      leading the development in 2011 of an on-line Diet and Physical Activity\u000a      (DAPA) toolkit which enables researchers to identify the most suitable\u000a      instrument for their particular study and to access all the necessary\u000a      elements of the measurement instrument to allow them to use it\u000a      independently. The Unit has contributed to understanding temporal trends\u000a      in physical activity in the United Kingdom (3) and geographical variations\u000a      in prevalence of inactivity globally. It has assessed the association in\u000a      large-scale cohort studies between overall physical activity, different\u000a      domains and different intensities on chronic disease outcomes including\u000a      all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease incidence (4), type 2 diabetes\u000a      and cancers. Research using objective measurement of physical activity in\u000a      cohort studies of adults and children has contributed to understanding of\u000a      the direction and quantification of the relationship between different\u000a      intensities of physical activity, sedentary behaviour and obesity and\u000a      metabolic disease (5,6).\u000a    These results have contributed to recommendations for physical activity\u000a      in the UK including recent refinements to focus not only on achieving 5 x\u000a      30 minute bouts of moderate to vigorous activity per week, but also to aim\u000a      to increase overall activity through whatever means and to diminish\u000a      sedentary behaviour. The studies have also informed the target of trials\u000a      to evaluate individualistic approaches to promoting physical activity. The\u000a      limited effectiveness of such individual approaches has led to investment\u000a      in research on understanding the wider population determinants of physical\u000a      activity, the effectiveness of planned and natural experimental\u000a      interventions that impact on physical activity levels (7) and the\u000a      estimation of the long term health benefits of changing activity (8). This\u000a      research has been led by the Cambridge UKCRC-funded Centre of Public\u000a      Health Research Excellence on Diet and Activity (CEDAR).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"19680","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Nature of impact Publications from the ERFC have been cited by 9\u000d\u000a      guideline statements:\u000d\u000a    2010: European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) Consensus Panel on\u000d\u000a      lipoprotein(a) in cardiovascular disease.\u000d\u000a    2010: American College of Cardiology Foundation \/ American Heart\u000d\u000a      Association (ACCF \/ AHA) guideline for assessment of cardiovascular risk\u000d\u000a      in asymptomatic adults\u000d\u000a    2011: European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society\u000d\u000a      (ESC \/ EAS) Guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias\u000d\u000a    2011: American Heart Association statement on Triglycerides and\u000d\u000a      cardiovascular disease\u000d\u000a    2011: American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Medical\u000d\u000a      Guidelines for Clinical Practice for developing a diabetes mellitus\u000d\u000a      comprehensive care plan\u000d\u000a    2011: US National Lipid Association expert advice\u000d\u000a    2012: Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines for the Diagnosis and\u000d\u000a      Treatment of Dyslipidemia for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in\u000d\u000a      the Adult\u000d\u000a    2012: European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and Other Societies Guidelines\u000d\u000a      on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice\u000d\u000a    2012: Evaluation and treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: an Endocrine\u000d\u000a      Society clinical practice guideline.\u000d\u000a      Specific impact\u000d\u000a    1.

There is, however, substantial debate about\u000d\u000a      what constitutes an optimum approach to risk assessment.\u000d\u000a    Researchers and outputs The ERFC was conceived and established by\u000d\u000a      Professor John Danesh (Professor since 2001), together with colleagues at\u000d\u000a      the Department of Public Health and Primary Care, including Dr Emanuele Di\u000d\u000a      Angelantonio (UL since 2010) and Dr Stephen Kaptoge (SRA since 2007).\u000d\u000a      Under the direction of Professor Danesh, the Cambridge coordinating centre\u000d\u000a      has since 2003 led all aspects of this consortium, including: choice of\u000d\u000a      hypotheses to study, collation and harmonisation of data, statistical\u000d\u000a      analyses, interpretation of data, reporting and dissemination of findings.\u000d\u000a      The ERFC has also given rise to other closely-related consortia led by the\u000d\u000a      same Cambridge investigators, such as the LpPLA2 Studies Collaboration.\u000d\u000a      Research Refs #1-5 provide examples of substantive findings. Professor\u000d\u000a      Danesh has been the key senior scientific leader in all the substantive\u000d\u000a      reports, exemplified by his role as the senior author and\/or corresponding\u000d\u000a      author.\u000d\u000a    Underpinning data and methods About 130 long-term prospective\u000d\u000a      cohort studies based in 25 different countries have shared extensive\u000d\u000a      individual-level data with the Cambridge coordinating centre of the ERFC.\u000d\u000a      This effort has yielded one of the largest and most detailed central\u000d\u000a      databases in CVD epidemiology worldwide (i.e., up to ~500 covariates for\u000d\u000a      each of 2.5 million participants). More than 100,000 incident CVD outcomes\u000d\u000a      have been recorded during 15 million person-years at risk. More than\u000d\u000a      300,000 people have provided serial measurements of risk factors.\u000d\u000a    In addition to its size and detail, several additional features have\u000d\u000a      distinguished this consortium's approach that have enhanced its power,\u000d\u000a      generalisability, and validity. First, cohorts contributing data to the\u000d\u000a      consortium have typically shared more extensive individual-level data\u000d\u000a      (e.g., additional types of disease endpoints and extended follow-up) than\u000d\u000a      have been reported in their own cohort-specific publications, thereby\u000d\u000a      enhancing power and enabling comparison of different types of CVD\u000d\u000a      outcomes. Second, the coordinating centre has iteratively checked,\u000d\u000a      cleaned, re-coded, and harmonised all data shared in this consortium in\u000d\u000a      close liaison with the investigators of contributing studies, thereby\u000d\u000a      enhancing the validity of the underlying data analysed.\u000d\u000a    Third, analyses have focused on a uniform and appropriate subset of\u000d\u000a      participants (e.g., people without a history of CVD at the baseline\u000d\u000a      examination who have complete information on relevant risk factors), in\u000d\u000a      contrast with inconsistent inclusion\/exclusion criteria used in previous\u000d\u000a      studies. Fourth, the ERFC has used methods specifically appropriate for\u000d\u000a      the evaluation of incremental risk prediction, such as measures of\u000d\u000a      discrimination and reclassification that require time-to-event data.\u000d\u000a      Results have also been expressed in a manner to help enhance understanding\u000d\u000a      by clinicians and policy makers, such as the numbers needed to screen to\u000d\u000a      avoid 1 additional CVD outcome over 10 years of preventive treatment.\u000d\u000a    Fifth, under the leadership of Professor Simon Thompson (MRC\u000d\u000a      Biostatistics Unit Director until 2011 and Professor since 2002) and Dr\u000d\u000a      Angela Wood (University Lecturer in Biostatistics, Department of Public\u000d\u000a      Health and Primary Care since 2006), the coordinating centre has developed\u000d\u000a      methods to optimise such analyses, including measures of discrimination\u000d\u000a      and reclassification for the multi-study situation [Research Ref #6\u000d\u000a      provides an example].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"19880","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The UK Stroke Association used our work to inform development of their\u000a      nationally provided community support services. Specific changes based on\u000a      our work include a significant move away from input primarily from a\u000a      stroke liaison worker to a more focused patient-centred approach; and an\u000a      increased focus on identifying and addressing, on an individual basis, the\u000a      long-term problems faced by each stroke survivor and his\/her carers. This\u000a      impact has had wide reach: the Stroke Association currently provides 340\u000a      commissioned services with a contract income of &#163;12.3 million and many\u000a      thousands of clients: e.g. in 2011\/12 Stroke Association staff saw 35,940\u000a      new clients.\u000a\u0009  Our findings also have reach beyond the UK. Based on our\u000a      work, Clinical Guidelines for Stroke in several countries (including the\u000a      UK, Scotland, Canada, New Zealand and Australia) now provide guidance to\u000a      health and social care workers on the importance of providing information\u000a      combined with educational sessions, rather than information alone. Lack of\u000a      appropriate information is one of the commonest concerns of patients and\u000a      their families (up to 50% report lack of information) and can hinder\u000a      compliance with secondary prevention and access to relevant community\u000a      services. We reported that information combined with educational sessions\u000a      improved knowledge and patient mood and was more effective than providing\u000a      information only. Our findings are cited in all these Clinical Guidelines\u000a      for Stroke (A-D), among others. Provision of information about\u000a      diagnosis and prognosis is a component of the National Sentinel Audit for\u000a      Stroke, which assesses compliance with guidelines. The latest audit (G)\u000a      reported some improvement in communication with patients.\u000a    Clinical Guidelines for Stroke have significant influence on service\u000a      provision: for example, on development of services in London (E).\u000a      This development work, which references our underpinning research, is part\u000a      of a major initiative to redesign stroke services across London, where\u000a      6,000 people are left with impairments following stroke each year.\u000a    Assessment six months post stroke is a component of the National Stroke\u000a      Strategy, and the development of assessment procedures is informed by our\u000a      finding that outcomes following secondary care- based assessment\u000a      six months post-stroke were no different from those following usual care\u000a      (generally no formal assessment). Our trial on which this finding is based\u000a      (8) is highlighted by the UK Stroke Improvement Programme (F),\u000a      an NHS initiative set up to provide national support for local improvement\u000a      of stroke services and the implementation of the National Stroke Strategy.\u000a      and is informing UK stroke services as they develop methods to implement\u000a      the six month assessment component of the National Stroke Strategy.\u000a    Addressing psychological need is now included in the UK National Stroke\u000a      Strategy, and in the annual National Sentinel Audit for Stroke (G)\u000a      that underpins its implementation, as an important component of stroke\u000a      care, based on our work highlighting the importance of psychological\u000a      outcomes after stroke, which raised the profile of this previously\u000a      neglected area. House contributed to the development of the stepped care\u000a      model for psychological interventions after stroke (A) which has\u000a      been developed by the Stroke Improvement Programme for national\u000a      implementation.\u000a    Forster, House and Young are authors of five stroke-related reviews\u000a      within the Cochrane Library, the premier resource for the synthesis of\u000a      evidence-based health care, which are used across the world as the\u000a      foundation stone for clinical guidelines: these reviews provide the\u000a      evidence for and are cited in Clinical Guidelines for stroke in the UK,\u000a      Scotland, Australia and Canada (A-D) and elsewhere. These\u000a      guidelines are the national templates for stroke service provision.\u000a    Our research was supported by (among others) the NIHR HTA and SDO\u000a      programmes, MRC and The Stroke Association, further testifying to its\u000a      direct clinical relevance, and underpinned by the development of a\u000a      nationwide stroke research network and comprehensive research network.\u000a      Forster is founding clinical director of the regional stroke network and\u000a      House was founding clinical director of the regional comprehensive\u000a      research network - so that development and implementation of our research\u000a      has been intimately integrated with NIHR policy.\u000a    Research approach\u000a      In our leading roles in the stroke research network, we have directly\u000a      evidenced the potential of research networks for stroke rehabilitation\u000a      research. This potential has been realised in our TRACS trial in which 36\u000a      participating centres recruited 900 patient and caregiver dyads, making it\u000a      the world's largest completed stroke rehabilitation trial (5). This\u000a      approach, novel in stroke research, has been further strengthened by\u000a      tandem economic and process evaluations. TRACS has demonstrated that large\u000a      rehabilitation trials are feasible and provides a template for large\u000a      pragmatic trials in rehabilitation. The study acted as an important\u000a      vehicle to engage clinical teams from across the UK in implementation and\u000a      delivery of research. Enhancing research methodology is a policy of\u000a      charity funders, for example AgeUK and The Stroke Association. The\u000a      importance of TRACS in the stroke rehabilitation research landscape is\u000a      evidenced by a public statement made by a former National Clinical Lead\u000a      for the NHS Stroke Improvement Programme. \"TRACS has been a very\u000a      significant study for two reasons. Firstly, the results of TRACS should\u000a      help provide important clarity on how stroke carers can best be supported.\u000a      Secondly, the engagement of front-line clinical staff in the running of\u000a      the [TRACS] trial has been hugely successful. Both these factors will help\u000a      raise the quality of care and support for people who have had a stroke and\u000a      their carers.\" (H).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Forster, House and Young have played a leading role in establishing the\u000a      importance of long-term psychological and social distress after stroke,\u000a      shifting the clinical emphasis (and evidence base) in stroke care from a\u000a      limited focus on physical recovery to acceptance of the importance of\u000a      psychological and social factors.

It is estimated that stroke costs the NHS over &#163;2.5\u000a      billion annually, accounting for 6% of total NHS and social services\u000a      expenditure. A particular focus of our research has been to explore and\u000a      address psychological and social recovery and their influences on the\u000a      longer-term quality of life of stroke survivors.\u000a    Improving stroke care\u000a      Work published by staff at the University of Leeds since 1995 has\u000a      highlighted the poor psycho- social outcome for stroke survivors and their\u000a      families. Since then we have explored the difficulties faced by stroke\u000a      survivors and their carers through a range of studies (all led by Forster,\u000a      Young and \/or House) including: systematic literature reviews; cohort\u000a      studies of the course and impact on physical outcomes of depressive\u000a      symptoms (1, 2) and the incidence of falls (an important cause of\u000a      anxiety) (3, cited &gt;190 times); qualitative work addressing\u000a      adjustment after stroke; and surveys of unmet need in stroke survivors.\u000a      Building on this research, which emphasises the need for stroke\u000a      rehabilitation to address psychological and social problems as well as\u000a      physical ones, we have developed interventions and led evaluations\u000a      (randomised trials) addressing pre-discharge preparation in stroke units\u000a      and post-discharge care. The following list gives such interventions (and\u000a      where available, their effects):\u000a    Pre-discharge:\u000a    \u000a      education and goal setting: gives significant reduction in patient\u000a        anxiety (4)\u000a      caregiver training immediately post stroke: has no benefit (5).\u000a    \u000a    Post-discharge:\u000a    \u000a      evaluation of home physiotherapy and day hospital care: the latter\u000a        showed no benefit\u000a      physical therapy later after stroke: improves mobility, but has no\u000a        long-term effect (6)\u000a      advice and guidance provided by a specialist nurse: showed there is no\u000a        proved strategy addressing the psychosocial difficulties of stroke\u000a        patients and their families (7, cited &gt;110 times)\u000a      UK national policy of routine re-assessment of disabled patients and\u000a        their carers at 6 months after stroke onset (the National Service\u000a        Framework for Older People): showed no benefit (8)\u000a      counselling and peer support: on-going work\u000a      continuity of care in stroke services: on-going work\u000a      structured assessment by a stroke care co-ordinator: on-going work.\u000a    \u000a    Our primary randomised trial work, specifically evaluation of input from\u000a      a specialist nurse, contributed to the Cochrane Review of `stroke liaison\u000a      workers'.\u000a    Development of research approach &#8212; randomised trials of complex\u000a        interventions.\u000a      In this work we have shown that it is possible to include mixed methods\u000a      (qualitative, process and realist evaluations) and health economic\u000a      analysis in trials of complex interventions even in the frail elderly\u000a      population that constitutes most stroke survivors. The trials have\u000a      progressed from small single-centre studies to two-centre studies\u000a      culminating recently with the implementation of two multicentre studies\u000a      (36 and 32 centres) recruiting 900 and 800 patients respectively, making\u000a      them the world's largest completed randomised trials in stroke\u000a      rehabilitation (Forster, Chief Investigator for both). The pioneering\u000a      nature of this work is evidenced by the former of these studies, the TRACS\u000a      trial, being the first stroke rehabilitation trial funded by the MRC (6).\u000a    Research presented here was led by: John Young Consultant Physician\/\u000a      Professor of Elderly Care 2005-present; Allan House, Professor of Liaison\u000a      Psychiatry, 1999-present; Anne Forster, Research Physiotherapist\/\u000a      Professor in Stroke Rehabilitation 1997-present\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"20045","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The AIRE study, which was conceived, designed and led by staff at Leeds,\u000a      showed for the first time the benefits of early initiation of ACEI\u000a      therapy for high-risk patients with clinical signs of heart failure after\u000a      AMI. This and subsequent research has led to the global introduction of a\u000a      simple and effective treatment, improving survival and quality of life for\u000a      many thousands of patients.\u000a    Impact on health and welfare\u000a    For patients surviving AMI, the debilitating syndrome of heart failure\u000a      secondary to left ventricular dysfunction is a common problem. The body's\u000a      production of angiotensin after AMI acts initially as a protective\u000a      mechanism to preserve blood pressure; however, prolonged angiotensin\u000a      production causes cell death. It had been proposed that ACEI therapy would\u000a      mitigate these effects but investigators were cautious about using the\u000a      drugs in these high-risk patients. The AIRE study was the first trial to\u000a      show survival benefits of the ACEI ramipril in these patients. A long-term\u000a      follow up study by Leeds of the trial's UK patients showed that these\u000a      beneficial effects persisted years later.\u000a    The international adoption of the strategy of early ACEI after AMI has\u000a      made it a fundamental part of routine treatment. In addition to\u000a      significantly changing clinical practice, the use of this simple and cost\u000a      effective treatment has contributed to the substantial decline in\u000a      mortality associated with AMI seen over the last two decades. For\u000a      instance, figures from the USA National Registry of Myocardial Infarction\u000a      Investigators indicates that in-hospital mortality after an AMI fell by\u000a      24% from 1990 to 2006 [A]. This trend due to improved care for AMI,\u000a      including the adoption of early secondary prevention such as ACEI\u000a      treatment, is reflected in data from other countries around the world. In\u000a      the UK, a study looking at trends in 3 year mortality in 3 month survivors\u000a      of AMI in the UK, demonstrated that between 1991 and 2002 the use of ACEI\u000a      increased from 11% to 71% and during the same period mortality fell by 28%\u000a      [B]. More recent data from the UK Myocardial Ischaemia National\u000a      Audit Project (covering England, Wales and Belfast) showed a continued\u000a      increase in the prescription of ACEI, from just over 80% of patients with\u000a      AMI in 2003 to 94% of patients with AMI in 2011\/12 [C, figure 15].\u000a      In 2011\/12 there were 79,433 individuals sustaining an AMI; in England,\u000a      95% of patients received ACEI treatment, Wales 90% and Belfast 98% [C;\u000a      table 7]. At a UK population level there has been a year-on-year fall in\u000a      the percentage of patients with AMI who die within 30 days of admission to\u000a      hospital [C; figures 19 and 20]. The observed improvements in\u000a      mortality are not solely attributable to use of ACEI; however, ACEI\u000a      therapy is a fundamental element of modern treatment strategies for AMI [D-F].\u000a      The AIRE study has had major reach and significance, as evidenced by its\u000a      recognition as one of the \"Landmark Heart Failure Treatment Trials\" [D]\u000a      which made \"a fundamental contribution to international clinical\u000a      guidelines, implementation of which has delayed or prevented morbidity and\u000a      death for millions of people worldwide.\" [E]. \"Two decades later\u000a      the results of this study still have a major impact on current guidelines\u000a      underscoring that this study significantly changed treatment of\u000a      cardiovascular high-risk patients.\" [F].\u000a    The importance of AIRE in contributing to the routine adoption of ACEI\u000a      therapy in patients sustaining an AMI is evidenced by the continuing\u000a      citation of this study in international clinical guidelines. The first\u000a      recommendation for the routine adoption of ACEI therapy in patients with\u000a      AMI who develop signs and symptoms of heart failure or who have reduced\u000a      left ventricular ejection fraction, the protocol used in the AIRE study,\u000a      was in the American College of Cardiology\/ American Heart Association\u000a      guidelines in 1996, which cited AIRE as supporting evidence. Since the\u000a      publication of AIRE, ACEI use after AMI has become standard practice\u000a      globally and is established as a class IA recommendation by, for instance,\u000a      the American College of Cardiology Foundation\/American Heart Association [G]\u000a      and the European Society of Cardiology [H] guidelines for\u000a      management of acute myocardial infarction. The AIRE Study is an\u000a      underpinning reference for this therapeutic strategy in both guidelines.\u000a      In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)\u000a      recommendation for secondary prevention following AMI, published in 2007,\u000a      has guided clinical practice during the current REF period and emphasised\u000a      the prescription of ACEI as a key priority [I, page 10]. This\u000a      guidance cites Leeds research on the efficacy of long term ACEI therapy as\u000a      supporting clinical evidence for the recommendation that: \"After an MI,\u000a      all patients with preserved left ventricular function or with left\u000a      ventricular systolic dysfunction should continue treatment with an ACE\u000a      inhibitor indefinitely, whether or not they have symptoms of heart\u000a      failure.\" [I, page 127]. Furthermore, cost effectiveness analysis\u000a      based on AIRE contributed to the conclusion that long-term ACEI was cost\u000a      effective in patients with and without left ventricular dysfunction [I,\u000a      pages 145-151]. A partial update of these guidelines released in June 2013\u000a      for consultation continues to emphasise ACEI as a key priority in\u000a      secondary prevention in patients with AMI and includes additional priority\u000a      recommendations on correct dosing of ACEI in acknowledgement of their\u000a      ongoing importance [J]. The updated guidance emphasises the\u000a      importance of rapidly achieving the target dose, based on relevant\u000a      clinical evidence, including AIRE, for specific ACEI (e.g. ramipril 10\u000a      mg\/day, as per AIRE): \"Titrate the ACE inhibitor dose upwards at short\u000a      intervals (for example, every 12-24 hours) before the person leaves\u000a      hospital until the maximum tolerated or target dose is reached. If this is\u000a      not possible, this should be completed within 4-6 weeks of hospital\u000a      discharge.\" [J].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Patients with evidence of heart failure following acute myocardial\u000a      infarction (AMI) have a particularly poor prognosis, with substantially\u000a      increased risk of death and subsequent cardiovascular events.

Whilst contemporary\u000a      mechanical reperfusion strategies significantly improve survival following\u000a      AMI, left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure develops in at least\u000a      40% of patients after AMI resulting in poorer outcomes, highlighting the\u000a      importance of effective management of heart failure in these patients.\u000a    The AIRE RCT (1) was conceived, designed and led by staff at the\u000a      University of Leeds (Professor SG Ball, British Heart Foundation Chair\u000a      (Leeds 1990-2010); Professor AS Hall (Leeds 1992-)), and built\u000a      upon evidence from earlier studies demonstrating the efficacy of\u000a      angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) in reducing mortality in\u000a      patients with severe heart failure. A reduction in sympathetic activity\u000a      and decreased adverse cardiac remodelling were believed to contribute to\u000a      the beneficial effects of ACEI in heart failure, suggesting likely\u000a      benefits for patients with heart failure following AMI. The AIRE study\u000a      (named after the river running through the city of Leeds) evaluated the\u000a      effect of early initiation of ACEI (ramipril) therapy on subsequent\u000a      mortality in patients sustaining an AMI with clinical evidence of heart\u000a      failure in a large multicentre, international prospective RCT. AIRE was\u000a      the first RCT specifically designed to evaluate the efficacy of ACEI\u000a      therapy on mortality and morbidity in this high-risk group of patients\u000a      with AMI. Previously, investigators had been reluctant to adopt this\u000a      strategy because of fears over a negative effect of ACEI therapy in high\u000a      risk patients. The AIRE study demonstrated a significant reduction in\u000a      post-AMI mortality in patients randomised to ramipril, reported in a\u000a      series of high citation Lancet publications (1, 2, 3), providing\u000a      vital evidence that the use of early and prolonged ACEI therapy improved\u000a      outcomes; this has led to a global change in the clinical management of\u000a      AMI.\u000a    In patients suffering an AMI the study randomly allocated patients with\u000a      evidence of heart failure to placebo or ramipril. Two thousand and six\u000a      patients were recruited across 14 countries and on a background of optimal\u000a      therapy were prescribed placebo (982 patients), or 5 mg ramipril (1004\u000a      patients) twice per day. At an average follow-up of 15 months (minimum 6\u000a      months), there were 170 deaths (17%) in the ACEI group and 222 deaths\u000a      (23%) in the placebo group, representing a relative risk reduction for\u000a      all-cause mortality of 27% (95% CI 11-40%) (1). An evaluation of\u000a      secondary (time to death or re-infarction, severe resistant heart failure\u000a      or stroke) and tertiary (mode of death) outcomes, demonstrated that ACEI\u000a      reduced sudden cardiac death by approximately 30% (95% CI 8-47%), which\u000a      appeared to be largely attributable to a reduction in progressive heart\u000a      failure (4). In an analysis of longer-term mortality in the UK\u000a      cohort of AIRE, 3 years after cessation of study treatment (minimum\u000a      follow-up period of 42 months), the relative risk reduction for long-term\u000a      mortality in those randomised to ACEI was 34% [95% CI 11-51%],\u000a      corresponding to an extra 114 patients surviving at 5 years per 1000\u000a      patients treated with ACEI for an average of 1 year following AMI (2).\u000a      A subsequent meta-analysis, including data from AIRE, confirmed that ACEI\u000a      treatment in patients sustaining an AMI with LV dysfunction\/heart failure\u000a      reduced early and longer-term mortality, and reduced the composite\u000a      endpoint of mortality or subsequent cardiovascular events (including\u000a      recurrent AMI and readmission for heart failure), supporting the benefit\u000a      of long-term ACEI in high-risk patients (3).\u000a    More recent work from Leeds (Hall A and Gale (Leeds Senior\u000a      Lecturer 2007-, NIHR Clinician Scientist)) in the EMMACE-2 study\u000a      (Evaluation of Methods and Management of Acute Coronary Events-2) examined\u000a      outcomes in 2,499 unselected patients with acute coronary syndromes.\u000a      Results of this study demonstrated that ACEI treatment is equally\u000a      beneficial in patients with and without diabetes sustaining an AMI, which\u000a      was not found to be the case for aspirin (5).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21201","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Outcome of research: A web-based user-friendly interface was\u000a      developed for BOADICEA (Impact\u000a      reference 5.1) which allows users to obtain rapid estimates of BRCA1\u000a      and BRCA2 carrier\u000a      probabilities and risks of developing breast or ovarian cancer. This\u000a      web-tool was made available\u000a      for general use in January 2008.\u000a    Scope and reach of BOADICEA: The web-interface of BOADICEA\u000a      currently has more than 2500\u000a      registered users from the UK and 45 other countries (Europe, North America\u000a      and Australia and\u000a      other). Periodic monitoring of the web servers during 2012 revealed an\u000a      average of 50 concurrent\u000a      users at any given time during a working week. The chief beneficiaries of\u000a      BOADICEA have so far\u000a      been healthcare providers, notably organisers of genetic testing (clinical\u000a      geneticists and genetic\u000a      counsellors), breast cancer screening and chemoprevention programmes,\u000a      oncologists and general\u000a      practitioners, family members of women with breast cancer or otherwise at\u000a      high risk of the disease,\u000a      women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and their families who\u000a      could be counselled for their\u000a      breast or ovarian cancer risks, the general public and bodies involved in\u000a      the planning of screening\u000a      or intervention trials.\u000a    Indicators of extent of impact: BOADICEA is one of the risk\u000a      prediction algorithms currently\u000a      recommended by the UK National Institutes of Health and Clinical\u000a      Excellence (NICE, Impact\u000a      reference 5.2, since 2006). It was also recommended by equivalent bodies\u000a      in other countries (e.g.\u000a      American Cancer Society and Ontario Breast Screening program incorporated\u000a      in guidelines since\u000a      2011 for determining eligibility for screening of high risk patients\u000a      (Impact references 5.3-5.6).\u000a    Nature of impacts: BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation\u000a      screening is expensive and is associated with\u000a      adverse psychosocial effects. Similarly, breast cancer screening is\u000a      expensive and has adverse\u000a      consequences including over-diagnosis. Chemoprevention is effective for\u000a      breast cancer prevention\u000a      but has adverse side effects. Thus, it is crucial that these interventions\u000a      are targeted at the\u000a      individuals most likely to benefit. Use of BOADICEA has had several\u000a      inter-related impacts in this\u000a      regard:\u000a    (1) To identify women eligible for screening by magnetic resonance\u000a        imaging (MRI) so that available\u000a        resources are targeted to those most likely to benefit most from early\u000a        cancer diagnosis, while\u000a        minimising the associated health service costs [Impact references\u000a      5.2, 5.5].\u000a      Under NICE current guidelines, women at raised risk of developing breast\u000a      cancer are offered\u000a      mammographic screening from age 40, and a subset of high risk women,\u000a      including BRCA1 and\u000a      BRCA2 mutation carriers, are offered screening by MRI. MRI screening is\u000a      more sensitive than\u000a      mammography but is approximately ten-fold more expensive. BOADICEA was\u000a      first adopted by\u000a      NICE in 2006 as a risk prediction algorithm for classifying women at risk\u000a      of familial cancer into\u000a      three risk categories: women at or near population risk, raised risk, or\u000a      high risk. BOADICEA\u000a      remains one of only two recommended breast cancer\/carrier risk assessment\u000a      tools by the revised\u000a      NICE guidelines (June 2013, Impact reference 5.2). Women predicted to be\u000a      at raised or high risk\u000a      are offered annual mammographic surveillance from age 40, compared to age\u000a      50 under the\u000a      standard NHS screening programme. Women at high risk are offered MRI\u000a      screening.\u000a    (2) Clinical genetics services are now using BOADICEA to refer women\u000a        for BRCA1 and BRCA2\u000a        mutation screening.\u000a      Predictions obtained by BOADICEA are being used to provide a consistent\u000a      way for referring\u000a      individuals for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation screening (NICE\u000a      guidelines currently recommend a\u000a      combined mutation carrier prediction of over 10% although the threshold\u000a      varies across countries,\u000a      Impact reference 5.2). This allows targeting mutation screening to those\u000a      individuals most likely to\u000a      carry BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, thus minimising the\u000a      psychosocial effects related to mutation\u000a      screening and the associated costs of mutation screening. Women found to\u000a      carry BRCA1 and\u000a      BRCA2 mutations could then be offered more intensive screening,\u000a      prophylactic surgery or other\u000a      risk reduction options.\u000a    (3) To guide chemoprevention and prophylactic surgery options for\u000a        women at high risk.\u000a      The predicted risks provided by BOADICEA are helping clinicians and\u000a      high-risk women take\u000a      informed decisions when faced with the options of risk reducing surgery,\u000a      regular screening or\u000a      chemoprevention. According to the revised NICE guidelines (Impact\u000a      reference 5.2) women\u000a      classified to be at high-risk of developing breast cancer may be offered\u000a      chemoprevention with\u000a      Tamoxifen or Raloxifene.\u000a    (4) To counsel women carrying BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations\u000a      BRCA1 and BRCA2 cancer risk estimates based on BOADICEA are\u000a      being used to counsel women\u000a      carrying such mutations.

The\u000a      Centre is the host for\u000a      a number of large-scale epidemiological studies and has played a leading\u000a      role in the\u000a      identification and characterisation of breast (and other) cancer\u000a      susceptibility variants.\u000a    Underpinning data and methods: The models were developed using\u000a      data from local and national\u000a      studies collected from 1996, combined with data from large international\u000a      collaborative studies\u000a      coordinated at the Centre for Cancer Genetic Epidemiology [Research ref\u000a      2]. Using the largest\u000a      world-wide series of breast cancer patients screened for BRCA1 and\u000a      BRCA2 mutations, Dr\u000a      Antoniou and Prof Easton used advanced statistical methods in 2002-2003 to\u000a      estimate the\u000a      breast and ovarian cancer risks for BRCA1 and BRCA2\u000a      mutation carriers [Research ref 1]. In\u000a      parallel between 2001-2008, Dr Antoniou and Prof Easton developed novel\u000a      statistical techniques to\u000a      model susceptibility to disease within families [Research ref 2]. These\u000a      data and methods formed the\u000a      basis of developing the BOADICEA algorithm [Research ref 2]. This was the\u000a      first algorithm to\u000a      model comprehensively genetic susceptibility to breast cancer, based on\u000a      the largest available data\u000a      resources worldwide. Between 2006 and 2008, Dr Antoniou led the analysis\u000a      to evaluate risk\u000a      prediction algorithms for familial breast cancer which involved the large\u000a      majority of clinical\u000a      genetics centres in the UK [Research ref 3]. This was the largest study of\u000a      its kind, including\u000a      1934 families. It demonstrated that BOADICEA was well-calibrated and that\u000a      it provided the best\u000a      discrimination among available risk models. Thus, BOADICEA was shown to be\u000a      a valid tool that\u000a      could be used for genetic counselling of familial breast cancer.\u000a    Additional research to broaden applicability of BOADICEA: Since\u000a      2007 Prof Easton has been\u000a      leading world-wide efforts to identify common breast cancer susceptibility\u000a      alleles through\u000a      genome-wide association studies. Sixty of the 67 known breast cancer\u000a      alleles have been\u000a      identified through studies at the University of Cambridge [Research ref\u000a      4]. Prof Easton and Dr\u000a      Antoniou have been coordinating the analytical efforts for the Breast\u000a      Cancer Association\u000a      Consortium (BCAC) and Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1\/2\u000a      (CIMBA). These\u000a      consortia have played a key role in the characterisation of novel genetic\u000a      variants and of risks\u000a      for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers [Research refs 4,5].\u000a      Recent risk modelling work, by\u000a      Dr Antoniou and Prof Easton, has also demonstrated that the research has\u000a      direct clinical\u000a      applicability for women who carry the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations who are\u000a      among the first\u000a      patients for whom the common breast cancer susceptibility variants can be\u000a      used for risk\u000a      prediction [Research ref 5]. Similarly, they have shown that common breast\u000a      cancer\u000a      susceptibility alleles identified from BCAC may have a role in targeted\u000a      prevention of breast\u000a      cancer [Research ref 6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21740","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aImpact of Newcastle research on informing prevalence rates\u000d\u000aA fundamental difficulty in tackling the challenges posed by dementia was the lack of knowledge of\u000d\u000athe scale of the problem, including prevalence rates and progression pathway. This was addressed\u000d\u000aby two reports that would prove influential in informing subsequent policy. The first, a report to the\u000d\u000aAlzheimer's Society entitled `Dementia UK' (EV a), contains prevalence and incidence data that\u000d\u000awere largely contributed by the CFAS (R 1-2): \"In terms both of sample size and scope the\u000d\u000aevidence base is dominated by the Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing\u000d\u000aStudy\" (EV a, pg. 10). Consequently, Dementia UK acted as the major source of information for the\u000d\u000asecond report, a 2007 National Audit Office document (EV b). These two reports formed the basis\u000d\u000afor the National Dementia Strategy (EV c), a high-level policy document published in 2009.\u000d\u000aImpact of Newcastle research on an improved care pathway\u000d\u000aNewcastle research has informed healthcare improvement programmes that highlight the\u000d\u000aimportance of early diagnosis, a well-performed disclosure and a well-planned care pathway.\u000d\u000aWhen preparing the National Dementia Strategy, the Early Diagnosis and Intervention working\u000d\u000agroup became aware of the lack of evidence to support opinions regarding earlier diagnosis and its\u000d\u000amore sensitive disclosure (EV d). This prompted research that resulted in the publication of R6,\u000d\u000awhich went on to inform the 2011 Health Foundation Improvement report. This cites R6 twice (EV\u000d\u000ae, pg 74), stating:\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\"patients are most likely to benefit from an early diagnosis if there is a coordinated team\u000d\u000awith representatives of different types of health and social care to plan the care of the\u000d\u000apatient\"\u000d\u000a\"Patients and carers prefer to be told the diagnosis early, as this ends their uncertainty\u000d\u000aabout the problem, allows them to learn more about the condition and how to cope with it. It\u000d\u000aalso gives them an opportunity to access support and allows them to achieve unfulfilled\u000d\u000aambitions in the short term.\"\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aImpact of Newcastle research on policy implementation\u000d\u000aThe Department of Health appointed an expert group to develop \"commissioning packs\" which\u000d\u000aenable the implementation of recommendations, via enabling health and local authority\u000d\u000acommissioners to design cost-effective services that are suited to local needs. Professor Robinson\u000d\u000awas recruited to this expert group on the basis of her relevant research expertise. She was able to\u000d\u000abring to the group's deliberations both the results of her research on the beneficial effects of early\u000d\u000adiagnosis for patients and their families, and the findings from Newcastle-led research on best\u000d\u000apractice in disclosing a diagnosis of dementia. The National Clinical Director for Dementia stated:\u000d\u000a\"I ... confirm that the evidence and advice [Professor Robinson] provided in [her] role as a key\u000d\u000amember of the Department of Health [DH] Expert Group responsible for the development of the DH\u000d\u000aCommissioning Guidance packs for Dementia care, was crucial to determining key commissioning\u000d\u000atargets and outcomes of good quality care\" (EV f). These packs were also informed directly by\u000d\u000aNewcastle research (R5) and indirectly via the 2009 National Dementia Strategy (EV c, itself\u000d\u000aincluding Newcastle research).\u000d\u000aThe two Dementia Commissioning Packs (EV g, h), published in 2011, include the statement:\u000d\u000a\"Identifying people earlier in the disease pathway enables more people suffering from the disease\u000d\u000ato make choices rather than at a point when it is too late\" (EV g, pg. 15). Newcastle research (R5)\u000d\u000ais included in EV h (pg. 9) as evidence that a rapidly and sensitively communicated diagnosis of\u000d\u000adementia has several advantages to the patient over traditional diagnosis pathways, including \"a\u000d\u000abetter understanding of the situation\" and \"an end to uncertainty\". These packs also went on to\u000d\u000aform the basis of the Prime Minister's 2012 Challenge on Dementia.\u000d\u000aThe Prime Minister's Dementia Challenge\u000d\u000aIn the latest step in policy development, the Prime Minister established a \"Dementia Challenge\" in\u000d\u000a2012 (EV i) to increase implementation of recommendations. Professor Robinson was appointed to\u000d\u000aa senior role, as confirmed by the National Clinical Director for Dementia (EV d): \"[Professor\u000d\u000aRobinson's] expertise as a national researcher in dementia care contributed to [her] selection as\u000d\u000aPrimary care advisor to the Secretary of State for the Prime Minister's National Dementia\u000d\u000aChallenge\". The National Dementia Challenge identifies major improvement targets for dementia\u000d\u000acare by 2015. Its first interim report notes that those responsible for implementation believe they\u000d\u000aare on track for working with professionals to improve early diagnosis (EV j, pg. 38).\u000d\u000aSummary\u000d\u000aNewcastle contributed to a large, multi-centre cohort study that broke with the prevailing focus of\u000d\u000aresearch. The study showed that dementia was more common than previously thought, and that\u000d\u000aage was a significant risk factor, with implications for the ageing population. Subsequent Newcastle\u000d\u000aresearch that identified poor quality of the diagnosis and care pathway informed several high-level\u000d\u000apolicy documents, including the 2012 Prime Minister's Dementia Challenge, and guidance in the\u000d\u000aform of the Department of Health's 2011 commissioning packs.\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aNewcastle research on dementia contributed two aspects that helped to shape high-level policy:\u000d\u000afirst that prevalence of the condition was higher than previously suspected, with implications for\u000d\u000acare of the ageing UK population.

In\u000d\u000aterms of quality of life, dementia is the chronic illness that accounts for the greatest number of\u000d\u000ayears lived with disability in those aged over 60 years. The estimated global financial burden is\u000d\u000a$315 billion, with UK costs estimated at &#163;17 billion (EV a).\u000d\u000aDementia is characterised by impaired memory and communication, which inevitably lead to loss\u000d\u000aof independence and a need for long-term care. As people age, some loss of memory is natural;\u000d\u000athis is known as normal cognitive ageing. However, 1 in 14 people over 65 years, and 1 in 5 over\u000d\u000a80 years will develop dementia. There is no long-term cure, but Newcastle research has\u000d\u000acontributed to a deeper understanding of the quality of clinical care that people experience along\u000d\u000athe diagnostic pathway.\u000d\u000aUnderstanding the prevalence and risk factors for dementia\u000d\u000aPrior to the 1990s, the majority of research into dementia was targeted towards finding a cure or\u000d\u000aunderstanding the cause of this devastating illness. However, the focus of research shifted towards\u000d\u000aunderstanding the natural history of dementia during the early 1990s with the MRC-funded CFAS\u000d\u000astudy (R 1-2). Newcastle's contribution to this unique, primary care based cohort study was to\u000d\u000arecruit 20% of the 13,000 participants and perform data analysis. The two main findings of the\u000d\u000astudy were first that prevalence was higher than previously thought, and second that age was a\u000d\u000asignificant risk factor for dementia, implying that the prevalence would increase in the ageing UK\u000d\u000apopulation.\u000d\u000aPatient and family experiences of the diagnostic pathway\u000d\u000aFollowing this epidemiological research, Newcastle researchers, including Professor Robinson in\u000d\u000aher capacity as an academic GP, investigated the quality of care received by patients as they were\u000d\u000aassessed for dementia. An MRC-funded, Newcastle-based study (R3) analysed general practice\u000d\u000arecords of 300 people recently diagnosed with dementia, and found that average time to diagnosis\u000d\u000awas 18 months and the maximum was four years. In order to explore the reasons behind such\u000d\u000adelays, a qualitative study was conducted in 2009 to investigate the individual experiences of\u000d\u000apatients and their families during assessment in memory clinics.

In\u000d\u000aaddition, Newcastle-led research examined the way in which a diagnosis of dementia was\u000d\u000adisclosed to patients and their families. The findings demonstrated that the majority of patients\u000d\u000awished to be informed of a definitive diagnosis of dementia; however, the diagnosis was often\u000d\u000awithheld from the patients themselves, even though their families were told (R5).\u000d\u000aFindings from a review of how diagnosis is carried out in primary care (R6) showed three aspects\u000d\u000aof relevance: first, that diagnosis involves good co-operation between primary and secondary care\u000d\u000aproviders, secondly that patients with mild dementia wish to know their diagnosis, and thirdly that\u000d\u000athe benefits of a well-performed and early diagnosis include an end to uncertainty, allowing\u000d\u000apatients and their families to plan for the future and giving access to support.\u000d\u000a"},{"CaseStudyId":"21741","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    As a result of research led by Newcastle University, the UK National\u000a        Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has adopted: (i)\u000a      methods by which the world's leading valid clinical practice guidelines\u000a      are produced; and (ii) processes that offer the best opportunity for\u000a      implementation by those responsible. This maximises the opportunities for\u000a      health gains for patients and predictable costs for the NHS.\u000a    The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence\u000a    NICE was established in 1999, and over time it has expanded its remit to\u000a      provide guidance and advice to improve health and social care. NICE\u000a      guidance supports healthcare professionals and others in England to ensure\u000a      that the care they provide is of the highest quality, and that it offers\u000a      the best value for money. NICE is internationally recognised for the way\u000a      in which recommendations are developed, using the best available evidence\u000a      (Ev a).\u000a    NICE guidelines: the ongoing impact of Newcastle research\u000a    The first guideline adopted by NICE was one developed by Eccles' research\u000a      group concerning secondary prophylaxis following myocardial infarction (Ev\u000a      b). NICE also adopted the approach by which the guideline (and those on\u000a      asthma (R1) and another on angina) was produced. Six research publications\u000a      (led by the Newcastle group) on guideline development (including R3, R5\u000a      and R6 above) were later cited in the first edition of the NICE\u000a        Guideline Development Manual (2004). These publications continue to\u000a      underpin the method for preparing guidelines, as can be observed most\u000a      recently in the November 2012 edition of the NICE Guideline\u000a        Development Manual (Ev c).\u000a    A total of 174 NICE guidelines had been produced using the approved\u000a      methods as of July 2013, the majority of which were after 2007. In the\u000a      seven years 2001-7, a total of 65 guidelines were published. In the\u000a      following five years 109 guidelines were published (Ev d). Of all\u000a      guidelines produced, 169 remain in force: 142 of which are in their\u000a      original form and 27 have been updated.\u000a    A significant development has been the introduction of the requirement to\u000a      review guidelines and, if necessary, update them. This process has largely\u000a      taken place since 2008 (see Figure 1). NICE policy, which is based on\u000a      Newcastle-led work on the lifespan of guidelines, is: \"A formal review\u000a        of the need to update a guideline is usually undertaken by NICE 3 years\u000a        after its publication\" (Ev c, p189). This three-year recommendation\u000a      is based on advice presented in the 2001 Journal of the American\u000a        Medical Association paper (R4). Since 2008, 22 guidelines have been\u000a      re-written, and 67 other guidelines have been subjected to the review\u000a      process. Five guidelines have been withdrawn as a result of the review\u000a      process.\u000a\u000aFigure 1.

Consequently, Newcastle-led research on strategies\u000a      for promoting the uptake of research findings was incorporated into the\u000a      processes and activities of NICE.\u000a    Examples:\u000a    (i) Encouraging engagement in promoting implementation. Guidelines\u000a      are, and have always been, written and reviewed by external committees\u000a      convened for that purpose, rather than NICE staff. The Implementation\u000a      Strategy Group scrutinised the processes by which guideline development\u000a      committee members were recruited. As a result of Newcastle-led research on\u000a      behaviour change amongst professionals (R6), a recommendation was made\u000a      regarding the importance of appointing the appropriate people to promote\u000a      guideline implementation. As a result, since Autumn 2009, the NICE\u000a      Implementation Team has advised management on potential gaps in guideline\u000a      development committee membership in order to encourage the recruitment of\u000a      individuals who could be expected to champion the implementation of a\u000a      guideline.\u000a    (ii) Web-based practical advice on implementation. In 2009, the\u000a      Implementation Strategy Group gave advice (based on research such as that\u000a      described in R6) on promoting engagement with primary care services and\u000a      supported the production of web pages designed to aid general\u000a      practitioners with the implementation of guidelines. The Implementation\u000a      Programme Director of NICE has said:\u000a    \"This is still a well used part of the site. ...

The development of clinical\u000a      practice guidelines (hereafter referred to as guidelines) began in the USA\u000a      in the early 1990s. However, legal challenges (a result of the largely\u000a      private nature of US healthcare) stopped progress soon afterwards leaving\u000a      significant methodological issues to be addressed, particularly\u000a      validation. Guidelines are considered valid only if: \"when followed,\u000a        they lead to the health gains and costs predicted for them\" (Field\u000a      &amp; Lohr, National Academy Press 1992). When appropriately disseminated\u000a      and implemented, valid guidelines can lead to changes in clinical practice\u000a      and improvements in patient outcome. Conversely, the dissemination and\u000a      implementation of invalid guidelines may lead to wasteful use of resources\u000a      on ineffective interventions or, worse still, deterioration in patients'\u000a      health. Research at Newcastle University sought to fill this gap in the\u000a      development of valid guidelines.\u000a    Research\u000a    The research undertaken at Newcastle first addressed the question of how\u000a      best to develop valid guidelines that help to improve the quality of\u000a      patient care. Building on the general method developed by the Agency for\u000a      Health Care Policy and Research in the USA, and refining it for\u000a      application to the NHS, in 1996 Professor Eccles led the development of\u000a      the first evidence-based guideline in the UK (R1). The following year,\u000a      further guidelines were published, along with a practical methodology for\u000a      the production of evidence-based guidelines (R2).\u000a    There had been little theoretical exploration, and a lack of a widely\u000a      accepted means, of incorporating economic considerations into guidelines.\u000a      The NHS Research and Development Health Technology Assessment Programme\u000a      document How to develop cost conscious guidelines (R3), authored\u000a      jointly by Eccles and Mason (York University) in 2001, was the first\u000a      published practical approach in which cost and cost-effectiveness concepts\u000a      were successfully incorporated into guideline development processes.\u000a    Between 2001 and 2005, Newcastle researchers played a leading role in an\u000a      international research effort that studied guidelines in use. This showed\u000a      that guidelines have an average lifespan of about six years and stated \"As\u000a        a general rule, guidelines should be reassessed for validity every 3\u000a        years.\" (R4, p1461) Further research led to a publication that\u000a      described approaches for updating clinical guidelines (R5).\u000a    In addition to this focus on guideline development, Newcastle researchers\u000a      developed an understanding of how new knowledge described in academic\u000a      medical literature was taken up by practising clinicians. This research\u000a      had implications for improving the implementation of guidelines in the\u000a      clinical setting (R6).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21743","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Economic and Social Research Council","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Alcohol misuse presents a considerable problem in England, with over 10\u000d\u000a      million adults drinking more than Government-set lower-risk limits, and\u000d\u000a      2.6 million drinking more than higher-risk limits (EV b).

In 1995, Professor Kaner\u000d\u000a      coordinated the English arm of a World Health Organization (WHO)\u000d\u000a      Collaborative Study on Implementing and Supporting Early Intervention\u000d\u000a      Strategies in Primary Health Care. Newcastle led two aspects of the study:\u000d\u000a    (i) a postal survey of 430 general practitioners (GPs) in the Midlands,\u000d\u000a      which showed low GP involvement in screening and brief intervention (SBI)\u000d\u000a      activity and identified a range of barriers and incentives for such work\u000d\u000a      (R1)\u000d\u000a      (ii) a large randomised controlled trial that focused on evaluating social\u000d\u000a      marketing strategies to promote uptake of the Drink-Less SBI programme\u000d\u000a      (originally developed by the WHO), and training and support strategies to\u000d\u000a      encourage its use in general practice (R2).\u000d\u000a    The survey (R1) was included in an influential British Medical\u000d\u000a      Association Board of Science report from 2008 entitled \"Alcohol misuse:\u000d\u000a      Tackling the UK epidemic\" (EV a) as evidence demonstrating why there was\u000d\u000a        \"no system for routine screening and management of alcohol misuse in\u000d\u000a        primary or secondary care settings in the UK\" (pg 64).\u000d\u000a    The finding that GPs delegated much of this SBI work to practice\u000d\u000a      colleagues, to nurses in particular, led to national pioneering work with\u000d\u000a      primary care nurses between 1997 and 2000 (R3). This involved: (i)\u000d\u000a      qualitative interviews to identify opportunities for SBI use in nurses'\u000d\u000a      health promotion work; (ii) the development of new materials to support\u000d\u000a      nurse-led SBI delivery; and (iii) a randomised controlled trial of\u000d\u000a      strategies to promote SBI delivery by nurses (R4). The development of the\u000d\u000a      new UK specific SBI programme (called `How Much is Too Much') was\u000d\u000a      led by Kaner, in collaboration with Gateshead Primary Care Trust and\u000d\u000a      Northumbria University. The work was funded by Sunderland Teaching Primary\u000d\u000a      Care Trust, and Professor Nick Heather from Northumbria University was the\u000d\u000a      study Principal Investigator.\u000d\u000a    Kaner's subsequent five-year Department of Health funded primary care\u000d\u000a      career scientist award (2000-2006) enabled further development of this\u000d\u000a      research via: (i) a pragmatic randomised controlled trial to evaluate the\u000d\u000a      cost-effectiveness of `How Much is too Much' when delivered by\u000d\u000a      nurses in routine practice (R3), and (ii) a Cochrane Collaboration\u000d\u000a      systematic review of the wider evidence on SBI effectiveness in primary\u000d\u000a      care settings (R5).\u000d\u000a    In 2004, Kaner was part of a team that tested various aspects of alcohol\u000d\u000a      screening and brief intervention in 12 general practices (R6) to ensure\u000d\u000a      that `How Much is Too Much' could be readily integrated into\u000d\u000a      routine primary care, an essential requirement for wide scale and\u000d\u000a      sustainable adoption.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"21764","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Adoption of FAST into national guidelines\u000a    In July 2008, FAST was included in NICE clinical guideline 68: \"In\u000a        people with sudden onset of neurological symptoms a validated tool, such\u000a        as FAST (Face Arm Speech Test [sic]), should be used outside\u000a        hospital to screen for a diagnosis of stroke or TIA [transient\u000a      ischemic attack: a mini-stroke]\" (EV b, pg. 8).\u000a    The 2012 National Clinical Guideline for stroke (EV c) addresses both of\u000a      the major barriers to rapid stroke care, recommending first that \"All\u000a        patients seen with an acute neurological syndrome suspected to be a\u000a        stroke should be transferred directly to a specialised hyperacute stroke\u000a        unit\". Secondly, R2 is included as the sole source of evidence for\u000a      the recommendation that \"People seen by ambulance staff outside\u000a        hospital, who have sudden onset of neurological symptoms, should be\u000a        screened using a validated tool (eg FAST) to diagnose stroke.\" The\u000a      guideline also states that \"The FAST is accepted as the tool of choice\u000a        for prehospital clinicians.\"\u000a    The effect of Newcastle work of re-organisation of stroke services\u000a    As a direct result of Newcastle research that demonstrated the\u000a      effectiveness of sending acute-stroke patients directly to a dedicated\u000a      unit, stroke services in two cites were reconfigured. In December 2008, a\u000a      new model was implemented to deliver acute stroke services in the Greater\u000a      Manchester region, which led to a substantial increase in thrombolysis\u000a      treatments given: from 10 eligible patients in 2006, 12 in 2007, to 20 in\u000a      2008 and 69 in 2009 (EV e, pg. 19). Between 2009 and 2010 a new model was\u000a      introduced in London that included eight hyper-acute stroke units (HASUs)\u000a      and in February 2010 stroke care in North Central London was merged into\u000a      one HASU to deliver a single standard of care. According to latest\u000a      available figures, thrombolysis rates increased in North Central London\u000a      from 3.5% in February 2009 to 12% by October 2010, and mortality rate\u000a      decreased from above 30% in 2006 to below 10% in 2011 (EV d, pg. 7).\u000a      Administration of thrombolytics within 4.5 hours has been found to be\u000a      significantly associated with a favourable outcome, in terms of measures\u000a      of disability such as the modified Rankin scale and functional scales such\u000a      as the Glasgow Outcome Scale (Hacke et al. 2008, DOI\u000a      10.1056\/NEJMoa0804656). However, this same study found no significant\u000a      difference in mortality rate between the group treated with thrombolytics\u000a      and placebo, a plausible explanation being that the decrease in mortality\u000a      rate seen in North Central London was due to more rapid transport to\u000a      hospital.\u000a    This reconfiguration of stroke care led to NHS London and the Greater\u000a      Manchester and Cheshire Cardiac and Stroke Network winning the 2009 and\u000a      2010 Health Service Journal (HSJ) award for Clinical Service Redesign,\u000a      respectively (EV d, e).\u000a    Adoption of FAST as a national campaign\u000a    The effectiveness of FAST in paramedic use led to its adoption as a\u000a      public recognition instrument. The first body to make use of the validated\u000a      FAST test was the Stroke Association, who state on their website that \"Professor\u000a        Gary Ford's team at Newcastle University showed that ambulance\u000a        paramedics can use the Face Arm Speech Time (FAST) test to recognise\u000a        when someone is having a stroke. The study, funded by The Stroke\u000a        Association, found that paramedics using the FAST test could identify a\u000a        stroke just as accurately as specially trained doctors.\" (EV f).\u000a    The work went on to inform the Department of Health's nationwide Act FAST\u000a      campaign, to help members of the public recognise the signs of stroke and\u000a      to act quickly to ensure that thrombolytics are administered within the\u000a      short window of opportunity. This campaign, originally launched in\u000a      February 2009, has seen several waves of activity, the latest in March\u000a      2013. The memorable imagery includes the use of a \"flaming head\" and has\u000a      appeared on national TV, posters and bus stops (EV g). The Director of\u000a      Research and Information at the Stroke Association states: \"I write to\u000a        confirm that the work you did in assessing the reliability of using FAST\u000a        by paramedics was key to the Stroke Association's decision to use FAST\u000a        in our bus stop campaign and then in the Department of Health using it\u000a        in the flaming head campaign.\" (EV h).\u000a    \u000aPoster from the Department of Health's national FAST campaign,launched in 2009 (EV g)\u000a\u000a    A National Audit Office report from February 2010 (EV i, pg 22-23) stated\u000a      that the Act FAST campaign had been seen by 92% of the 2000 people that\u000a      responded to a survey on its use. The same survey found that from before\u000a      to after the campaign, public awareness of the symptoms of stroke\u000a      increased from 15% to 82%. The report also states that an audit of one\u000a      hyper-acute stroke centre saw a 171% increase in the number of patients\u000a      presenting within three hours of a stroke between 2008 and 2009. Following\u000a      a renewal of the Act FAST campaign in 2012, there was a 25% rise in\u000a      stroke-related 999 calls and a 19% increase in stroke sufferers being seen\u000a      more quickly (EV g).\u000a    As a result of the re-organisation of stroke services and the\u000a      introduction of the Act FAST campaign, thrombolysis treatment for those\u000a      stroke patients who will benefit have increased nationwide fivefold\u000a      between 2006-7 and 2008-9 (EV i, pg. 24). The thrombolysis intervention\u000a      rate has continued to grow: from less than 1% in 20051, to 8%\u000a      by late 2011, according to the Stroke Improvement National Audit Programme\u000a      (SINAP, EV j).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Stroke is a major health burden to patients, carers and the NHS, with UK\u000a      costs estimated at &#163;15.5bn annually.

He left Newcastle University in October 2013.\u000a    The challenge of stroke and rapid diagnosis\u000a    In the UK alone, over 150,000 people have a stroke annually and 1.1\u000a      million people, of all ages, live with stroke (EV a). The annual costs of\u000a      stroke, which include health and informal care costs and loss of\u000a      productivity, are estimated to be up to &#163;15.5bn billion. Treatment exists\u000a      for ischaemic stroke in the form of clot-busting drugs, called\u000a      thrombolytics, but these are only effective if administered rapidly: each\u000a      hour over 714km of nerve fibre are lost. Translated into an example of\u000a      functional loss, every 10-minute delay results in a further 12 out of\u000a      every 1000 patients having impaired walking ability at discharge,\u000a      demonstrating the importance of rapid diagnosis and transfer to a\u000a      specialist centre (Saver et al. 2013, DOI:\u000a      10.1001\/jama.2013.6959). Thrombolytics are most effective if administered\u000a      within three hours (EV d), and beyond 4.5 hours the chances that the\u000a      treatment will help or harm the patients are approximately equal. This\u000a      highlights the importance of rapid diagnosis and transport to a\u000a      specialised unit.\u000a    A National Audit Office report from 2005 (\"Reducing Brain Damage:\u000a        Faster access to better stroke care\") stated that the rate of\u000a      thrombolytic treatment in England was below 1%, because of two major\u000a      contributing factors: firstly, \"the lack of public awareness of the\u000a        fact that stroke is a medical emergency, and that appropriate treatment\u000a        within the first few hours can make the difference between recovery and\u000a        serious disability\" and secondly \"Ambulance Trusts, Accident and\u000a        Emergency departments, Radiology departments and specialist stroke teams\u000a        do not routinely provide an effective, integrated emergency response to\u000a        stroke that includes rapid triage and access to scanning\".\u000a    Newcastle research addressed these two challenges by: 1) recognising that\u000a      paramedics could diagnose stroke with a high degree of accuracy; 2)\u000a      testing the theory that re-organising ambulance services would allow more\u000a      rapid admission of a patient directly to a stroke unit; and 3) developing\u000a      a protocol to increase public awareness of stroke as a medical emergency.\u000a    Re-organisation of stroke services\u000a    Until 1997, suspected stroke patients admitted to the Newcastle Hospitals\u000a      NHS Foundation Trust were first taken by ambulance to one of two Emergency\u000a      Departments before onward referral to the specialist acute stroke unit. To\u000a      improve the speed of access of acute-stroke patients to a dedicated acute\u000a      stroke unit, a protocol was established in Newcastle in 1997 and assessed\u000a      after 15 months (R1). The protocol required paramedics to assess patients\u000a      using the Face-Arm-Speech-Time (FAST) test (see below), with its outcome\u000a      determining whether patients were admitted directly by the acute stroke\u000a      unit, rather than by the Emergency Departments. During this time, 123\u000a      patients were admitted to the acute stroke unit. Admissions increased\u000a      during the first year from an average of three to 13 patients per month,\u000a      with diagnostic accuracy above 80%, showing that re-organisation of the\u000a      service allowed acute-stroke patients to be directed appropriately and\u000a      thus have a greater chance of rapid treatment.\u000a    Improving paramedic and public recognition of stroke\u000a    Research carried out by Professor Gary Ford CBE at Newcastle tested the\u000a      hypothesis that paramedics could recognise acute stroke using a simple,\u000a      quick protocol (R1, 2), and direct the patient to the appropriate unit for\u000a      prompt action. This protocol, named FAST for \"Face Arm Speech Time\" (or\u000a      sometimes \"Test\"), was developed from the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke\u000a      Scale (CPSS). The FAST test contains three elements of the CPSS which were\u000a      modified to use assessment of spontaneous speech rather than repetition of\u000a      a sentence. This allows the test to be performed more quickly, reducing\u000a      assessment time and enabling a positively-identified stroke patient to be\u000a      transferred to a stroke unit without delay. The FAST test was also\u000a      developed to complement existing assessments that paramedics were familiar\u000a      with such as conscious level. Newcastle research found that paramedics\u000a      correctly diagnosed stroke in 79% of patients using FAST (R2), and that\u000a      there was good agreement between paramedic identification of stroke and\u000a      later confirmation by a specialist (R3).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"22020","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Population ageing is a key social issue of our times.

By filling the gap in public availability of socially segmented\u000d\u000a      longevity risk analyses, including their epidemiological drivers via the\u000d\u000a      medium of peer-reviewed publications, the pension industry gains by having\u000d\u000a      an externally acknowledged benchmark against which to align company\u000d\u000a      specific client portfolios and to project future trajectories based on a\u000d\u000a      better understanding of the reasons for past differentials and the likely\u000d\u000a      direction of travel.\u000d\u000a    Bajekal was invited to serve on the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries\u000d\u000a      Mortality Research Steering Committee (MRSC) in Feb 2012.

The programme was set up to apply UCL's expertise in\u000d\u000a      the field of social epidemiology to key questions underpinning mortality\u000d\u000a      and longevity risk which are of interest to the UK actuarial profession.\u000d\u000a      The overarching aims are: to analyse social inequalities in health and\u000d\u000a      mortality risk in older age, between groups and over time; to identify the\u000d\u000a      underlying drivers of longevity change; and to project future trends.\u000d\u000a    The Principal Investigators for this collaboration are Mr Joseph Lu at\u000d\u000a      L&amp;G and at UCL Professor Rosalind Raine. Dr Madhavi Bajekal and Dr\u000d\u000a      Shaun Scholes (both L&amp;G employees and honorary staff at UCL, and based\u000d\u000a      at UCL) are the key researchers.\u000d\u000a    Over the four years to April 2013, we have focused on three streams of\u000d\u000a      work:\u000d\u000a    Firstly, we used a policy model developed by Professor Capewell\u000d\u000a      (Liverpool University) and extended in collaboration with him and his team\u000d\u000a      to examine whether the social gradient in the differential falls\u000d\u000a      in coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality in the UK were mostly due to\u000d\u000a      improved healthcare treatments or to healthier lifestyles. We quantified\u000d\u000a      the relative contributions of seven risk factors and approximately 50\u000d\u000a      medical therapies to the CHD mortality fall from 2000 to 2007 and the\u000d\u000a      variations between socio-economic groups. This research is now complete,\u000d\u000a      and key published papers are listed below [1, 2, 3]. To run this\u000d\u000a      model, we assembled a unique database from sources including population\u000d\u000a      health surveys, GP records, hospital admissions, specialist clinical\u000d\u000a      audits, and mortality statistics &#8212; all of which were uniformly coded at\u000d\u000a      the individual level to a deprivation index based on an individual's\u000d\u000a      postcode of residence. This dataset will continue to be vital in the next\u000d\u000a      phase of research from 2014.\u000d\u000a    Secondly, we compiled deprivation-coded mortality data from the Office of\u000d\u000a      National Statistics (ONS) for each year from 1981 onwards to address key\u000d\u000a      questions relating to long-term historical trends in rates of mortality\u000d\u000a      improvements among people over 50 years old, by age, gender and\u000d\u000a      socio-economic group. Such analyses had not previously been conducted for\u000d\u000a      the UK; the closest is the linked-mortality analysis of participants in\u000d\u000a      the ONS's Longitudinal Study &#8212; a one per cent sample of census records for\u000d\u000a      individuals in England and Wales, linked between successive censuses since\u000d\u000a      1971. However, results from the latter are available only once every\u000d\u000a      decade, and are indicative rather than conclusive due to the small sample\u000d\u000a      sizes at older ages, particularly when segmented by social position, age\u000d\u000a      and gender. Our mortality analyses included the following:\u000d\u000a    a) age, period and cohort effects in rates of mortality improvement for\u000d\u000a      different social groups. The results were presented at the Institute and\u000d\u000a      Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA) and published in the industry's leading\u000d\u000a      peer-reviewed journal, the British Actuarial Journal (BAJ) [4]\u000d\u000a    b) Cause of death decomposition of the differences in life expectancy at\u000d\u000a      age 50 between social groups and over time.

These\u000d\u000a      analyses are in support of the EU Gender Directive, adopted across the UK\u000d\u000a      in December 2012 [6].\u000d\u000a    Thirdly, we have provided epidemiological intelligence and support to\u000d\u000a      L&amp;G. Demographers, epidemiologists and actuaries often approach the\u000d\u000a      same question &#8212; e.g. longevity &#8212; in very different ways resulting in a gap\u000d\u000a      of integrated knowledge across the spectrum. For example: there are\u000d\u000a      numerous studies, replicated across several countries and cohorts, which\u000d\u000a      show that marital status in old age is a strong predictor of longevity.\u000d\u000a      But confusingly, the statistical methods used and effect sizes vary widely\u000d\u000a      between studies. In such instances where good evidence exists, rather than\u000d\u000a      carry out fresh analyses, we evaluated the evidence and converted these\u000d\u000a      into practical `best estimates' suitable for actuaries to use in longevity\u000d\u000a      models, e.g. as a rating factor.\u000d\u000a    To supplement our in-house expertise, we have actively built academic\u000d\u000a      collaborations across multi- disciplinary teams (e.g. with Liverpool\u000d\u000a      University for clinical epidemiology and policy modelling; Leeds\u000d\u000a      University and Max Planck Institute for demographic modelling; CASS for\u000d\u000a      actuarial forecasting).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"22418","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"226074","Name":"Uganda"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"895949","Name":"Zambia"},{"GeoNamesId":"927384","Name":"Malawi"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    HIV-infected infants are at high risk of disease progression and death.\u000a      But initiating them on lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) is\u000a      problematic because:\u000a    \u000a      it is a lifelong commitment\u000a      it costs money\u000a      the drugs can have side effects\u000a      the earlier infants start treatment the more time there is for\u000a        resistance to develop.\u000a    \u000a    Until 2008, national and international guidelines recommended initiation\u000a      of antiretroviral therapy on the basis of a low CD4 percentage or count, a\u000a      high viral load, or the presence of clinical symptoms, whereas the\u000a      treatment of asymptomatic infants with high CD4 values was not mandated.\u000a    The early results of CHER were released at the 4th\u000a      International AIDS Society Conference on Pathogenesis, Treatment and\u000a      Prevention in July 2007. In response to these results, a number of key\u000a      national and international guidelines were changed.\u000a    In February 2008 US national guidelines were changed to recommend\u000a      immediate treatment of HIV-infected infants [a].\u000a    WHO held a meeting in April 2008 to look at the evidence from CHER in\u000a      relation to their guidelines, and launched new interim guidelines in June\u000a      2008, recommending immediate treatment of HIV- infected infants. These\u000a      were then incorporated into the full guidelines when they were revised in\u000a      2010 [b].\u000a    The Paediatric European Network for Treatment of AIDS (PENTA) changed\u000a      their guidelines to recommend immediate treatment of HIV-infected infants\u000a      in November 2008 [c].\u000a    WHO guidelines are very influential for national HIV policy, particularly\u000a      in African countries, where most HIV-positive infants live. A survey of\u000a      national HIV policymakers, carried out in 2008, found that WHO was an\u000a      important and frequent source of information to inform HIV policymaking in\u000a      Africa [d]. Therefore the incorporation of recommendations from\u000a      the CHER trial into WHO policy has had a knock-on effect on national\u000a      guidelines in Africa. Following the changes to WHO guidance, individual\u000a      countries began to follow suit by changing their national guidelines. For\u000a      example, in South Africa the Essential Drug List Committee approved the\u000a      recommendation in November 2008, and it was included in the national\u000a      guidelines issued in December 2010, following the costing study [e].\u000a      The Malawi Ministry of Health updated their guidelines in April 2008 [f],\u000a      and the Uganda Ministry of Health updated their guidelines in June 2009 on\u000a      when to start infants on treatment [g].\u000a    National guidelines are very important determinants of the treatments\u000a      given in practice in low- income settings. In many African settings most\u000a      children are treated by clinical officers rather than doctors. These\u000a      clinical officers have less training than doctors, and therefore use\u000a      national guidelines as the basis of how they treat patients to a much\u000a      greater extent than doctors in high- income countries.\u000a    One paediatrician working in Zambia describes the impact of the trial as\u000a      follows: \"These changes were quickly adapted by many African countries\u000a        including Zambia, a step that enabled many HIV infected children to be\u000a        started early on ART and not only have these children survived but they\u000a        have been able to lead a relatively normal childhood. Currently it is\u000a        estimated that about 43,000 children 0-14 years old are receiving ART in\u000a        Zambia, a 50% increase from the 21,120 in 2009 (WHO, UNAIDS, UNICEF\u000a        Progress Report 2010). The impact of the CHER trial has not only been on\u000a        outcome of children but the findings have also helped push for improved\u000a        laboratory diagnostic services in order to initiate early treatment in\u000a        as many infants and children as possible in Zambia...Deaths from\u000a        HIV\/AIDS have dramatically dropped in infants and children, as most of\u000a        the children are identified early and commenced on treatment. The CHER\u000a        trial results have had a great impact on treatment of HIV infected\u000a        infants and children, subsequently on survival, hospital admissions and\u000a        ultimately cost of treatment and care for HIV infected infants and\u000a        children\" [h].\u000a    As the results have led to changes in guidelines for HIV-infected infants\u000a      worldwide, the research has had a global impact on infants living with HIV\u000a      in both high and low-income settings. It is difficult to say exactly how\u000a      many children have benefited as a result of this research, as the routine\u000a      data collected by most countries does not disaggregate ART coverage\u000a      figures into small enough age- bands. We can, however, extrapolate how\u000a      many lives could potentially be saved based on global figures. Each year\u000a      around 390,000 children are infected with HIV [i]. The vast\u000a      majority of these children were vertically-infected infants. CHER found\u000a      that early ART reduced infant mortality from 16% to 4%. If we assume that\u000a      the WHO guidelines were fully implemented worldwide, the results of this\u000a      trial would lead to around 46,800 lives being saved each year (although\u000a      the number of infected infants will decline with the scale-up of\u000a      Prevention of Mother To Child Transmission programmes).\u000a    The costing study found that early ART for infants had lower costs per\u000a      child to the health system than deferred ART or the strategy that was\u000a      routine care at the time in South Africa ($1,387 vs $2,440 vs $3,008\u000a      respectively) [ref 3, above]. This means that the health system in\u000a      South Africa (and possibly other settings) will benefit through reduced\u000a      costs of treating HIV-infected infants, as they require less\u000a      hospitalisation. In 2011 there were approximately 29,000 new infections in\u000a      children in South Africa. If all these newly-infected infants had been\u000a      treated early, it could save the South African health system as much as 47\u000a      million USD.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    HIV-infected infants are at high risk of disease progression and death.\u000a      Until 2008 guidelines recommended waiting until the infant displayed\u000a      symptoms, or had a weakened immune system before starting treatment. The\u000a      CHER trial found that starting infected infants on antiretroviral therapy\u000a      as early as possible substantially reduced mortality compared with waiting\u000a      until they developed symptoms or their immune system weakened. These\u000a      results led quickly to changes in guidelines for treating HIV-infected\u000a      infants issued by the US, World Health Organisation (WHO), Paediatric\u000a      European Network for Treatment of AIDS (PENTA) and South Africa. These\u000a      revised guidelines, if fully implemented along with early infant\u000a      diagnosis, would reduce the number of infant deaths because of HIV by 76%,\u000a      saving the lives of approximately 46,800 infants globally each year.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Health","Institution":"\u000a    University College London\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"University College London","InstitutionName":"University College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007784}],"Panel":"A         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a[1] Violari A, Cotton MF, Gibb DM, Babiker AG, Steyn J, Madhi SA,\u000a      Jean-Philippe P, McIntyre JA; CHER Study Team.

This recommends that annual physical\u000a      review of these patients should focus on cardiovascular risk factors\u000a      including blood pressure, cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, smoking and\u000a      diabetes. The guideline cites five of our papers as the reason for\u000a      focussing on CVD risk factors in annual reviews for people with\u000a      schizophrenia in national mental health policy. Nazareth was on the expert\u000a      advisory panel of the NICE Schizophrenia guideline group [a].\u000a    Impact on European Guidelines:\u000a    Our work was cited as the research evidence justifying a position\u000a      statement by the European Psychiatric Association (EPA), supported by the\u000a      European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and the European\u000a      Society of Cardiology (ESC) in 2009. Their statement was designed to\u000a      improve the care of patients suffering from severe mental illness. They\u000a      cite two of our papers as the rationale for focusing on CVD risk screening\u000a      in people with SMI. The statement refers in detail to our systematic\u000a      review regarding the relative incidence of CVD risk factors in SMI, as\u000a      well as our research demonstrating excess CVD mortality in young people\u000a      with SMI [b].\u000a    The position statement from the EPA has had further impact both in the UK\u000a      and Australia. The EPA position document is referenced as the rationale\u000a      for specific algorithms to help mental health professionals to deal with\u000a      cardiovascular risk factors in people with SMI [c]. In turn the\u000a      Australian guidelines have recently been adapted and endorsed by the Royal\u000a      College of General Practitioners, Royal College of Psychiatrists, Royal\u000a      College of Nursing, Royal College of Physicians, HQIP, Rethink Mental\u000a      Illness and Diabetes UK to provide guidance in line with the SMI QoF (see\u000a      below) and NICE guidance, which largely originates from the research done\u000a      at UCL [d]. These guidelines have been sent to every GP and\u000a      psychiatrist in the UK.\u000a    Impact on Psychopharmacology guidance:\u000a    The British Association of Psychopharmacologists produces evidence-based\u000a      guidelines for international and national prescribing in mental health,\u000a      aimed at all psychiatrists and other clinicians who prescribe in mental\u000a      health.

Osborn was\u000a      invited to present our research findings to specific workshops run by the\u000a      DH to formulate this strategy [f].\u000a    Once published, the policy was developed into a guide for general\u000a      practitioners by the Centre for Mental Health, in alliance with seven key\u000a      national mental health organisations. These third sector organisations\u000a      (outside the NHS) such as RETHINK cite our mortality work as one of the\u000a      reasons why general practitioners should focus on CVD screening for people\u000a      with mental disorders [g].\u000a    Impact on the Quality Outcomes Framework:\u000a    In 2011, our influence on NICE guidelines led to changes in the national\u000a      GP contract, through the Quality Outcomes Framework (QoF) for people with\u000a      severe mental illnesses [h]. GPs are now remunerated for ensuring\u000a      that people with SMI have had specific cardiovascular risk factors\u000a      measured within the last 15 months. The QoF documents explicitly state\u000a      that their recommendations are in line with the NICE schizophrenia\u000a      guidelines regarding CVD screening and hence include screening for BMI,\u000a      cholesterol, blood pressure and diabetes screening in the outcomes\u000a      framework for SMI (see above). Our research has thus directly impacted on\u000a      the day to day care provided for people with severe mental illnesses in\u000a      general practices across England through NICE and into QoF.\u000a    Impact elsewhere in the UK\u000a    Further, the two most cited of our research papers on this topic were\u000a      used by the Scottish QoF in 2008, recommending that Scottish GPs included\u000a      these cardiovascular measurements in their annual assessments [i].\u000a    These important changes within the NHS are thus leading to a reduction in\u000a      the inequalities of care that occur in people with schizophrenia and\u000a      severe mental illnesses.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Our research has led to major changes in the management of people with\u000a      severe mental illness (SMI) in general practice.

Little was known about the primary care management of\u000a      this population prior to us initiating research work on this topic in the\u000a      1990s. Professor Irwin Nazareth and colleagues (Department of Primary Care\u000a      &amp; Population Health) found that although people with schizophrenia\u000a      were frequent attenders, their management was unstructured with little\u000a      attention given to their physical health, compared to the care offered to\u000a      people with other chronic diseases. We found that one in three people with\u000a      schizophrenia were exclusively managed by their general practitioners with\u000a      no contact with a psychiatrist. Moreover, most people with schizophrenia\u000a      were willing to have their physical and psychological health needs managed\u000a      by their general practitioners [1]. Early evidence from an\u000a      exploratory controlled evaluation suggested beneficial trends from\u000a      structured health care delivered in primary care [2]. Since then,\u000a      we have led on a programme of MRC-funded research to identify and reduce\u000a      cardiovascular disease (CVD) in NHS patients with severe mental disorders.\u000a    Our research demonstrated high relative rates of cardiovascular mortality\u000a      in people with severe mental illnesses when compared to people without\u000a      these disorders. There was a threefold risk of cardiovascular deaths in\u000a      people with schizophrenia between the age of 18-50, and twice the risk in\u000a      people aged 50-75 [5].\u000a    Further research on this topic found an excess rate of abnormal lipids\u000a      (especially low levels of HDL), smoking and diabetes in people with severe\u000a      mental illnesses in general practice compared with healthy controls [4].\u000a      The significantly lower level of HDL in people with schizophrenia was a\u000a      novel finding and had never been previously reported. This work also\u000a      revealed that poor diets and low levels of physical activity were common\u000a      in this group of people and were worthy targets for interventions [6].\u000a      Our research additionally demonstrated that people with mental disorders\u000a      were willing to participate in CVD screening in primary care [3]\u000a      and the importance of this finding was highlighted in a Lancet editorial\u000a      (vol 367; 1469-71).\u000a    We then published a systematic review regarding lipids, diabetes and\u000a      hypertension levels as well as qualitative and quantitative findings to\u000a      facilitate the design of a new nurse-led intervention for cardiovascular\u000a      screening in SMI [7]. This led to a successful phase II trial of\u000a      the intervention [8] subsequently highlighted as a promising\u000a      development for clinical services in a Lancet editorial in 2011 (Lancet\u000a      377; 611).\u000a    Our ongoing research, funded by the Department of Health and NIHR,\u000a      explores inequalities in cancer and CVD screening in people with mental\u000a      illnesses and intellectual disabilities. We are also investigating the\u000a      contribution of antipsychotic medication to cardiovascular risk in these\u000a      people. Furthermore, we are developing and testing CVD risk prediction\u000a      models for people with SMI, and refining and evaluating a an intervention\u000a      delivered over a period of one year within a cluster trial based in\u000a      primary care settings.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"22422","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"933860","Name":"Botswana"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research described above provided an evidence base to continue the\u000a      rollout of ART in sub-Saharan Africa without diverting resources for ART\u000a      to measures of viral load &#8212; a policy which had come under question in\u000a      previous years. It was seen as critical to understand whether the\u000a      consequences of roll out of ART without viral load monitoring were so\u000a      severe (due to concerns over transmission of HIV drug resistance) as to\u000a      mean that introduction of such testing should be prioritised over\u000a      continued ART expansion by ART programmes. Our findings provided support\u000a      for continued roll out in settings where viral load monitoring was not\u000a      available.

Almost all countries in\u000a      sub-Saharan Africa (with the exceptions of South Africa and Botswana) have\u000a      been providing ART without regular viral load monitoring. Point of care\u000a      tests for viral load are now close to coming to market and WHO has started\u000a      to encourage use of viral load testing in patient monitoring as resources\u000a      allow, so long as this does not inhibit roll-out.\u000a    Our publications in 2008 and 2011 were written jointly with colleagues at\u000a      WHO responsible for the public health approach [d], and influenced\u000a      their policy as described &#8212; i.e. to prioritise the continued expansion of\u000a      roll-out of ART over introduction of viral load monitoring, but to\u000a      encourage research and development of implementable viral load measurement\u000a      technology. The two publications are officially approved WHO publications\u000a      and our work has been cited in WHO guidelines. The 2008 WHO progress\u000a      report \"Towards Universal access: Scaling up priority HIV\/AIDS\u000a      interventions in the health sector\" cites our publication from the\u000a      previous year as providing support for WHO's recommendations on scaling up\u000a      ART provision [e]. Furthermore, there were 11 references in total\u000a      to the wider work of the HIV Epidemiology &amp; Biostatistics Group of the\u000a      Research Department of Infection &amp; Population Health in the key WHO\u000a      guideline \"Antiretroviral therapy for HIV infection in adults and\u000a      adolescents.

In order to make this\u000a      feasible, the WHO developed a public health approach, which involved use\u000a      of standard regimens with little requirement for the monitoring that was\u000a      being used at that time in developed country settings. Use of CD4 counts,\u000a      particularly to select who should start ART, was encouraged but measures\u000a      of viral load were very expensive in the context of low resource settings\u000a      (the current fully loaded cost of a viral load test is the cost of around\u000a      8 months of ART for one person) and could not be used in most settings. At\u000a      that time, however, increasing concerns were being expressed that\u000a      widespread delivery of ART without use of viral load monitoring to\u000a      identify people failing ART could lead to widespread development of drug\u000a      resistance, with consequences for both the treated individuals and for the\u000a      population, due to transmission of drug resistant HIV. There was no\u000a      research available to evaluate the likely consequences of the ongoing\u000a      roll-out strategy.\u000a    In previous work done by our group between 2003 and 2007, we had\u000a      developed a stochastic computer simulation model of HIV progression and\u000a      the effect of ART, based on our extensive work on studying HIV in cohort\u000a      studies. The first paper from this model, published in 2007, made\u000a      projections about the HIV population in the UK [1]. As a result of\u000a      concerns about the roll out of ART in low-resource settings, we adapted\u000a      our model to investigate the impact of lack of viral load monitoring on\u000a      outcomes of ART in low resource settings [2] and included a\u000a      transmission component to consider transmitted drug resistance [3].\u000a      This work helped us understand what the consequences of provision of ART\u000a      without viral load monitoring were likely to be, in terms of patient\u000a      survival and transmission of drug resistance. We showed that eventual use\u000a      of viral load monitoring is important, particularly to avoid future\u000a      widespread transmission of drug resistance, and that development of new\u000a      tests which are not dependent on substantial laboratory infrastructure or\u000a      highly trained staff should be a key research and development priority.\u000a      However, we also showed that the impact on mortality of lack of viral load\u000a      monitoring was likely to be modest in the short to medium term, relative\u000a      to the mortality impact of failing to provide more widespread ART. Thus\u000a      the message was to continue the roll-out without re-directing resources to\u000a      viral load measurement but to encourage the development of cheaper tests.\u000a    Continuing our research in this areas, we are currently working with WHO\u000a      on assessing the impact on transmission of HIV drug resistance of starting\u000a      more people on ART earlier, and defining threshold levels of transmitted\u000a      drug resistance beyond which a change in public health policy is required.\u000a      In further work using the model, we are collaborating with GSK Biologicals\u000a      to model potential effects of their vaccines. We collaborate on this\u000a      research with health economist colleagues at the London School of Hygiene\u000a      and Tropical Medicine (Alec Miners) and, more recently, the University of\u000a      York (Paul Revill).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"22423","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    a) Development and on-going review of the UK universal child vision\u000a        screening programme\u000a    Our research findings provided the first robust evidence base for the UK\u000a      National Screening Committee's policy on universal childhood vision\u000a      screening and surveillance. This has led to the revised programme status\u000a      and standards for the Newborn and Infant Physical Examination Programme\u000a      (NIPE) and discontinuation of 9-month and pre-school vision screening\u000a      examinations [a]. More recently we have completed a commissioned\u000a      systematic review for the National Screening Committee (NSC) which is\u000a      currently forming the basis of their policy review of the content and\u000a      timing of the 4-5 year\/school entry vision screening examination [b].\u000a    b) Improving the quality of paediatric ophthalmology services\u000a    Our work has underpinned the development of new quality standards for\u000a      paediatric ophthalmology services. A number of our publications are cited\u000a      in the Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth) standing report,\u000a      Ophthalmic Services for Children (Updated August 2012) for which Rahi\u000a      acted also acted as reviewer. Our work provides epidemiological background\u000a      and supports recommendations on the involvement of parents, on the early\u000a      detection of ophthalmic disorders and on certifying children as\u000a      sight-impaired [c]. Our study of the needs and experiences of\u000a      families of newly diagnosed visually impaired children informed the\u000a      successful implementation of a novel regional-level `key worker' service,\u000a      the Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) Ophthalmology Community Link Team,\u000a      which provides information, support and liaison to families of our\u000a      patients [d]. This was taken as a model of key worker provision\u000a      and cited in the above document.\u000a    Following on from this, Rahi helped to develop Quality Standards for\u000a      Paediatric Ophthalmology on behalf of RCOphth [e]. These quality\u000a      standards are now in regular use in clinical practice. For example, this\u000a      can be seen on the GOSH website, which describes how it has measured its\u000a      services against the Quality Indicator Tool that we helped to develop [f].\u000a    In 2012, Rahi contributed to the first Atlas of Variation in Healthcare\u000a      for Children and Young people which was produced by the Department of\u000a      Health's QIPP (Quality, Innovation, Productivity and Prevention) programme.\u000a      This document presented variations across the breadth of child health\u000a      services provided by NHS England together for the first time to allow\u000a      clinicians, commissioners and service users to identify priority areas for\u000a      improving outcome, quality and productivity. Map 7 highlighted variation\u000a      in the proportion of eligible premature babies tested for retinopathy of\u000a      prematurity (ROP) within the recommended timeframe, and made\u000a      recommendations on improving services [g].\u000a    c) Improving the management of congenital cataract\u000a    Congenital cataract is the most common surgically treatable cause of\u000a      childhood visual impairment worldwide. Our studies on congenital cataract\u000a      have been conducted through the British Congenital Cataract Interest\u000a      Group, a network comprising over 150 ophthalmologists which we established\u000a      in 1995. This has led to timely implementation of findings to improve\u000a      clinical practices and provide improved outcomes information for parents\u000a      of affected infants [h]. For example, during our ongoing research\u000a      on intraocular lens implantation, we have used this network to spread use\u000a      of the data collection forms that we developed as part of the study. These\u000a      are now more widely used as routine clinical pro-formas for patient case\u000a      notes, leading to standardisation of key aspects of management nationally.\u000a      GOSH, for example, report that:\u000a    \"The per-operative data entry proforma currently used by our surgeons\u000a        at GOSH was developed as part of the IOLu2 [Intraocular lens under 2]\u000a        study by Dr Lola Solebo in 2009... Not only is [it] still used and can\u000a        be sampled for future studies it is now used by all the other surgeons\u000a        in the team... The team has found it promotes good record keeping when\u000a        performing childhood cataract surgery... It has also be shared with many\u000a        other centres through our lectures and when we have visiting\u000a        ophthalmologists. The proforma helps the department to enter clinical\u000a        data in an efficient, standardised and thorough manner\" [i].\u000a    d) Improving patient involvement in research\u000a    Our research over the years has directly involved service users and\u000a      patient groups. For example, our systematic review of Patient-reported\u000a      outcome measures (PROMs) in paediatric ophthalmology involved a service\u000a      user (visually impaired herself and parent of a visually impaired child)\u000a      as a co-investigator [j].\u000a    In the first stage of our work to develop our `quality of life'\u000a      instrument, we worked with the pupils in the Visual Impairment unit at\u000a      Exhall Grange, a specialist school in Coventry that caters for children\u000a      and young people with a range of disabilities. Specifically, we conducted\u000a      focus groups and interviews with these pupils to help us identify the\u000a      content for our instrument. In the focus groups we elicited the children's\u000a      thoughts and views about the impact of living with visual disability. The\u000a      mobility officer working with these children, who helped facilitate the\u000a      focus group discussion, was struck by how much the children opened up\u000a      about their lives and felt there was a broader benefit of this context.\u000a      Subsequently, he reported to us that as a result of this experience, the\u000a      Visual Impairment unit initiated a `forum for the visually impaired\u000a      pupils' where the pupils meet weekly or monthly for an `around the table'\u000a      discussion of any issues that they might have (modelled on their\u000a      participation in our research). Finally, the school was commended by\u000a      Ofsted for this initiative [k].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Our research into the epidemiology of childhood visual impairment has\u000a      transformed understanding of the epidemiology, outcomes and impact of\u000a      childhood visual impairment in the UK. As a result, changes have been made\u000a      to the Newborn and Infant Physical Examination Programme and the National\u000a      Vision Screening Programme. Our work has underpinned the development of\u000a      new quality standards for paediatric ophthalmology services issued by the\u000a      Royal College of Ophthalmologists.

Most are affected from birth and will\u000a      experience a significant lifelong burden of adverse impact on their\u000a      development, education, social and emotional wellbeing, and curtailed\u000a      occupational and social prospects, with high attendant economic costs for\u000a      affected individuals, their families and society. At the MRC Centre of\u000a      Epidemiology for Child Health, we have established an integrated and\u000a      innovative programme on childhood visual impairment that encompasses\u000a      classical, lifecourse, and genetic epidemiology and health services\u000a      research, led by Professor Jugnoo Rahi. Our research has transformed\u000a      understanding of the epidemiology, outcomes and impact of childhood visual\u000a      impairment in the UK and established a series of novel study-specific\u000a      clinical networks (most with 150+ consultant ophthalmologists) for rapid\u000a      implementation of findings into practice and policy.\u000a    We have undertaken a series of national studies of all-cause visual\u000a      impairment and of all of the most common (globally) treatable childhood\u000a      ophthalmic disorders i.e. amblyopia, congenital cataract, paediatric\u000a      glaucoma, ocular anomalies and hereditary retinal disorders. These have\u000a      provided the first population-based data on the frequency, distribution\u000a      and natural history of these individual disorders together with unbiased\u000a      assessment of effectiveness and safety of treatments.\u000a    We have shown for the first time that there are major variations in risk\u000a      of visual impairment\/eye disorders e.g. by socio-economic status,\u000a      ethnicity, birthweight and other early life factors and demonstrated a\u000a      growing and increasingly complex population at risk [1, 2].\u000a    Our longstanding programme on amblyopia, the most common paediatric eye\u000a      condition, has shown that contrary to long-held clinical opinion, there is\u000a      remarkably limited disutility per se [3] but that risk of\u000a      blindness and its attendant socio-economic consequences occurring through\u000a      loss of sight in the non-amblyopic eye is substantial [4].\u000a    Our series of studies on congenital cataract have provided for the first\u000a      time internationally accepted population based `benchmark' outcomes data\u000a      on visual function, quality of life, and complications [5] and\u000a      identified the risk factors associated with poor outcomes against a\u000a      backdrop of evolving surgical approaches. Most recently we have completed\u000a      the first national study of intra-ocular lens implantation in infants, the\u000a      key surgical innovation in this field, assessing early visual outcomes\u000a      with this new approach compared to established surgical treatment and\u000a      identifying the point of `equipoise' for clinicians in their choice of\u000a      surgical approach. This study established a unique national cohort which\u000a      is providing important early insights into the impact of this new\u000a      intervention on visual outcomes and iatrogenic complications. In due\u000a      course it will provide unique long-term outcomes data.\u000a    Our inter-disciplinary programme to understand the impact of visual\u000a      impairment has combined health services research and social sciences,\u000a      resulting in innovative child-centred methodology and a novel patient\/NHS\u000a      user research partnerships which have underpinned our development of the\u000a      first child-reported measures of quality of life and of functional vision\u000a      [6], which can also be used routinely in the NHS as a tool for\u000a      assessing quality and as outcome measures in clinical trials of novel\u000a      therapies.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23145","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The major impact of the research has been the implementation of Flexible\u000d\u000a      Sigmoidoscopy as a\u000d\u000a      single examination at age 55 as part of the National Bowel Cancer\u000d\u000a      Screening Programme.\u000d\u000a      Following the publication of the trial outcomes in the Lancet in April\u000d\u000a      2010, and the results of the\u000d\u000a      successful pilot programme in the Journal of Medical Screening in June\u000d\u000a      2010, the Prime Minister\u000d\u000a      David Cameron announced in October 2010 that once-only FS screening would\u000d\u000a      be included in the\u000d\u000a      NHS National Bowel Cancer Screening Programme. &#163;60m was pledged over the\u000d\u000a      next four years to\u000d\u000a      introduce this latest cancer screening technology, with estimates that\u000d\u000a      flexible sigmoidoscopy could\u000d\u000a      save 3,000 lives a year [a]. Then Health Secretary, Andrew Lansley\u000d\u000a      announced that pilot schemes\u000d\u000a      for the new screening programme would begin in spring 2011 [b],\u000d\u000a      subject to approval by the UK\u000d\u000a      National Screening Committee [c].\u000d\u000a    The existing NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme is based on biennial\u000d\u000a      faecal occult blood\u000d\u000a      testing using the guaiac-based test (gFOBT), with an immunochemical test\u000d\u000a      (iFOBT) being piloted\u000d\u000a      in 2014. An `options appraisal' of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening\u000d\u000a      modalities commissioned by\u000d\u000a      the NHS Cancer Screening Programme in 2004 from SCHARR (University of\u000d\u000a      Sheffield School of\u000d\u000a      Health and Related Research) had used the baseline data from the FS trial,\u000d\u000a      and concluded that FS\u000d\u000a      screening was likely to be highly cost-effective compared with other\u000d\u000a      methods because it reduced\u000d\u000a      incidence of CRC and therefore the costs of the programme would be likely\u000d\u000a      to be offset by a\u000d\u000a      substantial reduction in the costs of treatment. SCHARR repeated the\u000d\u000a      analysis in 2012 using the\u000d\u000a      full FS trial outcome data and concluded that: `For a strategy of\u000d\u000a        one-off FS screening, the optimal\u000d\u000a        effectiveness (QALYS) is achieved with a one-off FS screen in the age\u000d\u000a        range 55-60. The most\u000d\u000a        cost-effective strategy was FS at age 55 followed by biennial iFOBT\u000d\u000a        screening for ages 56-74,\u000d\u000a        irrespective of whether the comparator was the current screening\u000d\u000a        programme of biennial gFOBT\u000d\u000a        60-74 or no screening. This strategy was associated with the greatest\u000d\u000a        net monetary benefit and\u000d\u000a        also the greatest reduction in CRC incidence, CRC mortality and CRC\u000d\u000a        treatment costs'. The report\u000d\u000a      also concluded that `it may be cost-effective to spend considerable\u000d\u000a        resources on increasing\u000d\u000a        screening awareness' which has been a parallel focus of our\u000d\u000a      research, with a particular emphasis\u000d\u000a      on promoting awareness in order to reduce socioeconomic disparities in CRC\u000d\u000a      screening uptake\u000d\u000a      [d]. Professor Wardle now has programme grant funding from NIHR\u000d\u000a      trial for a trial (ASCEND) of\u000d\u000a      methods to reduce socioeconomic disparities in CRC screening uptake as\u000d\u000a      Co-PI with Professor\u000d\u000a      Rosalind Raine (also UCL).\u000d\u000a    In January 2011, the Department of Health's document Improving\u000d\u000a        Outcomes: A Strategy for\u000d\u000a        Cancer set out the plans for FS screening [e].\u000d\u000a      Implementation of the FS programme began in early\u000d\u000a      2011, with three `pathfinder' screening sites set up to finalise the\u000d\u000a      invitation and organisation\u000d\u000a      procedures [f]. One of the centres explored a novel method of\u000d\u000a      invitation, but the conclusion from\u000d\u000a      the 4,022 invitations across the three sites was that the invitation\u000d\u000a      system Wardle and her team had\u000d\u000a      developed in the FS Trial and applied in the Demonstration Pilot\u000d\u000a      (comprising a `flyer' giving brief\u000d\u000a      information about the programme, followed by a dated and timed invitation\u000d\u000a      that could be confirmed,\u000d\u000a      changed or cancelled, followed by a self-administered enema with detailed\u000d\u000a      information about the\u000d\u000a      test), was likely to be most successful.\u000d\u000a    Plans are now finalised for national implementation, and six sites began\u000d\u000a      screening between March\u000d\u000a      and July 2013 to finalise invitation procedures and patient information\u000d\u000a      materials [g]. Professor\u000d\u000a      Wardle's group has been commissioned to carry out real-time audits of\u000d\u000a      uptake, patient-reported\u000d\u000a      outcomes 24 hours after the test, and patient satisfaction at 12 weeks\u000d\u000a      when any follow-up\u000d\u000a      procedures should be completed, in the starter sites. This will allow\u000d\u000a      rapid identification of any\u000d\u000a      problems and make it possible to implement small modifications to optimise\u000d\u000a      procedures in advance\u000d\u000a      of the national rollout.\u000d\u000a    To the end of July, around 2,220 people had received FS screening between\u000d\u000a      the pathfinder and\u000d\u000a      starter sites. Data from the FS trial indicated that one colorectal cancer\u000d\u000a      diagnosis is prevented for\u000d\u000a      each 191 people screened. So even with the small number of people screened\u000d\u000a      so far, it is likely\u000d\u000a      that 11 of these terrible diagnoses have been prevented [h].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Our evidence that a single flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) dramatically\u000d\u000a      reduced bowel cancer\u000d\u000a      mortality and incidence, combined with evidence of high public\u000d\u000a      acceptability in our pilot\u000d\u000a      programme, led the Prime Minister to announce in late 2010 that once-only\u000d\u000a      FS would be included\u000d\u000a      in the UK National Bowel Cancer Screening Programme.

Professor\u000d\u000a      Jane Wardle from the\u000d\u000a      Department of Epidemiology and Public Health at UCL has a long-standing\u000d\u000a      collaboration with\u000d\u000a      Professor Wendy Atkin (Imperial) to evaluate the potential of flexible\u000d\u000a      sigmoidoscopy (FS) to\u000d\u000a      prevent CRC through finding and removing pre-cancerous adenomas.\u000d\u000a    The natural history of CRC suggested that a single FS examination in the\u000d\u000a      age range when\u000d\u000a      adenomas are likely to have developed, but before CRC incidence starts to\u000d\u000a      rise, could provide\u000d\u000a      protection for 10-25 years. With Professor Atkin and colleagues, Professor\u000d\u000a      Jane Wardle\u000d\u000a      developed and piloted screening and pathology protocols, quality control\u000d\u000a      procedures, patient\u000d\u000a      management systems, patient information materials, and invitation\u000d\u000a      protocols, which included\u000d\u000a      pioneering the use of a mailed, self-administered enema to be carried out\u000d\u000a      at home before the test.\u000d\u000a      The trial team then carried out pilot studies of FS screening in\u000d\u000a      asymptomatic 55-64 year olds in\u000d\u000a      Welwyn Garden City and Leicester. The results demonstrated that FS could\u000d\u000a      be safe and\u000d\u000a      acceptable, and the yield of neoplasia suggested there would be a\u000d\u000a      significant impact on CRC\u000d\u000a      incidence [1].\u000d\u000a    The success of the pilot studies led onto the main randomised controlled\u000d\u000a      trial in which almost\u000d\u000a      400,000 adults around the UK were randomised either to be invited for FS\u000d\u000a      screening at their local\u000d\u000a      hospital or to usual care, using a novel, two-stage invitation procedure\u000d\u000a      which allowed us to make a\u000d\u000a      robust estimate of efficacy [2]. Baseline findings revealed high\u000d\u000a      rates of pre-malignant adenomas,\u000d\u000a      most of which were low risk and could be safely removed during FS. Rates\u000d\u000a      of referral for\u000d\u000a      colonoscopy were manageable (around 5%), with evidence that the risk of\u000d\u000a      harm from the test was\u000d\u000a      low [3]. Professor Wardle was responsible for the psychosocial\u000d\u000a      elements of the trial and showed\u000d\u000a      that uptake and acceptability were high in both men and women, and the\u000d\u000a      psychological impact was\u000d\u000a      favourable [4]. After 11 years of follow-up for cancer\u000d\u000a      registrations and deaths, intention-to-treat\u000d\u000a      analyses showed a 23% reduction in incidence and a 31% reduction in\u000d\u000a      mortality, with per-protocol\u000d\u000a      analyses (attenders vs controls) showing a 33% reduction in incidence and\u000d\u000a      43% reduction in\u000d\u000a      mortality [5]. Incidence of distal colorectal cancer (rectum and\u000d\u000a      sigmoid colon), the secondary\u000d\u000a      outcome of the trial, was reduced by half. These were the best results\u000d\u000a      ever reported in a cancer\u000d\u000a      prevention trial, and the progressive divergence in incidence and\u000d\u000a      mortality curves between\u000d\u000a      screened and control groups indicates prolonged and continuing protection.\u000d\u000a    In the meantime, Professor Wardle had been commissioned by the National\u000d\u000a      Cancer Screening\u000d\u000a      Committee to set up a `demonstration' study of an FS screening programme\u000d\u000a      in a socio-economically\u000d\u000a      and ethnically diverse area of North London, with FS carried out by nurse\u000d\u000a      endoscopists. In collaboration with Professor Atkin, she modified the\u000d\u000a      trial procedures for a\u000d\u000a      population programme, and concurrently evaluated a range of methods for\u000d\u000a      promoting uptake. An\u000d\u000a      uptake rate of 55% was achieved in the pilot programme [6], and\u000d\u000a      patient-reported outcomes were\u000d\u000a      almost unanimously positive [7]. The Prime Minister announced in\u000d\u000a      2010 that FS screening would\u000d\u000a      be added to the National Bowel Cancer Screening Programme. Starting in\u000d\u000a      March 2013, a single\u000d\u000a      FS screening test will be offered to all adults aged 55. Professor\u000d\u000a      Wardle's group have been\u000d\u000a      commissioned to monitor uptake and patient-reported outcomes using methods\u000d\u000a      developed in the\u000d\u000a      trial. She is also collaborating in the continued follow-up of the FS\u000d\u000a      trial participants and they expect\u000d\u000a      to publish 15 year outcomes in 2014.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"23146","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Initial results were based on 2,688 patients, from ten randomised trials,\u000d\u000a      and updated to include 3,005 patients, from 11 trials, including the MRC\u000d\u000a      Clinical Trials Unit BA06 trial.

Worldwide there are estimated to be about 336,000 new cases per\u000d\u000a      year, of which about one third are likely to be invasive or metastatic\u000d\u000a      disease.\u000d\u000a    Invasive bladder cancer, where the tumour has spread into (or invaded)\u000d\u000a      the muscle layer of the bladder, is likely to spread to other parts of the\u000d\u000a      body. At the time this project was initiated, standard treatment for\u000d\u000a      invasive bladder cancer was surgery to remove the tumour, and part or all\u000d\u000a      of the bladder and nearby lymph nodes and other tissues. Alternatively,\u000d\u000a      radiotherapy was also given instead of or in addition to surgery. However,\u000d\u000a      giving (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy before surgery and\/or radiotherapy\u000d\u000a      offered the potential to reduce tumour size and control cancer spread.\u000d\u000a      Furthermore, if chemotherapy is given before these potentially\u000d\u000a      debilitating treatments, it might be better tolerated than chemotherapy\u000d\u000a      given after them, so that patients are more likely to comply with their\u000d\u000a      chemotherapy treatment, allowing higher doses of drug to be administered.\u000d\u000a      However, most randomised trials investigating the use of neoadjuvant\u000d\u000a      chemotherapy were modestly sized and inconclusive about its effects,\u000d\u000a      although results of the largest trial, the MRC Clinical Trials Unit BA06\u000d\u000a      trial looked encouraging. Subsequent systematic reviews and meta-analyses\u000d\u000a      based on aggregate or summary data from publications of these trials were\u000d\u000a      limited by the availability and quality of data and were similarly\u000d\u000a      inconclusive.\u000d\u000a    We therefore initiated a systematic review and meta-analysis of\u000d\u000a      individual patient data (IPD).

The resulting policy document, ECDC Guidance on\u000d\u000a      Chlamydia Control in Europe 2009 [a], states that the guidance was\u000d\u000a      developed by a technical expert group using the evidence gathered in the\u000d\u000a      EU report \"Review of chlamydia control activities in EU countries\" [b]\u000d\u000a      and systematic review of the effectiveness of chlamydia screening [6,\u000d\u000a        above]. It provides guidance to health policy makers in the EU about\u000d\u000a      national strategies for chlamydia control.\u000d\u000a    The systematic review of chlamydia screening was commissioned by NICE to\u000d\u000a      inform its guidance [c]. Our findings indicated that there was a\u000d\u000a      lack of evidence from randomised trials to show the effectiveness of\u000d\u000a      chlamydia screening and the final NICE Guidance made no recommendations\u000d\u000a      about chlamydia screening except for more robust research to examine the\u000d\u000a      effectiveness of different screening approaches [d]. This\u000d\u000a      recommendation contributed to decisions to fund two large randomised\u000d\u000a      trials &#8212; one in the Netherlands of a register based screening programme\u000d\u000a      and one in Australia of an opportunistic screening programme. The research\u000d\u000a      in the Netherlands concluded \"There was no statistical evidence of an\u000d\u000a        impact on chlamydia positivity rates or estimated population prevalence\u000d\u000a        from the Chlamydia Screening Implementation programme after three years\u000d\u000a        at the participation levels obtained. The current evidence does not\u000d\u000a        support a national roll out of this register based chlamydia screening\u000d\u000a        programme\" [e]. The systematic review had a persistent\u000d\u000a      influence on development of chlamydia screening policy nationally and\u000d\u000a      internationally.\u000d\u000a    Our research into chlamydia screening had wide impact, as it contributed,\u000d\u000a      through informed and constructive criticism, to public debate about the\u000d\u000a      National Chlamydia Screening Programme (NCSP) in England and its future\u000d\u000a      direction. Stephenson presented insights gained from the research to the\u000d\u000a      annual NCSP meeting (2007) and to the Independent Advisory Group at the\u000d\u000a      House of Lords (2008) [f]. She was among the experts who gave\u000d\u000a      evidence at interview to the National Audit Office for their report on\u000d\u000a      value for money of the NCSP (NAO 2009). She highlighted that since the\u000d\u000a      NCSP did not use unique identifiers or collect any clinical outcome data,\u000d\u000a      it was not able to evaluate its aims. The NAO report cites both our review\u000d\u000a      of chlamydia control activities in EU countries and the subsequent ECDC\u000d\u000a      Guidance on chlamydia control in Europe [g]. It concluded that the\u000d\u000a      delivery of the NCSP had not demonstrated value for money. In accordance\u000d\u000a      with our research findings, it stated that \"due to uncertainties in the\u000d\u000a        scientific evidence on chlamydia, the Department does not know how often\u000d\u000a        infection leads to serious health problems and hence whether it is\u000d\u000a        cost-effective to invest so much public money in tackling this problem.\"\u000a      The NAO Report was swiftly followed by a highly critical report from the\u000d\u000a      Public Accounts Committee (2009-2010) [h]. In response to this\u000d\u000a      criticism, the NCSP focused on chlamydia testing in sexual health services\u000d\u000a      and primary care and has ceased screening in low risk groups that\u000d\u000a      identifies fewer positive cases [i]. These and other\u000d\u000a      organisational changes are expected to substantially improve value for\u000d\u000a      money. Between 2003 and 2009, c.&#163;100m was spent delivering the programme [h]\u000d\u000a      and cost savings on reconfiguration are expected to be considerable: \"The\u000a        average cost per chlamydia screening episode (including follow up of\u000d\u000a        positive clients, overheads and local coordination) was found to be\u000d\u000a        &#163;45... An estimated cost of &#163;33 per screening episode should be\u000d\u000a        achievable, as screening volumes increase, chlamydia screening is better\u000d\u000a        integrated in all community sexual health pathways, sexual health\u000d\u000a        networks develop and regions move to collaborative procurement\" [j].\u000d\u000a    While mathematical models tend to predict that screening will reduce the\u000d\u000a      prevalence of infection, there is currently no empirical evidence from the\u000d\u000a      NCSP to demonstrate a fall in prevalence. The latest (April 2013) update\u000d\u000a      on the National Chlamydia Screening Programme acknowledges the gaps in\u000d\u000a      current knowledge that our research highlighted and describes a new policy\u000d\u000a      of re-focusing chlamydia testing within health services, moving away from\u000d\u000a      population-based screening with coverage targets [k].\u000d\u000a    Reflecting on changes in chlamydia screening policy, Stephenson was\u000d\u000a      invited to present a plenary debate at the world congress of sexually\u000d\u000a      transmitted infections (Vienna, July 2013) on whether to abandon\u000d\u000a      population based chlamydia screening of asymptomatic young women [l].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research by Professor Judith Stephenson and colleagues at the UCL\u000d\u000a      Institute of Women's Health into the effectiveness of chlamydia screening\u000d\u000a      has led to guidance to health policy makers in the EU about national\u000d\u000a      strategies for chlamydia control, and has influenced NICE guidelines on\u000d\u000a      the subject.

We then examined the feasibility of patients taking their\u000d\u000a      own samples (vaginal swabs) in a sexual health clinic compared with\u000d\u000a      clinicians taking cervical samples and showed that patient-taken samples\u000d\u000a      were acceptable to women and appropriately sensitive for the new molecular\u000d\u000a      diagnostics [2]. We went on to show the feasibility of women and\u000d\u000a      men taking their own samples outside the clinic setting in response to a\u000d\u000a      screening invitation sent to their home address and posting the samples to\u000d\u000a      a laboratory for chlamydia testing [3]. Together, these three\u000d\u000a      studies, in addition to baseline prevalence studies from Natsal [see\u000d\u000a        case study UCL02-JOH] were instrumental to the\u000d\u000a      rapid expansion and uptake of chlamydia testing in England. At the same\u000d\u000a      time, we made a strong case, based on review of the limited evidence base,\u000d\u000a      for the cost-effectiveness of chlamydia screening to be evaluated through\u000d\u000a      randomised trials before proceeding with implementation of a national\u000d\u000a      screening programme [4].\u000d\u000a    A systematic survey of chlamydia control activities in 29 European\u000d\u000a      countries was carried out 2006-2008, funded by the European Centre for\u000d\u000a      Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC). Stephenson collaborated with\u000d\u000a      Professor Nicola Low (PI, Bern University) on designing the survey and led\u000d\u000a      the work in the UK, including investigation of the National Chlamydia\u000d\u000a      Screening Programme (NCSP) as a case study. The survey showed wide\u000d\u000a      variation in the organisation of chlamydia control, with almost half of\u000d\u000a      the countries reporting no organised activity and national control\u000d\u000a      programmes in two countries. We outlined four levels for chlamydia control\u000d\u000a      programmes: Level A primary prevention, Level B case management, Level C\u000d\u000a      opportunistic testing, Level D screening programme and recommended a\u000d\u000a      step-by-step approach to ensure that accurate STI prevention and patient\u000d\u000a      management are in place before complex interventions such as screening are\u000d\u000a      considered, particularly as evidence for the impact of level C and D\u000d\u000a      programmes is lacking [5].\u000d\u000a    The early research described above sparked considerable debate and in\u000d\u000a      2006, Low's team and Stephenson were commissioned by NICE to carry out a\u000d\u000a      review of the effectiveness of chlamydia screening [6].

Maintaining some sort of legacy structure,\u000d\u000a      that could be activated rapidly in the event of a new pandemic, should be\u000d\u000a      a priority\" (see reference 1 below).\u000d\u000a    b) Regarding the NIHR funded `emergency' influenza studies, these were\u000d\u000a      commissioned and awarded as part of the UK Government's R&amp;D response\u000d\u000a      to pandemic influenza, and all three were published rapidly in Health\u000d\u000a      Technology Assessment, in line with other NIHR funded work. The `MummyFlu'\u000d\u000a      project delivered critical data that demonstrated that 2009 pandemic\u000d\u000a      vaccines administered to pregnant women in the UK were highly likely to\u000d\u000a      protect newborns via transplacental transfer of passive immunity. This\u000d\u000a      work has contributed towards the UK's decision to adopt a policy of\u000d\u000a      influenza vaccination for pregnant women from Autumn 2010 onwards.\u000d\u000a      Similarly the work to evaluate the two pandemic vaccines used in adults in\u000d\u000a      the UK during 2009 provided rapid feedback to the UK Government that one\u000d\u000a      (adjuvanted with AS03) was in fact considerably more immunogenic than the\u000d\u000a      other. This work helped inform the UK's decision to target children with\u000d\u000a      the AS03 adjuvanted vaccine. (see reference 2)\u000d\u000a    c) The HPIRGs evaluation work for the WHO Regional Office for Europe was\u000d\u000a      the largest piece of post-pandemic evaluative work undertaken by WHO\u000d\u000a      Europe and led to a consultation workshop in Copenhagen in Autumn 2010,\u000d\u000a      and a formal WHO report (see Section 5). The Director of WHO Europe wrote\u000d\u000a      (Foreword): \"A principal value of this report is that it applies a\u000d\u000a      standard framework to highlight essential cross-cutting elements of\u000d\u000a      successful pandemic preparedness activities. Moreover, it takes an\u000d\u000a      objective approach to highlight not only the essential elements of\u000d\u000a      successful activities but also the areas on which the pandemic experience\u000d\u000a      suggests future planning must place greater emphasis...Member States, by\u000d\u000a      sharing the experiences gained and lessons learnt throughout the process,\u000d\u000a      have shaped the recommendations in this report, which we at WHO believe is\u000d\u000a      extremely useful for all countries and WHO alike, as we review our\u000d\u000a      pandemic plans\". The findings of our work have been incorporated into a\u000d\u000a      new draft Pandemic preparedness planning guide for Member States of the\u000d\u000a      WHO European Region and the European Union (affecting 900 million\u000d\u000a      citizens) which were published in late 2012. (see references 3 and 4)\u000d\u000a    d) The HPIRG's research work for WHO Headquarters in Geneva has comprised\u000d\u000a      of individual (unpaid) consultancy and expert advice as well as four major\u000d\u000a      systematic reviews and meta- analyses on the subject of influenza\u000d\u000a      vaccination in immunocompromised subjects and vaccination of healthcare\u000d\u000a      workers to protect patients. The WHO was so satisfied with the outputs of\u000d\u000a      this work, it wrote \"these reviews have been of fundamental importance in\u000d\u000a      supporting WHO's recommendations.....the impact of this work is\u000d\u000a      significant in terms of the change in policy, which has reduced the\u000d\u000a      economic impact on Member States for pandemic preparedness...\" (see\u000d\u000a      references 5, 6, 7 and 8).\u000d\u000a    e) The recently funded work on influenza transmission (awarded October\u000d\u000a      2011), results from sustained efforts to develop this area. In terms of\u000d\u000a      the lack of current understanding about modes of transmission of\u000d\u000a      influenza, this knowledge gap has been identified by the US CDC, the UK\u000d\u000a      Government, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC),\u000d\u000a      the WHO Global Influenza Research Agenda and the Institutes of Medicine as\u000d\u000a      being a high priority unmet need for influenza. The findings will be\u000d\u000a      applicable in every nation of the world in the event of a future pandemic,\u000d\u000a      emphasising the global importance attached to this work.

Our work has contributed to these falls, thus helping to\u000a      prevent thousands of cases of\u000a      lifelong addiction to, and premature death from, smoking. Examples of\u000a      impact include:\u000a    Smoke-free policy and passive smoking: Our report on passive\u000a      smoking and children generated\u000a      widespread media coverage and calls by NGOs (including British Medical\u000a      Association, British Lung\u000a      Foundation, Action Cancer (Northern Ireland)) for wider restrictions on\u000a      smoking in the presence of\u000a      children, particularly in cars; a 2011 All Party Parliamentary Group\u000a      hearing on smoking in private\u000a      vehicles chaired by Steven Williams MP [5.1]); a private member's bill\u000a      calling for legislation to\u000a      prohibit smoking in cars in Northern Ireland (http:\/\/www.niassembly.gov.uk\/Assembly-Business\/Official-Report\/Reports-11-12\/14-November-2011\/#4)\u000a      and the Smoke-free Private\u000a      Vehicles Bill [HL] 2012-13 in the House of Lords. Britton briefed the\u000a      Secretary of State for Health\u000a      (Hunt) and Public Health Minister (Soubry) personally on passive smoking\u000a      and plain packaging on\u000a      21.11.12.\u000a    Point of sale legislation: McNeill's work on point of sale\u000a      legislation in Ireland, presented in the\u000a      House of Commons and followed by a personal telephone conversation with\u000a      the Secretary of State\u000a      for Health (Lansley), proved crucial to the retention of 2010 Health Act\u000a      point of sale legislation in\u000a      the 2011 Coalition Government's Tobacco Control Plan for England\u000a      [5.2].\u000a    Plain packaging: Our advocacy, with others, was crucial to the\u000a      inclusion of a commitment to\u000a      consider plain packaging in the Tobacco Control Plan for England\u000a      [5.2], and the systematic\u000a      evidence review (AM) a key driver of the formal consultation in 2012.\u000a    Smoking cessation and prevention: Our research in hospital\u000a      patients, adolescents, pregnant\u000a      women and people with mental disorders has fed directly into several NICE\u000a      guidelines over the\u000a      past decade. Britton was a member of the NICE PDG which produced guidance\u000a      on smoking\u000a      cessation in community settings in 2008 (www.nice.org.uk\/PH010).\u000a      Coleman provided expert\u000a      evidence reviews for 2010 NICE guidance on smoking cessation in pregnancy\u000a      and after childbirth\u000a      (http:\/\/guidance.nice.org.uk\/PH26).\u000a      Britton chaired the PDG (Ratschen and Murray members)\u000a      producing guidance on smoking cessation in all NHS acute, maternity and\u000a      mental health\u000a      secondary care settings (consultation draft published 5.4.13 [5.3]; final\u000a      guidance due 27.11.13),\u000a      with Ratschen, Murray, Leonardi-Bee and Szatkowski providing expert\u000a      reviews, and in which our\u000a      work in acute and mental health hospital cessation service models, and\u000a      clinical trials, were pivotal.\u000a      Szatkowski was part of the NICE Advisory Group which produced the 2013\u000a      Evidence Update on\u000a      school-based interventions to prevent the uptake of smoking among children\u000a      and young people\u000a      (http:\/\/guidance.nice.org.uk\/PH23).\u000a    Harm reduction: Our work, particularly the RCP harm reduction\u000a      report, has led to the inclusion of\u000a      harm reduction strategies in a number of government policies, including\u000a      the 2010 and 2011\u000a      Department of Health tobacco control strategies [5.2, 5.4], and encouraged\u000a      major industries to\u000a      enter the alternative nicotine market. Representations by Britton and\u000a      others to the Medicines and\u000a      Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) led to the establishment of\u000a      and our involvement\u000a      in an Expert Committee on Nicotine Containing Products [5.5], leading to a\u000a      substantive review of\u000a      MHRA licensing policy on nicotine products and an announcement of\u000a      permissive licensing for\u000a      nicotine-containing products in June 2013 [5.6]. The key change, a switch\u000a      from using placebo as\u000a      the safety comparator for nicotine products to the pragmatic likelihood of\u000a      continued smoking, has\u000a      opened the door to the development and use of alternative nicotine\u000a      products (e.g. electronic\u000a      cigarettes) as long-term substitutes for smoking. In 2008 Britton met with\u000a      the Director of NICE to\u000a      make the case for harm reduction as a public health strategy. This\u000a      initiated a NICE Citizens\u000a      Council on harm reduction in 2009 [5.7], and a NICE PDG on tobacco harm\u000a      reduction (Britton and\u000a      McNeill members) which produced guidance (June 2013) integrating harm\u000a      reduction into NHS\u000a      practice [5.8]. Britton also met with the Cabinet Office Behavioural\u000a      Insight Team (BIT) in 2011,\u000a      advocating harm reduction as a means to promote healthy choices, leading\u000a      to the inclusion of\u000a      harm reduction as a BIT policy [5.9]. Britton has since met twice with the\u000a      Prime Minister's senior\u000a      policy advisor on Health and Adult Care (Paul Bate) at 10 Downing St (in\u000a      2011 and 2012) to\u000a      discuss harm reduction and other prevention strategy. These policy changes\u000a      have established the\u000a      UK as world leader in harm reduction approaches to nicotine addiction. Our\u000a      influence and\u000a      leadership was directly acknowledged in a speech by the Secretary of State\u000a      for Health on 6.3.12\u000a      [5.10]. The RCP harm reduction report was also used by Britton to brief\u000a      (meeting 2.3.13) Linda\u000a      McAvan, rapporteur on the 2013 EU Tobacco Products Directive for the\u000a      Environment, Public\u000a      Health and Food Safety (ENVI) committee, to support permissive regulation\u000a      of nicotine-containing\u000a      products at EU level (and 75% health warnings on tobacco packs) in the EU\u000a      Directive:\u000a      http:\/\/www.europarl.europa.eu\/pdfs\/news\/expert\/infopress\/20130708IPR16824\/20130708IPR16824_en.pdf.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research, policy development, evaluation and advocacy work at The\u000a      University of Nottingham has\u000a      achieved significant impact in helping to prevent the harm to health\u000a      caused by smoking, which is\u000a      the largest avoidable cause of death and disability, and of social\u000a      inequalities in health, in the UK.\u000a      This impact has been achieved through contributions in two areas of\u000a      prevention: (1) conventional\u000a      population- and individual-level interventions to prevent smoking uptake\u000a      and promote smoking\u000a      cessation; and (2) novel population-level measures to encourage\u000a      substitution of smoked tobacco\u000a      with alternative, low hazard nicotine products as a harm reduction\u000a      strategy.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Health","Institution":"\u000a    University of Nottingham\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Nottingham (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Nottingham","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"East Midlands","UKPRN":10007154}],"Panel":"A         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

The\u000d\u000a      website is can be used by anyone to determine whether they are at high\u000d\u000a      risk or not. QRISK is also integrated into another website as a decision\u000d\u000a      aid (www.qintervention.org)\u000d\u000a      which can be used to help determine how interventions may lower the risk.\u000d\u000a      The QRISK web calculator is in constant use around the world with &gt;\u000d\u000a      500,000 hits since 2011[1]. www.qintervention.org website was\u000d\u000a        rated by the Times as one of the top five medical Websites in 2013[2]\u000d\u000a    Formation of ClinRisk Ltd\u000d\u000a    With the University's support, Julia Hippisley-Cox set up a company\u000d\u000a      (ClinRisk Ltd) in 2008 to develop software to ensure the reliable and\u000d\u000a      widespread implementation of the QRISK into clinical practice across the\u000d\u000a      UK. ClinRisk has since developed the public facing website (www.qrisk.org)\u000d\u000a      and software which integrates the algorithm into clinical computer\u000d\u000a      systems. The University provided legal support to enable licensing of the\u000d\u000a      algorithm, trademark and software to industry for use across the NHS.\u000d\u000a      Since 2008, QRISK software has been licensed by a number of companies\u000d\u000a      including the leading suppliers to primary and secondary care within the\u000d\u000a      NHS.\u000d\u000a    Clinical utility of QRISK at population level\u000d\u000a    QRISK is also used to risk-stratify entire populations. The software,\u000d\u000a      which is now embedded in &gt; 90% of UK GP clinical computer systems, runs\u000d\u000a      calculations every night which generate a rank-ordered list of those at\u000d\u000a      high risk of heart disease or stroke. The software is used daily by\u000d\u000a      clinicians during consultations with patients and as a risk stratification\u000d\u000a      tool to identify patients for recall for further assessment. Patients at\u000d\u000a      high risk of cardiovascular disease can therefore be identified and given\u000d\u000a      interventions to lower risk where appropriate. Interventions include\u000d\u000a      weight reduction, smoking cessation, blood pressure lowering treatment and\u000d\u000a      cholesterol lowering treatment.\u000d\u000a    The NHS Health Checks programme and Department of Health Policy\u000d\u000a    The NHS Health Checks Programme offers a cardiovascular risk assessment\u000d\u000a      to adults aged 40-74 years in England. The Department of Health endorsed\u000d\u000a      QRISK on publication and used it to develop the economic modelling\u000d\u000a      underpinning the NHS Checks programme in 2008, recommending its use for\u000d\u000a      the start of the programme in 2009[3].\u000d\u000a    Changes to NICE guidance and GP contract Quality and outcomes\u000d\u000a        framework\u000d\u000a    Use of QRISK was ratified by NICE guidance in 2010[4,9].\u000d\u000a      A favourable independent appraisal of QRISK2 [8] and other risk prediction\u000d\u000a      tools concluded that \"QRISK emerges with the greatest potential. It is\u000d\u000a      most likely to be sensitive to the equity issues of great current concern,\u000d\u000a      it reflects best the contemporary British population and its initial\u000d\u000a      results are encouraging. The uncertain approach of NICE's guideline\u000d\u000a      development group illustrates how difficult it can be to judge how much\u000d\u000a      evidence is needed before a change in practice can be recommended, but if\u000d\u000a      QRISK lives up to its promise, it will in time become established as the\u000d\u000a      risk assessment method of choice.\" Use of QRISK is also an integral part\u000d\u000a      of the UK GP contract since vascular screening is one of the quality\u000d\u000a      indicators for which GPs are paid. The new indicator for primary\u000d\u000a      prevention of cardiovascular disease was introduced in 2010\/11[5]\u000d\u000a    Implementation in NHS clinical computer systems\u000d\u000a    QRISK has now been implemented by all four major GP computer suppliers\u000d\u000a      covering in excess of 90% of all UK general practice: EMIS (5500 general\u000d\u000a      practices), InPractice Systems (1800 practices), The Phoenix Partnership\u000d\u000a      (2000 practices) and Microtest (~300 practices). Other suppliers use QRISK\u000d\u000a      in community and pharmacy contexts including Oskis, Wellpoint\u000d\u000a      (kiosk\/pharmacies), Telehealth (kiosk\/pharmacies). These pharmacy and\u000d\u000a      other community schemes use QRISK as part of the NHS Health Checks\u000d\u000a      programme. QRISK is also available as an app for the iphone.\u000d\u000a    Clinical Beneficiaries\u000d\u000a    The main beneficiaries of QRISK are the patients whose risk is assessed\u000d\u000a      more accurately, especially those high risk patients from ethnic\u000d\u000a      minorities or deprived areas who would otherwise have missed out on\u000d\u000a      effective treatments if the Framingham score had been used. Other\u000d\u000a      beneficiaries include clinicians using QRISK since it is better able to\u000d\u000a      identify high risk patients than Framingham. Health care professionals can\u000d\u000a      use the web interface to display an individual's risk of cardiovascular\u000d\u000a      disease in a way which the patient is likely to understand thereby\u000d\u000a      involving patients in decisions regarding their care. Clinical\u000d\u000a      Commissioning Groups also benefit from the integrated automated electronic\u000d\u000a      population tools which are efficient at identifying those at high risk and\u000d\u000a      summarise the number of patients at high risk and those with modifiable\u000d\u000a      risk factors.\u000d\u000a    Development of new technologies and approaches.\u000d\u000a    To our knowledge, QRISK is the first risk prediction tool to be developed\u000d\u000a      using routinely collected electronic data from primary care medical\u000d\u000a      records.

Clinicians need reliable information about an individual's risk\u000d\u000a      of developing cardiovascular disease since interventions exist which can\u000d\u000a      reduce risk of cardiovascular disease in individuals at high risk.\u000d\u000a      Historical methods for quantifying cardiovascular disease risk were based\u000d\u000a      on an American equation (Framingham) developed more than 20 years ago\u000d\u000a      based on a study of white people from a small American town. Consequently\u000d\u000a      the Framingham equation is not suitable for use in a contemporary\u000d\u000a      ethnically diverse UK population as it doesn't reliably identify those at\u000d\u000a      high risk and tends to over-predict risk in low risk individuals. New\u000d\u000a      approaches to cardiovascular risk estimation were needed to take account\u000d\u000a      of the characteristics of the population to which the tool should be\u000d\u000a      applied and which can be updated over time as the population changes and\u000d\u000a      national guidelines for prevention evolve. QRISK was therefore developed\u000d\u000a      as a new approach to cardiovascular risk estimation. The research was led\u000d\u000a      by Professor Julia Hippisley-Cox and Dr Carol Coupland and assisted by Ms\u000d\u000a      Vinogradova from the University of Nottingham with collaborators from\u000d\u000a      other institutions.\u000d\u000a    The new QRISK algorithm was developed using the QResearch database which\u000d\u000a      is a large anonymised repository of electronic health records for medical\u000d\u000a      research created as part of a not-for-profit partnership between the\u000d\u000a      University of Nottingham and EMIS &#8212; a leading supplier of GP clinical\u000d\u000a      computer systems in the UK (www.qresearch.org\u000a        ). The original QRISK algorithm was developed using health records\u000d\u000a      from a cohort of 1.3 million adults aged 35-74 years from 318 general\u000d\u000a      practices across the UK. A statistical model was developed to estimate\u000d\u000a      associations between occurrence of cardiovascular disease during follow-up\u000d\u000a      and a range of risk factors including age, sex, deprivation, smoking,\u000d\u000a      cholesterol, blood pressure, treated hypertension, body mass index and\u000d\u000a      family history. The model estimates were combined to give an algorithm for\u000d\u000a      predicting absolute risk of cardiovascular disease at 10 years. The\u000d\u000a      algorithm was validated in a separate validation cohort containing 610,000\u000d\u000a      people from 160 different practices. An updated algorithm QRISK2 was\u000d\u000a      derived from a cohort of 1.5 million adults and incorporated additional\u000d\u000a      terms for ethnicity, type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, renal disease,\u000d\u000a      and atrial fibrillation. It is the largest cardiovascular risk prediction\u000d\u000a      study to date globally. Because it is derived from clinical information\u000d\u000a      collected in primary care, rather than on a specially assembled research\u000d\u000a      cohort, it is less likely to be affected by selection bias. It can be\u000d\u000a      updated to reflect changes in populations, data quality and improvements\u000d\u000a      in statistical methods.\u000d\u000a    Validation studies have shown that QRISK is more accurate than the\u000d\u000a      Framingham score at assessing risk for UK individuals. QRISK has\u000d\u000a      weightings for deprivation and ethnicity and so is less likely to\u000d\u000a      under-estimate cardiovascular risk in high-risk patients and can therefore\u000d\u000a      help avoid widening health inequalities. Unlike the Framingham score,\u000d\u000a      QRISK does not over estimate risk in low-risk UK patients thereby avoiding\u000d\u000a      unnecessary medication. Overall it is a more efficient tool for the\u000d\u000a      quantification of cardiovascular risk which is then used to guide\u000d\u000a      treatment decisions.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"27329","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The PRACtICe study has provided the best evidence to date on prevalence,\u000d\u000a      nature and causes of\u000d\u000a      prescribing errors in general practices whilst the PINCER trial has\u000d\u000a      identified a highly successful\u000d\u000a      intervention to reduce prescribing errors in primary care. The main\u000d\u000a      evidence of impact comes from\u000d\u000a      media coverage, changes to the RCGP curriculum, production of learning\u000d\u000a      materials for GPs,\u000d\u000a      developments to the TPP SystmOne GP computer system, and uptake from a\u000d\u000a      release of computer\u000d\u000a      queries used in the PINCER trial. These have all occurred in 2012-13. The\u000d\u000a      main beneficiaries are\u000d\u000a      patients and members of the public, GPs, pharmacists and the NHS.\u000d\u000a    Our report on the GMC-funded PRACtICe study was launched at a press\u000d\u000a      conference at the\u000d\u000a      Wellcome Trust in May 2012. The study findings received substantial media\u000d\u000a      interest [A] including\u000d\u000a      front-page headlines in The Daily Telegraph and The Daily\u000d\u000a        Express; articles in all major national\u000d\u000a      newspapers; Professor Avery being interviewed on the BBC Radio 4 Today\u000d\u000a      Programme and BBC\u000d\u000a        Radio 2 Jeremy Vine show; and coverage on several hundred radio\u000d\u000a      stations and several hundred\u000d\u000a      websites. This raised public awareness and debate around the problems of\u000d\u000a      prescribing errors in\u000d\u000a      general practice and interviews undertaken by Professors Avery helped\u000d\u000a      improve public\u000d\u000a      understanding of the issue. In an article for the Daily Mail,\u000d\u000a      Professor Avery explained how patients\u000d\u000a      can help reduce their chances of having a prescribing error. As a result\u000d\u000a      of this publicity, the BBC1\u000d\u000a        Inside-Out programme commissioned and produced a documentary on\u000d\u000a      prescribing errors in\u000d\u000a      primary care which included Professor Avery explaining the findings from\u000d\u000a      the PRACtICe study.\u000d\u000a      This was broadcast in three regions of England in October and November\u000d\u000a      2012.\u000d\u000a    As a result of the publication of the PRACtICE study report, Peter Rubin\u000d\u000a      (President of the GMC)\u000d\u000a      confirmed that in 2012\/13, \"We [the GMC] have met with relevant\u000d\u000a        organisations to ensure that the\u000d\u000a        findings [of the study] around a greater role for pharmacists in\u000d\u000a        supporting GPs, the better use of\u000d\u000a        computer systems and the extra emphasis on prescribing in GP training\u000d\u000a        are translated into actions\u000d\u000a        that help protect patients.\" [B] Professor Avery has worked closely\u000d\u000a      with the RCGP since the\u000d\u000a      publication of the report and presented findings and recommendations at an\u000d\u000a      RCGP Curriculum\u000d\u000a      Group meeting in June 2012, and the RCGP National Conference in October\u000d\u000a      2012. The following\u000d\u000a      impacts have resulted from this [C]: 1) Additional learning outcomes on\u000d\u000a      therapeutics and safe\u000d\u000a      prescribing skills, written by Professor Avery and ratified by the GMC,\u000d\u000a      were added to the 2013\u000d\u000a      RCGP curriculum [D]; 2) Following a meeting between Professor Avery and\u000d\u000a      RCGP examiners in\u000d\u000a      April 2013, assessment of therapeutics and safe prescribing has been\u000d\u000a      strengthened in the MRCGP\u000d\u000a      examination, e.g. new consultation skills assessments have been developed.\u000d\u000a    The PRACtICE study report suggested various ways in which the prescribing\u000d\u000a      safety features of\u000d\u000a      general practice computer systems could be improved. In August 2012, the\u000d\u000a      GP periodical Pulse\u000d\u000a      reported that TPP SystmOne, \"one of the country's biggest GP software\u000d\u000a      providers has\u000d\u000a      implemented a raft of changes to almost 2,000 practice systems in the wake\u000d\u000a      of a GMC-funded\u000d\u000a      study which estimated there are errors in 1 in 20 GP prescriptions\u000d\u000a      nationally\" [E]. This has included\u000d\u000a      computerised alerts aimed at ensuring that patients on high-risk drugs\u000d\u000a      receive necessary blood-tests.\u000d\u000a    As a result of the publication of the PINCER trial in The Lancet,\u000d\u000a      general practice organisations and\u000d\u000a      NHS leaders (including the Chief Pharmaceutical Officer) have expressed\u000d\u000a      considerable interest in\u000d\u000a      rolling out the intervention to general practices in England. Since 2012,\u000d\u000a      Professor Avery and\u000d\u000a      colleagues have worked with a University spin out company (PRIMIS) to\u000d\u000a      produce e-learning\u000d\u000a      materials [F] and develop new methods for general practices to download\u000d\u000a      computer queries used\u000d\u000a      in the PINCER trial [G] to identify prescribing errors and prevent patient\u000d\u000a      harm. By July 2013, over\u000d\u000a      800 general practices had downloaded these computer queries [H] with\u000d\u000a      potential benefits to\u000d\u000a      thousands of patients, and the NHS, from this cost-effective intervention.\u000d\u000a    Keith Ridge, the Chief Pharmaceutical Officer, stated in 2013 that the\u000d\u000a      PRACtICe Study, \"has\u000d\u000a        brought considerable, and much-needed, recognition of ... the problem of\u000d\u000a        prescribing errors ... in\u000d\u000a        general practice\" and that he \"and other senior Government and\u000d\u000a        NHS officials and professionals,\u000d\u000a        routinely use this study as justification for policy development and\u000d\u000a        initiatives designed to improve\u000d\u000a        quality and outcome for patients.\" [I] He also stated that PINCER is\u000d\u000a      \"an important step towards\u000d\u000a        improving patient safety and outcomes from medicines prescribing and\u000d\u000a        use, including the\u000d\u000a        development of IT to support clinical decisions.\" [I]\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Our research has: i) increased public and professional knowledge and\u000d\u000a      understanding of the\u000d\u000a      prevalence, nature and causes of prescribing errors in general practices;\u000d\u000a      ii) led the General\u000d\u000a      Medical Council to recommend improvements to GP education and training;\u000d\u000a      iii) led to the Royal\u000d\u000a      College of General Practitioners to revise its curriculum to increase the\u000d\u000a      emphasis on safe\u000d\u000a      prescribing; iv) led one of the major GP computer system suppliers to make\u000d\u000a      safety improvements;\u000d\u000a      v) identified an IT-based intervention that is effective at reducing\u000d\u000a      prescribing errors; vi) led to the\u000d\u000a      roll-out of the intervention in over 800 general practices.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Health","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of Nottingham\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Nottingham (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Nottingham","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"East Midlands","UKPRN":10007154}],"Panel":"A         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    This section should provide references to key outputs from the\u000d\u000a      research described in the previous\u000d\u000a      section, and evidence about the quality of the research.\u000d\u000a    \u000a1.

Prescribing\u000d\u000a      or monitoring errors were detected in one in twenty of all prescription\u000d\u000a      items. The following factors\u000d\u000a      were associated with increased risk of prescribing or monitoring errors:\u000d\u000a      male gender, age less than\u000d\u000a      15 years or greater than 64 years, number of unique medication items\u000d\u000a      prescribed, and being\u000d\u000a      prescribed preparations in certain therapeutic areas.\u000d\u000a      A wide range of underlying causes of error was identified. In particular,\u000d\u000a      a lack of focus on\u000d\u000a      therapeutics and safe prescribing skills was highlighted in GP training,\u000d\u000a      and deficiencies were found\u000d\u000a      with the design of computerised prescribing systems in general practices.\u000d\u000a      Also, general practices\u000d\u000a      did not have reliable systems for detecting and correcting errors once\u000d\u000a      they had occurred.\u000d\u000a    A number of strategies were identified for reducing prescribing errors in\u000d\u000a      general practices and\u000d\u000a      these include improvements to GP training, improvements to GP computer\u000d\u000a      systems, and the\u000d\u000a      introduction of better systems for detecting and correcting errors (as\u000d\u000a      demonstrated in the PINCER\u000d\u000a      trial [4]).\u000d\u000a    The aim of the PINCER trial was to determine the effectiveness,\u000d\u000a      costs\/benefits and acceptability of\u000d\u000a      a complex pharmacist-led IT-based intervention compared with simple\u000d\u000a      feedback in reducing rates\u000d\u000a      of prescribing and monitoring errors in general practice.\u000d\u000a      PINCER was a cluster randomised controlled trial which incorporated a\u000d\u000a      health economic analysis,\u000d\u000a      embedded longitudinal qualitative analysis, and process analysis of\u000d\u000a      pharmacists' interventions.\u000d\u000a      The control practices received computer-generated simple feedback for\u000d\u000a      patients at-risk of\u000d\u000a      hazardous prescribing.

We ensured that patients were at the heart of quality\u000a      improvement activities,\u000a      through the development, validation and implementation of measures of\u000a      patient experience, and\u000a      their adoption and collection on a national scale. Our impact has been to\u000a      raise the profile of patient\u000a      experience and link it to quality improvement activity across the UK.\u000a    Raising the profile of patient experience\u000a    Policy documents have highlighted the critical role of information on\u000a      patient experience. The White\u000a      Paper `Equity and excellence: Liberating the NHS' (S1) sought to\u000a      `encourage more widespread use\u000a      of patient experience surveys and real-time feedback' to inform choice and\u000a      drive quality\u000a      improvement.\u000a    The NHS centralised the use of standardised measures in the assessment of\u000a      patient experience in\u000a      2007-2008, sending our GPPS measure to samples of patients in a rolling\u000a      programme of quality\u000a      measurement. This has resulted in GPPS being completed by millions of\u000a      patients, with their views\u000a      assessed and analysed on a large scale and a sustained basis over time\u000a      (S2).\u000a    Collection of data on patient experience is not simply for the benefit of\u000a      managers and policy\u000a      makers. All NHS patients can now access information on GPPS scores of\u000a      their local general\u000a      practices from a website (www.gp-patient.co.uk\/faq\/accessing\/),\u000a      to help them assess the quality of\u000a      care and make choices about local services.\u000a    Linking patient experience to quality improvement\u000a    Much research has shown how simple provision of information is\u000a      insufficient for securing change.\u000a      To ensure appropriate impact from patient experience measures, in 2004,\u000a      use of one of our earlier\u000a      patient experience measures (GPAQ) was linked to payments in the early\u000a      version of the Quality\u000a      and Outcomes Framework (QOF).\u000a    The QOF represents a unique programme for quality improvement and the\u000a      results have been of\u000a      interest worldwide. Early in the development of the QOF, general\u000a      practitioners were incentivised to\u000a      conduct surveys on their practice population, and to respond to these\u000a      surveys with appropriate\u000a      quality improvement activities to enhance patient experience and ensure\u000a      that their services were\u000a      responsive to the needs of their local population. Between 2004 and 2009,\u000a      the vast majority of\u000a      practices (&gt;90%) undertook such activities.\u000a    To support this activity and enhance value for money, we disseminated\u000a      written guidance for\u000a      practitioners to interpret the GPAQ data and use it to target these\u000a      quality improvement activities at\u000a      a local level (S3). Twenty three thousand copies of the guidance were\u000a      disseminated, to stimulate\u000a      and guide quality improvement across the United Kingdom.\u000a    Although initial incentives linked to patient experience were largely for\u000a      the use of surveys, later\u000a      versions of the QOF significantly raised the level of achievement\u000a      required. In 2009, &#163;68 million\u000a      pounds worth of general practitioners' pay were linked to actual patient\u000a      reports of their ability to\u000a      gain ready access to care, such as getting an urgent appointment and being\u000a      able to book ahead\u000a      (S1). These targets were harder to meet, with around 70% of practices\u000a      achieving maximum\u000a      performance on these more stringent targets between 2010 and 2012.\u000a    The national regulator, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) used patient\u000a      experience scores as\u000a      part of their performance assessment of Primary Care Trusts undertaken by\u000a      the predecessor of the\u000a      CQC (the Health Care Commission). Current CQC documentation includes\u000a      patient experience\u000a      surveys as an indicator of standards to be expected of all GP practices\u000a      (S4,S5).\u000a    Department of Health reports list the other activities it has conducted\u000a      in response to the data\u000a      collected by patient surveys, including the GPPS (S6,S7). This has ranged\u000a      from public\u000a      dissemination to encourage responsiveness of patient experience among\u000a      Primary Care Trusts,\u000a      review of the needs of marginalised groups such as ethnic minorities, and\u000a      establishment of teams\u000a      to respond to practices and PCTs with the lowest scores.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Improving patient experience of health services is a policy priority\u000a      worldwide.

Quality of health care for individual\u000a      patients can be judged in terms\u000a      of ready access to care, and the effectiveness of care once it is\u000a      accessed. Although scientific\u000a      evidence and clinical consensus are both important methods of determining\u000a      quality, there is\u000a      increasing agreement that a comprehensive assessment of quality needs\u000a      consideration of the\u000a      views and experience of patients.\u000a    However, reliable, valid and useable assessments of the patient\u000a      experience have not always been\u000a      available, which has meant that the patient voice has been largely missing\u000a      from the quality\u000a      improvement agenda.\u000a    Our work involved multidisciplinary research on theory, in-depth\u000a      qualitative work with patients, and\u000a      large-scale quantitative evaluations. Key contributions are detailed\u000a      below:\u000a    \u000a      We defined the core dimensions of patient-centredness (1).\u000a      We investigated how patients make judgments about quality of care,\u000a        assessing the\u000a        dimensions they can judge effectively, and those (such as clinical\u000a        quality of care) that may\u000a        be better assessed by other quality improvement methods (2). We also\u000a        considered the\u000a        relative priority that patients place on different aspects of care (3)\u000a        to help decision-makers\u000a        respond more effectively.\u000a      We designed a series of measures to provide reliable and valid\u000a        assessments of patient\u000a        experience of care.

The impact on total PCT budgets of adopting the changes\u000a      to the prescribing formula in publication 4 was smaller, with an average\u000a      change of 0.2% and range of changes between -0.7% (Isle of Wight PCT) and\u000a      +0.7% (Blackburn with Darwen Teaching Care Trust).

The programme is underpinned\u000a      by a conceptual\u000a      definition of quality of care which showed that quality measurement must\u000a      address clinical\u000a      excellence (e.g. adherence to clinical care standards) as well as patient\u000a      experience, underpinned\u000a      by sound organisational systems and processes for driving quality\u000a      improvement (1).\u000a    Findings from the research informed the design of the Quality and\u000a      Outcomes Framework (QOF) for\u000a      primary care introduced in 2004 in which UK general practices are paid\u000a      according to their\u000a      performance against a range of quality of care indicators. NPCRDC\u000a      evaluated the impact of QOF\u000a      on the clinical quality of care and patient experience in general\u000a      practice, showing that pay-for-performance\u000a      improved clinical quality and reduced inequalities in care but also\u000a      adversely affected\u000a      some aspects of patient experience. The research was published in the\u000a      highest impact journals in\u000a      the field including the New England Journal of Medicine, Annals of Family\u000a      Medicine, British\u000a      Medical Journal, Health Affairs, Journal of the American Medical\u000a      Association and the Lancet.\u000a      This case study describes the impact of research designed to maximise\u000a      improvements in clinical\u000a      quality while minimising the adverse consequences of pay-for-performance\u000a      schemes in general\u000a      practice. Findings from the research shaped subsequent refinements to the\u000a      pay-for-performance\u000a      scheme in UK general practice from 2008 onwards. Specifically NPCRDC\u000a      developed innovative\u000a      methodologies to:\u000a    1) Design and test new quality indicators\u000a    NPCRDC developed a protocol to test and validate new indicators of care\u000a      quality in general\u000a      practice including identifying unintended consequences of their\u000a      implementation such as neglect\u000a      of patients with conditions, or aspects of care, not included in\u000a      pay-for-performance schemes\u000a      (2,3).\u000a    2) Revise and retire existing indicators\u000a    NPCRDC showed that removing quality indicators from a pay-for-performance\u000a      scheme can\u000a      lead to subsequent declines in the quality of care addressed by that\u000a      indicator (4). The\u000a      NPCRDC also developed a framework for assessing when to remove\/retire a\u000a      quality indicator\u000a      from pay-for-performance schemes so as to minimise any decrements in\u000a      quality (5).\u000a    3) Structure pay-for-performance to maximise quality and minimise harm\u000a    NPCRDC showed that, at relatively little financial cost, exception\u000a      reporting (excluding patients\u000a      for whom quality targets are deemed inappropriate or who actively decline\u000a      intervention)\u000a      provides some protection from inappropriate and coercive treatment for\u000a      patients whose\u000a      providers are subject to pay-for-performance schemes (6).\u000a    The research showed that physician incentives provide short-term gains\u000a      and are not a magic bullet\u000a      for quality improvement, nor are they entirely responsive to the complex\u000a      needs of individual\u000a      patients. Rather, it demonstrated the need for multilevel approaches to\u000a      change as part of a wider\u000a      strategy for quality improvement.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"28200","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"798549","Name":"Romania"},{"GeoNamesId":"3190538","Name":"Slovenia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"390903","Name":"Greece"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    See numbered corroborating sources (S) in section 5.\u000d\u000a    The European Practice Assessment (EPA) scheme has been used by 1,584\u000d\u000a      practices (1,170 primary care practices) across 7 countries: Germany,\u000d\u000a      Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, Greece, Romania, Slovenia. The scheme and\u000d\u000a      the indicators are available in the following languages: English, Dutch,\u000d\u000a      French, German, Romanian, Slovenian, Greek, Arab and Hebrew. Overall, 507\u000d\u000a      practices have used the EPA scheme (S1).\u000d\u000a    In 2005 the German federal government introduced a regulation which\u000d\u000a      stipulated that all healthcare providers, including general practices, are\u000d\u000a      obliged to implement an annual quality management programme in order to\u000d\u000a      demonstrate compliance with national systems for accountability in\u000d\u000a      healthcare provision. The European Practice Accreditation scheme, designed\u000d\u000a      by NPCRDC with its European partners is one federally approved option for\u000d\u000a      demonstrating compliance in general practice (S2).

In total 303 primary care practices have\u000d\u000a      used EPA in Germany. 103 of these German general practices used the\u000d\u000a      European Practice Accreditation scheme twice, to measure longitudinal\u000d\u000a      changes in quality improvement over the period 2008-date (S2).

From 2008, 187 dental healthcare organisations have used the\u000d\u000a      EPA-Dental scheme to assess their quality of care (63 having used it\u000d\u000a      twice). Compared with the comparative group at first assessment, the\u000d\u000a      intervention group at second assessment had significantly better scores\u000d\u000a      for the domains \"infrastructure\" (Intervention group 94.2%, Comparative\u000d\u000a      group 84.0%) and \"quality and safety\" (Intervention group 88.7%,\u000d\u000a      Comparative group 78.1%).\u000d\u000a    In the UK, the General Practice Accreditation scheme developed by the\u000d\u000a      Royal College of General Practitioners in partnership with NPCRDC was\u000d\u000a      implemented in July 2011 and closed to new applicants in February 2013\u000d\u000a      (S5,S6). Upon successful completion, Practice Accreditation is valid for\u000d\u000a      three years. From 2011, 260 of the 8,088 general practices in England have\u000d\u000a      sought accreditation of which 4 have been successful with the remainder\u000d\u000a      ongoing.

This requires the development of care quality standards and\u000d\u000a      measures that can be applied efficiently to assess whether an organisation\u000d\u000a      has the necessary organisational systems and processes in place to deliver\u000d\u000a      safe and effective care. NPCRDC developed innovative methods to design and\u000d\u000a      test indicators of quality in the organisational systems and processes\u000d\u000a      within general practice that underpin care quality and safety (2).\u000d\u000a    In collaboration with the Universities of Nijmegen and Heidelberg, NPCRDC\u000d\u000a      applied these methods to the development of a European Practice Assessment\u000d\u000a      accreditation scheme suitable for use by general practices across Europe\u000d\u000a      (3,4). The research was funded by the Bertelsmann Foundation. The European\u000d\u000a      Practice Assessment accreditation scheme won the 2009 award of the\u000d\u000a      European Health Forum Gastein. This award, widely regarded as the\u000d\u000a      'European Oscar' for healthcare, is given for major innovations in\u000d\u000a      European healthcare. Subsequent research demonstrated the effectiveness of\u000d\u000a      practice accreditation as a method for driving quality improvement in\u000d\u000a      primary care (5).\u000d\u000a    In the UK, NPCRDC worked in partnership with the Royal College of General\u000d\u000a      Practitioners (RCGP), applying knowledge from the research to the\u000d\u000a      development of a British system of Practice Accreditation (6). The\u000d\u000a      development work was undertaken in close collaboration with the General\u000d\u000a      Medical Council, Royal College of Nursing, Care Quality Commission,\u000d\u000a      Department of Health, NHS Confederation Primary Care Trusts and patient\u000d\u000a      groups to ensure the Practice Accreditation scheme was aligned to the\u000d\u000a      priorities and concerns of other key stakeholders.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"29681","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    In 1993, the health, development and climate consequences of household\u000d\u000a      energy in Lower and\u000d\u000a      Middle Income Countries (LMICs) were barely recognised outside a small\u000d\u000a      number of specialist\u000d\u000a      agencies. The UoL's research has shown that HAP is the 4th most\u000d\u000a      important risk factor globally\u000d\u000a      leading to 4m premature deaths and 11m DALYs. The research has been\u000d\u000a      significant in generating\u000d\u000a      international awareness and mobilising action. The Liverpool WHO CC has\u000d\u000a      had a central advisory\u000d\u000a      role in many initiatives including the (i) United Nations Foundation\u000d\u000a      Global Alliance for Clean\u000d\u000a      Cookstoves (GACC) &#8212; a public-private partnership aiming to secure the\u000d\u000a      health, economic, climate\u000d\u000a      and related benefits of clean cooking, and (ii) the United Nations\u000d\u000a      initiative on Sustainable Energy\u000d\u000a      for All (SE4All).

He has also contributed to health impact\u000d\u000a      assessment from\u000d\u000a      climate change mitigation strategies through recently-established\u000d\u000a      collaboration between WHO and\u000d\u000a      the United Nations Environment Programme-led Climate and Clean Air\u000d\u000a      Coalition (CCAC) which is\u000d\u000a      focused on securing climate and health co-benefits of action on\u000d\u000a      short-lived climate pollutants and\u000d\u000a      which builds on UoL's modelling approach. The Executive Director of UN\u000d\u000a      GACC, stated in 2013\u000d\u000a      that \"the University of Liverpool research led by Professor Bruce has\u000d\u000a        spurred global efforts over the\u000d\u000a        past 15 years to quantify and communicate the health burden from\u000d\u000a        household air pollution,\u000d\u000a        particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America... it has certainly\u000d\u000a        helped gain commitment for\u000d\u000a        action at the highest levels and will support the development of the\u000d\u000a        clean cookstoves and fuels\u000d\u000a        markets\" [10]. These actions are also leading to health\u000d\u000a      improvements, lower costs for poor\u000d\u000a      families and reducing carbon emissions.\u000d\u000a    Liverpool WHO CC systematic reviews provided estimates of risk for the\u000d\u000a      GBD-2010 study, and\u000d\u000a      intervention effect estimates for several important preventive strategies\u000d\u000a      and tools.

Annual campaigns to increase uptake of the vaccination amongst\u000d\u000a      NHS staff have cited the publication for many years. (See, for example,\u000d\u000a      the current year's letter from the Chief Medical Officer [b].) The\u000d\u000a      evidence on low uptake contributed to DH decisions to set up mandatory\u000d\u000a      routine monitoring of influenza vaccine uptake in England and informs the\u000d\u000a      content of the DH \"Flu Fighters\" campaign (launched in 2010\/11) aimed at\u000d\u000a      increasing uptake amongst front line healthcare staff including protection\u000d\u000a      of patients, safety and effectiveness as key messages. This has led to a\u000d\u000a      range of local NHS trust campaigns [c]. Since the publication of\u000d\u000a      our research, healthcare worker vaccination in acute trusts in England has\u000d\u000a      increased from a steady low of around 15% to around 45% in the 2010\/11\u000d\u000a      season [d].\u000d\u000a    Internationally, the trial is cited in annual US guidance on healthcare\u000d\u000a      worker vaccination [e] and has also contributed to 27 States in\u000d\u000a      the US making healthcare worker influenza vaccination mandatory [f].\u000d\u000a      Our work was presented as key evidence in a 2013 test-case trial in Canada\u000d\u000a      on mandatory vaccination [g].\u000d\u000a    Informing US recommendations of prevention of stroke\u000d\u000a    Our systematic review and meta-analysis of the influence of influenza as\u000d\u000a      a trigger for acute vascular events was the first of its kind.

This\u000d\u000a      decision was largely based on the findings of a dynamic transmission\u000d\u000a      model, commissioned by the DH and conducted by LSHTM and HPA, to assess\u000d\u000a      the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the national influenza\u000d\u000a      vaccination campaign and consider options for extending this to other\u000d\u000a      groups. The model predicted that 30% coverage in children would result in\u000d\u000a      net savings of around &#163;65m and prevent loss of around 17,000 Quality\u000d\u000a      Adjusted Life Years annually. The model also suggested that extending\u000d\u000a      vaccination to all those aged greater than 50 years would not be cost\u000d\u000a      effective [i].\u000d\u000a    In order to increase confidence in the findings of the economic model the\u000d\u000a      committee requested that the age specific baseline levels of infection and\u000d\u000a      disease inferred by the model be validated against Flu Watch data\u000d\u000a      (provided prior to publication) to check that the model provided an\u000d\u000a      accurate representation of the true community burden. The fact that model\u000d\u000a      output and the empirical measures from Flu Watch matched gave confidence\u000d\u000a      in the validity of the model and thus supported the recommendation to\u000d\u000a      extend routine influenza vaccination to children but not to all adults\u000d\u000a      aged over 50. In deliberating on the type of vaccine to be used the Flu\u000d\u000a      Watch finding that cellular immune responses provide protection against\u000d\u000a      both seasonal and pandemic disease was discussed and contributed to the\u000d\u000a      decision to use Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (which stimulates both\u000d\u000a      cellular and humoral immunity) rather than Trivalent Inactivated Vaccine\u000d\u000a      (which only stimulates humoral immunity) [j].

Subjects said they would be persuaded to take up\u000d\u000a      vaccination in future by easier access (36%), more information about\u000d\u000a      personal benefit and risk (34%) and more information about effects on\u000d\u000a      staff absence (24%).\u000d\u000a    Hayward is lead author in a systematic review and meta-analysis of the\u000d\u000a      impact of influenza on triggering acute cardiovascular events showing this\u000d\u000a      is an important preventable risk factor [4].\u000d\u000a    Since 2006, Hayward has led the MRC\/Wellcome Flu Watch study, the world's\u000d\u000a      largest community study of influenza transmission and immunity. This study\u000d\u000a      recruited households across England to monitor levels of illness over five\u000d\u000a      flu seasons, via serological testing of pre- and post-season blood\u000d\u000a      samples, weekly follow up to record any flu-like illness, and nasal swabs\u000d\u000a      for those who reported such illness. The main results, which are under\u000d\u000a      review by the Lancet, provide the most robust measures to date of\u000d\u000a      influenza burden across different age groups and highlight the\u000d\u000a      particularly high rates in children [5].

TB is curable in virtually all cases\u000a      and can be effectively\u000a      controlled provided cases are found early and patients can complete\u000a      treatment. The research\u000a      described above has resulted in new services to improve control of\u000a      tuberculosis in hard-to-reach\u000a      groups.\u000a    The Find&amp;Treat Project\u000a    The original TB profile study provided justification for London Region to\u000a      invest in a large\u000a      demonstration project of mobile X-ray screening in homeless people, drug\u000a      users and prisoners.\u000a      Our initial evaluation of the demonstration project led the Department of\u000a      Health (DH) to invest in\u000a      continued funding of mobile X-ray screening in homeless shelters and drug\u000a      services and the\u000a      expansion of the service to include workers to support patients through\u000a      diagnosis and treatment.\u000a      This has now become the Find&amp;Treat service &#8212; a specialist outreach\u000a      team that works alongside\u000a      over 200 NHS and third sector front-line services to tackle TB among\u000a      homeless people, drug or\u000a      alcohol users, vulnerable migrants and people who have been in prison. The\u000a      multidisciplinary\u000a      Find&amp;Treat team takes TB control into the community, finds cases of\u000a      active TB early and supports\u000a      patients to take a full course of treatment and get cured. The service\u000a      spans the TB pathway from\u000a      detection, to diagnosis and onward care. To `Find' TB cases early the team\u000a      raises awareness\u000a      among service users and frontline professionals and screen almost 10,000\u000a      high risk people every\u000a      year using a mobile digital X-ray unit (MXU) as recommended by the\u000a      National Institute of Health\u000a      and Clinical Excellence (NICE). The screening service covers every London\u000a      Borough and supports\u000a      Public Health England (PHE) to manage outbreaks of TB nationally. Our\u000a      subsequent evaluation of\u000a      the expanded service contributed to decisions for NHS to take over the\u000a      funding of the service\u000a      which is now hosted by UCLH on behalf of London [a].\u000a    Analysis of service data shows that between January 2008 and June 2013,\u000a      Find&amp;Treat undertook\u000a      45,385 X-rays leading to 385 referrals, 84 of which resulted in treatment\u000a      being commenced for\u000a      pulmonary tuberculosis (detection rate 247 per 100,000 individuals\u000a      screened). 84% successfully\u000a      completed treatment within 12 months (higher than the proportion of cases\u000a      who complete TB\u000a      treatment nationally). Since 2008 Find&amp;Treat have worked with 1,379\u000a      suspected and active TB\u000a      cases including 780 cases with active TB (696 referred from TB and allied\u000a      services in London and\u000a      Birmingham and 84 found on the MXU). Of the culture confirmed cases 33%\u000a      were drug resistant\u000a      including 59 multidrug-resistant (MDR) and 4 extensively drug-resistant\u000a      (XDR) cases. 371 of the\u000a      referrals to Find&amp;Treat were because of loss to follow up and deemed\u000a      un-contactable by local\u000a      services. The outreach team recontacted 74% (275) of whom 73% have\u000a      completed treatment (154)\u000a      or are well established and expected to complete treatment (46). The team\u000a      also support Directly\u000a      Observed Therapy (where a responsible adult watches every dose of\u000a      treatment being swallowed to\u000a      improve adherence) and have pioneered the use of Video Observed Therapy\u000a      (VOT) using laptops\u000a      and smartphones. VOT is now being evaluated as part of a randomised trial\u000a      funded within the\u000a      UCL-led TB Reach NIHR Programme grant [b].\u000a    Public Health England is now developing a project to expand the service\u000a      nationally, creating a\u000a      National Infection &amp; Inequality System (NIIS) to provide integrated\u000a      testing, treatment, health and\u000a      social care for vulnerable populations disproportionately affected by\u000a      serious public health\u000a      infections, in particular TB, Hepatitis C and HIV. This service will be\u000a      directly modelled on the\u000a      successful model of Find&amp;Treat [c].\u000a    Introduction of static screening in prisons\u000a    Our research demonstrated that turnover of prisoners was too high for a\u000a      mobile unit to provide\u000a      sufficient coverage to pick up cases and recommended the installation of\u000a      static digital X-ray units\u000a      (DXR) in key prisons. In March 2008, the Chief Medical Officer announced\u000a      the intention of DH to\u000a      fund the installation of static DXR machines in five London prisons at a\u000a      cost of &#163;10m. This decision\u000a      was explicitly linked by the CMO to our MXU evaluation project (ref 5\u000a      above) [d]. The X-ray units\u000a      were all installed and in operation by March 2012. PHE's Director of\u000a      Health and Justice reports that\u000a      \"I have no doubt that the MXU project has had a direct and positive\u000a        influence on policy and\u000a        programmes relating to active case finding for pulmonary TB among people\u000a        in prisons and other\u000a        places of detention.\" A new national partnership agreement just\u000a      signed between PHE, NHS\u000a      England and the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) has made\u000a      further commitments\u000a      to ensuring the service is fully utilised, and furthermore, following a\u000a      successful trial of the\u000a      Find&amp;Treat service at a large Immigration Removal Centre (IRC) near\u000a      London, proposals are now\u000a      being made to extend the service permanently for use in this setting [e].\u000a    Broader influence on control of tuberculosis in hard to reach groups\u000a    In July 2009 NICE received the following referral from DH: \"Produce\u000a        programme guidance on the\u000a        effectiveness and cost effectiveness of interventions based on active\u000a        case finding among hard-to-reach\u000a        groups (find and treat model) for reducing transmission of tuberculosis\u000a        and related mortality\u000a        and implications for service development.\" The guideline development\u000a      group was chaired by\u000a      Hayward and considered a wide range of evidence including the research\u000a      described above and\u000a      expert testimony from the Find&amp;Treat service.

In addition to the above\u000a      this guidance includes\u000a      a risk assessment tool modelled on our original TB patient profile form.\u000a      This helps to systematically\u000a      identify patients in need of enhanced case management [g].\u000a    The approach of adding the support of allied health professionals to work\u000a      alongside TB services\u000a      which we pioneered in the TB Link project, is now in use in at least 18 TB\u000a      services across London\u000a      alone.

Interventions mainly\u000a      involved supporting\u000a      access to housing (36%), income\/benefits (34%) and immigration entitlement\u000a      issues (7%). Over\u000a      80% of cases successfully completed treatment. The research was carried\u000a      out by Dr Andrew\u000a      Hayward in collaboration with Alistair Story (Health Protection Agency\u000a      (HPA) at that time, now\u000a      UCL\/UCLH) [1].\u000a    In 2003\/4 the London TB Patient Profile worked with all TB nurses\u000a      in 35 clinics across London to\u000a      look at social as well as clinical factors affecting patient outcomes. The\u000a      study included 1,941\u000a      patients (over 95% of London TB patients) and showed the importance of\u000a      three risk factors in\u000a      particular: homelessness, drug use and imprisonment. It demonstrated that\u000a      these groups had\u000a      extremely high prevalence of tuberculosis (higher than recent migrants\u000a      from high incidence\u000a      countries) and that these factors were strong independent predictors of\u000a      drug resistance, poor\u000a      adherence and loss to follow up [2]. Subsequent work based on this\u000a      data showed that Crack\u000a      Cocaine Users were substantially more likely than others to have smear\u000a      positive (infectious) forms\u000a      of tuberculosis than other cases, posing a great transmission risk [3].\u000a      The work also demonstrated\u000a      substantial missed opportunities for diagnosis and early treatment of HIV\u000a      (only 50.8% of TB\u000a      patients aged &gt; or =20 years without previous testing were offered HIV\u000a      testing) [4].\u000a    The first work to evaluate mobile X-ray screening started in\u000a      collaboration with colleagues in\u000a      Holland who were working on a similar project. In 2004 Story and Hayward\u000a      led a three-day\u000a        screening pilot across several of the larger homeless hostels in\u000a      London, and in a prison. One\u000a      case of TB was found in a prison, and one among the homeless. This\u000a      proof-of-concept study\u000a      demonstrated the potential of such a scheme, and prompted the Department\u000a      of Health to fund a\u000a      demonstration project entitled Evaluation of Targeted Mobile X Ray\u000a        Screening for tuberculosis\u000a        in high risk groups. Over 21 months the project undertook 23,881\u000a      chest X-rays and led to 43\u000a      patients starting treatment. Screening shortened delay to diagnosis\u000a      three-fold. Modelling\u000a      suggested this would prevent around 87 active cases and 389 infections per\u000a      year by 2013 and that\u000a      the intervention was cost-saving [5]. Nevertheless it highlighted\u000a      that because patients were being\u000a      lost between initial screening and diagnosis at a clinic, investment was\u000a      also needed to support\u000a      people through confirmation of diagnosis and treatment. The report also\u000a      noted that high turnover of\u000a      inmates in prisons prevented high screening coverage with a mobile unit.\u000a    A subsequent evaluation of an expanded Find &amp; Treat service\u000a      (Abubaker, then HPA now UCL and\u000a      Aldridge, UCL) showed the cost effectiveness of the service in identifying\u000a      hard to reach patients\u000a      and supporting their care [6].\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32321","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    In 2006, Scotland became the first country in the UK to introduce a ban\u000d\u000a      on smoking in public places.

On 12\u000d\u000a      October 2010, the EU Health Commissioner John Dalli stated that \"a number\u000d\u000a      of studies indicate important health effects of smoke-free policies\" when\u000d\u000a      answering a question raised in the European Parliament regarding the\u000d\u000a      Commission's proposal, before referring to another memo that also\u000d\u000a      references the Pell findings.b\u000d\u000a    In 2011, the WHO released the document `Making Cities Smoke-free' to\u000d\u000a      support compliance with the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control,\u000d\u000a      an international treaty signed by 174 countries.c Addressed to\u000d\u000a      mayors of cities across the world, this document drew on the experience of\u000d\u000a      many different jurisdictions and provided a practical framework for\u000d\u000a      implementing smoke-free laws in cities (effectively defining the\u000d\u000a      legislation, anticipating and countering opposition, ensuring civil\u000d\u000a      society involvement, and managing public communications). In the section\u000d\u000a      entitled `Key Resources', the 2008 study by Pell and colleagues (2008, NEJM\u000d\u000a      in section 3) was the sole reference provided for the UK to demonstrate\u000d\u000a      the benefit of measuring indicators of worker health pre- and post-ban,\u000d\u000a      specifically `the number of emergency admissions to hospital for acute\u000d\u000a      cardiovascular problems such as heart attacks'. Professor Pell was also\u000d\u000a      invited by the WHO to present at the 14th World Conference on\u000d\u000a      Tobacco and Health in 2009 in Mumbai, India. The World Heart Federation,\u000d\u000a      which supports \"reduction of the prevalence of risk factors associated\u000d\u000a      with cardiovascular deaths\" and includes tobacco control as one of its\u000d\u000a      advocacy strands has selected Pell's research as one of four international\u000d\u000a      case studies that exemplify \"the work of women who have played key roles\u000d\u000a      ensuring that women's needs are taken into account in the formation of\u000d\u000a      tobacco control policy and the provision of cessation services around the\u000d\u000a      world\".d\u000d\u000a    In the USA, the University of Glasgow findings have been covered widely\u000d\u000a      by the press. A White Paper produced in 2011 by the Health Care Foundation\u000d\u000a      for Greater Kansas City included a section entitled `Clean Indoor Air\u000d\u000a        Laws,e which cited Pell's research (2008, NEJM in\u000d\u000a      section 3), stating that \"after just one year in effect, Scotland's\u000d\u000a      comprehensive clean indoor air law resulted in a 17% reduction in hospital\u000d\u000a      admissions for heart attacks and other coronary problems.\" These data were\u000d\u000a      also referenced in a section of the Global Voices Status Report (2009)\u000d\u000a      that referred to the UK and Ireland as `Regional Leaders' for their\u000d\u000a      smoking legislation.f This report provides guidance for\u000d\u000a      clinicians and policy-makers on how to protect people from second-hand\u000d\u000a      smoke and was produced by the Global Smoke-free Partnership (GSP) &#8212; an\u000d\u000a      international umbrella organisation coordinated by the American Cancer\u000d\u000a      Society &#8212; which promotes effective smoke-free air policies worldwide. The\u000d\u000a      GSP has also disseminated the research of Pell's team in a number of the\u000d\u000a      smoking-related factsheets that are available on its website.\u000d\u000a    Evidence produced by the University of Glasgow has also been cited in the\u000d\u000a      Scottish Government's evaluation of the success of the smoking ban and\u000d\u000a      continues to support its tobacco control policies. ASH Scotland's\u000d\u000a      Information Service is funded by the British Heart Foundation and the\u000d\u000a      Scottish Government to provide reliable evidence-based information on\u000d\u000a      tobacco and its harmful effects on health, society, and the economy in\u000d\u000a      Scotland. In ASH's `National evaluation of Scotland's smoke-free\u000d\u000a      legislation' (2013), key findings of the University of Glasgow research\u000d\u000a      (2008, NEJM and 2010, NEJM in section 3) are presented as\u000d\u000a      headline items, including the positive impacts on childhood asthma and on\u000d\u000a      heart attack admissions to hospital.g The Scottish Government's\u000d\u000a      2013 strategy on tobacco control, entitled `Creating a tobacco-free\u000d\u000a      generation: A tobacco control strategy for Scotland', cites the \"clear\u000d\u000a      evidence that ... the smoking ban, has lead [sic] to a range of health\u000d\u000a      benefits including: reduced heart attack admissions to hospital; reduced\u000d\u000a      childhood asthma admissions to hospital; and fewer premature births\",\u000d\u000a      referencing the 2008 and 2010 NEJM papers (section 3),\u000d\u000a      demonstrating the continued influence of Glasgow research on the\u000d\u000a      government's current smoke-free policy.h\u000d\u000a    Leading public debate\u000d\u000a    Extensive coverage in UK and international newspapers, on the radio, and\u000d\u000a      on the internet mean that the findings of Pell and her team have played an\u000d\u000a      important role in the continuing and often vociferous public debate for\u000d\u000a      and against smoking legislation.i-p As an example, the Wall\u000d\u000a        Street Journal, with a daily circulation of 2.1 million readers,\u000d\u000a      cited the team's findings in its coverage of the smoking ban debate in the\u000d\u000a      USA in 2008, stating that \"a new study from Scotland provides what\u000d\u000a      public-health experts in the US say is the strongest evidence yet that\u000d\u000a      public bans on smoking being debated in several locales &#8212; improve health\u000d\u000a      by reducing exposure to secondhand smoke\".i\u000d\u000a    Despite research from the Scottish Government showing that 80% of people\u000d\u000a      supported the idea of a smoking ban, there were concerns expressed about\u000d\u000a      the potentially damaging effect it would have on businesses and vocal\u000d\u000a      opposition from pro-smoking groups is ongoing. The significance of the\u000d\u000a      Glasgow findings in supporting a smoking ban policy is evidenced by the\u000d\u000a      regularity with which they are targeted by ban opponents, e.g.\u000d\u000a      Freedom2Choose (F2C), a lobbying initiative seeking to `alleviate the\u000d\u000a      negative social and economic impacts of the ban' and to challenge\u000d\u000a      supposedly misleading claims over smoking issues, particularly in relation\u000d\u000a      to passive smoking.j Pell's research findings also feature\u000d\u000a      regularly in a blog entitled `Taking Liberties' written by Simon Clark,\u000d\u000a      the director of an anti-tobacco-legislation lobbying group called Forest\u000d\u000a      that is funded, in part, by British American Tobacco.k\u000d\u000a    On the other side of the debate, the Chief Executive of Action on Smoking\u000d\u000a      and Health (ASH) Scotland has contributed to a number of blogs in her\u000d\u000a      `Smoked out' series using the research by Pell's team to support the\u000d\u000a      argument in favour of smoking bansl. In 2011, on the 5-year\u000d\u000a      anniversary of the Scottish smoking ban, the Scotsman newspaper\u000d\u000a      published a feature covering the wide range of views on smoke-free\u000d\u000a      legislation. In addition to soliciting opinions from Simon Clark and\u000d\u000a      representatives from the ASH and the Scottish Licensed Trade Association,\u000d\u000a      they invited Jill Pell and Phil Hanlon to present the evidence base in\u000d\u000a      support of such laws.m In the BBC coverage of the 5th\u000d\u000a      anniversary of the ban, the legislation was described as one of the\u000d\u000a      country's \"big public health success stories\" &#8212; research by Pell and\u000d\u000a      colleagues (showing lower hospitalisation rates for children with asthma)\u000d\u000a      was used to support this statement.n\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Smoke-free laws are public policies that prohibit tobacco smoking in\u000d\u000a      workplaces and other public spaces. Since the end of March 2006, smoking\u000d\u000a      has been prohibited by law in all enclosed public spaces throughout\u000d\u000a      Scotland, with the specific aim of protecting non-smokers from the effects\u000d\u000a      of second-hand smoke.

The impact of smoke-free laws on\u000d\u000a      public health in Scotland has been evaluated in ongoing research by a\u000d\u000a      combined team of academics and health professionals at the University of\u000d\u000a      Glasgow that is led by Professor Jill Pell and funded by NHS\u000d\u000a      HealthScotland. This research has shown that smoke-free laws are\u000d\u000a      associated with a reduced incidence of key smoking-related disorders, such\u000d\u000a      as coronary heart disease, childhood asthma, complications in pregnancy,\u000d\u000a      and stroke.\u000d\u000a    Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a life-threatening form of heart\u000d\u000a      disease. Although eight previous studies in USA, Canada and Italy had\u000d\u000a      suggested that total admissions for ACS were reduced following the\u000d\u000a      introduction of smoke-free laws, Pell's team was the first to perform a\u000d\u000a      prospective study that linked reductions in admission rates to the smoking\u000d\u000a      status of patients.1 For 10 months before the enactment of the\u000d\u000a      smoking legislation in Scotland on the 26th March 2006 and the\u000d\u000a      same 10 months in the year following legislation, patients admitted with\u000d\u000a      ACS to nine Scottish hospitals (accounting for 64% of the total ACS\u000d\u000a      admissions in Scotland) were recruited to the study by Pell et al.1\u000d\u000a      The information collected from participating patients included\u000d\u000a      self-reported smoking status and exposure to second-hand smoke, which was\u000d\u000a      also measured objectively by a well-established biomarker for exposure to\u000d\u000a      tobacco smoke (cotinine &#8212; a breakdown product of nicotine). Over the\u000d\u000a      period studied, the number of hospital admissions for ACS in Scotland\u000d\u000a      decreased by 17% (from 3,235 in the 10 months prior to the introduction of\u000d\u000a      the law to 2,684 in the 10 months afterwards), with non-smokers accounting\u000d\u000a      for two-thirds of this reduction. By comparison, a 4% reduction was\u000d\u000a      reported during the same period in England, where no such legislation had\u000d\u000a      been introduced. The significance of this study was reflected by the fact\u000d\u000a      that the publication was voted the Top Paper of 2008 by the American Heart\u000d\u000a      Association.\u000d\u000a    In 2009, Pell's team used record linkage to conduct a follow-up study of\u000d\u000a      the 1,261 never smokers to establish the effect of exposure to second-hand\u000d\u000a      smoke on early outcomes of ACS. Never smokers who were exposed to\u000d\u000a      second-hand smoke had a higher risk of adverse events (such as death or\u000d\u000a      rehospitalisation) within 30 days of first admission to hospital.2\u000d\u000a      This finding further supported the argument for protecting non-smokers\u000d\u000a      from the harmful effects of second-hand smoke.\u000d\u000a    Pell's team also examined the effects of the smoke-free law on rates of\u000d\u000a      childhood asthma and pregnancy complications in Scotland. Research\u000d\u000a      published by this group showed that childhood asthma admissions had been\u000d\u000a      increasing by about 5% each year prior to the introduction of the\u000d\u000a      smoke-free law, but were reduced by 18% per year following introduction of\u000d\u000a      the legislation.3 Faculty of 1000 graded this article as 5*\u000d\u000a      stating it was \"an important study for health care providers, legislators\u000d\u000a      and public health care workers\". Pell and her team went on to examine data\u000d\u000a      on 717,000 women who conceived between August 1995 and February 2009, and\u000d\u000a      showed that, relative to the underlying trends, there was a significant\u000d\u000a      drop of more than &gt;10% in the overall number of preterm deliveries, and\u000d\u000a      significant drops of 5% and 8% in the number of infants born either small\u000d\u000a      or very small, respectively, for their gestational age.4 Following\u000d\u000a      the legislation, the number of expectant mothers who smoked fell from\u000d\u000a      25.4% to 18.8%. This dramatic decline was not observed in the general\u000d\u000a      population but was consistent with other Scottish studies that showed that\u000d\u000a      parents responded to the smoke-free legislation by implementing voluntary\u000d\u000a      home restrictions on smoking to protect their children.\u000d\u000a    More recently, Pell's team was the first to show a reduction in the\u000d\u000a      incidence of cerebral infarction as a result of the smoke-free law.\u000d\u000a      Cerebral infarction is a form of stroke caused by restriction of blood\u000d\u000a      flow to the brain, due to diseased or damaged cerebral arteries, and\u000d\u000a      accounts for 50% of all strokes. The incidence of cerebral infarction was\u000d\u000a      increasing at around 1% per year but, following introduction of the\u000d\u000a      smoke-free law, reduced by around 9%. This was sustained for 20 months,\u000d\u000a      before partially reverting to pre-legislation levels.5 This was\u000d\u000a      consistent with another study by Pell's team that showed an initial\u000d\u000a      increase in smoking quit rates, followed by some relapses.\u000d\u000a    Key researchers at the University of Glasgow: Jill Pell\u000d\u000a      (Henry Mechan Chair of Public Health, 2007-present); Daniel Mackay\u000d\u000a      (Research Associate, 1998-2011; Senior Lecturer of Public Health,\u000d\u000a      2012-present); Scott Nelson (Muirhead Chair of Reproductive and Maternal\u000d\u000a      Medicine, 2008-present); Peter Langhorne (Professor of Stroke Care,\u000d\u000a      1994-present); Alex McConnachie (Assistant Director of Biostatistics,\u000d\u000a      2010-present).\u000d\u000a    Key collaborator: Sally Haw &#8212; (NHS Health Scotland, moved\u000d\u000a      to University of Stirling, Department of Nursing Midwifery and Health in\u000d\u000a      2011).

His core series of workbooks, `Overcoming depression and low\u000a      mood: a five areas approach' has sold 10,734 copies since 2008a\u000a      and his approach to guided self-help CBT has been shown in clinical\u000a      research and practice to effectively treat depression. Williams has\u000a      achieved significant local, national and international recognition for the\u000a      pioneering dissemination of his `five areas' model through two\u000a      complementary approaches &#8212; practitioner training and the provision of\u000a      online resources.\u000a    Practitioner training\u000a      Courses to train healthcare practitioners in using the `Overcoming\u000a      depression and low mood' materials with patients have been developed, and\u000a      then evaluated in the Glasgow team's research, facilitating the\u000a      implementation of self-help CBT treatments within existing clinical\u000a      settings.\u000a    The SPIRIT programme has operated since 2002, during which time it\u000a      has received (and continues to receive) NHS funding of around &#163;127,000 per\u000a      annum. The first accredited course of this kind, it delivers training to\u000a      teams operating within NHS Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde (GG&amp;C).\u000a      Currently, all `adult' and `older adult' mental health teams in Glasgow\u000a      have been trained in SPIRIT, with 287 practitioners trained since 2008.b\u000a      This focus on team-based training has enhanced the assimilation of new\u000a      practice into wards and, since 2008, mental health clinical admissions in\u000a      GG&amp;C have undergone `five areas' assessment, with use of the SPIRIT\u000a      programme recorded in the electronic patient record\/PIMS system.\u000a    Widening access to Self-Help and Psychological Interventions\u000a      (WISH) is a programme funded by the Scottish Government to provide\u000a      short-course training to healthcare and community practitioners, carers\u000a      and physiotherapists, using a low-intensity application of the `five\u000a      areas' approach. In a pilot study performed from 2009 to 2010, WISH\u000a      provided training for 597 healthcare professionals practicing across three\u000a      Scottish NHS boards (Highland, Dumfries &amp; Galloway and Lanarkshire)\u000a      and employees of a national charity \"Action on Depression\" (AOD), in how\u000a      to support patients using the `five areas' resources. AOD staff and\u000a      volunteers lead small groups and provide telephone support for online\u000a      versions of the five areas approach. Since the beginning of April 2011, a\u000a      further 985 practitioners have been trained with WISH, including\u000a      clinicians from two additional NHS boards (Lothian and GG&amp;C)c\u000a      and funding has been extended a further year until March 2014.\u000a    Online resource\u000a      Williams' second approach was to develop a free-access CBT-related website\u000a      called \"Living Life to the Full\" (LLTTF). This was based upon the original\u000a      `Overcoming depression and low mood' book plus new resources to increase\u000a      accessibility. LLTTF was established in 2004 (and re-launched in 2011) to\u000a      widen and expedite the delivery of an adult life skills course; it can be\u000a      used alone or together with books, DVDs and face-to-face classes in both\u000a      clinical and non-clinical settings. Since 2008, 208,604 members have\u000a      registered with the website,d which receives an average of over\u000a      45,000 visits per monthd and has a Google page ranking of 5 (on\u000a      a 0-10 logarithmic scale that reflects both the number and quality of\u000a      other webpages referring to the site). Put into the context of other\u000a      popular websites, a ranking of 5 is considered to be a good score; for\u000a      example, the bbc.co.uk website has a ranking of 9 and the scot.nhs.uk\u000a      website has a ranking of 6. Since 2008, Williams has supported a number of\u000a      national and international projects that roll out local delivery of LLTTF,\u000a      which are outlined in the subsections below.\u000a    NHS Living Life is a telephone support line for people with low\u000a      mood or anxiety that is funded by the Scottish Health Department and\u000a      available in Scotland since 2011. Operated by GP referral or\u000a      self-referral, patients are directed towards the LLTTF website and the\u000a      \"Overcoming depression and low mood: a five areas approach\" workbook, and\u000a      receive support using these from SPIRIT-trained therapists. An independent\u000a      audit of the 2008-2010 pilot study of 224 patients who completed the\u000a      online treatment course found that 83% were either in remission or had\u000a      recovered upon completion of this course.e Feedback was\u000a      overwhelmingly positive, with responses including:\u000a    \u000a      \"The course is helping me think things through and I'm coping\u000a          better. I'm better able to catch and stop negative thoughts.\"\u000a        (Student, aged 22 years)\u000a      \"The online course with the follow-up phone calls is genius! It has\u000a          helped me so much and helped me get back to work.\" (Teacher, aged\u000a        40 years)\u000a      \"The anxiety session was a real eye-opener for me. Thanks for your\u000a          support. It has been a great resource.\" (Social worker, aged 46\u000a        years)\u000a    \u000a    NHS Choices is the online `front door' to the NHS, and is the\u000a      largest health website in the UK. The site hosts a webpage called the\u000a      `moodzone', which offers practical information and interactive tools for\u000a      people with subclinical mood-related issues. Williams was invited to\u000a      create a suite of eight CBT- based podcasts relating to low mood and\u000a      depression, which are based on the original `Overcoming depression and low\u000a      mood' series materials. The podcasts have been available online since\u000a      February 2013, and been collectively viewed 45,803 times by 31st\u000a      July 2013.f\u000a    AWARE Defeat Depression is a charity based in Northern Ireland and\u000a      the Republic of Ireland that delivers LLTTF life skills classes to groups.\u000a      In 2009 and 2010, the pilot course was delivered to 46 groups (with a\u000a      combined total of 356 people), including groups representing\u000a      ex-prison-officers, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals,\u000a      carers and women. The proportion of participants identified as being\u000a      depressed (according to a standardised depression questionnaire) dropped\u000a      from 73% at the start of the course to 12% after completion of the course.f\u000a      All participants said they would recommend the course to friends. The\u000a      success of the pilot study led to the uptake of LLTTF classes in the\u000a      Republic of Ireland by the Irish charity AWARE, which, in partnership with\u000a      the Tesco supermarket chain, provides ongoing financial support for CBT\u000a      classes in both urban and rural areas. Since June 2012, 1,336 people have\u000a      completed the six-week programme of life- skills classes, the completion\u000a      of which was associated with a 50% improvement in low mood (based on a\u000a      validated clinical questionnaire to assess severity of depression) and\u000a      high levels of satisfaction with the course, as suggested by the following\u000a      comments:h\u000a    \u000a      \"It changed how I dealt with situations and I have stuck with the\u000a          information given and been using it.\"\u000a      \"Realising my thoughts cause my feelings means I can now control my\u000a          feelings and make myself feel better.\"\u000a      \"Beneficial in terms of improving my understanding and providing\u000a          practical steps to take.\"\u000a    \u000a    Highlighting the value of self-help CBT, and improved access to it by\u000a      practitioner training and online resources, the Canadian Mental Health\u000a      Association (CMHA) adapted the \"Overcoming depression and low mood: a five\u000a      areas approach\" workbook with support and training from Professor\u000a      Williams.i Bounce Back, a CAN $6 million initiative, employs 26\u000a      staff members in British Columbia who offer on-referral, low-intensity\u000a      self-help CBT telephone support for patients in primary care with mild or\u000a      moderate depression.\u000a    There have been 22,475 patient referrals since the launch of this\u000a      programme in June 2008.j In a survey of 2,903 patients who\u000a      completed at least one of the 3-5 sessions offered, only 56% were\u000a      considered to be depressed after completion of the LLTTF course (compared\u000a      with 91% prior to the course).j Bounce Back also offers a DVD\u000a      version of the LLTTF course and has distributed about 67,000 copies.j\u000a      The CMHA also run life skills classes modelled on those run by AWARE and\u000a      people can self-book onto the classes at http:\/\/www.llttf.ca.\u000a      In 2010 and 2011, the CMHA piloted the website and classes; of the 228\u000a      participants who were surveyed in the pilot study, 85% found the course to\u000a      be useful and 91% said that they would recommend it to their friends.i\u000a      The LLTTF Canadian website provides on-going certified training to a\u000a      nationwide network of facilitators who provide CBT coaching for the same\u000a      LLTTF classes described above that AWARE offer; so far, 120 facilitators\u000a      from five Canadian states have been trained.k\u000a    In recognition of his sustained outstanding contribution to CBT and its\u000a      dissemination in the UK and internationally, in 2013 Williams was awarded\u000a      an Honorary Fellowship by the British Association for Behavioural &amp;\u000a      Cognitive Psychotherapies (BABCP), the leading body for CBT provision in\u000a      the UK.

Although CBT is recommended by clinical guidelines such as\u000a      those published by the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence\u000a      and the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, access to treatment\u000a      has typically been limited by the low number of expert CBT practitioners,\u000a      resulting in long waiting times. Consequently, more recently published\u000a      clinical guidelines recommend new ways of delivering CBT, such as\u000a      self-help books, computerised training, classes and group sessions, as\u000a      well as a stepped-care delivery approach &#8212; a tiered system that directs\u000a      patients to the lowest intensity form of therapy requiring less\u000a      practitioner support time. Here, the self-help materials deliver some of\u000a      the work of therapy. Using this system, most people with mild or moderate\u000a      depression can undergo a brief period of self-help CBT as a first step,\u000a      before deciding on longer-term care options. The challenge with adopting\u000a      this approach is to determine how best to deliver such a service within\u000a      existing clinical settings.\u000a    Since 2000, Professor Chris Williams (Professor of Psychosocial\u000a      Psychiatry, 2000-present) and his team at the University of Glasgow have\u000a      focused on evaluating new ways of delivering evidence-based CBT in a\u000a      non-clinical setting. At the heart of this research is the `five areas'\u000a      model, a CBT assessment tool that Williams developed at the University of\u000a      Leeds between 1997-1999, which enables mental health practitioners to\u000a      offer focused interventions for individual patients. A series of workbooks\u000a      entitled `Overcoming depression and low mood: a five areas approach',\u000a      first published in 2001, explains this model and provides a structured and\u000a      educational guide to self-help CBT intervention that can be used by both\u000a      practitioners and patients.1\u000a    Briefly, this involves individuals using either written, DVD or computer\u000a      based formats, to work through a checklist identifying how low mood or\u000a      anxiety is affecting them in five key areas of life: people and events\u000a      around them, their thinking, feelings, physical symptoms and behaviour.\u000a      Users then choose which areas to work on first, addressing the most common\u000a      problems encountered in that area using the appropriate workbook module,\u000a      which cover, for example, practical problem solving, being assertive, and\u000a      identifying then changing upsetting thoughts.\u000a    Since 2001, Williams has refined and updated content in response to\u000a      feedback from clinical mental health teams in Glasgow and elsewhere, with\u000a      new editions and also new books addressing medically unexplained symptoms,\u000a      postnatal depression, and depression in young people. Development has\u000a      ensured that the content, structure and language of the model can be\u000a      easily understood by healthcare practitioners from a range of different\u000a      specialties and patients with a broad range of cognitive abilities. For\u000a      example, terms such as \"selective abstraction\" and \"negative automatic\u000a      thoughts\" were replaced with \"putting a negative slant on things\" and\u000a      \"unhelpful thinking\", respectively. The second edition of the book (which\u000a      was published in 2006) was subsequently shown to have an average reading\u000a      age of 12.6 years, which is lower than the reading ages of almost all\u000a      other widely recommended self-help books for depression (generally ranging\u000a      from age 13.1-15.4 years). This is an important consideration given that\u000a      16% of the adult UK population has a reading age of less than 11 years.2,3\u000a    In the largest randomised controlled trial of a book-based CBT resource\u000a      to date, Williams' team evaluated the efficacy of providing the\u000a      \"Overcoming depression and low mood: a five areas approach\" series of\u000a      workbooks to 203 adult patients in a primary-care setting from 2004 to\u000a      2007. With brief support from a person who was not a mental-health expert,\u000a      the approach was highly effective, with 43% of patients considered to have\u000a      recovered after 4 months, compared with 25% of those who received usual\u000a      care (such as antidepressant medication) only.4\u000a    The introduction of guided self-help CBT approaches into clinical\u000a      services requires specialised staff training, and Williams' research led\u000a      to the first accredited course to address this requirement. The Structured\u000a      Psychosocial InteRventions in Teams (SPIRIT) course was designed to train\u000a      mental health practitioners in Glasgow. It consists of nearly 40 hours of\u000a      workshops on the use of the five areas CBT self-help resources and 5 hours\u000a      of staff supervision to support their use of the Overcoming depression\u000a      series of workbooks in clinical practice. When given to community and\u000a      inpatient mental health teams in NHS Greater Glasgow, this course led to\u000a      both short-term and long-term improvements in the knowledge and skills of\u000a      trained staff, as well as high levels of practitioner satisfaction of the\u000a      usefulness of the approach in clinical practice.5\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32323","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Context\u000d\u000a    By the late 1990s, concerns were growing about the global scale of the\u000d\u000a      obesity epidemic and high-profile health organisations sought to develop\u000d\u000a      public-health strategies to tackle the problem. The University of Glasgow\u000d\u000a      waist circumference Action Levels published 1995 were rapidly adopted by\u000d\u000a      the World Health Organisation (WHO) in its influential Technical Report\u000d\u000a      `Obesity: Preventing and Managing the Global Epidemic' released in 2000.a\u000d\u000a      Although the report did not include any citations to published research,\u000d\u000a      the WHO explicitly defined a waist circumference above 94 cm and 102 cm in\u000d\u000a      men, and above 80 cm and 88 cm for women, as corresponding to an increased\u000d\u000a      risk and a substantially increased risk, respectively, of obesity-related\u000d\u000a      illness within white populations. A statement from the Chairman of the WHO\u000d\u000a      committee confirms that University of Glasgow research (Lean et al.\u000d\u000a      1995a1) formed the evidence base for these cut-offs.b\u000d\u000a      Citation by the WHO gave the Glasgow Action Levels a global profile and\u000d\u000a      stimulated public-health impacts across the world. The WHO report is cited\u000d\u000a      by many of the campaigns that quote the University of Glasgow waist\u000d\u000a      circumference Action Levels. Indeed, since the exact values (94 cm in men\u000d\u000a      or 80 cm and 102 cm in men or 88 cm in women) stated by the waist\u000d\u000a      circumference Action Levels are entirely unique to the University of\u000d\u000a      Glasgow human nutrition research evidence-base, any publication or\u000d\u000a      guideline which cites these values can be considered an impact of this\u000d\u000a      research.\u000d\u000a    Incorporation in health promotion and disease risk screening\u000d\u000a          campaigns\u000d\u000a    The simplicity of measuring waist circumference and the ease of\u000d\u000a      interpretation of the Action Levels by the general public confer a\u000d\u000a      strategic advantage over previous BMI-focused messages and lend themselves\u000d\u000a      to inclusion in public-health initiatives. Since 2008, there has been a\u000d\u000a      flood of prominent public-health programmes targeting obesity and\u000d\u000a      obesity-related health risks. The waist circumference Action Levels\u000d\u000a      defined by the University of Glasgow have become the benchmarks in a broad\u000d\u000a      range of these campaigns internationally.c,d \u000d\u000a    For example, the charity Diabetes UK uses the University of Glasgow\u000d\u000a      Action Levels in their online materials to alert the public to the need\u000d\u000a      for weight loss to limit the risk of developing diabetes. Similarly, the\u000d\u000a      British Heart Foundation advocate the Glasgow Action Levels as a way to\u000d\u000a      determine if weight loss is required in order to `raise awareness of\u000d\u000a        shape as well as weight being important in relation to risk of coronary\u000d\u000a        heart disease'. To complement this, as part of their Heart Matters\u000d\u000a      campaign, the society offers a tape measure based on the `Waist Watcher'\u000d\u000a      in their welcome pack. The Waist Watcher tape is also available to buy\u000d\u000a      from online retail giant Amazon. Further UK campaigns that cite the\u000d\u000a      University of Glasgow Action Levels to promote weight loss and raise\u000d\u000a      awareness of the central obesity-related disease risks include the NHS\u000d\u000a      Choices `Why is my waist size important?' initiative, the British\u000d\u000a      Dietetic Association `Weight Wise' campaign and the Public Health\u000d\u000a      Agency, Northern Ireland information leaflet `Is your waistline\u000d\u000a        creeping up on you?'. Internationally, the University of Glasgow\u000d\u000a      Action Levels have been prolifically cited in health-promotion campaigns\u000d\u000a      from 2008 onwards, including `Healthy Weight &#8212; it's not a diet, it's a\u000d\u000a        lifestyle' (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA.),\u000d\u000a      `Healthy Waist' (Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada), `Measure\u000a        your waist' (National Heart Foundation of Australia), `Measure\u000d\u000a        Up' (Australian Government) and `Health@Work' (Hong Kong\u000d\u000a      Government).\u000d\u000a    Informing clinical guidelines and policies\u000d\u000a    The impact of the University of Glasgow Action Levels within clinical and\u000d\u000a      public-health medicine has been substantial.

However, the general public\u000d\u000a      cannot easily calculate BMI, and errors are often compounded by\u000d\u000a      overestimating height and underestimating weight. Moreover, BMI can be\u000d\u000a      misleading when applied to individuals with variable muscle mass.\u000d\u000a      University of Glasgow research led by Professor Mike Lean aimed to\u000d\u000a      identify a simpler and more reliable measure than BMI to classify body fat\u000d\u000a      and consequent disease risk that could primarily be used in\u000d\u000a      health-promotion initiatives. Although waist circumference had been\u000d\u000a      measured in some previous epidemiological studies, University of Glasgow\u000d\u000a      research was the first to investigate the independent relation of this\u000d\u000a      parameter to total body fat, and to propose cut-off values of waist\u000d\u000a      circumference for practical use.\u000d\u000a    Waist circumference established as valid indicator of total body\u000d\u000a          fat (1995-1997)\u000d\u000a    A population-based study conducted by Lean's group in 1995 measured\u000d\u000a      height, weight, waist-to-hip ratio and waist circumference in almost 2,000\u000d\u000a      Scottish men and women.1 Through comparison with conventional\u000d\u000a      BMI categories (BMI &gt;25 and &gt;30 indicating excess weight and\u000d\u000a      obesity, respectively), this study demonstrated that waist circumference\u000d\u000a      alone could provide comparable classification.1 The accuracy of\u000d\u000a      waist circumference for estimating body fat was further established with\u000d\u000a      underwater weighing as the reference method for body composition and\u000d\u000a      predictive equations for body fat content were developed, using simple\u000d\u000a      body measurements.2 Between 1996 and 1997, while working in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with groups in the Netherlands (led by Jacob Seidell at the\u000d\u000a      National Institute of Public Health and the Environment, Bilthoven, and\u000d\u000a      Paul Deurenberg at the University of Wageningen), the University of\u000d\u000a      Glasgow researchers further validated the predictive ability of waist\u000d\u000a      circumference using data from two existing international survey databases.\u000d\u000a      Waist circumference was shown to be a better predictor of both total body\u000d\u000a      fat and its distribution than BMI,3 even without adjusting for\u000d\u000a      height.4\u000d\u000a    Development of `Action Levels' for waist circumference (1995-1998)\u000d\u000a    The above work culminated in the definition of two key `Action Levels'\u000d\u000a      for waist circumference,1 which identify the need for weight\u000d\u000a      management among white populations:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      \u000aAction Level 1: a waist circumference over 94 cm in men or 80\u000d\u000a        cm in women signals that personal action is required.\u000d\u000a      \u000aAction Level 2: a waist circumference over 102 cm in men or 88\u000d\u000a        cm in women signals that professional advice should be sought.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    To address the issue of self-assessed waist circumference being\u000d\u000a      under-estimated, Lean's team developed the `Waist Watcher' &#8212; a push-button\u000d\u000a      tension-controlled tape measure with three intuitively coloured bands:(i)\u000d\u000a      green: waist circumference below Action Level 1; (ii) amber: waist\u000d\u000a      circumference between Action Levels 1 and 2; and (iii) red: waist\u000d\u000a      circumference above Action Level 2. The University of Glasgow researchers\u000d\u000a      showed that individuals could self-assess waist circumference\u000d\u000a      significantly more accurately using the Waist Watcher than they could with\u000d\u000a      a conventional tape measure (sensitivity and specificity for Waist Watcher\u000d\u000a      both above 95%).5\u000d\u000a    Action Levels for waist circumference correlate with risk of\u000d\u000a          chronic disease\u000d\u000a    By the late 1990s, the association between increased accumulation of body\u000d\u000a      fat &#8212; particularly with an intra-abdominal or `central' distribution &#8212; and\u000d\u000a      obesity-related ill-health became widely accepted. To determine the\u000d\u000a      ability of waist circumference to predict such disease risk, the\u000d\u000a      University of Glasgow researchers performed statistical correlations of\u000d\u000a      data on cardiovascular risk factors (type 2 diabetes, blood pressure,\u000d\u000a      cholesterol levels and lifestyle factors) with waist circumference\u000d\u000a      measurements from over 5,000 men and women.2 Individuals with a\u000d\u000a      waist circumference between Action Levels 1 and 2 were 1.5-2.0 times more\u000d\u000a      likely to be at cardiovascular risk than were those with a waist\u000d\u000a      circumference below Action Level 1. At a waist circumference above Action\u000d\u000a      Level 2, individuals had a 2.5-4.0 times greater risk.2 In\u000d\u000a      addition, other obesity-related symptoms (shortness of breath, impaired\u000d\u000a      physical function and lower back pain), as well as the prevalence of type\u000d\u000a      2 diabetes, were significantly greater among individuals with a waist\u000d\u000a      circumference above Action Level 2, even following adjustment for age and\u000d\u000a      lifestyle.6 Higher waist circumference measurements were also\u000d\u000a      associated with impaired quality of life, including reduced capacity for\u000d\u000a      performing everyday activities and increased likelihood of becoming\u000d\u000a      unemployed.\u000d\u000a    Key University of Glasgow researchers: Mike Lean (Professor\u000d\u000a      of Human Nutrition [1990-present]); Caroline Morrison (Honorary Clinical\u000d\u000a      Lecturer [2007-2010]).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"32342","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The Gay Men's Sexual Health (GMSH) Survey has provided robust evidence on\u000a      the sexual behaviours and prevention and testing activities of MSM in\u000a      Scotland since 1996. Since 2008, the findings have informed health\u000a      guidelines in Scotland, the UK and Europe and have been used in successful\u000a      NHS sexual health campaigns.\u000a    Health guidelines and practice\u000a    European level guidelines\u000a    The GMSH Survey findings &#8212; of rising infection levels and substantial\u000a      proportions of HIV-positive men undiagnosed at the time of survey &#8212; were\u000a      part of a wider body of similar findings from across the EU which formed\u000a      the evidence basea for guidance released in 2010 by the\u000a      European Centre for Disease Prevention &amp; Control (ECDC). The ECDC\u000a      states in its Guidance Report on HIV testing: increasing uptake and\u000a        effectiveness in the European Union that `the issue is the extent to\u000a      which people living with HIV who need treatment are unaware of their\u000a      infection' and identifies `low-risk perception' as an important barrier to\u000a      being tested.\u000a    UK level guidelines\u000a    National guidelines on safer sex were issued in 2012 by the British\u000a      Association for Sexual Health and HIV and the British HIV Association.b\u000a      These guidelines, provide guidance for practitioners in Level 3\u000a      Genitourinary medicine (GUM) services (Tier 5 in Scotland). The Glasgow\u000a      research is cited in the evidence-base for recommendations on repeat\u000a      testing for sexually transmitted infections (STIs, p12&#8212;13) which include\u000a      `HIV testing should be routinely recommended to all individuals attending\u000a      GUM or sexual health services. Pre- and post-test discussions and\u000a      counselling support should be available'.\u000a    Scottish guidelines\u000a    McDaid was invited to be part of the Scottish Government's HIV Action\u000a      Plan Groupc which produced the HIV Action Plan in Scotland:\u000a        March 2009 to March 2014.d As part of the Scottish\u000a      Government National Sexual Health &amp; HIV Advisory Committee, McDaid was\u000a      on the Project Groups tasked with the relevant actions in the HIV Action\u000a      Plan aimed at `Reducing levels of undiagnosed HIV and transmission in\u000a      Scotland' (specifically Action 7 and Action 9 Project Groups for the\u000a      periods May 2010&#8212;Dec 2011 and Mar 2011&#8212;Apr 2012 respectively). Action 7&#8212; `Systems\u000a        to monitor risk behaviours and new HIV infections among persons at\u000a        highest risk of acquiring infection will be reviewed and, if\u000a        appropriate, developed and implemented' &#8212; arose directly out of the\u000a      2005 GMSH survey findings and the recognised need to learn whether the\u000a      findings applied to broader geographical areas. Action 9 of the plan &#8212; `Existing\u000a        guidance on prevention of HIV transmission in MSM' &#8212; led to the\u000a      production of Health Protection Network Guidancee tailored to\u000a      national and\/or local circumstances. The survey findings (ref 5 and 6 in\u000a      section 3) contributed to the evidence base for the guidance and the\u000a      survey is given as an example of the behavioural outcome measures to use\u000a      in addressing research gaps and local needs assessments. The HIV Action\u000a      Plan was subsumed into the National Sexual Health &amp; Blood Borne\u000a      Viruses (BBV) Frameworkf published in 2011, which brought\u000a      together the two areas for the first time. The BBV Framework informs\u000a      practice across the Scottish NHS Boards and they are held accountable for\u000a      the delivery of the outcomes in the Framework.\u000a    Health practitioners and voluntary organisations\u000a    The insights gained through the GMSH survey were shared with health\u000a      practitioners and NGOs through informal channels, including local events\u000a      with voluntary organisations such as Gay Men's Health and Terence Higgins\u000a      Trust Scotland. Between 2008 and the present, McDaid has disseminated GMSH\u000a      survey findings to more than 150 healthcare practitioners and managers,\u000a      and voluntary sector workers. These events raised awareness on the current\u000a      risks, delivered Continuing Professional Development (CPD) training and\u000a      provided information to help inform the practice and delivery of services\u000a      to MSM in clinical settings.g,h McDaid was also twice invited\u000a      to present GMSH survey findings at Gaycon (in 2008 and 2012)i,\u000a      a biennial conference on gay and bisexual men's sexual health and\u000a      wellbeing attended by ~150 healthcare and public health practitioners, NGO\u000a      representatives and policy makers at local and national levels.\u000a    Public awareness and health campaigns in Scotland\u000a    Findings from the GMSH surveys have been covered extensively in the\u000a      mainstream media (e.g. BBC) and specialist press (e.g. NAM\/AidsMap article\u000a      warning of the `perfect storm' in HIV transmission, and a Nursing\u000a        Times article emphasising that `safer-sex' messages need to be\u000a      reinforced among gay men living with an HIV-positive diagnosis' and citing\u000a      University of Glasgow work4 in the article's first paragraph)j.\u000a      In the press coverage, attention was drawn to the high levels of\u000a      undiagnosed HIV-positive men and levels of HIV-positive men who were still\u000a      engaging in sexual risk behaviour. The GMSH survey findings have also\u000a      driven targeted HIV awareness campaigns in the Edinburgh, Lothian and\u000a      Glasgow areas, beginning in 2006 and continuing through 2009. Subsequent\u000a      GMSH surveys (2008 and 2011) have found consistently higher awareness of\u000a      HIV risk among respondents and a maintained increase of 23% more\u000a      respondents having been tested for HIV. In the 2008 survey, almost half\u000a      the men surveyed reported a recent HIV test; a substantial increase over\u000a      2005 findings. There had also been a decrease in undiagnosed HIV infection\u000a      (42% of men testing HIV positive were undiagnosed in 2005 compared with\u000a      26% in 2008).\u000a    `HIV: the comeback tour' was developed by a multi-agency group in Lothian\u000a      led by NHS Lothian. As a public information and social media campaign, it\u000a      aimed to increase HIV testing and condom use among gay and bisexual men\u000a      and was piloted in Edinburgh in 2007. The campaign materials and\u000a      information were created with direct input from the GMSH researchers, who\u000a      provided specific figures for the areas being targeted by the materials\u000a      and whose findings informed the general focus of the campaign.\u000a      Specifically, the GMSH finding that approximately 40% of HIV-positive men\u000a      in Scotland were undiagnosed was cited in campaign materials including\u000a      8,000 posters and postcards, which were distributed in clubs and bars\u000a      throughout Edinburgh's gay scene and more widely through primary care,\u000a      community (libraries and leisure centres) and local transport networks\u000a      (200 bus posters) in the city. External evaluation of the pilot phase\u000a      reflected increased awareness among MSM and a 23% increase in HIV testing\u000a      in Edinburgh. In 2008, in the lead-up to World Aids Day (1 December), NHS\u000a      Lothian announced the second phase of the campaign. This included a\u000a      roll-out to additional social venues, 126 GP surgeries, and 180 pharmacies\u000a      as well as libraries throughout the Lothian area; massive mobile\u000a      billboards carried on 20 regional buses in addition to the existing bus\u000a      posters; regular peer education sessions using trained volunteers;\u000a      internet outreach using specific websites such as Gaydar.com to promote\u000a      campaign messages, and further publicity in the media. For example, `ads'\u000a      for the `tour' featured in The List, and a series of `tour dates'\u000a      with `merchandise stalls' giving away postcards and leaflets on sexual\u000a      health, testing services etc.\u000a    The GMSH findings were instrumental in another high-profile campaign. Run\u000a      by NHS Greater Glasgow &amp; Clyde (NHSGG&amp;C), NHS Lanarkshire and NHS\u000a      Ayrshire &amp; Arran health boards, the `Make Your Position Clear' (MYPC)\u000a      campaigni was aimed at the estimated 50,000 gay and bisexual\u000a      men in the three health board regions.i This campaign resulted\u000a      in greater awareness of the risks of HIV and the need for prevention and\u000a      won a Silver Award in the 2010 Institute of Practitioners in Advertising\u000a      Effectiveness Awards, which judge healthcare-related communications. In a\u000a      presentation at Gaycon 2012, the NHSGG&amp;C delivered its evaluation of\u000a      MYPC (as part of a three-campaign social marketing programme which also\u000a      included HIV: the Comeback Tour). NHSGG&amp;C reports that in a survey on\u000a      Gaydar.com, one of the channels used by the campaigns, 72% of people\u000a      agreed that the campaign had made them think about the risks of HIV; 57%\u000a      said it had made them consider getting tested; and 41% said they had\u000a      gained new knowledge about HIV and testing. In the campaign evaluation,\u000a      which surveyed 822 MSM in Glasgow, those with mid-to- high exposure to\u000a      MYPC were more likely to have been tested for HIV (but not STIs) in the\u000a      previous 6 months. These findings informed the use of social marketing\u000a      interventions by NHSGG&amp;C.h\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Men who have sex with men (MSM) are at highest risk of acquiring HIV in\u000a      the UK and an estimated one-quarter of HIV-infected MSM have not been\u000a      diagnosed. The Gay Men's Sexual Health (GMSH) Survey, conducted by\u000a      University of Glasgow researchers, has provided robust evidence of sexual\u000a      behaviours as well as prevention and testing activities of MSM in Scotland\u000a      since 1996.

This\u000a      community-based questionnaire survey of gay, bisexual and other MSM is\u000a      conducted in exclusively gay commercial venues (bars and saunas) in\u000a      Glasgow and Edinburgh, Scotland's two largest cities and the main\u000a      commercial centres of the Scottish gay scene. Around 1500 men are surveyed\u000a      each year.\u000a    The survey was originally designed to evaluate a peer-led, sexual health\u000a      intervention set up by the Gay Men's Task Force (GMTF) and modelled on a\u000a      US intervention. GMTF was a bar-based, peer- led intervention designed to\u000a      increase sexual health service use and decrease sexual risk behaviours at\u000a      the community level.1 The initial findings of this survey\u000a      called into question the transferability of sexual health interventions\u000a      from one region to another, because the GMTF failed to replicate the\u000a      successful results of the US intervention.1 The survey,\u000a      repeated every 3 years, presented the opportunity to measure\u000a      community-level changes in sexual behaviour and sexual health service use\u000a      across time. The most notable finding was an increase in sexual risk\u000a      behaviour between 1996 and 2002.2 In 1996, 10.7% of men\u000a      surveyed (and 11.2% in 1999) reported unprotected anal intercourse (UAI)\u000a      with casual partners. This increased markedly to 18.6% in 2002. UAI with\u000a      more than one partner increased from 8.1% in 1996 to 13.7% in 2002. There\u000a      was also a significant increase in men reporting that they `knew' their\u000a      casual partners' HIV status, despite no increase in HIV testing among men\u000a      who reported UAI with casual partners.2 The Glasgow research\u000a      group argued that this finding could represent `prevention failure' on the\u000a      part of governments and health agencies.2\u000a    Between 2005 and 2011, the Glasgow group collected oral fluid samples\u000a      from the gay, bisexual and other MSM who took part in the survey for\u000a      anonymous HIV testing to improve the estimate of HIV prevalence and\u000a      undiagnosed infection in this population. These were the first data on HIV\u000a      prevalence and undiagnosed infection among a community-based sample of gay\u000a      men in Scotland; 4% of the men tested were HIV-positive, and of these, 42%\u000a      were undiagnosed.3 In collaboration with University College\u000a      London (UCL), data from surveys of gay men in London, Brighton, and\u000a      Manchester in 2003 and 2004 were combined with the Scottish data from 2005\u000a      to examine factors associated with undiagnosed HIV infection. The results,\u000a      published in 20084, revealed that most men with undiagnosed HIV\u000a      had previously tested HIV-negative, suggesting a need to promote frequent\u000a      repeat testing among high-risk men to reduce the levels of undiagnosed HIV\u000a      and ultimately the number of new infections in the UK.\u000a    The Glasgow group demonstrated that changes to HIV testing policy to\u000a      opt-out testing introduced in 2005, significantly increased recent testing\u000a      from 33.2% to 48.3% among gay men in Scotland between 2005 and 2008 and\u000a      potentially contributed to a substantial reduction in levels of\u000a      undiagnosed HIV from the 42% seen in 2005 to 26% in 2008.5\u000a      However, analysis of the survey findings between 1996 and 2008 also show\u000a      that HIV-related sexual risk behaviour is not diminishing, with the number\u000a      of men reporting UAI with more than one partner in 2008 remaining at the\u000a      level previously reported in 2002 (13.1%).6\u000a    Key researchers: Dr Lisa McDaid (n&#233;e Williamson; Research\u000a      Assistant [2000] then Senior Investigator Scientist [to 2010] then\u000a      Programme Leader Track [to 2012] then Programme Leader [to present]) and\u000a      Professor Graham Hart (Programme Leader and Associate Director, 1994&#8212;2005)\u000a      both McDaid and Hart are\/were members of the Medical Research\u000a      Council\/Chief Scientist Office (MRC\/CSO) SPHSU during the research period.\u000a      On 1 June 2013, the SPHSU was transferred to the Institute of Health and\u000a      Wellbeing at the University of Glasgow and SPHSU staff became employees of\u000a      the University.

Current estimates\u000a      suggest that more than 7000 European and American adults die of\u000a      cardiovascular disease every day. Heart disease, a major form of\u000a      cardiovascular disease, is a broad term used to describe heart failure,\u000a      heart attack and angina, all of which present a substantial economic\u000a      burden to healthcare services. For example, in 2010-2011, it is estimated\u000a      that the NHS spent in excess of &#163;2 billion on patients with heart failure,\u000a      with around 70% of this expenditure reflecting hospitalisation. Medical\u000a      therapy limits heart disease progression and patients are typically\u000a      treated with a lifelong prescription of multiple classes of drugs. Since\u000a      2008, landmark clinical trials with leadership involvement of the RCB have\u000a      led to the expansion of therapeutic options for patients with heart\u000a      failure.\u000a    Regulatory approval\u000a    Conducting well-designed RCTs to determine whether medications are safe\u000a      and effective is the lynchpin of gaining regulatory approval for their use\u000a      in patients. Ivabradine (brand name, Procoralan) was originally approved\u000a      by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2005 specifically for the\u000a      treatment of long-term angina among people with normal heart rhythm. The\u000a      findings of BEAUTIFUL prompted the manufacturer of this drug (leading\u000a      French pharmaceutical company Servier) to apply for an extension to the\u000a      original indication (angina).a In October 2009, the EMA\u000a      approved ivabradine as an add-on therapy (on top of beta blockers) for the\u000a      treatment of long-term angina in patients with coronary artery disease and\u000a      normal heart rhythm.b The BEAUTIFUL study (CL3-056) was\u000a      extensively cited as key supporting evidence for clinical benefit and\u000a      acceptable safety profile in this application (sections I.2.2 and I.2.3).\u000a      In March 2012, the EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use\u000a      (CHMP) granted a further request by Servier to extend the indications for\u000a      ivabradine to include patients with chronic heart failure.b The\u000a      SHIFT study (CL3-16257-063) was cited as the sole supporting evidence in\u000a      the CHMP assessment report (sections 1.1, 2.1, 2.3, 2.4 and 3).\u000a      Consequently, the CHMP recommendation for this novel use of ivabradine\u000a      (variation C.I.6.a; section 4) was based entirely on information made\u000a      available by the SHIFT investigators.\u000a    Commenting on the key role of the RCB in this approval process, Servier's\u000a      Director of the Division for Medical Affairs stated that `The\u000a        internationally recognised combination of outstanding biostatistical\u000a        skill, knowledge of the disease area and experience in large\u000a        cardiovascular clinical outcome trials...highlighted the synergy between\u000a        the [RCBs] expertise and our own research aims in developing treatments\u000a        for heart disease...[the] findings of BEAUTIFUL and particularly SHIFT\u000a        were pivotal in Servier's successful application to the EMA in 2012 to\u000a        extend the original licence for ivabradine in stable angina to include\u000a        heart failure'.a\u000a    The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) is responsible for assessing new\u000a      treatments for use within NHS Scotland. The SMC approved the restricted\u000a      use of ivabradine for chronic heart failure in September 2012, citing\u000a      SHIFT as the sole evidence base for this decision.c In November\u000a      2012, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)\u000a      approved ivabradine for this application throughout the NHS.d\u000a      The NICE technical appraisal document (TA 267) cites SHIFT in the evidence\u000a      as the \"only randomised controlled trial that assessed the effect of\u000a        ivabradine in people with heart failure\" (section 3.1). Regulatory\u000a      approval of ivabradine in 2012 was widely reported by major UK media\u000a      outlets, including the Telegraph, Guardian, Mail\u000a        Online and Daily Mirror, reaching a potential audience of\u000a      approximately 9 million.e Specialist coverage included NHS\u000a      Choices, theheart.org, and the British Heart Foundation.\u000a    Generic drug formulations can significantly lower health costs and\u000a      improve access to treatment once brand-name drugs come off patent.

This RCT examined the effect of the beta-blocker carvedilol in 1,959\u000a      patients from 17 countries worldwide with abnormal heart function (left\u000a      ventricular dysfunction) following a heart attack. Treatment with\u000a      carvedilol (on top of background ACE inhibitor therapy) led to a 23%\u000a      reduction in mortality during follow-up (average 1.3 years), supporting\u000a      the use of beta-blockers in this patient population.1\u000a    Nicorandil is cardioprotective in patients with stable angina\u000a    Stable angina is a form of chest pain or discomfort that occurs upon\u000a      exertion and results from poor blood flow through the arteries of the\u000a      heart. The pioneering IONA study was designed, conducted and analysed by\u000a      the RCB, with Ford serving on the Steering Committee. This RCT assessed\u000a      the effects of nicorandil (a drug that maintains blood flow to the heart)\u000a      on morbidity and mortality among 5,126 patients, recruited from across the\u000a      UK, with stable angina pectoris. The findings of IONA (2002) showed a 17%\u000a      reduction in the risk of coronary events and deaths in patients being\u000a      treated with nicorandil compared with placebo.2\u000a    Ivabradine reduces cardiovascular events in heart failure patients\u000a          with elevated heart rate\u000a    Elevated heart rate is an established risk factor for cardiovascular\u000a      events. BEAUTIFUL was the first RCT to examine the effect of ivabradine (a\u000a      drug that lowers heart rate) on cardiovascular events. This study involved\u000a      10,917 patients with coronary disease and left ventricular dysfunction who\u000a      were recruited internationally. Whilst ivabradine did not affect the\u000a      composite primary endpoint in the general trial population, the results\u000a      established the importance of a heart rate over 70 beats per minute (bpm)\u000a      in identifying high-risk patients and those who might benefit from\u000a      heart-rate-lowering therapy.3 The ground-breaking SHIFT study\u000a      of 6,558 patients demonstrated the ability of ivabradine to reduce\u000a      cardiovascular death or hospital admission for heart failure by 18% among\u000a      individuals with a heart rate above 70bpm.4 SHIFT was the first\u000a      RCT to provide robust evidence that lowering heart rate can specifically\u000a      reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events, and provide an additional\u000a      therapy on top of the maximally tolerated beta-blocker dose to further\u000a      improve outcomes for patients with heart failure. Ford had key roles on\u000a      the Executive Committees of BEAUTIFUL and SHIFT, which were designed and\u000a      analysed with considerable involvement of the RCB.\u000a    Implantable devices to enable early detection of fluid accumulation\u000a          in heart failure patients\u000a    Progressive worsening of heart failure results in fluid accumulation in\u000a      the lungs and peripheral tissues, which requires emergency hospitalisation\u000a      and urgent in-patient intensification of therapy to relieve fluid\u000a      overload. Contrary to expectations, the DOT-HF trial determined that\u000a      implantation of expensive devices to detect fluid accumulation at an early\u000a      stage and intensify treatment as an out-patient resulted in higher rather\u000a      than lower rate of heart failure hospitalisation (and no improvement in\u000a      any other outcome). This negative result was important as it challenged\u000a      the rationale that the use of expensive technology to detect and manage\u000a      fluid overload could improve patient outcomes in patients with heart\u000a      failure.5\u000a    In summary, the RCB held leading roles in these four major projects\u000a      providing vital, independent analysis in all of these practice-changing\u000a      trials &#8212; an important point given that the individual members of steering\u000a      committees and trial management groups differed across all four trials.\u000a    Key University of Glasgow researchers: Ian Ford (Professor of\u000a      Statistics\/Biostatistics [1992-present] all trials above); Michele\u000a      Robertson (Consultant statistician [1994-2008], Senior statistician,\u000a      [2008-2010], Assistant Director Commercial Biostatistics [2010-present];\u000a      CAPRICORN, BEAUTIFUL and SHIFT); Henry Dargie (Professor of Cardiology\u000a      [1994-1999], Honorary Senior Research Fellow [1999-present]; Steering\u000a      committee CAPRICORN, IONA); William Hillis (Professor of Cardiovascular\u000a      and Exercise Medicine [1997-2008]; Steering committee IONA).

Between going live in\u000a      September 2012 and 31st July 2013, there were 1180 registered\u000a      users, primarily doctors.c\u000a    Incorporation of the CARE Measure in RCGP professional training\u000a          standards to facilitate assessment, appraisal and revalidation\u000a    The MRCGP exam is a compulsory assessment system that complies with the\u000a      standards set by the UK's GMC. It confirms a doctor's competence in the\u000a      speciality of General Practice and ability to practice independently in\u000a      the UK. Completion of the MRCGP is a pre-requisite for the certificate of\u000a      completion of training (CCT) and full RCGP membership. Since August 2007,\u000a      the CARE Measure (renamed Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ) by the\u000a      RCGPd) has been used as a compulsory evidence-based tool in the\u000a      Workplace-Based Assessment component of the MRCGP Exame. In\u000a      this capacity, the PSQ allows patient feedback to be gathered on empathy\u000a      and relationship-building with each GP trainee. Two cycles of the PSQ are\u000a      used during the training period: once in GP placement in Speciality\u000a      Training year 1 or year 2 and once in Speciality Training year 3.e\u000a      The RCGP estimates that with approximately 3,000 GP trainees each year, an\u000a      average of 33,000 cycles of PSQ were completed by trainees between 1st\u000a      Jan 2008 and 31st July 2013.e The decision by RCGP\u000a      to adopt the CARE Measure was based on its proven ability to effectively\u000a      discriminate between doctors [references 3 and 4, above].\u000a    iMAP is the process whereby independent practitioners on the GP register\u000a      may become members of the RCGP. Assessment for membership on this basis\u000a      requires the completion of fifteen compulsory modules, one of which\u000a      specifically addresses the PSQ. The PSQ was initially the only tool to\u000a      facilitate this when iMAP was launched in 2007.f It is now one\u000a      of seven tools approved; encouraging its uptake, it is the only tool\u000a      available free of charge.g The RCGP estimates that since 2007,\u000a      approximately 30% of applicants to iMAP used the PSQ.f The\u000a      decision by RCGP to adopt the CARE Measure was based on its proven ability\u000a      to effectively discriminate between doctors [references 3 and 4, above].\u000a    Revalidation is the process by which all 60,000 licensed doctors must\u000a      demonstrate to the GMC that they are up to date and fit to practice; this\u000a      ensures compliance with the relevant professional standards, and is thus\u000a      compulsory to maintain a license to practice. To determine its suitability\u000a      for use in revalidation, the CARE Measure has twice been comprehensively\u000a      reviewed by the RCGP; in 2009 it was one of nine patient feedback tools\u000a      reviewed,h and in 2010 it was one of ten reviewed.h\u000a      Subsequently, the CARE Measure has been fully endorsed by RCGP as a `fit\u000a      for purpose' patient survey for use in the revalidation process.h,i\u000a      The CARE Measure is used by GPs in Scotland as both a patient satisfaction\u000a      survey and for appraisal and revalidation; it is listed in the Scottish\u000a      Online Appraisal Resource (the key online information point for GP\u000a      Appraisal).j,k Since 2004, it has been accredited for use in\u000a      appraisal of all GPs in Scotland.l The decision by the GMC to\u000a      adopt the CARE Measure was based on its proven ability to effectively\u000a      discriminate between doctors [references 3-6, above].\u000a    Implementation of the CARE Measure into government policy\u000a    In Scotland, the CARE Measure is detailed in the Government's Quality\u000a      Strategy (2010).m The Quality Strategy aims to allow those\u000a      involved in Scotland's healthcare &#8212; namely all healthcare professionals\u000a      (numbering 100,000), partners and the public &#8212; to work towards achieving\u000a      three Quality Ambitions of Safe, Person-Centred and Effective healthcare.\u000a      The Quality Strategy specifies the use of the CARE Measure as a tool to\u000a      capture patients' assessments of their relationships with healthcare\u000a      professionals, allowing an understanding of health outcomes and patient\u000a      experience to be determined, and for improvement to be informed where\u000a      required.m Inclusion of the CARE Measure has made Scotland the\u000a      first country in the world to include staff empathy as a component of\u000a      healthcare quality. The decision by the Government to adopt the CARE\u000a      Measure was based on its proven ability to effectively discriminate\u000a      between practitioners [references 3-6, above], and by a series of\u000a      high-level meetings and discussion between Mercer and the Scottish\u000a      Government between 2009-2010, including the Chief Executive of NHS\u000a      Scotland at the time (Dr Derek Feeley) and the then Cabinet Secretary and\u000a      Minister for Health, Nicola Sturgeon.\u000a    Implementation of the CARE Measure as a validated Patient\u000a          Reported Experience Measure\u000a    Since 2012, the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy has recommended the\u000a      CARE Measure to their 52,000 members (98% of UK physiotherapists).n\u000a      In this context, the CARE Measure is being used by the Chartered Society\u000a      of Physiotherapy as the primary validated Patient Reported Experience\u000a      Measure, to assess and improve Physiotherapy services along with the\u000a      overall patient journey.n The CARE Measure became a\u000a      recommendation after a 2009 Scottish pilot study (collaboration between\u000a      University of Glasgow and University of Stirling) associated with\u000a      Physiotherapy training and person centred care, which subsequently led to\u000a      involvement in validation work in Allied Health Professionals.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The ability of healthcare professionals to empathise with patients has\u000a      been shown to enhance patient satisfaction, improve symptoms and promote\u000a      well-being.

The research steps undertaken between\u000a      2000-2003 were:\u000a    Firstly, following an extensive literature review, Mercer highlighted the\u000a      importance of empathy in healthcare, whilst confirming a lack of validated\u000a      measures suitable for use in primary care1. Secondly, Mercer\u000a      led the initial development and preliminary validation of the CARE Measure\u000a      in primary care.2 An important aspect of this was the\u000a      collaborative approach taken to the measure's development and testing,\u000a      which involved patients and practitioners from both high and low\u000a      socioeconomic deprivation areas.2 The aim of developing the\u000a      measure in this manner was to ensure it was meaningful to all patients,\u000a      irrespective of their deprivation level, which was deemed to be important\u000a      given the wide health inequalities that exist in Scotland and indeed the\u000a      UK. Thirdly, Mercer led a major study on more than 3,000 patients (again\u000a      in areas of high and low deprivation) which confirmed the validity and\u000a      reliability of the CARE Measure in General Practice, and its ability to\u000a      effectively discriminate between qualified GPs; thus establishing\u000a      its utility in GP assessment.3 This research, carried out at\u000a      the University of between 2000-2003 and published in international\u000a      peer-reviewed journals, laid the academic foundation for the subsequent\u000a      adoption of the measure `by RCGP Scotland for use in GP Appraisal.

The handbook is widely used within the Department of Health\u000a      and across the NHS and was also a major contributor to the development of\u000a      the Department of Health Best Practice Guidance (2009; D).\u000a    Impact on public expenditure\u000a    Modelling work by NICE showed that utilising risk scores in a screening\u000a      programme is cost-effective and is likely to be cost-saving in those from\u000a      black and minority ethnic backgrounds. Work carried out by the Centre\u000a      shows that the cost per case detected is lowered significantly, from &#163;350\u000a      to around &#163;200, by incorporating risk scores (E).\u000a    Impact on public health in the UK\u000a    Clinical commissioning groups: The self-assessment tool is being\u000a      used by clinical commissioning groups around the country at screening\u000a      events. It is also used to target people for the NHS Health Check, a\u000a      programme to prevent heart disease, stroke, diabetes and kidney disease.\u000a      Here it identifies those at high risk, who can then be given support and\u000a      lifestyle interventions to reduce their risk and prevent onset of these\u000a      conditions.\u000a    Healthy Lifestyle roadshows: Diabetes UK has used the\u000a      self-assessment tool at local road shows since 2011. In 2012 (latest\u000a      available figures) they carried out 20,911 risk assessments and referred\u000a      10,945 visitors, 3,700 of whom were at high risk of having or developing\u000a      T2DM in the next 10 years. In a survey conducted in 2011, of those who\u000a      were in these higher risk categories, 69% had been to their general\u000a      practice or intend to go. Recall of the risk factors for T2DM and how to\u000a      reduce risk was high among visitors two months after attending the road\u000a      show (F).\u000a    Evaluation of the use of the self-assessment score within Diabetes UK\u000a      activities showed that after being risk assessed: 41% had started to eat\u000a      more healthily and a further 44% intended to; 33% had increased their\u000a      physical activity levels and a further 43% intended to; and 44% of those\u000a      referred to their GP had been to their GP to seek a test. Bridget Turner\u000a      of Diabetes UK says: \"The diabetes risk score plays an important part in\u000a      encouraging more people to take greater notice of their health and their\u000a      lifestyles &#8212; helping to tackle the growing public health challenge of Type\u000a      2 diabetes and working towards earlier diagnosis and prevention.\" (G).\u000a    Community Champions: Diabetes UK has embarked on a programme of\u000a      awareness-raising within black and minority ethnic communities by\u000a      recruiting 'Community Champions' &#8212; volunteers who are trained to deliver\u000a      healthy lifestyle and diabetes awareness messages, through information\u000a      stands and talks at community centres, places of worship and at festivals\u000a      and events. Over 100 champions have been trained in London, and the\u000a      programme is being rolled out in four other towns across England. Some\u000a      champions have been trained to undertake the risk assessments.\u000a    Faith centres: The test has been used with 200 people in three\u000a      faith centres in Leicester, by interpreters using iPads. It is being\u000a      adapted for use by non-English speaking Guajarati speakers.\u000a    Pharmacies: In conjunction with Diabetes UK the self-assessment\u000a      test is available in Boots and Tesco pharmacies: the latter is advertising\u000a      the service on buses, taxis, and London Underground carriages; on radio\u000a      stations and online; and in shopping centres and on high streets across\u000a      the UK In Northern Ireland during Diabetes Week 2011, Diabetes UK ran a\u000a      risk assessment event in 11 Boots stores: 140 risk assessments were\u000a      carried out, with 25 people referred to their GP. The Regional Pharmacy\u000a      Manager, Boots, said: \"We were delighted with the success of our recent\u000a      work with Diabetes UK Northern Ireland. In helping to identify patients\u000a      who are at high risk of diabetes, we can work with other healthcare\u000a      professionals to ensure an early diagnosis is made and help people reduce\u000a      their risk.\" (H).\u000a    In Wales, the self-assessment score was used in 700 pharmacies as part of\u000a      a free health check initiative; the 10-day Diabetes UK Cymru\/Community\u000a      Pharmacy Wales project 2011. This project involved an extensive media\u000a      campaign. More than 17,500 people visited their local pharmacy for the\u000a      assessment with 1,478 (8.4%) being referred to their GP for a diabetes\u000a      test after being found to be at high risk of developing the condition (I).\u000a    Online and TV: The test has been available on the Diabetes UK\u000a      website since 2011 and is now on the Boots and Tesco websites, free of\u000a      charge. It has been used by over 260,000 people since July 2011. It was\u000a      featured in the Embarrassing Bodies programme (Channel 4, 6 June 2011),\u000a      reaching around 2 million viewers. The automated tool allows for targeted\u000a      population-based screening within primary care and is available on the\u000a      University's website. It will soon be available through the Royal College\u000a      of General Practitioners website.\u000a    International impact\u000a    Khunti and Gray are part of the International Diabetes Federation's\u000a      PREDICT 2 project which is developing a global risk score to be used in\u000a      developing countries. Gray is currently developing risk scores for use in\u000a      Portugal and Spain.\u000a    Awards\u000a    Davies was awarded a prestigious NIHR Senior Investigator status in 2009\u000a      and this was renewed to the maximum term in 2012. The risk scores were\u000a      awarded gold at the national Quality in Care (QIC) Diabetes Awards 2011\u000a      for the best early detection\/screening initiative, and Gray won the Best\u000a      Presentation Prize at the World Congress for the Prevention of Diabetes\u000a      2011.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Around 2.5 million people in the UK have Type 2 diabetes, with many more\u000a      in a pre-diabetic state, Both conditions are hard to detect and frequently\u000a      remain undiagnosed and untreated for years. The cost burden to the NHS of\u000a      eventual treatment is estimated at &#163;10 billion; 80% of which is spent on\u000a      complications that are, with good care, avoidable. Targeted diabetes\u000a      prevention programmes could aid in prevalence reduction and associated\u000a      costs. Leicester's Diabetes Research Centre has developed two risk scores,\u000a      both suitable for use with an ethnically diverse UK population, to detect\u000a      these conditions: a self-assessment questionnaire and a general practice\u000a      database tool.

In the\u000a      UK around 10% of the adult population over 45 has T2DM, and diabetes\u000a      prevalence is increasing steadily due to an ageing population, high\u000a      obesity levels and a more ethnically diverse make-up. T2DM is preceded by\u000a      a pre-diabetic state called impaired glucose regulation (IGR).\u000a      Population-based screening studies have shown that around 20% of the adult\u000a      population over 45 has an undiagnosed glucose disorder and this prevalence\u000a      is significantly higher (up to six times) in those from black and minority\u000a      ethnic groups.\u000a    Need for novel screening strategies\u000a    Leicester's Diabetes Research Centre, one of the largest of its kind in\u000a      Europe, focuses on finding new ways of identifying people at high risk of\u000a      diabetes as well as developing effective interventions to stop, slow and\u000a      treat the condition.\u000a    In 2007, a study reported in the BMJ showed that timely treatment with\u000a      medication or modifications to lifestyle can delay or prevent progression\u000a      to T2DM in people with IGR, as well as the development of complications\u000a      such as heart and renal disease in people with T2DM (1). Despite\u000a      the evidence for these benefits, uptake in screening programmes is\u000a      generally low, and lower still in black and minority ethnic populations. A\u000a      qualitative study identified a number of barriers to uptake of screening:\u000a      the time commitment involved in attending a long appointment during\u000a      working hours, low self-perception of risk, difficulties with arranging\u000a      general practice appointments, and dislike of oral glucose tolerance tests\u000a      (2). The findings highlighted the need for novel screening\u000a      strategies.\u000a    Two self-assessment scores for an ethnically diverse population\u000a    In 2008, the Centre offered screening within 20 general practices to\u000a      30,950 randomly selected people from Leicestershire, who had not been\u000a      previously diagnosed with T2DM (3). Of these, 6,390 took up the\u000a      offer, and a fifth were identified as either having undiagnosed T2DM or at\u000a      high-risk of developing the disease. A comprehensive set of data &#8212; sex,\u000a      BMI, waist circumference, family history of diabetes, history of high\u000a      blood pressure and ethnicity &#8212; as well as oral glucose tolerance tests,\u000a      was collected from all those attending.\u000a    This data was used to develop two scores to detect undiagnosed IGR or\u000a      T2DM in an ethnically diverse population; the results were published in\u000a      leading journals Diabetic Medicine and Diabetologia (4,5). The\u000a      Leicester Self-Assessment (LSA) score is based on factors known to the\u000a      patient and the Leicester Practice Risk (LPR) score is designed to enable\u000a      general practices to identify those at highest risk in their populations,\u000a      using routinely stored data (minus waist circumference). These are the\u000a      first scores that have been specifically developed or validated in a UK\u000a      multi-ethnic population. Both scores were externally validated using data\u000a      from a second screening study (6).\u000a    Clinical trials\u000a    The tools have been successfully used to identify those at risk in\u000a      clinical studies led by the Centre: the Let's Prevent Diabetes trial used\u000a      the LPR score to rank people by risk of IGR\/T2DM within general practices,\u000a      and those with the highest 10% of scores were then invited for\u000a      second-stage screening and a quarter of those screened were found to have\u000a      either IGR or T2DM (7). Similar results were seen for a study into\u000a      the Walking Away from Diabetes programme, a 3-hour course which offers\u000a      participants the opportunity to explore their risk of developing diabetes\u000a      and to identify the changes they need to make to remain healthy. The\u000a      self-assessment score is being used in two CLAHRC (Collaboration for\u000a      Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care) early detection studies,\u000a      ATTEND and PRISM, which have screened over 3,000 participants to date.\u000a    Key Leicester researchers: Melanie Davies, Professor of Diabetes\u000a      Medicine, 2006-present; Kamlesh Khunti, Professor of Primary Care Diabetes\u000a      and Vascular Medicine, 2007-present; Dr Laura Gray, Lecturer of Population\u000a      and Public Health Sciences, 2008-present\u000a    Other Leicester researchers: Dr Clare Gillies, Lecturer in Medical\u000a      Statistics, 2000-present; Dr Helen Eborall, Lecturer in Social Sciences,\u000a      2008-present; Dr Margaret Stone, Sen.

The impact NICE has made since its inauguration is acknowledged\u000a      to be partly\u000a      attributable to the high quality of the independent academic reports\u000a      delivered in tight timescales.\u000a      NICE guidelines are now recognised to be of importance throughout the\u000a      developed world 3 The\u000a      Exeter based PenTAG group has contributed greatly to this process through\u000a      its many reports for\u000a      NICE and its methodological research.\u000a    The specific project (HTA 09\/87\/01) was commissioned by the NETSCC HTA\u000a      programme on\u000a      behalf of NICE in November 2009 with the title `The effectiveness and\u000a      cost-effectiveness of\u000a      donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and memantine for the treatment of\u000a      Alzheimer's disease\u000a      (Review of TA111)'. The project was to review and update the evidence\u000a      presented to NICE in 2004\u000a      of how good a number of drugs were for treating Alzheimer's disease. The\u000a      assessment would also\u000a      assess whether the reviewed drugs were likely to be considered good value\u000a      for money for the\u000a      NHS. The final technology appraisal report, consisting of systematic\u000a      reviews, meta-analyses and\u000a      mixed treatment comparisons of RCTs (both the new evidence alone and\u000a      cumulatively with\u000a      previous evidence), systematic reviews of cost-effectiveness evaluations,\u000a      critical appraisals of\u000a      three manufacturer submissions and a de novo cost-effectiveness model was\u000a      submitted in June\u000a      2010 and considered by the NICE Appraisal Committee in August 2010 3.\u000a    In the previous guidance NICE in 2004 had recommended that donepezil,\u000a      galantamine and\u000a      rivastigmine could be used for people with moderate Alzheimer's disease\u000a      but memantine could\u000a      only be used in clinical trials.\u000a    The report from PenTAG 4was the key piece of evidence that\u000a      informed the decision by NICE's\u000a      Appraisal Committee to provide its 2011 guidance, which extended the\u000a      availability of donepezil,\u000a      galantamine and rivastigmine to people with mild Alzheimer's disease, and\u000a      allowed memantine to\u000a      be used with those with severe forms of the disease for the first time5.\u000a      This guidance was released\u000a      in March 2011. It is mandatory for NHS commissioners to adhere to any\u000a      technology appraisal\u000a      guidance released. Data for prescribing in England published on the NHS\u000a      Health and Social Care\u000a      website indicates that there has been a massive increase in use of these\u000a      drugs between 2010, the\u000a      year before the 2011 NICE guidance was released, and 2012, the first\u000a      complete year after\u000a      (although arguably the full extent of the effect on prescribing may not be\u000a      seen until the 2013, the\u000a      data for which are not yet available). Between 2010 and 2012 donepezil use\u000a      increased by 41%,\u000a      rivastigmine by 51% and memantine by 278%, with 3% decrease in use of\u000a      galantamine6,7. Based\u000a      on the results of the economic model in our HTA we estimate that there\u000a      were 110,000 persons with\u000a      \"untreated\" mild Alzheimer's disease in England and Wales at the time of\u000a      the change in guidance\u000a      and if these individuals are now prescribed either donepezil or\u000a      galantamine or rivastigmine we can\u000a      expect on average cognition to be improved by 4% (absolute increase) in\u000a      this population and there\u000a      to be a cumulative delay in time to admission to long term care of 13,000\u000a      person\/years. Similarly\u000a      we estimate that there were 103,000 persons with \"untreated\" severe\u000a      Alzheimer's disease in\u000a      England and Wales at the time of the change in guidance and if these\u000a      individuals are now\u000a      prescribed memantine we can expect on average cognition to be improved by\u000a      3% (absolute\u000a      increase) in this population and there to be a cumulative delay in time to\u000a      admission to long term\u000a      care of 8,000 person\/years, with consequential large financial savings.\u000a    The change in decision about recommended drugs was directly attributed by\u000a      NICE to change in\u000a      the evidence, the key source of which was PenTAG's independent academic\u000a      report8,9,10. The NICE\u000a      decision on drugs for Alzheimer's disease thus provides a clear example of\u000a      how PenTAG's\u000a      research makes an impact on national policy making, and the important\u000a      influence of the\u000a      independent academic report is always reflected in the NICE appraisal\u000a      process. In addition, NICE\u000a      does have great worldwide influence3, so we expect that this\u000a      work has had beneficial impacts on\u000a      the treatment on patients with Alzheimer's disease throughout the world.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    About 800,000 people are living with Alzheimer's disease in the UK today,\u000a      at a cost of about &#163;23\u000a      Billion\/annum.

This HTA considered new evidence on the effectiveness and\u000a      cost-effectiveness of\u000a      donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine and memantine in the treatment of\u000a      Alzheimer's disease,\u000a      superseding the 2004 HTA report that had informed the previous NICE\u000a      guidance. Although not\u000a      formally published in the HTA Monograph series until 2012 (Bond et al)1,\u000a      the report was completed\u000a      in June 2010 and considered by the Appraisal Committee of NICE in August\u000a      2010, who then\u000a      issued their new guidance in March 2011. The report by PenTAG included\u000a      systematic reviews,\u000a      meta-analyses and mixed treatment comparisons of RCTs (both the new\u000a      evidence alone and\u000a      cumulatively with previous evidence), systematic reviews of\u000a      cost-effectiveness evaluations, critical\u000a      appraisals of three manufacturer submissions and a new cost-effectiveness\u000a      model, subsequently\u000a      published in peer review journals (Hyde et al, Peters et al) 2,3.\u000a      The findings showed a consolidation\u000a      of evidence on the effectiveness of donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine\u000a      and slightly enhanced\u000a      evidence on the effectiveness of memantine. For instance a statistically\u000a      significant beneficial effect\u000a      on measures of patient function and global impact emerged when randomised\u000a      controlled trials\u000a      comparing memantine with best-supportive care were formally meta-analysed\u000a      in our report. This\u000a      was not apparent previously. The most marked change was on the evidence on\u000a      cost-effectiveness,\u000a      which was greatly improved for donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine and\u000a      slightly improved for\u000a      memantine relative to the assessment in 2004. The PenTAG model\u000a      demonstrated that each of the\u000a      AChE inhibitors was cost saving compared with best supportive care, and\u000a      that for memantine the\u000a      incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was &#163;32,100\/QALY gained. As well as\u000a      including cutting edge\u000a      analytical methods the report also included novel methods of presenting\u000a      large volumes of research\u000a      data of a complex nature (Pitt et al)4.\u000a    Each piece of NICE guidance in the technology appraisal programme is\u000a      supported by an\u000a      independent academic report. In the multiple technology appraisal process\u000a      a health technology\u000a      assessment (HTA), generally comprising systematic reviews, meta-analyses\u000a      and health economic\u000a      modelling, is prepared by an academic group. The Exeter based Peninsula\u000a      Technology\u000a      Assessment Group (PenTAG) has been performing this role for 12 years and\u000a      has conducted over\u000a      30 HTAs, all published in peer reviewed journals. The work is funded by DH\u000a      through the NIHR HTA\u000a      Programme. This is currently in its fourth period of renewal, which will\u000a      run until 2016. The work was\u000a      led by Professor Ken Stein until 2009 and subsequently by Professor Chris\u000a      Hyde. The PenTAG\u000a      group working on the Alzheimer's drug appraisal, while led by Hyde, was\u000a      multidisciplinary,\u000a      including economists (Anderson and Hoyle) as well as experts in systematic\u000a      reviews (Hyde, Bond,\u000a      Peters and others), and used new methodological approaches developed\u000a      within the group (Pitt et\u000a      al 2009)4.\u000a    Grant:\u000a      Stein K.

There is\u000a      good evidence that the processes for identifying and managing high-risk\u000a      locations have been\u000a      implemented. For example, in 2009 the NW Public Health Observatory\u000a      identified 49 locations that\u000a      had been used for two or more suicidal acts. Signs encouraging suicidal\u000a      individuals to call\u000a      Samaritans were installed at several of these locations; at one of them,\u000a      an average of 2 suicides\u000a      per year has been reduced to only 2 suicides in the last 3 years2.\u000a      Placing of Samaritans signs\u000a      on the Tyne Bridge in December 2007 led to a reduction in the number of\u000a      call-outs by police\u000a      negotiators to deal with individuals threatening suicide, from 131 in 2007\u000a      to 47 in 2008, and 30 in\u000a      2009. Further benefits have been reported there, including improved\u000a      information sharing\u000a      between police and mental health trusts about high-risk individuals3.\u000a      In 2011, an NHS Trust\u000a      agreed to increase the height of the parapets around the top floor of a\u000a      new multi-storey hospital\u000a      car park, after the Guidance was brought to its attention by a\u000a      member of the public4. These\u000a      impacts have been acknowledged by NIHR5 (p.16).\u000a    Scotland: In 2010 NHS Health Scotland requested permission to\u000a      adapt the Guidance for use in\u000a      the Scottish context. It was subsequently instrumental in persuading\u000a      Transport Scotland to install\u000a      fencing to prevent jumping from the Erskine Bridge. In the two years prior\u000a      to installation (Aug\u000a      2011) there were 16 suicides from the bridge; in the two years after\u000a      installation this reduced to\u000a      only 36.\u000a    Northern Ireland: The Guidance was cited in support of\u000a      recommendations to improve public\u000a      safety at the Langan Weir Bridge in 20127.\u000a    Japan: The Guidance was translated into Japanese in 2007.\u000a      Two thousand copies were\u000a      disseminated to prefectural governments, mental health and welfare centres\u000a      and other agencies,\u000a      and are believed to have contributed to local suicide prevention\u000a      initiatives.\u000a    Australia: In 2011 the Government of Australia sought consent to\u000a      use the Guidance as the\u000a      model for the development of their own, and the authors of the Australian\u000a      guidance worked\u000a      closely with the Exeter team8a. The Australian Government has\u000a      subsequently committed $12\u000a      million funding to capital works to improve safety at identified hotspots8b.\u000a    The USA is home to the world's number one suicide site, the Golden\u000a      Gate Bridge, estimated to\u000a      be responsible for around 24 deaths per year. Installation of barriers to\u000a      prevent individuals from\u000a      jumping had been strenuously resisted for many years, but a Physical\u000a      Suicide Deterrent System\u000a      has now been given the go-ahead. The English Guidance is cited in\u000a      support of the scheme9. The\u000a      $5m design stage is due for completion in 2013. Safety nets are also being\u000a      installed on seven\u000a      bridges across Fall Creek Gorge, following the deaths of Cornell\u000a      University students. Again, the\u000a      Guidance is cited as a key resource10.\u000a    There is strong evidence to suggest that an individual who is prevented\u000a      from carrying out a\u000a      suicidal plan at one location, e.g. by the erection of a physical barrier,\u000a      is unlikely to seek out\u000a      another location or another method of suicide.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Our work on suicide prevention, led by Christabel Owens of the University\u000a      of Exeter in\u000a      conjunction with Devon Partnership NHS Trust, has led to environmental\u000a      changes to improve\u000a      safety at public locations worldwide.

They went on to pioneer the use of\u000a      qualitative methods to gain\u000a      insight into lay perspectives 1. This led in 2006 to an MRC\u000a      grant to learn more about the role that\u000a      lay people can play in preventing suicides and the resources they need in\u000a      order to do so. They\u000a      found that:\u000a    \u000a      signs of suicidal despair can be oblique, ambiguous and difficult to\u000a        interpret; individuals\u000a        who are intent on suicide employ a range of face-saving strategies when\u000a        communicating\u000a        with those around them, which make it difficult for listeners to judge\u000a        the intention behind\u000a        their words2,3;\u000a      family members and friends are predisposed to disregard warning signs\u000a        and focus instead\u000a        on positive `countersigns';\u000a      even when relatives and friends are aware that something is seriously\u000a        wrong, taking any\u000a        action at all involves considerable personal risk;\u000a      proximity to the suicidal person and emotional investment in the\u000a        relationship make it difficult\u000a        for them to see, say or do anything at all2.\u000a    \u000a    The team concluded that efforts to strengthen the capacity of lay people\u000a      to play a role in\u000a      preventing suicide should focus on helping people to recognise\u000a      communications of suicidal intent\u000a      for what they are and to acknowledge and overcome their fears about\u000a      intervening.\u000a    2) Preventing suicides in public places\u000a    Restricting access to lethal means is one of the most effective\u000a      approaches to suicide prevention.\u000a      In pursuit of this goal, the first National Suicide Prevention\u000a        Strategy for England (2002) pledged to\u000a      produce guidance on action to be taken at suicide `hotspots', i.e. bridges\u000a      and other public\u000a      locations that offer means and opportunity for suicide. In 2006,\u000a      Christabel Owens' team were\u000a      awarded a grant to develop the guidance.\u000a    The team collected data on locations of suicidal acts and found that\u000a      nearly a third (31%) were\u000a      carried out in public places4. They then:\u000a    \u000a      reviewed the evidence for interventions to prevent suicides at\u000a        high-risk locations5;\u000a      outlined a process for identifying high-risk locations at local level\u000a        and piloted it;\u000a      outlined a multi-agency approach to managing high-risk locations and\u000a        piloted it.\u000a    \u000a    They produced a simple practical handbook with guidance to support local\u000a      efforts to prevent\u000a      suicides in public places6.\u000a    Grants: 1) Owens C and Aitken P &#8212; Development of national guidance\u000a      on action to be taken at\u000a      suicide hotspots &#8212; NIMHE, 2006, &#163;9,916. 2) Owens C et al &#8212; Public\u000a      involvement in suicide\u000a      prevention &#8212; MRC, 2006, &#163;280,200.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35584","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    This research has had a far-reaching and significant impact on the lives\u000d\u000a      of patients with depression.

These impressive\u000d\u000a      implementation results have been underpinned by Richards' team in Exeter,\u000d\u000a      and their academic and professional publications. They have created the\u000d\u000a      IAPT para-professional `Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner' (PWP) role\u000d\u000a      and established it as a core component of the stepped care IAPT treatment\u000d\u000a      delivery method. In addition to trial results, Richards et al's\u000d\u000a      publications include the first major international edited textbook on\u000d\u000a      low-intensity CBT (Bennett-Levy, Richards, Farrand, et al, 20104);\u000d\u000a      the national curriculum for IAPT low-intensity workers (Richards, Farrand\u000d\u000a      and Chellingsworth, 20115), and three sets of educational\u000d\u000a      guidebooks for HEIs, low-intensity Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner\u000d\u000a      (PWP) students and their supervisors (Richards and White 2010; 2009a;\u000d\u000a      2009b 6,7,8). These materials are in use throughout the HEI\u000d\u000a      sector and the NHS in England. Richards also worked closely with public\u000d\u000a      and patient involvement representatives in his IAPT national advisor role\u000d\u000a      and advised RETHINK, the national mental health charity, on their\u000d\u000a      ultimately successful tenders for a number of IAPT services in England.\u000d\u000a    In addition, the recent (2009) NICE guidelines on depression9\u000d\u000a      references the work of Richards' group, and particularly notes that the\u000d\u000a      results of the recently published CADET trail (2013) \"should inform\u000d\u000a        further updates of this guideline\"\u000d\u000a    Richards' research has prompted interventions to be implemented\u000d\u000a      internationally: For example, he is an advisor to the `Mindspot'\u000d\u000a      Australian Federal Government service commission won by Macquarie\u000d\u000a      University, Sydney, to implement low-intensity CBT throughout all states\u000d\u000a      in Australia; he is also advisor to `Beyond Blue' the national Australian\u000d\u000a      Depression Initiative10.

Because of the limited\u000d\u000a      availability of treatment for many depressed patients Richards' work\u000d\u000a      (Professor of Health Services Research, Exeter, appointed 2008) has been\u000d\u000a      to improve the evidence for and the accessibility of low-cost,\u000d\u000a      evidence-based treatments. He and his team have also provided leadership\u000d\u000a      in translational implementation programmes from this research, to train\u000d\u000a      the next generation of NHS clinicians.\u000d\u000a    His studies have provided one crucial element of the empirical rationale\u000d\u000a      for the &#163;700m expansion of Improving Access to Psychological Therapies\u000d\u000a      (IAPT) services throughout England. He developed the `low-intensity'\u000d\u000a      clinical methods and collaborative care organisational structures in a\u000d\u000a      trial of collaborative care (Richards et al, 20081) and then\u000d\u000a      implemented these clinical and organisational procedures in one of the\u000d\u000a      IAPT pilot sites (Clark et al, 2009; Richards and Suckling, 2009; Richards\u000d\u000a      and Borglin, 2011 2,3,4). Data from 7859 consecutive patients\u000d\u000a      treated by this service over two years demonstrated that combining low-\u000d\u000a      and high-intensity treatments maximised treatment volumes whilst\u000d\u000a      maintaining good clinical outcomes (Richards and Borglin, 20114).\u000d\u000a      Subsequently, he has led one of the largest trials (MRC\/NIHR-EME) of\u000d\u000a      collaborative care internationally (CADET), to directly address a NICE\u000d\u000a      2009 Depression Guideline research priority to improve depression\u000d\u000a      treatment (Richards et al, 20135). Results have removed the\u000d\u000a      uncertainty about the effectiveness of Collaborative Care for depression\u000d\u000a      in the UK, in that collaborative care had persistent positive effects, was\u000d\u000a      cost effective within the NICE affordability threshold, and patients were\u000d\u000a      more satisfied than in usual care.\u000d\u000a    Addressing a further NICE research recommendation, Richards is leading an\u000d\u000a      on-going large-scale NIHR-HTA trial (COBRA) which is examining whether a\u000d\u000a      simpler treatment &#8212; behavioural activation (Ekers et al, 20116)\u000d\u000a      &#8212; is as efficacious as CBT but potentially cheaper and more accessible\u000d\u000a      through delivery by less expensive health-care professionals.\u000d\u000a    Externally funded grant support related to reported research\u000d\u000a    A Trial Platform of Enhanced Care for Depression in Primary Care.\u000d\u000a      MRC &#163;164,849.

Their matched\u000a      cohort study utilising the pilot data convincingly demonstrated a\u000a      reduction of 27% in deaths from colorectal cancer among those\u000a      participating in screening [1], vindicating the assumptions that had been\u000a      made at the planning stage. National screening was developed from the\u000a      pilot work and subsequent research led by Steele. It commenced in\u000a      England in 2006, was followed by Scotland and Wales in 2007 and Northern\u000a      Ireland in 2010 [2], and is already impacting on national mortality rates.\u000a    The impact of the group's research on repeated invitations [3] and on\u000a      pre-notification [4] is reflected in demonstrated increases in the overall\u000a      uptake of screening and of colonoscopy. For example, uptake of a first\u000a      invitation for prevalence screening was 53%, and for a second and third\u000a      invitation was 15% and 12% respectively, with a significant number\u000a      proceeding to colonoscopy [3]; pre- notification with a letter (with or\u000a      without an accompanying booklet) increased the uptake of screening from\u000a      54% to 59% [4]. Mortality figures are expected to continue to improve as\u000a      this research, which has been incorporated into the national screening\u000a      algorithm, leads to increased uptake and participation. As a result of the\u000a      research into faecal occult blood testing methodology [vi], the screening\u000a      algorithm in Scotland has also been changed to incorporate immunological\u000a      testing. However, a study of interval cancers has demonstrated that the\u000a      sensitivity of the screening Faecal Occult Blood test is only about 50%\u000a      for cancer and that it is less sensitive in women than in men [5]. This\u000a      set in train a piece of work funded by the Scottish Government (&#163;130,241)\u000a      that demonstrated the utility (improved efficiency, and age- and\u000a      gender-specificity) and potential impact of improved faecal testing using\u000a      quantitative faecal immunochemical testing as the first line test [6]. A\u000a      business case for the introduction of this technology is currently being\u000a      developed.\u000a    The demonstration pilot achieved similar short term outcomes to previous\u000a      randomised trials, indicating that 30 colorectal cancer deaths per million\u000a      of the total population per year will be avoided in the first instance.\u000a      These figures will certainly continue to improve (a) as the proportion of\u000a      the population participating in the screening programme increases; (b)\u000a      with the implementation of more accurate testing methodologies such as\u000a      immunological faecal occult blood testing (already partially implemented\u000a      in Scotland) and the novel proteomics approaches that are currently under\u000a      development in Dundee; and (c) as the uptake and impact of lifestyle\u000a      interventions identified by the BeWEL study reduces the incidence of\u000a      malignant tumours among those participating in screening. This work\u000a      therefore demonstrates that the screening programme prevents around 2,000\u000a      UK colorectal cancer deaths each year, and will inevitably prevent many\u000a      more in the future.\u000a    In addition to informing the decision to introduce a national colorectal\u000a      cancer screening programme, the research described here has had a\u000a      significant impact on the testing modalities used in the screening\u000a      programme and on the method of invitation. Furthermore, extremely valuable\u000a      information has been gathered on the significance of interval cancers. In\u000a      addition, &#163;2m funding has also been made available from the Scottish\u000a      Government in order to explore the introduction of flexible sigmoidoscopy\u000a      as a primary screening modality, and a randomised evaluation is under\u000a      development. Professor Steele chairs the Steering Group for this\u000a      study.\u000a    The Screening Programme has attracted major national and international\u000a      media attention [7], and has served as a model for the implementation of\u000a      similar programmes in a number of other countries (most recently Ireland\u000a      [8], with others under development in the Netherlands, Sweden, Croatia,\u000a      Slovenia and Taiwan). The recently published European Guidelines for\u000a      Quality Assurance in Colorectal Cancer Screening [9], to which Professor Steele\u000a      made a major contribution [10], drew heavily on the experience gained in\u000a      Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom, and is a major influence on\u000a      these programmes.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The UK Faecal Occult Blood Test Screening Programme, based on Dundee-led\u000a      research (Steele), offers bowel cancer screening through mailed\u000a      test kits followed up with colonoscopy when faecal blood is detected. It\u000a      is estimated to prevent about 2,000 UK deaths annually. Steele's\u000a      Screening Research Unit also trialled immunological faecal occult blood\u000a      testing, which was subsequently incorporated into the Scottish screening\u000a      algorithm. In addition to demonstrating a 27% reduction in bowel cancer\u000a      deaths through participation in Faecal Occult Blood screening, the Unit\u000a      has researched the incidence of interval cancers and the impact of\u000a      repeated invitations, development of new tests, and strategies for\u000a      increasing participation. All of these drive the National Screening\u000a      Programme, and will further reduce mortality.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Technological","Institution":"\u000a    University of Dundee\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Dundee (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Dundee","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"Scotland","UKPRN":10007852}],"Panel":"A         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000ai.

Cases often present clinically at an advanced stage of\u000a      disease, with consequently poor outcome.\u000a    Single cohort randomised controlled trials carried out in Nottingham,\u000a      England and Funen, Denmark and published in 1993 demonstrated that\u000a      screening for colorectal cancer using Faecal Occult Blood testing reduced\u000a      disease-specific mortality by up to 18%. On the advice of the National\u000a      Screening Committee, the UK Departments of Health commissioned a\u000a      demonstration pilot of faecal occult blood test screening to be carried\u000a      out in two geographical areas, one in England and one in Scotland. The\u000a      areas chosen, on the basis of competitive bids, were Tayside, Grampian and\u000a      Fife in Scotland and Coventry and Warwick in England. The executive group\u000a      established to oversee this exercise was chaired by Steele\u000a      (Professor of Surgical Oncology, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School,\u000a      Dundee). This group developed the pilot methodology and subsequently\u000a      carried out the major piece of underpinning research, a demonstration\u000a      pilot exercise in the two sites to test the effectiveness of the first\u000a      round of a biennial screening programme. This ran between March 2000 and\u000a      May 2003 and proved to be extremely successful, inviting 478,250\u000a      individuals aged 50-69 for faecal occult blood test screening over a\u000a      two-year period and assessing key performance indicators against\u000a      benchmarks set by the previous randomised controlled trials [i]. The\u000a      results of this research were evaluated by an independent team and\u000a      reported to the UK Departments of Health who acted on them by developing\u000a      and introducing National Colorectal Screening Programmes [ii]. In\u000a      Scotland, the demonstration pilot continued for two further biennial\u000a      screening rounds. This provided information on the performance of both\u000a      prevalence and incidence screening, allowing for more precise planning by\u000a      the screening centres and NHS Boards [iii]. Subsequent research\u000a      demonstrated that telephone communication with screen positive individuals\u000a      increased the uptake of colonoscopy and that repeated invitations\u000a      increased the overall uptake of screening [iv]. A further randomised\u000a      controlled trial [v] to assess the impact of pre-notification for\u000a      screening demonstrated a further significant increase in uptake.\u000a      Additionally, research carried out at the Screening Centre and the\u000a      Research Unit established that the use of a sensitive immunological faecal\u000a      occult blood test in those with a weak positive guaiac faecal occult blood\u000a      test provided a more accurate method of selecting screen-positive\u000a      individuals for colonoscopy [vi].\u000a    Both the research work and the implementation of the screening programme\u000a      involved close collaborations between the University of Dundee, NHS Boards\u000a      and Government Health Departments. In order to analyse the data generated\u000a      by the Scottish arm of the demonstration pilot and to support new\u000a      developments, a Colorectal Screening Research Unit was established at the\u000a      Scottish Bowel Screening Centre in Dundee. This was funded by a programme\u000a      grant awarded to the University of Dundee by the Chief Scientist Office of\u000a      the Scottish Government Health Department, and led by Professor Steele.\u000a      Other local researchers were Callum Fraser (Director, Scottish Bowel\u000a      Screening Laboratory and Honorary Professor in Molecular and Cellular\u000a      Pathology); Frank Carey (Pathology Lead for Colorectal Cancer Screening in\u000a      Scotland and Honorary Professor of Pathology); and Gillian Libby (Research\u000a      Statistician).\u000a    Finally, the Screening Research Unit obtained funding of &#163;262,000 from\u000a      TENOVUS to work with the College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee on\u000a      the utilisation of advanced proteomics for the development of more\u000a      sensitive and specific screening tests, and &#163;1.55M from the MRC (through\u000a      the National Prevention Research Initiative) with Anderson to\u000a      study lifestyle interventions in individuals diagnosed with adenomas\u000a      through the screening programme (the BeWEL study, which ran from January\u000a      2010 to July 2013).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"35829","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d    Our research has been central to the development of methods for\u000d      evaluating the impact of antibiotic policy and the relationship between\u000d      hospital prescribing and resistance in Europe; Davey has, for example,\u000d      participated in Europe-wide reviews of the issue [1,2]. In Scotland our\u000d      work on prescribing indicators and quality improvement has enabled\u000d      sustainable evaluation of hospital antibiotic prescribing by hospitals in\u000d      all 14 Health Boards; this was accompanied by a demonstrated 43% reduction\u000d      in C. difficile infection in Scotland between 2008 and 2011 [3,p7\u000d      and 4]\u000d    In addition to multiple citations of the main report of the Cochrane\u000d      review [iii], its impact is evidenced by the ORION guidelines [iv] arising\u000d      from subsequent collaboration with researchers from University College\u000d      London and the University of Bristol. These have been endorsed by\u000d      professional societies in the UK, Europe and USA and disseminated at their\u000d      meetings [4]. The Cochrane review was quoted in the Scottish Management of\u000d      Antimicrobial Resistance Action Plan (http:\/\/www.scotland.gov.uk\/Publications\/2008\/03\/12153030\/0)\u000d      and influenced the recommendation for a national organisation to integrate\u000d      improvement in antibiotic prescribing with control of healthcare\u000d      associated infection. This resulted in establishment of the Scottish\u000d      Antimicrobial Prescribing Group (SAPG) as part of the Scottish Medicines\u000d      Consortium (2007) [5].\u000d    Research outputs [i-iv] led to Davey being invited to lead the Hospital\u000d      Subproject of ESAC from 2003-2010. From 2006-2010 Davey led the\u000d      development and testing in 20 European hospitals of a web based method for\u000d      reporting on point prevalence studies of antibiotic use [v]. The ESAC\u000d      project continued until 2010 and the ESAC website documents wide\u000d      dissemination across Europe. The 2009 point prevalence survey included 172\u000d      hospitals from 25 European countries [6]. In Scotland, hospitals from all\u000d      14 Health Boards participated in the 2009 ESAC point prevalence survey,\u000d      and this is specifically cited by NHS Boards when discussing the impact\u000d      SAPG has had in their area, in the SAPG 2009 Annual Report [7].\u000d    As the Representative with Responsibility for International Liaison and\u000d      Research for SAPG Davey recommended that the ESAC quality\u000d      indicators should be adopted as national targets. This SAPG recommendation\u000d      was included by Scottish Government in 2009 as part of their HEAT (Health,\u000d      Efficiency and Access to Treatment) target to reduce the rate of C.\u000d        difficile Associated Disease among patients aged 65 and over by at\u000d      least 30% by 31 March 2011 [8]. SAPG adapted the ESAC Point Prevalence\u000d      Survey method for continuous measurement of compliance with the national\u000d      targets for hospital antibiotic use. A secure, web based system was\u000d      created for all acute hospitals in Scotland to report their compliance\u000d      with antibiotic policy with monthly prevalence surveys in acute medical\u000d      and surgical admission units. The recommended restrictive antibiotic\u000d      policy for reducing C. difficile Associated Disease was based on Davey's\u000d      study to identify high risk antibiotics [vi] as well as the Cochrane\u000d      review [iii]. The SAPG Report on Progress from 2008-11 cites the\u000d      development and measurement of hospital prescribing indicators as being\u000d      critical to SAPG's contribution to the 43% reduction in C. difficile\u000d      infection seen throughout NHS Scotland by national restriction of\u000d      antimicrobials associated with a high risk of C. difficile\u000d      infection [3,p7]. SAPG continues to use the hospital antibiotic\u000d      prescribing indicators for measurement of antibiotic use and compliance\u000d      with policy and produces annual reports [9,10]. The C. difficile\u000d      infection HEAT target for 2009-11 has been reviewed by the Healthcare\u000d      Acquired Infection Task Force and a new C. difficile infection\u000d      target from April 2011 has been set using a `best in class' approach so\u000d      that by March 2013 the rate of C. difficile infection in patients\u000d      aged 65 and over is 0.39 cases or less per 1000 total occupied bed days in\u000d      all NHS boards. As a result of the impact of this work the University of\u000d      Dundee is being funded by Scottish Government's Healthcare Associated\u000d      Infection Task Force to work with National Services Scotland on the\u000d      development of further quality indicators of hospital antibiotic\u000d      prescribing. Internationally, the Clinical Excellence Commission in\u000d      Sydney, Australia invited Davey to be a consultant in February\u000d      2013, and has subsequently adapted the ESAC quality indicators for\u000d      implementation across New South Wales [11].\u000d    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d    The need to measure and improve hospital antibiotic prescribing was\u000d      identified as a priority in European and UK policy documents about\u000d      antibiotic resistance in the late 1990s. Our research developed\u000d      sustainable methods for evaluating interventions to improve hospital\u000d      antibiotic prescribing, and led to Davey collaborating with the\u000d      European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption (ESAC) project and\u000d      becoming the Scottish Antimicrobial Prescribing Group's Representative\u000d      with Responsibility for International Liaison and Research.

Collaboration with authors of another systematic\u000d      review about infection control produced the ORION guidelines for good\u000d      practice in reporting interventions [iv].\u000d    Most hospital data systems only record supply of antibiotics to hospital\u000d      wards. This information can be used to analyse the impact of interventions\u000d      on use of antibiotics targeted by policy change [ii]. However, hospitals\u000d      also need a sustainable method for measurement of prescribing to\u000d      individual patients in order to assess compliance with antibiotic policy\u000d      for treatment of specific infections. Davey was the UK\u000d      representative for the 2000-2003 ESAC project and from 2003-10 was funded\u000d      by ESAC II and III to lead work on surveillance of hospital consumption.\u000d      This led to the development and testing in 20 European hospitals of a\u000d      method for point prevalence surveying of the treatment of individual\u000d      patients.

Service standards and funding are reviewed annually\u000a      by commissioners\u000a      and providers. The latest standards refer to 2012\/13 (A), and the\u000a      budget for Leicester for this\u000a      period is just over &#163;4.3 million.\u000a    NSCT and providers have a commitment to working together to continually\u000a      improve the service\u000a      and react to innovative and dynamic ideas, such as developing a mobile\u000a      ECMO service for\u000a      neonatals and children in 2011\/12. This is now offered by Glenfield\u000a      Hospital (B).\u000a    The response to the CESAR trial has been to commission an adult ECMO\u000a      service: since 2011 this\u000a      has operated in five centres, with transport of patients on ECMO as part\u000a      of the contract (C).\u000a      Glenfield is the only one offering a neonatal, paediatric and adult\u000a      service.\u000a    Quality of life\u000a    The neonatal trial provided clear data of improved survival, reduced risk\u000a      of disability and cost\u000a      effectiveness. These data remain unchallenged in 2013.\u000a    Survival rates: The most immediate impact has been on survival of\u000a      babies entered into the ECMO\u000a      programme. Statistically, for every three babies with breathing problems\u000a      and lung failure treated\u000a      with ECMO rather than conventional ventilation, one more survived. The\u000a      number of additional\u000a      survivors to 2013 can be estimated, based on 100 suitable cases per year\u000a      in the UK, at 340.\u000a      Paediatric and adult patients are also being successfully treated in\u000a      increasing numbers.\u000a    Reduced risk of disability: In the neonatal trial, overall rates\u000a      of impairment and disability were\u000a      approximately half that seen in survivors treated conventionally. An\u000a      important feature of both\u000a      neonatal and adult trials was that the end-point was not survival; it was\u000a        intact survival after an\u000a      interval. In the case of the neonatal trial it was 1-, 4- and 7-year\u000a      intact survival based on\u000a      neurological assessments. In the case of CESAR it was functional\u000a      independence six months after\u000a      treatment. An often unrecognised aspect of ECMO support is that the\u000a      quality of both neonatal and\u000a      adult survivors is excellent and there is limited long-term functional\u000a      disability. Provided they are\u000a      otherwise healthy before needing ECMO, they go on to have long and\u000a      productive lives in society\u000a      (D).\u000a    Cost-effectiveness: In the period from discharge from initial\u000a      hospitalisation until 7-year follow-up,\u000a      there was consistently higher use of health care resources in the ECMO\u000a      arm, but this is largely\u000a      because of increased survival in this group. Economic evaluations of ECMO\u000a      after 4 and 7 years\u000a      provided rigorous evidence of the cost-effectiveness of ECMO. The measures\u000a      of benefit used were\u000a      the life-years gained and the disability-free life-years gained (E).\u000a    International renown\u000a    Since 2009, Leicester has been the largest centre in the world in terms\u000a      of the combined number of\u000a      neonatal, paediatric and adult cases annually. The trial data have\u000a      influenced practice in Europe\u000a      (Sweden, the Netherlands, France and Germany) and further afield (US and\u000a      Australia), and many\u000a      practitioners have come to Leicester to train in the use of ECMO.\u000a      Glenfield has a reciprocal\u000a      agreement with European centres, particularly the Karolinska Institute in\u000a      Stockholm. During the\u000a      H1N1 influenza A pandemic (swine flu) in 2009\/10, which produced a number\u000a      of young adults\u000a      whose respiratory function was severely compromised, Glenfield treated 62\u000a      additional patients,\u000a      some from abroad, who showed significant benefit from being able to access\u000a      ECMO.\u000a    When Glenfield's ECMO unit for children was threatened with closure in\u000a      2012, the Director of the\u000a      ECMO unit at Karolinska, warned that 20 years' experience would be thrown\u000a      away, and that about\u000a      50 babies would die over five years if the unit was moved. \"Leicester\u000a        has one of the highest\u000a        survival rates for patients who need ECMO in the world,\" he is\u000a      quoted as saying. Leicester and\u000a      Karolinska both have survival rates 10 to 20% higher than in other parts\u000a      of the world (F).\u000a    Beginnings of evidence-based approach\u000a    The novel neonatal trial recruited babies with a predicted mortality of\u000a      80%: it also incorporated a\u000a      prospective health economic evaluation, a follow-up programme and a review\u000a      of parent opinions of\u000a      the procedure and the trial. Sir Iain Chalmers of the Cochrane Collection\u000a      says: \"The trial provided\u000a        the opportunity to do some important social scientific studies exploring\u000a        the challenges of explaining\u000a        controlled trials to parents in the fraught circumstances of the birth\u000a        of a severely ill child.\" (G).\u000a    It set an important precedent for how research trials should be designed\u000a      to reduce uncertainty and\u000a      provide better evidence to inform future decisions in clinical practice\u000a      and policy implementation. It\u000a      is one of the earliest examples of direct engagement between NHS\u000a      Commissioners and academics\u000a      to assess a new technology prior to any `creep' into general practice.\u000a      Chalmers says: \"The\u000a        example set by British neonatologists when they decided that ECMO should\u000a        only be offered within\u000a        the context of a multicentre trial until its effects were clearer\u000a        remains today a beacon showing the\u000a        way that clinicians should behave when there is uncertainty about the\u000a        effects of their practices.\"\u000a      (G).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a complex\u000a      procedure of life support\u000a      used in severe but potentially reversible respiratory failure in newborn\u000a      infants.

ECMO\u000a      provides time for the\u000a      heart to rest and recover, while maintaining a good blood supply to the\u000a      brain and other organs.\u000a      First used in the US in the late 1970s, it was still a pioneering\u000a      technique when Richard Firmin, a\u000a      paediatric surgeon at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester and an honorary\u000a      senior lecturer at the\u000a      University, convinced that the treatment was effective (unlike many other\u000a      surgeons), approached\u000a      the children's charity Heart Link for funds to support the introduction of\u000a      an ECMO programme in\u000a      Leicester. After a successful series of cases, Firmin and colleagues,\u000a      buoyed by huge public\u000a      support and the backing of Leicester MP Greville Janner, persuaded the\u000a      Department of Health to\u000a      fund a grant proposal; that was followed by &#163;1.4 million to conduct a\u000a      randomised controlled trial to\u000a      assess the effectiveness of ECMO against conventional ventilation.\u000a    The randomised controlled trial\u000a    The trial was not an easy undertaking. It was complex and expensive. It\u000a      was ethically and\u000a      practically difficult to design, given the type of patient being studied:\u000a      babies with only a 20%\u000a      chance of survival were assigned randomly to the ECMO group or control\u000a      group within hours of\u000a      their birth. At the time ECMO was a highly controversial procedure and the\u000a      long-term outcomes\u000a      were completely unknown: there was a very real possibility that reduced\u000a      mortality might be\u000a      achieved only with an increase in severe disability among survivors.\u000a    Between January 1993 and November 1995, 185 infants with severe\u000a      respiratory failure were\u000a      recruited for the study: 93 infants were randomly allocated to the ECMO\u000a      group and 92 to the\u000a      conventional treatment group. The trial was led by Professor David Field,\u000a      who set up the trial,\u000a      established a protocol and trained staff from five regional centres that\u000a      formed the UK Collaborative\u000a      &#8212; Leicester, Glasgow, Newcastle, Kings College London and Great Ormond\u000a      Street Hospital. All\u000a      five centres recruited babies to the trial. Analysis of results was\u000a      carried out by the National\u000a      Perinatal Epidemiology Unit (NPEU) in Oxford.\u000a    Recruitment to the trial was stopped two months early by the independent\u000a      Data Monitoring\u000a      Committee when the results showed that ECMO had a clear advantage: 63 of\u000a      93 infants allocated\u000a      ECMO survived compared with 38 of 92 allocated conventional care. The\u000a      conclusion was that\u000a      ECMO support should be actively considered for neonates with severe but\u000a      potentially reversible\u000a      respiratory failure. The results were published in The Lancet by the UK\u000a      Collaborative ECMO trial\u000a      Group, with Field listed as corresponding author. Despite the highly\u000a      specialised nature of the\u000a      subject matter, the article has been cited 337 times (1).\u000a    Follow-up research\u000a    The UK Collaborative carried out three follow-up studies. Initial\u000a      assessment at one year showed\u000a      that the results were in accord with earlier preliminary findings: that\u000a      ECMO support reduces the risk\u000a      of death without a concomitant rise in severe disability (2).\u000a    A fuller assessment at 4 years of age, using six clinical areas\u000a      (cognitive ability, neuromotor skills,\u000a      general health, behaviour, hearing and vision) demonstrated both an\u000a      increased number of\u000a      survivors (62 versus 38) and an increased number of survivors who were\u000a      free of disability (30\u000a      versus 13) in the ECMO group, compared with the conventional treatment\u000a      group. The results were\u000a      published in The Lancet and Field was one of the authors (3).\u000a    Further research at 7 years, when the children were old enough for\u000a      educational and other longer-term\u000a      impacts to be assessed, showed that the ECMO technique resulted in 34\u000a      (37%) cases of\u000a      death and severe disability v. 54 (59%) cases in the conventional\u000a      treatment group. Although both\u000a      groups had problems, the ECMO group consistently performed better and the\u000a      authors concluded\u000a      that the beneficial influence of an ECMO policy is still present at the\u000a      age of 7 years, and likely to be\u000a      at age 18. The results were published in Paediatrics and Field was the\u000a      corresponding author (4).\u000a    Other research\u000a    The establishment of an ECMO centre in Leicester has enabled a series of\u000a      studies with global\u000a      significance. In 2004 a multi-centre trial, again led by Field, and\u000a      assisted by Marie Horan (MD\u000a      student) focused on the use of hypothermia as a means of protecting brain\u000a      function in this group of\u000a      babies. The results made clear that this intervention, used widely in\u000a      neonatal ECMO centres\u000a      around the world, was potentially harmful (5).\u000a    Research has also been conducted on older babies (12 to 15 months) and\u000a      adults. The 2001-2006\u000a      CESAR (Conventional Ventilation or ECMO for Severe Adult Respiratory\u000a      Failure) trial involving\u000a      seriously ill adult patients led by Dr Giles Peek (Hon Senior Lecturer,\u000a      Cardiac Surgery) and\u000a      Professor Andrew Wilson (Primary Care) with colleagues from the London\u000a      School of Hygiene &amp;\u000a      Tropical Medicine, showed that 63% of patients given ECMO survived to 6\u000a      months without\u000a      disability compared to 47% of those assigned to conventional treatment\u000a      with a ventilator (6).\u000a    Key personnel\u000a    Leicester: Professor David Field, Neonatal Medicine (1985 &#8212;\u000a      present)\u000a    Other institutions: Prof Diana Elbourne; Prof Miranda Mugford; Dr\u000a      Stavros Petrou (NPEU, Oxford).\u000a    Clinical leads: Mr Richard Firmin (Leicester); Dr Duncan McCrae\u000a      (Great Ormond Street Hospital);\u000a    Mr Carl Davies and Dr Charlie Skeoch (Glasgow &#8212; Royal Hospital for Sick\u000a      Children); Prof Anne\u000a      Greenough (Kings College Hospital); and Mr Leslie Hamilton (Newcastle\u000a      Royal Victoria Infirmary).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38353","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The HAPO study identified for the first time, on a global basis, the\u000a      adverse impact on both\u000a      mother and baby of mildly elevated levels of glucose below those\u000a      traditionally used to make a\u000a      diagnosis of diabetes in pregnancy. The traditionally used criteria for\u000a      diabetes in pregnancy\u000a      were based on the principle of identifying women at risk of diabetes after\u000a      the pregnancy, rather\u000a      than the principle of identifying pregnancies where there was significant\u000a      risk to mother and\/or\u000a      baby as a consequence of elevated glucose. HAPO aimed to determine the\u000a      level of maternal\u000a      glucose associated with abnormal pregnancy outcomes for mother and baby,\u000a      and hence to\u000a      allow the development of new criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes in\u000a      pregnancy.\u000a    Following the publication of the major HAPO results in 2008, the\u000a      International Association of\u000a      Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) convened a consensus panel,\u000a      which\u000a      published new recommended criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes in\u000a      pregnancy based on the\u000a      HAPO study findings, in Diabetes Care in 20101,2. Queen's\u000a      researchers were members of the\u000a      Consensus Panel which published the recommendations and are amongst its\u000a      authors. The\u000a      new criteria are based on identification of average glucose values at\u000a      which odds for increased\u000a      birth weight, levels of insulin in cord blood and percentage body fat of\u000a      the baby in the top 10%\u000a      reached 1.75 times the estimated odds of these outcomes at average glucose\u000a      values.\u000a      Therefore, the whole basis on which the diagnosis of diabetes in pregnancy\u000a      is made has been\u000a      changed from risk of subsequent diabetes in the mother, to risk to the\u000a      baby at birth.\u000a    The new criteria have already begun to have far reaching consequences at\u000a      an international\u000a      level1,3. A completely new two phase screening strategy for\u000a      diabetes in pregnancy is\u000a      recommended. This consists of an initial measurement of fasting plasma\u000a      glucose, random\u000a      glucose or HbA1c (a test that indicates average blood glucose levels over\u000a      the past three\u000a      months) in all women at the first prenatal visit. If the results are\u000a      abnormal, the woman is\u000a      managed as if she had diabetes preceding pregnancy. In all women with\u000a      normal results at this\u000a      initial visit, it is proposed that a 2 hour 75 g oral glucose tolerance\u000a      test is carried out at between\u000a      24 and 28 weeks gestation, and new criteria are provided for the diagnosis\u000a      of gestational\u000a      diabetes. In a typical developed population, use of the new criteria\u000a      approximately doubles the\u000a      percentage of women who will be diagnosed as suffering from gestational\u000a      diabetes, from 8% to\u000a      16%. Appropriate management of women with this condition improves outcomes\u000a      both for\u000a      mother and baby.\u000a    The new criteria for diabetes in pregnancy were endorsed by the American\u000a      Diabetes\u000a      Association in January 2011 and are currently under review by many other\u000a      national guideline\u000a      bodies.

Elizabeth\u000a      Trimble (Professor of Clinical\u000a      Biochemistry) and David Hadden (Honorary Professor of Diabetic Medicine)\u000a      were key to this.\u000a      As a consequence, researchers at Queen's University Belfast were lead\u000a      participants in\u000a      discussions with other leading international research groups that led to\u000a      the development of the\u000a      protocol for the Hyperglycaemia and Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study. This\u000a      major\u000a      international study involved a total of 25,505 pregnant women at 15\u000a      centres in nine countries,\u000a      who underwent 75-g oral glucose-tolerance testing at 24 to 32 weeks of a\u000a      pregnancy. The\u000a      study was led by Dr. Boyd Metzger from North-Western University in the USA\u000a      and funded by a\u000a      grant from the US National Institute of Health (NIH). Queen's\u000a      investigators were co-applicants\u000a      on the successful proposal, which was led from Chicago, and were members\u000a      of the study\u000a      Steering Committee, Head of the Central laboratory (Professor Elisabeth\u000a      Trimble), Head of the\u000a      European Clinical Area (with 3 separate clinical centres) (Professor David\u000a      Hadden) and Co-chair\u000a      of the Publications Committee (Professor Elisabeth Trimble). Belfast\u000a      provided the Central\u000a      laboratory for the study, because of its long and wide experience in\u000a      measuring peptides in\u000a      clinical samples developed under the leadership of the late Professor\u000a      Keith Buchanan. This\u000a      laboratory performed the analysis of samples from all countries for the\u000a      key parameters of\u000a      glucose, insulin and C-peptide. In addition, Belfast was one of the key\u000a      recruitment centres for\u000a      the study.\u000a    The main results of the HAPO study were published in the New England\u000a      Journal of Medicine in\u000a      2008 with three Queen's staff among the 14 authors3, and\u000a      subsequently, a number of\u000a      secondary publications appeared in other journals4-6. The main\u000a      findings of the HAPO study\u000a      were as follows: maternal glucose levels, even though these were below\u000a      those diagnostic for\u000a      diabetes, strongly correlated with the main outcomes of (i) increased\u000a      birth weight of the baby,\u000a      (ii) an increased need for primary Caesarean section, (iii) clinically\u000a      evident low blood glucose in\u000a      the newborn child and (iv) increased cord-blood insulin levels. In\u000a      addition, maternal obesity\u000a      also affected the main outcomes independent of the mother's elevated blood\u000a      glucose levels.\u000a      Obesity together with elevated blood glucose increased the risk for\u000a      undesirable outcomes\u000a      round the birth of the baby. The results proved to be valid for all\u000a      ethnicities and geographical\u000a      regions tested.\u000a    In summary, the global relevance of the risk revealed by the HAPO study\u000a      combined with\u000a      emerging evidence that intervention at lower plasma glucose levels leads\u000a      to improved\u000a      outcomes, has lent great urgency to re-evaluation of risk levels in\u000a      `gestational diabetes' and the\u000a      development of new guidelines for risk management.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38354","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Of the 3,800 individuals who are suspected to suffer from FH in Northern\u000d\u000a      Ireland, less than 200 had been identified at the start of this programme\u000d\u000a      of research.

FH is the most common significant inherited clinical disorder in the\u000d\u000a      UK. It affects somewhere between 1 in 200 and 1 in 500 of the population,\u000d\u000a      meaning that there are over 110,000 affected individuals in the UK, and\u000d\u000a      approximately 3,800 in Northern Ireland. Traditional diagnosis of the\u000d\u000a      condition relies on measuring serum cholesterol, but this is unreliable,\u000d\u000a      especially in children and adolescents. If FH is not identified and\u000d\u000a      treated, 50% of men will have a heart attack before the age of 50, and 50%\u000d\u000a      of women before the age of 60. The majority of individuals suffering from\u000d\u000a      FH currently remain unidentified.\u000d\u000a    The key pathways of importance to the regulation of serum cholesterol and\u000d\u000a      the relevant genes controlling them were identified by Brown and Goldstein\u000d\u000a      in the USA in work originating in the 1970s. FH usually arises as a result\u000d\u000a      of a defect in one of three genes1,2. In a programme of work\u000d\u000a      originating in the early 1990s, researchers from Queen's (Young and\u000d\u000a      Nicholls) published a series of papers describing the identification of\u000d\u000a      genetic defects causing FH in the Northern Ireland population, and a\u000d\u000a      number of methodology papers describing improved methods for testing for\u000d\u000a      the condition2. Young is Professor of Medicine and the Director\u000d\u000a      of the Centre for Public Health, Queen's University Belfast, while\u000d\u000a      Nicholls is an Honorary Professor of Medicine.\u000d\u000a    The impact reported derives from ten papers published between 1995 and\u000d\u000a      2008. Initial research was funded by the Northern Ireland Chest Heart and\u000d\u000a      Stroke Association and subsequently by the British Heart Foundation. This\u000d\u000a      involved the clinical identification of families with suspected FH. In\u000d\u000a      these families cholesterol levels were measured and this was correlated\u000d\u000a      with assessments of heart disease in family members3,4,5. Once\u000d\u000a      a potential family had been identified, DNA was collected from them to\u000d\u000a      start a screening process. The majority of cases of FH result from a\u000d\u000a      defect in the low density lipoprotein receptor gene. A relatively small\u000d\u000a      number of cases result from defects in two other genes (known as ApoB and\u000d\u000a      PCSK9). Young and his colleagues identified over 20 novel genetic defects\u000d\u000a      in the Northern Ireland population as well as a number of mutations which\u000d\u000a      had been previously described in other populations, and the relationship\u000d\u000a      between these defects, gene expression and clinical presentation was\u000d\u000a      established. In parallel with the clinical work, a laboratory-based\u000d\u000a      program developed increasingly sophisticated methods of genetic diagnosis.\u000d\u000a      The most recent evolution of the laboratory methodology was published in Clinical\u000a        Genetics in 2008 and now provides the basis of the routinely offered\u000d\u000a      genetic approach6. This is followed by sequencing of the\u000d\u000a      relevant genes if a defect is not identified in a family with a high\u000d\u000a      degree of clinical suspicion.\u000d\u000a    In summary, the research led to the identification of new mutations\u000d\u000a      involved in FH and these were incorporated into a diagnostic screening\u000d\u000a      programme.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38355","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The effect of the NIBR research has been an increased recognition of the\u000d\u000a      lower cancer risk in\u000d\u000a      BO than previously thought, the importance of using clinicopathological\u000d\u000a      characteristics (and\u000d\u000a      potentially biomarkers) to stratify BO patients according to cancer risk\u000d\u000a      and tailoring endoscopic\u000d\u000a      surveillance of BO patients accordingly. The principal aim of the register\u000d\u000a      was to determine the\u000d\u000a      true clinical and public health importance of BO and to influence clinical\u000d\u000a      practice in the UK and\u000d\u000a      internationally by providing unbiased estimates of cancer incidence and\u000d\u000a      mortality in patients\u000d\u000a      diagnosed with this condition. The research has informed changes in\u000d\u000a      influential clinical\u000d\u000a      gastroenterology guidelines.

This work has resulted in a paradigm shift in the thinking\u000d\u000a      of clinicians and health\u000d\u000a      service providers involved in the management of BO. It is now recognised\u000d\u000a      that BO patients\u000d\u000a      should be stratified according to cancer risk and endoscopic surveillance\u000d\u000a      and associated\u000d\u000a      interventions targeted at those with higher cancer risk. Work in NIBR\u000d\u000a      based on clinico-pathological\u000d\u000a      factors has identified some groups at higher cancer risk3 and\u000d\u000a      seminal publications\u000d\u000a      have also identified tissue biomarkers that may be applied within routine\u000d\u000a      clinical settings to aid\u000d\u000a      targeting of surveillance practice.\u000d\u000a    The importance of the research undertaken within the register to the\u000d\u000a      shaping of scientific and\u000d\u000a      clinical thinking with respect to BO is evidenced by the fact that the\u000d\u000a      main publications have been\u000d\u000a      accompanied by editorials from leading practitioners in the field.1,2,4.\u000d\u000a      These editorials have, for\u000d\u000a      example, pointed out that the finding that cancer mortality in BO patients\u000d\u000a      is low `has direct\u000d\u000a        clinical relevance as well as public health significance'.

Rapid increases in the last 30 years in\u000d\u000a      OAC incidence\u000d\u000a      led to the widespread practice of routine endoscopic surveillance in the\u000d\u000a      UK, Europe and USA in\u000d\u000a      patients diagnosed with BO. It has been a widely held premise that the\u000d\u000a      cancer risk in BO\u000d\u000a      patients is high and that regular endoscopy would lead to detection of\u000d\u000a      cancer at an early or pre-invasive\u000d\u000a      stage and thereby provide a cost-effective opportunity for surgery or\u000d\u000a      other\u000d\u000a      interventions; to improve outcomes for BO patients and reduce the public\u000d\u000a      health burden\u000d\u000a      associated with OAC.\u000d\u000a    A systematic review of the published literature in this field undertaken\u000d\u000a      by Professor Liam Murra\u000d\u000a      (Cancer Epidemiologist, Centre for Public Health, Queen's) identified that\u000d\u000a      the case for\u000d\u000a      surveillance of BO patients was primarily based on flawed evidence from\u000d\u000a      small studies of biased\u000d\u000a      high-risk BO populations, which provided inflated estimates of cancer\u000d\u000a      risk.1 The review identified\u000d\u000a      that no unbiased population-based studies of cancer incidence in BO had\u000d\u000a      been performed.\u000d\u000a      Therefore, Professor Murray, Professor Brian Johnston (Gastroenterologist,\u000d\u000a      Belfast Health and\u000d\u000a      Social Care Trust (BHSCT), Honorary Clinical Professor, Queen's), Dr\u000d\u000a      Damian McManus\u000d\u000a      (Pathologist, BHSCT, Honorary Clinical Senior Lecturer, Queen's) and Dr\u000d\u000a      Anna Gavin (Director,\u000d\u000a      Northern Ireland Cancer Registry, Queen's) established the Northern\u000d\u000a      Ireland Barrett's\u000d\u000a      oesophagus Register (NIBR). The NIBR is a unique, population based\u000d\u000a      register of every case of\u000d\u000a      BO diagnosed in NI since 1993. NIBR reflects everyday practice within the\u000d\u000a      NHS and avoids\u000d\u000a      referral biases (e.g. to specialist centres), which afflict other studies\u000d\u000a      in the field. The NIBR was\u000d\u000a      followed up with minimal loss of follow-up (until 2010) for cancer\u000d\u000a      incidence and death. Uniquely,\u000d\u000a      it was possible to access diagnostic BO tissue and link to detailed\u000d\u000a      clinical data.\u000d\u000a    The first NIBR publication was reported in Gut in 2003.2\u000d\u000a      This study showed that, although the\u000d\u000a      death rate from OAC was elevated, OAC accounted for only a small\u000d\u000a      proportion of deaths and\u000d\u000a      the overall mortality in BO patients was the same as in the general\u000d\u000a      population. This was one of\u000d\u000a      the first and most influential reports to query the prevailing view within\u000d\u000a      the scientific and clinical\u000d\u000a      community that BO carried a very high OAC incidence and mortality risk. In\u000d\u000a      2011, the group\u000d\u000a      published the cancer incidence within NIBR.3 The study\u000d\u000a      confirmed that the cancer risk in BO\u000d\u000a      was substantially lower than previously believed and was at a level where\u000d\u000a      the cost-effectiveness\u000d\u000a      of endoscopic surveillance of BO patients was questionable. The study\u000d\u000a      underlined the\u000d\u000a      importance of strategies to identify BO patients who are at the highest\u000d\u000a      risk of developing cancer\u000d\u000a      and in whom surveillance may be beneficial and cost-effective. Such\u000d\u000a      strategies include the use\u000d\u000a      of clinico-pathological characteristics and tissue biomarkers for cancer\u000d\u000a      progression.

Under Evans's leadership the MONICA\u000d\u000a      Manual established the necessary quality assurance procedures and collated\u000d\u000a      the information with which to judge the reliability and comparability of\u000d\u000a      data on risk factors and outcomes of coronary heart disease. This enabled\u000d\u000a      unbiased international comparisons, which allowed policymakers in many\u000d\u000a      countries to make informed decisions about the balance between primary and\u000d\u000a      secondary prevention strategies for cardiovascular disease.\u000d\u000a    Evans was a member of the MONICA Steering Committee from 1990 and was its\u000d\u000a      Publication Coordinator from 1992. He subsequently assumed responsibility\u000d\u000a      for the revision of the MONICA Survey Manual, re-designing several\u000d\u000a      elements to remove ambiguities. In 1994 he became Chairman of the MONICA\u000d\u000a      Steering Committee and he led the MONICA EU Biomed Concerted Action from\u000d\u000a      1996-1999, during which the success of the standardization process was\u000d\u000a      thoroughly assessed and published in a series of reports1. As\u000d\u000a      Chairman and with senior colleagues from other participating centres, he\u000d\u000a      also set the direction for the subsequent MONICA research outputs.\u000d\u000a    The insights gained from the research led to the promotion of uniform\u000d\u000a      methods for cardiovascular surveys (collated as manuals and e-publications\u000d\u000a      on the MONICA website1) and their adoption by initially 38\u000d\u000a      population centres of coronary heart disease registration. Based on the\u000d\u000a      MONICA Manuals, the European Commission supported the development of the\u000a        European Health Examination Survey (EHES). This standardized\u000d\u000a      national health examination surveys in the European countries. The\u000d\u000a      Feasibility of the European Health Examination Survey (FEHES) programme\u000d\u000a      assessed the capacity to conduct uniform national health examination\u000d\u000a      surveys in all EU countries. This feasibility project2\u000d\u000a      (2006-2008) led directly to the EHES Pilot. The pilot in 12 countries\u000d\u000a      between 2009 and 2012supported by the EU Joint Action programme set up the\u000d\u000a      EHES Reference Centre (EU Service Contract) led directly to the production\u000d\u000a      of a European Health Examination Survey Manual2.\u000d\u000a    MONICA's survey manual and consistency of approach has also permitted\u000d\u000a      policy makers to draw robust inferences about trends in CHD and the\u000d\u000a      impacts of prevention and healthcare policies on them. For example,\u000d\u000a      research based on MONICA survey data demonstrated that approximately 60%\u000d\u000a      of the substantial CHD mortality decline in Northern Ireland between 1987\u000d\u000a      and 2007 was attributable to major cardiovascular risk factor changes and\u000d\u000a      approximately 35% was attributable to treatments. These findings were\u000d\u000a      launched by the Chief Medical Officer for Northern Ireland and the\u000d\u000a      Minister for Employment and Learning in April 20123. Similar\u000d\u000a      conclusions have been replicated in many countries4 and would\u000d\u000a      not have been possible but for the adoption of MONICA's harmonised survey\u000d\u000a      methods. Editorials in major journals have long testified to the need for\u000d\u000a      data, such as are available in MONICA, for policy making5,6.\u000d\u000a    Other direct beneficiaries of the research include commissioners of\u000d\u000a      health services. A careful analysis of MONICA data from Belfast and\u000d\u000a      Glasgow7 showed little additional benefit in Belfast of having\u000d\u000a      more expensive medically staffed coronary care ambulances. As a result,\u000d\u000a      local commissioners moved away from supporting a medically manned mobile\u000d\u000a      coronary care ambulance service and supported more paramedic-led coronary\u000d\u000a      care models, appropriate to local geography and service needs.\u000d\u000a    The adoption of the MONICA survey methods also paved the way for a\u000d\u000a      further important commissioning decision at EU level, namely to support\u000d\u000a      the MORGAM programme8, which has already successfully\u000d\u000a      provided follow-up for cardiovascular disease of the cohorts defined by\u000d\u000a      the MONICA risk factor surveys and other similar European population\u000d\u000a      surveys.

The correct\u000d\u000a      policy response to these trends was uncertain because both the incidence\u000d\u000a      of and mortality from CHD is affected by the nature of the presentation,\u000d\u000a      the location of the event and the speed and rigour of the diagnosis and\u000d\u000a      medical intervention. To understand which of these factors could explain\u000d\u000a      international differences in coronary mortality, the World Health\u000d\u000a      Organisation sponsored the MONICA Project (Multinational MONItoring\u000a      of trends and determinants in CArdiovascular disease). Queen's\u000d\u000a      University investigators led by Evans (Professor of Epidemiology, QUB from\u000d\u000a      1988-2010) were the first to join MONICA. Evans attracted the initial\u000d\u000a      grant from the MRC, recruited and trained the staff and was responsible\u000d\u000a      for the project's overall conduct in Northern Ireland. He recruited Kee\u000d\u000a      (Professor of Public Health Medicine) who worked with him from 1994\u000d\u000a      onwards.\u000d\u000a    MONICA was a global epidemiological study on a scale never before matched\u000d\u000a      covering 38 populations, 21 countries in 4 continents over 23 years. Under\u000d\u000a      Evans' leadership, the project was responsible for the detailed assessment\u000d\u000a      of the quality of reporting of populations-at-risk, risk factor and case\u000d\u000a      definitions, and survivorship, all of which were subsequently collated as\u000d\u000a      manuals and e-publications on the MONICA website http:\/\/www.thl.fi\/publications\/monica\/.\u000d\u000a      This huge effort pre-dated the current capability of digital\u000d\u000a      communications and electronic data-capture.\u000d\u000a\u0009  The number of people who die\u000d\u000a      of a heart attack each year comprise those having a heart attack and who\u000d\u000a      die immediately, and the \"early\" survivors who reach hospital but die soon\u000d\u000a      afterwards (within 28 days). The case fatality rate is this number divided\u000d\u000a      by the total number of heart attack patients per year i.e. the incidence\u000d\u000a      of heart attack. The key insights that Evans and the MONICA team made(1,2)\u000d\u000a      were that among countries experiencing a decline in mortality, changes in\u000d\u000a      case fatality (the proportion who die within 28 days) contributed only\u000d\u000a      about a third of the overall improvement and that a major factor was\u000d\u000a      variation in the measurement of incidence. Variability in the suspicion,\u000d\u000a      recognition, and confirmation of non-fatal versus fatal events can create\u000d\u000a      error in the mortality rates if these are not defined accurately.\u000d\u000a      International standards are needed for fair population comparisons and for\u000d\u000a      comparisons of coronary care, so that spurious drivers of overall\u000d\u000a      mortality can be distinguished from real ones. For example, in some low\u000d\u000a      incidence countries where case fatality in women was high, the application\u000d\u000a      of MONICA criteria suggested that non-fatal events in women were less\u000d\u000a      consistently recognised. Less complete recording of non-fatal events\u000d\u000a      artefactually inflates case fatality rates, making the latter a poor proxy\u000d\u000a      for the quality of coronary care. Using consistent case definitions and a\u000d\u000a      uniform measurement of acute coronary care allowed the first comparisons\u000d\u000a      of the pathways of care and mortality in different counties that had\u000d\u000a      differing models of acute out-of-hospital care(3).\u000d\u000a    In summary, MONICA resulted in 120 publications, many confirming that\u000d\u000a      classic risk factors (such as high blood pressure, cholesterol and\u000d\u000a      smoking) only partly explained the trends in heart disease. Residual\u000d\u000a      variance across counties was attributable to difficulties in measurement\u000d\u000a      and analysis(4,5).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38795","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"285570","Name":"Kuwait"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"286963","Name":"Oman"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Shifting delivery of anticoagulation services\u000d\u000a    Impact on Clinical Practice and Patient Health\u000d\u000a    Primary care research within UoB UoA2 has led to the transfer of oral\u000d\u000a      anticoagulation services from secondary to primary care, and latterly\u000d\u000a      patient self-management resulting in improved clinical outcomes for\u000d\u000a      patients throughout the 2008-13 REF impact period.

AF increases in prevalence with age and presents in 12%\u000d\u000a      of people aged over 75 years; 56% of patients with this arrhythmia are\u000d\u000a      over the age of 75. AF is a major risk factor for stroke, leading to a\u000d\u000a      five-fold increase in risk. As risk of stroke increases with age, stroke\u000d\u000a      prevention in elderly people with atrial fibrillation is a key aspect of\u000d\u000a      management for this group. Anticoagulation therapy with warfarin is highly\u000d\u000a      effective in reducing stroke risk but is associated with monitoring costs\u000d\u000a      and higher risk of haemorrhage compared with other treatments. Work on\u000d\u000a      this area has focused on service re- design, screening and treatment for\u000d\u000a      AF and has included generation of robust primary evidence through RCTs\u000d\u000a      [1-5], economic evaluation [4,6] and systematic review [6].\u000d\u000a    Shifting service delivery into primary care\u000d\u000a    Until a decade ago, patients in the UK who received oral anticoagulation\u000d\u000a      management were managed in secondary care because of the need for\u000d\u000a      monitoring via a laboratory blood test, the international normalised ratio\u000d\u000a      (INR). UoB UoA2 has undertaken an extensive primary care research\u000d\u000a      programme within the area of service delivery for oral anticoagulation\u000d\u000a      management (Professor David Fitzmaurice, Professor of Primary\u000d\u000a      Care, UoB; Dr Kate Fletcher, Stroke Prevention Programme Manager\u000d\u000a      UoB; Professor Richard Hobbs, Professor of Primary Care,\u000d\u000a      UoB until April 2011; Mr Roger Holder, Medical Statistician, UoB;\u000d\u000a      Dr Susan Jowett, Senior Lecturer in Health Economics, UoB;\u000d\u000a      Professor Gregory Lip, Consultant Cardiologist and Professor of\u000d\u000a      Cardiovascular Medicine, UoB [UoA1]; Professor Jonathan Mant,\u000d\u000a      Professor of Primary Care, UoB until September 2008; Dr Ellen Murray,\u000d\u000a      Senior Lecturer in Primary Care, UoB; Mrs Andrea Roalfe, Senior\u000d\u000a      Lecturer in Primary Care, UoB) led by Fitzmaurice (NHS national\u000d\u000a      R&amp;D Primary Care Career Scientist Award (CSA99\/025)) to investigate\u000d\u000a      the integration and evaluation of new technologies &amp; the Birmingham\u000d\u000a      model, comprising computerised decision support dosing software, and point\u000d\u000a      of care INR testing within primary care, to facilitate oral\u000d\u000a      anticoagulation management [1].\u000d\u000a    Self-monitoring of oral anticoagulation\u000d\u000a    In 1999, UoB's primary care grouping within UoA2 began the SMART\u000d\u000a      (Self-Management of Anticoagulation: a Randomised Trial) study (PI: Fitzmaurice,\u000d\u000a      &#163;285K, MRC, 1999-2002). SMART demonstrated the effectiveness of\u000d\u000a      self-management for approximately 25% of patients receiving warfarin,\u000d\u000a      compared with routine care whether provided through primary or secondary\u000d\u000a      care [2]. These data were the first UK RCT data and the first in the world\u000d\u000a      from primary care and have underpinned subsequent meta-analyses\u000d\u000a      demonstrating the clinical and cost-effectiveness of this model of care\u000d\u000a      (Garcia-Alamino et al Cochrane review 2010). Different models of managing\u000d\u000a      long- term oral anticoagulation therapy have also been assessed [6]. More\u000d\u000a      recently the Patient Self- Management registry (PI: Fitzmaurice\u000d\u000a      &#163;50k, NIHR National School for Primary Care Research 2011-2014) has been\u000d\u000a      developed. As more people undertake self-monitoring or self- management of\u000d\u000a      their oral anticoagulation it is important to ensure that therapeutic\u000d\u000a      control is maintained. This electronic central register provides a\u000d\u000a      valuable tool for studying the safety and effectiveness of this method of\u000d\u000a      service delivery. This study is evaluating the feasibility of patients\u000d\u000a      with AF who self- monitor or self-manage their conditions entering their\u000d\u000a      data onto a website to produce a register.\u000d\u000a    Screening for AF\u000d\u000a    The Screening for Atrial Fibrillation in the Elderly (SAFE) study (Fitzmaurice\u000d\u000a      (PI), Hobbs, Mant, &#163;485k HTA funded 1999-2003) was\u000d\u000a      a trial of systematic screening (targeted and total population screening)\u000d\u000a      versus routine practice for the detection of AF in 15,000 patients aged\u000d\u000a      over 65 [3,4]. SAFE determined the optimal method of AF diagnosis &amp;\u000d\u000a      ECG interpretation [3] and established the incremental cost-effectiveness\u000d\u000a      (Jowett) of different screening options compared with routine\u000d\u000a      clinical practice, determining that opportunistic screening was most\u000d\u000a      cost-effective [4].\u000d\u000a    Management of AF\u000d\u000a    Meta-analysis has demonstrated that anticoagulants are significantly more\u000d\u000a      effective than aspirin at preventing stroke, but that this benefit is at\u000d\u000a      the cost of higher risk of major bleeding (van Walraven C, Hart RG, Singer\u000d\u000a      DE, Laupacis A, Connolly S, Petersen P et al. Oral anticoagulants vs\u000d\u000a      aspirin in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation: an individual patient\u000d\u000a      meta-analysis. JAMA 2002 ; 288(19) : 2441-8.). However, there were\u000d\u000a      concerns as to the applicability of this research to elderly patients with\u000d\u000a      AF, particularly in primary care settings.\u000d\u000a    In view of these uncertainties, the primary care grouping within UoB's\u000d\u000a      UoA2 conducted the BAFTA (Birmingham Atrial Fibrillation Treatment of the\u000d\u000a      Aged) study (PIs: Fitzmaurice, Hobbs, &#163;740k MRC,\u000d\u000a      1999-2004). This compared the efficacy of warfarin with that of aspirin\u000d\u000a      for the prevention of stroke in a primary care population of 973 patients\u000d\u000a      with AF aged 75 years or over.\u000d\u000a    The effect on stroke prevention reported in the BAFTA study [5] was\u000d\u000a      similar to that reported in the 2002 meta-analysis. However, the key\u000d\u000a      difference between the two results is that the meta-analysis showed a\u000d\u000a      doubling of risk of major haemorrhage in people on oral anticoagulants\u000d\u000a      compared with those on aspirin, whereas the BAFTA study found no such\u000d\u000a      difference. The BAFTA study provided accurate data on the risk of\u000d\u000a      haemorrhage, which appears to be an important factor in physicians'\u000d\u000a      decisions whether to prescribe warfarin. In addition, the study\u000d\u000a      demonstrated the actual benefits of warfarin compared to aspirin and\u000d\u000a      reported data showing improved efficacy and equivalent safety of warfarin\u000d\u000a      versus aspirin in stroke prevention in the very elderly. The study\u000d\u000a      provided evidence to support the use of anticoagulation therapy (warfarin)\u000d\u000a      for people aged over 75 with AF unless there are contraindications or the\u000d\u000a      patient chooses otherwise [5].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38796","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The key impacts are as follows:\u000a    Impact on public policy\u000a      NICE guidelines are the accepted standard for determining the management\u000a      of hypertension in UK\u000a      primary care. As a result of this research, the National Institute for\u000a      Health and Clinical Excellence\u000a      (NICE) has published a new guideline for the Clinical Management of\u000a      Primary Hypertension in\u000a      Adults (CG 127; 24 August 2011). The guideline reported the inaccuracy of\u000a      CBPM using this\u000a      research: \"these findings suggest that the current practice of using a\u000a        series of CBPM alone for the\u000a        diagnosis of hypertension can lead to inaccurate diagnosis\" and that\u000a      \"this detailed analysis\u000a        suggested that the current practice of using CBPM to define hypertension\u000a        will lead to drug\u000a        treatment being offered to a substantial number of people who are\u000a        normotensive according to\u000a        ABPM\". The Guideline Development Group \"thus recommended that\u000a        ABPM should be\u000a        implemented for the routine diagnosis of hypertension in primary care\"\u000a      [1]\u000a    Impact on clinical practice and health\u000a      The key to the success of implementing the recommendations of the review\u000a      is buy-in from\u000a      clinicians. The original research was widely reported in the national\u000a      press, including the Daily\u000a      Telegraph, the Guardian and the GP publication Pulse [2]. At the time of\u000a      the full publication of the\u000a      NICE guidelines, it was again widely reported, including on BBC national\u000a      news and on the BBC\u000a      website [3]. To encourage adoption, the British Hypertension Society has\u000a      made a series of videos\u000a      covering key aspects of the guidance [4]. These, along with the NICE\u000a      implementation materials\u000a      (http:\/\/www.nice.org.uk\/CG127),\u000a      are helping to facilitate dissemination and implementation of this\u000a      evidence-based evolution of the NICE hypertension guidelines.\u000a    As the NICE guidelines are relatively new (2011) it is not possible at\u000a      this stage to specify impact in\u000a      terms of changes in patient outcome, however the NICE Primary Care Quality\u000a      and Outcomes\u000a      Framework Indicator Advisory Committee recommended that an indicator be\u000a      piloted to ensure\u000a      practices use ABPM for all new diagnoses of hypertension; the proposed\u000a      wording of the indicator\u000a      is: `The percentage of patients with a new diagnosis of hypertension after\u000a      1 April 2012 whose\u000a      diagnosis was confirmed following ABPM.'[Pulse http:\/\/www.pulsetoday.co.uk\/nice-to-pilot-ambulatory-blood-pressure-monitoring-qof-indicator\/14101039.article].\u000a    Economic impact\u000a      The cost-effectiveness analysis of ABPM conducted by the University of\u000a      Birmingham was reported\u000a      by the full NICE clinical guidelines \"This analysis suggests that ABPM\u000a        is the most cost-effective\u000a        method of confirming a diagnosis of hypertension in a population\u000a        suspected of having hypertension\u000a        based on a Clinical BPM screening measurement &gt;140\/90 mmHg, compared\u000a        with further CBPM or\u000a        HBPM. This conclusion was consistent across a range of age\/gender\u000a        stratified subgroups.\" and\u000a      impacted on the NICE guideline [1].\u000a    The research has also influenced the South African Hypertension guideline\u000a      of 2011 which\u000a      recommends that ABPM should be encouraged for clear indications, quoting\u000a      the economic\u000a      evidence generated in this research as evidence for this guidance [5]: \"In\u000a        patients with a raised\u000a        clinic BP, ABPM was shown to reduce misdiagnosis and save costs\u000a        (reference, Lovibond et al)\".\u000a    Impact on education and CPD\u000a      The research is influencing medical education.

High blood\u000a      pressure (or hypertension) is\u000a      the major cause of stroke and other cardiovascular disease and is one of\u000a      the most important\u000a      preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in developed and developing\u000a      countries. At least a\u000a      quarter of the adult population of the UK has hypertension, and this\u000a      figure rises to more than 50%\u000a      in people over the age of 60 years. Hypertension is the commonest chronic\u000a      disorder seen in\u000a      primary care with around 1:8 receiving antihypertensive treatment in the\u000a      UK. Moreover, as the\u000a      demographics shift towards an older, more sedentary and obese population,\u000a      the prevalence of\u000a      hypertension and the requirement for effective treatment will continue to\u000a      rise.\u000a    High blood pressure is currently diagnosed in primary care and in\u000a      hospital clinics using the\u000a      traditional technique of measurement by a GP or nurse with either a\u000a      mercury sphygmomanometer\u000a      and stethoscope or with an automated device. In terms of patient outcomes,\u000a      these methods\u000a      compare poorly with ABPM where a cuff connected to a portable monitor is\u000a      worn continuously by\u000a      the patient for a period of 24 hours. However, no previous study had\u000a      attempted to bring together\u000a      and synthesise the literature on the accuracy of diagnosis of hypertension\u000a      using different methods\u000a      of measurement.\u000a    This research, which forms part of the Birmingham\/ Oxford Universities\u000a      Collaborative BP\u000a      Monitoring Programme Group, has provided robust evidence of the\u000a      superiority of ABPM over clinic\u000a      (CBPM) and home (HBPM) blood pressure monitoring in diagnosing\u000a      hypertension. In 2009, a\u000a      group led from Primary Care within the University of Birmingham (Professor\u000a      Richard McManus,\u000a      Professor of Primary Care, UoB up to 31 August 2011; Professor Richard Hobbs,\u000a      Professor of\u000a      Primary Care, UoB up to 30 April 2011; Dr Pelham Barton, Reader in\u000a      Economic Modelling, UoB;\u000a      Dr James Hodgkinson, Research Fellow, UoB; Dr Boliang Guo,\u000a      Research Fellow, UoB) and\u000a      working with others in the University of Birmingham (Professor Jon Deeks,\u000a      Professor of Health\u000a      Statistics, UoB; Dr Una Martin, Reader in Clinical Pharmacology,\u000a      UoB [UoA1]) and in the\u000a      University of Oxford (Mant, Heneghan, Roberts) conducted a systematic\u000a      review of the worldwide\u000a      literature and a meta-analysis using hierarchical summary\u000a      receiver-operating characteristic\u000a      models. The study was funded by an NIHR Programme Grant for Applied\u000a      Research (RP-PG-0407-10347,\u000a      Mant et al, including McManus, Hobbs); Hodgkinson,\u000a      McManus and Martin extracted the\u000a      data in conjunction with Mant; Guo, Hodgkinson and Deeks\u000a      undertook the analysis.\u000a    The objective of the systematic review was to determine the relative\u000a      accuracy of clinic\u000a      measurements and home blood pressure monitoring compared with ambulatory\u000a      blood pressure\u000a      monitoring as a reference standard for the diagnosis of hypertension. The\u000a      research identified that,\u000a      compared with ambulatory monitoring, neither clinic nor home blood\u000a      pressure measurements have\u000a      sufficient sensitivity or specificity to be recommended as a single\u000a      diagnostic test. If ambulatory\u000a      monitoring is taken as the reference standard, then treatment decisions\u000a      based on clinic or home\u000a      blood pressure alone may result in substantial over-diagnosis (and\u000a      subsequent over-medication\u000a      and unnecessary cost). For example, if the prevalence of hypertension in a\u000a      screened population\u000a      was 30%, there would only be a 56% chance that the clinic measurement\u000a      would be correct\u000a      compared with using the ABPM methods. These results suggest that\u000a      ambulatory monitoring prior\u000a      to commencement of life-long drug treatment would lead to more appropriate\u000a      targeting of\u000a      treatment, particularly around the diagnostic threshold [1]. The review\u000a      was published in BMJ in\u000a      2011 and has been cited 45 times.\u000a    The research findings had profound implications for the diagnosis of\u000a      hypertension, particularly as\u000a      ambulatory monitors are considerably more expensive than clinic BP\u000a      monitors so, as part of the\u000a      programme grant, health economists at the University of Birmingham (Dr Sue\u000a      Jowett, Senior\u000a      Lecturer in Health Economics; Dr Pelham Barton, Reader in Economic\u000a      Modelling) and the\u000a      National Clinical Guideline Centre (Lovibond, Wonderling) in conjunction\u000a      with the Birmingham team\u000a      described above and members of the relevant clinical guidelines group\u000a      undertook the most\u000a      detailed cost-benefit analysis ever conducted for ABPM. The UoB health\u000a      economists supervised\u000a      the modelling, which was conducted by Lovibond at NICE.\u000a    This Markov model-based probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis of the\u000a      three different diagnostic\u000a      strategies for hypertension included a hypothetical primary care\u000a      population aged &#8805;40 years with a\u000a      screening blood pressure measurement above 140\/90 mmHg and risk factor\u000a      prevalence reflecting\u000a      the general population. Ambulatory monitoring was identified as the most\u000a      cost effective strategy for\u000a      the diagnosis of hypertension for men and women of all ages, and resulted\u000a      in more quality-adjusted\u000a      life years (QALYs) for male and female groups aged over 50. Implementation\u000a      of a\u000a      diagnostic strategy for hypertension using ambulatory monitoring following\u000a      an initial raised clinic\u000a      reading would reduce misdiagnosis and reduce unnecessary treatment costs.\u000a      Whilst ABP monitors\u000a      are expensive, the additional costs of ambulatory monitoring are more than\u000a      offset by cost savings\u000a      from better targeting of treatment and the study estimated that it use\u000a      would save the NHS &#163;10.5M\u000a      per annum. The study indicated that service commissioners should recommend\u000a      ambulatory\u000a      monitoring prior to the commencement of anti-hypertensives for the\u000a      majority of patients. The\u000a      results showed clearly that the use of ABPM would result in substantial\u000a      savings to the NHS.\u000a    These findings were published in the Lancet in 2011 and have been cited\u000a      more than 30 times [2].\u000a      Media coverage included television (ITV central; reach 655,000), print\u000a      newspapers (Daily Mail,\u000a      Daily Express; reach 2,434,00) and online (BBC, Forbes; reach 8,352,000).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38797","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    This work has had major impacts on international policy and practice &#8212;\u000a      including patient groups\u000a      who wish to campaign on this topic &#8212; as well as directly for children and\u000a      their parents where the\u000a      test has been implemented as a result. The research was described as `a\u000a      new milestone in the\u000a      history of congenital heart disease' in a Lancet editorial [1].\u000a    Impact on international policy\u000a    The Lancet paper (2011), HTA report (2012) and subsequent international\u000a      media attention led to a\u000a      demand from policy makers internationally for advice on implementation of\u000a      pulse oximetry. In the\u000a      USA, where CCHD affects about 4,800 babies born every year, Dr Ewer was\u000a      invited in 2011 to\u000a      advise a working group of the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Heritable\u000a      Diseases in Newborns'\u000a      and Children (SACHDNC) in Washington, USA with his data described as\u000a      `instrumental in creating\u000a      recommendations for the screening algorithm' [2] . Following this meeting,\u000a      the group issued a\u000a      statement advocating the introduction of pulse oximetry screening endorsed\u000a      by the American\u000a      Academy of Pediatrics [3] and the American Heart Association [4]. As a\u000a      direct result, in 2011 the\u000a      US Secretary for Health and Human Services recommended the addition of\u000a      pulse oximetry\u000a      screening for CCHD across the US [5,6], with the chosen strategy [7]\u000a      referencing just the work of\u000a      the Birmingham team (reference 14) and one Swedish study. Seven US states\u000a      (including New\u000a      Jersey, Michigan) currently perform routine screening; 27 others have\u000a      passed legislation towards\u000a      this goal, with 3 having active legislation in process. Current\u000a      information on progress towards\u000a      legislation can be obtained at [8] and an example of guidance on screening\u000a      referencing the\u000a      Birmingham team's work for the state of Alabama at [9].\u000a    The research has also impacted on provision in Ireland, where the Royal\u000a      College of Physicians in\u000a      2011 recommended that pulse oximetry `should be undertaken in all Units\u000a      across the country',\u000a      citing the `seminal research' of the Birmingham team as the basis for the\u000a      decision, and indicating\u000a      that screening would identify 99 babies per year with the condition [10].\u000a    Impact on UK policy\u000a    The UK National Screening Committee (NSC) assesses evidence for\u000a      programmes against a set of\u000a      internationally recognised screening criteria, advises ministers\/the NHS\u000a      on all aspects of screening\u000a      and supports implementation of screening programmes. The UK NSC will\u000a      shortly conduct a public\u000a      consultation over whether to add pulse oximetry to the assessment of\u000a      newborn babies. The\u000a      consultation highlights the `...considerable research evidence to\u000a        demonstrate that pulse oximetry,\u000a        as an adjunct to clinical examination, increases the detection rate of\u000a        critical or life-threatening\u000a        CHDs at the newborn screening opportunity' and that `routine\u000a        pulse oximetry is probably the most\u000a        promising additional newborn screening modality' under\u000a      consideration, for which the University of\u000a      Birmingham's work provides the bulk of the underpinning rationale and\u000a      evidence [11].\u000a    Impact on UK clinical practice and patient health\u000a    Although the UK policy situation is still developing, changes in clinical\u000a      practice are already\u000a      occurring. A 2010 national survey found that only 7% of UK neonatal units\u000a      were undertaking\u000a      routine pulse oximetry screening. A survey of 204 units in 2012 indicated\u000a      a rise in these figures,\u000a      with 18% of units utilising pulse oximetry routinely and 4% in the process\u000a      of introducing it [12]. Of\u000a      non-screening units, 70% were considering its introduction. This survey\u000a      and associated\u000a      correspondence clearly indicates a shift of opinion among UK\u000a      neonatologists about pulse oximetry\u000a      screening, with a substantial majority now in favour, albeit with\u000a      reservations about cost.\u000a    One centre adopting pulse oximetry screening is Birmingham Women's\u000a      Hospital, with 8000 live\u000a      births per year. With screening, over a three year period (2010-13) there\u000a      were 187 admissions as\u000a      a result of an abnormal screening test. This equates to approximately\u000a      60\/year, 0.8% of all live\u000a      births. Of the 187 babies admitted, seven had a critical congenital heart\u000a      defect unsuspected prior\u000a      to screening. Five further babies had an unsuspected non-critical\u000a      congenital heart defect. Further,\u000a      for those 180 babies who did not have critical congenital heart defects,\u000a      many other serious health\u000a      conditions (including congenital pneumonia, sepsis and pulmonary\u000a      hypertension) were identified\u000a      through the positive pulse oximetry screening, and only 36\/180 (20%)\u000a      admitted babies had no\u000a      health issues. This indicates the additional benefits obtained through\u000a      incorporating this screening\u000a      into routine practice.

Timely\u000a      diagnosis is crucial for the\u000a      best possible outcome for these children. However, the accuracy of current\u000a      methods for screening\u000a      newborn babies for critical congenital heart defects (CCHD) is variable\u000a      and currently only detects\u000a      these issues in between 35-50% of babies before birth. Although some cases\u000a      are picked up after\u000a      birth, up to a third of children with these problems are sent home\u000a      undiagnosed, where they may\u000a      become unwell or die.

They are a leading cause of\u000a      infant deaths in the\u000a      developed world, with most deaths occurring in the first year of life.\u000a      Critical congenital heart defects\u000a      (CCHD) are a key subset; affecting around 2\/1000 babies, they are have\u000a      significant implications for\u000a      the child's survival. If they are not detected early, risks for\u000a      circulatory collapse increase. Although\u000a      surgery can greatly improve survival, if diagnosis is not timely, the risk\u000a      of surgical mortality also\u000a      increases. Screening for congenital heart defects at the time of the\u000a      research relied on antenatal\u000a      ultrasonography and postnatal clinical examination. However, these methods\u000a      are not very accurate\u000a      for detecting CCHD, identifying before birth only 35-50% of babies for\u000a      whom it is a problem. For\u000a      the remaining babies, these defects are then either identified after birth\u000a      or remain undetected when\u000a      children are sent home. Overall, around one third of children with these\u000a      potentially life-threatening\u000a      heart defects are discharged from hospital without being diagnosed.\u000a    A team from the University of Birmingham UoA2 (Professor Jon Deeks,\u000a      Professor of Health\u000a      Statistics, UoB; Professor Tracy Roberts, Professor of Health\u000a      Economics, UoB; Dr Pelham\u000a      Barton, Reader in Mathematical Modelling, UoB; Dr Jane Daniels,\u000a      Senior Research Fellow, UoB,\u000a      Alexandra Furmston; Trial Co-ordinator, UoB, Lee Middleton,\u000a      Statistician, UoB; Peter Auguste,\u000a      Research Associate, UoB until December 2012) with clinical colleagues in\u000a      UoB UoA1 (Bhoyar,\u000a      Ewer, Khan, Thangaratinam) and others (Edwards, Birmingham Women's\u000a      Hospital; Pattison,\u000a      Aston; University, Wright, Birmingham Children's Hospital) has worked\u000a      since 2007 to conduct a\u000a      programme of research around the use of pulse oximetry to better identify\u000a      babies with these\u000a      problems.\u000a    It is well established that blood oxygen levels are often low in CCHD and\u000a      so one way of identifying\u000a      these defects might be to identify those babies with low blood oxygen\u000a      levels. Pulse oximetry is a\u000a      method of measuring blood oxygen levels by placing a sensor on part of the\u000a      patient's body (such\u000a      as a fingertip or earlobe), not requiring any invasive techniques. The\u000a      sensor can detect the baby's\u000a      oxygenation levels during labour. The technique was developed in the 1970s\u000a      and explored for\u000a      monitoring fetal oxygenation, but results had been inconclusive. The\u000a      University of Birmingham\u000a      team conducted a systematic review in 2007 which showed encouraging\u000a      results but drew attention\u000a      to various difficulties in assessing the accuracy of pulse oximetry\u000a      including variations in patient\u000a      selection, timing of measurement, cut-offs for a positive result, types of\u000a      congenital heart defects\u000a      screened for, rigour of follow-up, and type of oximeters used [1]. The\u000a      systematic review\u000a      demonstrated a clear need for a larger, robust, well-conducted study to\u000a      confirm the value,\u000a      acceptability and cost effectiveness of such a screening programme.\u000a    In 2007, the National Institute of Health Research funded the PulseOx\u000a      study (Ewer, Daniels,\u000a        Roberts, Thangaratinam, Khan, Deeks, Pattison, Wright, NIHR\u000a      HTA; &#163;947k 2007-10). This large,\u000a      multi-centre study assessed the accuracy of pulse oximetry for screening\u000a      major congenital heart\u000a      defects in newborn babies. It was the largest UK study in this field,\u000a      screening 20,055 newborn\u000a      babies between February 2008 and January 2009, and the first to assess the\u000a      added value of pulse\u000a      oximetry screening in modern healthcare systems where antenatal ultrasound\u000a      screening was\u000a      widely available. The study used robust methods to generate precise\u000a      estimates of the accuracy\u000a      [2,3], cost-effectiveness [2,4] and acceptability [2,5] of pulse oximetry.\u000a      The test accuracy paper\u000a      [2,3] demonstrated that the addition of pulse oximetry screening to the\u000a      routine anomaly scan and\u000a      newborn physical examination resulted in 92% of babies with critical\u000a      congenital heart defects being\u000a      detected prior to discharge; no baby died with unidentified congenital\u000a      heart defects. The study\u000a      found that pulse oximetry is a safe, feasible (i.e. easy to undertake and\u000a      simple to adopt into routine\u000a      practice) test that complements and adds value to existing screening by\u000a      identifying more issues at\u000a      birth, including cases of CCHD that would go undetected with antenatal\u000a      ultrasonography. The\u000a      team also demonstrated that pulse oximetry screening in combination with\u000a      clinical examination\u000a      identified almost 30 additional CCHD cases per 100,000 live births with a\u000a      timely diagnosis\u000a      compared with routine clinical examination alone, with a very high\u000a      likelihood (over 90%) that this\u000a      would be regarded as `cost-effective', i.e. worth the extra investment\u000a      needed to identify these\u000a      cases [2,4]. The acceptability research undertaken clearly showed that\u000a      both parents and health\u000a      professionals felt the test was not painful, difficult to perform or\u000a      inconvenient [2,5]. False-positive\u000a      results did not significantly increase anxiety. Overall, the results\u000a      substantially enhanced the\u000a      evidence that indicates the potential benefits of the introduction of\u000a      pre-discharge pulse oximetry\u000a      screening as a routine procedure.\u000a    Media coverage of the work has included print newspapers (Guardian,\u000a      Independent, Scotsman,\u000a      Express, Star; reach 319,300), Radio (Heart FM, Classic FM, BBC Radio WM;\u000a      reach 97,300) and\u000a      online (Mail, Guardian, Telegraph, Independent; reach 4,888,400).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38798","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"3077311","Name":"Czech Republic"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Impact on Public Policy\u000a    CARE-HF has been used as key evidence supporting the use of cardiac\u000a      resynchronization therapy in a series of international guidelines at both\u000a      regional (Europe [1]) and national level, in countries as diverse as\u000a      Australia [2], Brazil [3], Canada [4], Czech Republic [5], New Zealand\u000a      [2,6], and USA [7,8,9].

CARE-HF was one of\u000a      4 RCTs considered by the NICE Appraisal Committee on CRT-P versus optimal\u000a      pharmacological therapy alone (see p7-15). In addition the strict clinical\u000a      inclusion criteria was adopted by the committee as a requirement in\u000a      clinical practice (see pages 14\/15):\u000a    \"The Committee noted that in one of the large studies (CARE-HF)\u000a        additional evidence of mechanical dyssynchrony from echocardiography was\u000a        required in patients with a QRS duration of between 120 ms and 150 ms,\u000a        and was therefore persuaded that such a requirement would be appropriate\u000a        to use in clinical practice.\" (p14)\u000a    \"The Committee also understood from the clinical specialists that\u000a        confirmation of the presence of mechanical dyssynchrony by\u000a        echocardiography was considered appropriate in patients with electrical\u000a        dyssynchrony as indicated by a QRS duration of between 120 ms and 149\u000a        ms. The Committee noted that this approach was the same as the inclusion\u000a        criteria for the CARE-HF trial.\" (p15)\u000a    The publication of the CARE-HF Trial was a substantial contribution\u000a      within the overall portfolio of evidence which has seen the use of CRT\u000a      substantially increased throughout Europe. Eucomed data, based on reports\u000a      from major device manufacturers, suggest an increase in CRT (+\/-ICD) use\u000a      across Europe rising from 86 units per million inhabitants in 2008 to 141\u000a      units per million inhabitants in 2012 [12]. In the UK new CRT implants\u000a      have increased significantly following the publication of the CARE-HF\u000a      trial in 2005 [12] and are now over 100\/million population [13].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Heart failure affects more than 22 million people worldwide, including 6\u000a      million in Europe and 5 million in the United States, with approximately\u000a      500,000 new patients diagnosed each year.\u000a    The cardiac resynchronisation in heart failure trial (CARE-HF)\u000a      demonstrated that, in patients with heart failure and cardiac\u000a      dyssynchrony, use of an implantable pacemaker to improve heart contraction\u000a      led to a 37% reduction in the risk of death and hospitalisations and\u000a      significant improvements in patient quality of life. The benefits are in\u000a      addition to those of standard pharmacologic therapy.

Early studies of an implantable pacemaker &#8212; cardiac\u000a      resynchronization therapy (CRT) suggested that it was a promising new\u000a      intervention for patients with heart failure, left ventricular systolic\u000a      dysfunction and ventricular dyssynchrony with evidence that CRT decreased\u000a      symptoms, improved exercise capacity, quality of life, and ventricular\u000a      function. The COMPANION trial (2004) showed that CRT alone or combined\u000a      with an implantable defibrillator reduced the composite end point of death\u000a      from any cause or hospitalization during a mean follow-up of 16 months;\u000a      however, the decrease in the risk of death was not significant with CRT\u000a      alone (P=0.06). Meta-analyses left lingering uncertainty about the effects\u000a      of cardiac resynchronization on the risk of complications and death.\u000a    From 2001 to 2005, a team from the University of Birmingham (Professor\u000a      Nick Freemantle, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology and\u000a      Biostatistics, UoB up to April 2011; Dr Melanie Calvert, Reader in\u000a      Epidemiology, UoB) led the design and analysis of the landmark Cardiac\u000a      Resychronisation in Heart Failure Trial (CARE-HF) and its extension study.\u000a      The CARE-HF trial (PI Cleland, University of Hull; funded by Medtronic\u000a      Ltd; design &amp; analysis Freemantle, Calvert) was a\u000a      multi-centre, international, randomised controlled trial to evaluate\u000a      long-term effects of CRT on the mortality and morbidity of patients with\u000a      heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction and cardiac\u000a      dyssynchrony who were receiving standard pharmacologic therapy. A total of\u000a      813 patients were recruited between January 2001 and March 2003 at 82\u000a      centres across 12 European countries. Patients were randomly assigned to\u000a      receive medical therapy alone or with CRT and followed for a mean of 29.4\u000a      months.\u000a    The primary end point was the time to death from any cause or unplanned\u000a      hospitalisation for a major cardiovascular event. The principal secondary\u000a      end point was death from any cause. The primary end point was reached by\u000a      159 patients in the cardiac-resynchronization group, as compared with 224\u000a      patients in the medical-therapy group (39 percent vs. 55 percent; hazard\u000a      ratio, 0.63; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.51 to 0.77; P&lt;0.001).\u000a      There were 82 deaths in the CRT group, as compared with 120 in the\u000a      medical-therapy group (20 percent vs. 30 percent; hazard ratio 0.64; 95\u000a      percent confidence interval, 0.48 to 0.85; P&lt;0.002). As compared with\u000a      medical therapy, CRT reduced the interventricular mechanical delay, the\u000a      end-systolic volume index, and the area of the mitral regurgitant jet;\u000a      increased the left ventricular ejection fraction; and improved symptoms\u000a      and the quality of life (P&lt;0.01 for all comparisons). This landmark\u000a      trial thus demonstrated significant improvements in survival and quality\u000a      of life in patients randomised to CRT. These benefits are in addition to\u000a      those afforded by standard pharmacologic therapy and it was recommended\u000a      that the implantation of a cardiac-resynchronization device should\u000a      routinely be considered in such patients. The results were published in\u000a      the New England journal of Medicine [1] and have been cited 2715 times accessed\u000a        via Scopus online 30th July 2013. The\u000a      observed benefits in survival and quality of life were sustained over time\u000a      [2].\u000a    Whilst the CARE-HF trial demonstrated reduced morbidity and mortality,\u000a      CRT is relatively costly thus it was essential to establish the\u000a      incremental cost-effectiveness of using the device compared to standard\u000a      care. Within trial and life-time simulation model based cost-effectiveness\u000a      analyses were led from the University of Birmingham (Freemantle;\u000a        Calvert; Professor Stirling Bryan, Professor of\u000a      Health Economics, UoB, up to August 2008; Dr Lily Yao,\u000a      Senior Lecturer in Health Economics, UoB, up to February 2013; Professor\u000a      Lucinda Billingham, Professor of Biostatistics, UoB) in\u000a      conjunction with CARE-HF investigators from elsewhere (Cleland, Daubert).\u000a      The aim of the within trial cost-effectiveness analysis was to evaluate\u000a      the incremental cost per QALY gained and incremental cost per life year\u000a      gained of CRT plus medical therapy compared to medical therapy alone. It.\u000a      CRT was associated with increased costs (&#8364;4316, 95% CI: 1327 to 7485),\u000a      survival (0.10 years, 95% CI: &#8212; 0.01 to 0.21), and QALYs (0.22, 95% CI:\u000a      0.13 to 0.32). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was &#8364;19 319 per\u000a      QALY gained (95% CI: 5482 to 45 402) and &#8364;43 596 per life-year gained (95%\u000a      CI: &#8212; 146 236 to 223 849) [3]. A further long term cost-effectiveness\u000a      analysis used a lifetime simulation model developed based upon individual\u000a      patient data from the CARE-HF trial to examine the additional effect of\u000a      CRT with an implantable cardioverter-defibrilator (ICD) function, which\u000a      further reduces risk of death. Both CRT + medical therapy and CRT-ICD +\u000a      medical therapy were cost-effective at a notional willingness to pay\u000a      threshold of &#8364;29 400 (&#163;20,000) but the latter to a lesser extent [4].\u000a      There were also contributions to cost-effectiveness analyses for the\u000a      Nordic region and Greece (Freemantle, Calvert).\u000a    The CARE-HF trial has resulted in a further 24 publications (including\u000a      Birmingham authors Freemantle; Calvert; Dr Puvanendran Tharmanathan,\u000a      doctoral student, UoB up to December 2008; Matthew Richardson,\u000a      research fellow, UoB up to April 2012; Aparna Shankar,\u000a      research associate, UoB up to August 2008) on topics including quality of\u000a      life [5], neurohormonal effects, procedure success rate and predictors of\u000a      outcome.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"38799","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Impact on Public Policy\u000a    This research on the effects of epidurals at the University of Birmingham\u000a      has directly influenced and changed clinical practice in the UK and\u000a      internationally. The COMET trial is the definitive (and only) trial in the\u000a      review of traditional versus modern regimens of epidural infusion in the\u000a      UK NICE Intrapartum Care guideline updated in 2008 and still current, and\u000a      led to the recommendation stating that: `traditional high\u000a        concentration local anaesthetic solutions (0.25% or above of bupivacaine\u000a        or equivalent) should not be used routinely for either establishing or\u000a        maintaining epidural analgesia' [1]. It had previously been\u000a      calculated by others that such changes would result in 10,000 fewer\u000a      instrumental deliveries year on year in the UK (Thornton JG, Capogna G.\u000a      Reducing likelihood of instrumental delivery with epidural anaesthesia.\u000a      The Lancet 2001; 358: 2001). Forceps births are known to be associated\u000a      with increased problems for women, such as faecal incontinence, perineal\u000a      pain and pain on intercourse (dyspareunia).\u000a    These changes to UK policy are reinforced by Royal College of\u000a      Anaesthetists Guidelines (2009, 2013) on the provision of Obstetric\u000a      Anaesthesia Services, which recommends that units should be able to\u000a      provide low dose regional analgesia, citing COMET as the sole reference\u000a      [2]. Internationally, the COMET trial has influenced clinical policy in\u000a      Canada and Australia. The Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in\u000a      Health (2010) clinical guidelines on effectiveness and safety of\u000a      ambulatory epidural analgesia in obstetrics [3] includes references to the\u000a      main Lancet paper and several of the subsequent COMET papers. These\u000a      subsequent papers have provided evidence on safety and leg strength in\u000a      relation to ambulation, urinary catheterisation and anaesthetic outcomes\u000a      such as speed of analgesia, drug utilisation and requirement for\u000a      anaesthetist re-attendance. In Western Australia, the research was\u000a      referenced in 2010 in the Department of Health's Women and Newborn Health\u000a      Service, obstetrics and midwifery clinical guidelines [4].\u000a    Impact on Clinical Practice and Patient Care\u000a    There has been impact on patients throughout the 2008-2013 impact period\u000a      resulting both from these policy changes as well as earlier guidelines\u000a      that were still current during this time. The Obstetric Anaesthetists'\u000a      Association (OAA) \/ The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and\u000a      Ireland (AAGBI) Guidelines for Obstetric Anaesthetic Services [5]\u000a      had recommended in 2005 (with COMET as the sole reference) that units\u000a      should have guidelines for management of epidural blocks and should be\u000a      able to provide low-dose regional analgesia. Together, the original\u000a      research and the subsequent guidelines and policy changes, have moved the\u000a      UK from a situation just before the COMET trial in which only 24% of units\u000a      offered low dose techniques in 1996\/7 (Burnstein R, Buckland R, Pickett\u000a      JA, A survey of epidural analgesia for labour in the United Kingdom.\u000a      Anaesthesia 1999; 54(7): 634-640) to one in which UK units rarely use the\u000a      traditional high dose technique for standard labour analgesia. This change\u000a      in approach can be directly linked to the COMET study through these\u000a      changes in policy and guidance. This work has also been incorporated into\u000a      local unit guidelines e.g. cited in Guidelines for the Practice of\u000a      Obstetric Anaesthesia in Nottingham University Hospitals [6]. The COMET\u000a      trial has also influenced clinical care through its incorporation in\u000a      textbooks on pain management: an example is the Oxford Handbook on pain\u000a      management [7], which references the COMET trial.\u000a    Economic Impact\u000a    The impact of a reduction in the instrumental delivery rate has had a\u000a      corresponding effect on reducing the costs of deliveries. This is because,\u000a      if a woman has an instrumental rather than a spontaneous delivery, the\u000a      costs rise due to an obstetrician being required for instrumental\u000a      deliveries, the costs of the instruments and the cost of an associated\u000a      increase in the length of the hospital stay. The cost-effectiveness study\u000a      that formed part of the COMET trial demonstrated reduced obstetrician\u000a      attendance and duration of stay. At the time the overall cost saving in\u000a      clinical time and hospital stay was offset by the greater cost of the use\u000a      of the newer drug, but these drugs are now less costly. In addition,\u000a      several studies have shown that forceps deliveries are associated with an\u000a      increase in faecal incontinence, haemorrhoids, constipation, perineal pain\u000a      and dyspareunia occurring after birth, such problems incurring greater\u000a      costs to both the NHS and women themselves. Little is known about these\u000a      symptoms in the longer term following instrumental births, except for\u000a      faecal incontinence which has been shown to persist for many years even in\u000a      women who have had only one forceps delivery thus continuing additional\u000a      costs (evidenced in other research by MacArthur [8]). The\u000a      prevalence of persistent faecal incontinence (including less severe\u000a      symptoms) at 12 years postpartum in the largest postpartum cohort study\u000a      was 4.6% in women who had only had spontaneous vaginal deliveries, whereas\u000a      it was 9.3% in women whose delivery history included a forceps birth [8].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Instrumental births can cause problems and are needed more often with\u000a      epidurals. The Comparative Obstetric Mobile Epidural Trial (COMET) was the\u000a      definitive trial that led to the NICE Intrapartum Care guideline\u000a      recommendation to discontinue traditional epidurals using high\u000a      concentration local anaesthetic solutions in favour of low dose epidural\u000a      techniques which allow women to be mobile during labour. It is estimated\u000a      that these changes have resulted in about 10,000 fewer instrumental\u000a      deliveries annually in the UK. Correspondingly, numbers of women\u000a      experiencing effects of instrumental births such as faecal incontinence\u000a      will have been substantially reduced. This research has also influenced\u000a      clinical guidelines and led to changes in practice on the type of\u000a      epidurals used during labour elsewhere, including Australia and Canada.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Health","Institution":"\u000a    University of Birmingham\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Birmingham (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of Birmingham","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"West Midlands","UKPRN":10006840}],"Panel":"A         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"2058645","Name":"State of Western Australia"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a1.

However, it is associated with increased rates of instrumental\u000a      vaginal delivery and other effects, which may be related to the dense\u000a      motor block produced by traditional high dose epidurals. Professor MacArthur\u000a      (Professor of Maternal and Child Epidemiology, University of Birmingham)\u000a      and colleagues considered that new low dose or \"mobile\" epidural\u000a      techniques that preserve motor function might reduce rates of obstetric\u000a      intervention.\u000a    Professor MacArthur with anaesthetists at Birmingham Women's NHS\u000a      Foundation Trust began studying the effects of epidurals in 1988 as part\u000a      of their Department of Health funded study of health problems following\u000a      childbirth. This observational study of almost 12,000 women linked women's\u000a      responses to a questionnaire to data from their obstetric case notes and\u000a      showed an association between increased reporting of backache and other\u000a      symptoms in those who had used epidurals for pain relief. Three papers\u000a      were published in BMJ between 1991 and 1993. Prompted by this work, a\u000a      group in Harvard also investigated effects of epidurals but failed to find\u000a      the same associations. Discussions between Professor MacArthur and\u000a      the Harvard team highlighted that they used a new low dose `mobile'\u000a      infusion (LDI) epidural in their centre because women liked mobility,\u000a      rather than the high dose epidurals formerly used. This led Professor MacArthur\u000a      to develop the COMET study. The Birmingham team applied to NHS R&amp;D for\u000a      funding and formed a collaboration with an obstetrician (Professor Andrew\u000a      Shennan) in London where a Combined Spinal Epidural (CSE) mobile technique\u000a      had been developed. Both groups were funded jointly by NHS R&amp;D to\u000a      undertake a randomised controlled trial to test the effects of mobile\u000a      techniques relative to traditional epidurals: the Comparative Obstetric\u000a      Mobile Epidural Trial (COMET, ISRCTN49349244) commenced 1997 and completed\u000a      2001 (http:\/\/www.controlled-trials.com\/ISRCTN49349244\/).\u000a    COMET was a three-arm, two-centre randomised controlled trial, which\u000a      compared the effects of two `mobile' low-dose epidural techniques (LDI and\u000a      CSE) with high-dose traditional epidural. Between February 1999 and April\u000a      2000, 1054 nulliparous women requesting epidural analgesia were randomly\u000a      assigned to traditional (n=353), LDI (n=350), or CSE (n=351) groups. The\u000a      primary short term outcome was mode of delivery (spontaneous vaginal\u000a      birth) and secondary outcomes included labour progress, efficacy of\u000a      procedure, effect on newborns and women's satisfaction and control. Data\u000a      were collected during labour and women were interviewed postnatally, then\u000a      completed a postal questionnaire12 months after birth, to assess long-term\u000a      symptoms.\u000a    The COMET trial demonstrated that both of the low-dose `mobile' epidural\u000a      techniques resulted in significantly fewer instrumental deliveries and\u000a      authors concluded that continued routine use of traditional epidurals\u000a      might not be justified [1]. There were no differences in pain relief\u000a      ratings and satisfaction with mobile techniques, whilst feelings of\u000a      control in labour were superior [1,2,3]. Follow-up at 12 months showed no\u000a      long-term disadvantages of using mobile techniques and significantly less\u000a      faecal and stress incontinence reported by the LDI group and less headache\u000a      by the CSE group, than the traditional epidural group [3,4]. The main\u000a      findings were published in the Lancet in 2001 [1] accompanied by a\u000a      commentary summarising the impact of the research in terms of avoidance of\u000a      large numbers of instrumental deliveries if mobile rather than traditional\u000a      techniques were to be used. Numerous subsequent papers have been published\u000a      in specialist journals [4,5,6,] and the main COMET study paper [1] has\u000a      been cited over 130 times.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"39367","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"3895114","Name":"Chile"},{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The direct clinical impact this trial had on Bell's Palsy management in\u000a      UK General Practice was\u000a      measured by analysing trends in prescribing behaviour (with significance\u000a      confirmed by interrupted\u000a      times series regression analysis) between 2001 and 2012 [1]. This analysis\u000a      used 14,460 Bell's\u000a      Palsy cases identified from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink\u000a      database (5.25 million active\u000a      UK electronic medical records), and clearly demonstrated that the trial\u000a      was associated with a\u000a      significant increase in treatment with prednisolone and reduction in\u000a      combination treatment with\u000a      antivirals, the maximum relative increases and decreases being 70% and 41%\u000a      respectively.

Although many cases resolve\u000a      spontaneously around 25% have\u000a      a poor outcome with persistent facial nerve malfunction and deformity. Its\u000a      aetiology is unknown but\u000a      the dominant hypothesis before our study was that viral reactivation\u000a      caused oedematous swelling\u000a      of the facial nerve within the temporal bone. This was assumed to cause\u000a      distal denervation of\u000a      motor (and sometimes sensory) fibres. Prior to publication of our Scottish\u000a      Bell's Palsy Study paper\u000a      in the New England Journal of Medicine [i] in 2007, two Cochrane\u000a      reviews, published in 2002 and\u000a      updated in 2004 [ii, iii], found an insufficiency of high quality evidence\u000a      and concluded that more\u000a      data were needed to determine whether early treatment with steroids and\/or\u000a      antivirals for Bell's\u000a      Palsy was effective in reducing poor outcomes. In the face of this\u000a      uncertainty increasing amounts\u000a      of expensive antiviral drugs were being prescribed.\u000a    We undertook pilot work in the emergent Primary Care Research Networks of\u000a      Tayside and the\u000a      West of Scotland to scope the feasibility of a study to examine the effect\u000a      of different treatments on\u000a      outcomes in Bell's Palsy.\u000a    The Scottish Bell's Palsy study was led by the University of Dundee; the\u000a      lead researcher was\u000a      Sullivan and other key researchers in Dundee were Smith\u000a      (local Principal Investigator in\u000a      Grampian), Donnan (Study Statistician), Clarkson (UoA3,\u000a      co-ordinated dental participation) and\u000a      Daly (Trial Manager)). It was a collaboration built around the\u000a      Scottish School of Primary Care, with\u000a      other University partners including Swan and Morrison (Glasgow), McKinstry\u000a      and Davenport\u000a      (Edinburgh) and Vale (Aberdeen).\u000a    The key features of the underpinning science developed through this work\u000a      were that:\u000a    a) There was genuine uncertainty about how to manage this acute,\u000a      distressing condition;\u000a    b) It was a national, acute, primary care trial involving GPs in half of\u000a      all practices in Scotland;\u000a    c) It had a primary outcome measure that was highly relevant to patients,\u000a      clinicians and\u000a      policymakers: complete recovery at three and nine months;\u000a    d) It recorded and reported adverse events;\u000a    e) It used an intention-to-treat analysis;\u000a    f) The results were presented in a variety of ways to aid understanding.\u000a      In addition to odds\u000a      ratios, we also provided Absolute Risk Reduction and Numbers Needed to\u000a      Treat and an\u000a      economic analysis;\u000a    g) The conclusion was clear: early treatment with prednisolone\u000a      significantly increased\u000a      chances of complete recovery at three and nine months. In contrast,\u000a      aciclovir had little or\u000a      no effect [iv];\u000a    h) Implementing the result is cost-effective and does not require the\u000a      health service to be\u000a      reorganised; a GP simply prescribes a single, relatively inexpensive drug\u000a      instead of a\u000a      relatively expensive drug or a combination [v].\u000a    We therefore rejected the hypothesis that the aetiology of Bell's Palsy\u000a      is reactivation of the Herpes\u000a      Simplex Virus affecting the facial nerve. The specific contribution of\u000a      this study is that prednisolone\u000a      (50mg\/day for 10 days) significantly improves outcomes (83.0% recovery to\u000a      a House Brackmann\u000a      Grade of I at 3 months for prednisolone compared with 63.6% for no\u000a      prednisolone) and antivirals\u000a      confer no additional advantage. The Numbers Needed to Treat for treatment\u000a      with oral\u000a      corticosteroids were six (95% Confidence Interval 4 to 9) at three months\u000a      and eight (95% CI 6 to\u000a      14) at nine months.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40165","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Prostate cancer screening is one of the most controversial healthcare\u000a      topics globally. Prostate cancer kills over 11,000 men per annum in the\u000a      UK. Many prostate cancers can be identified when potentially curable\u000a      following screening with a PSA blood test and prostate biopsy, but it is\u000a      not possible to identify which tumours will become aggressive or\u000a      life-threatening (the vast majority will not). Screening leads to large\u000a      numbers of men being diagnosed and suffering harms related to the\u000a      diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer in the context of small and\u000a      uncertain benefits &#8212; hence the current UK policy not to recommend\u000a      screening. Our research has provided the evidence-base for this policy and\u000a      has had the following specific impacts:\u000a    The establishment of UK policy and origin of the impact\u000a    UK policy was established in a letter from the DH to all UK health\u000a      authorities and clinicians in 1997, stating that: \"Population screening\u000a      for prostate cancer, including the use of prostate specific antigen (PSA)\u000a      as a screening test, should not be provided by the NHS or offered to the\u000a      public until there is new evidence of an effective screening technology\u000a      for prostate cancer\".[a] This was based directly on two cited systematic\u000a      literature reviews, one led from UoB.[1] The policy has remained unchanged\u000a      throughout the REF impact reporting period, based on this original policy\u000a      statement.\u000a    Implementing UK policy\u000a    A National Screening Committee (NSC) Scientific Reference Group\u000a      (including UoB Donovan and Lane as members) launched the Prostate Cancer\u000a      Risk Management Programme (PCRMP) in 2002. PCRMP issued on-line and paper\u000a      documents containing information about PSA testing, prostate cancer\u000a      diagnosis, and treatment, based on evidence from the UoB systematic\u000a      review[1] to enable patients to make informed decisions about\u000a      screening.[b] PCRMP documents were revised in 2009[c] with UoB Donovan\u000a      given first acknowledgement (p.2) for contributing evidence from the\u000a      review[1] and ProtecT feasibility study.[2] The PCRMP remains the primary\u000a      source of information for UK GPs and men.\u000a    Low levels of UK PSA-testing have been corroborated by independent\u000a      research in 2004 showing the rate of PSA-testing in primary care of 6% of\u000a      eligible men;[d] UoB research confirmed this rate (6.2%) in 2008.[8]\u000a    Evaluating the benefits and harms of screening\u000a    UK policy has led to much lower levels of incidence and treatment of\u000a      localised prostate cancer compared with countries where PSA testing has\u000a      been widespread since the 1980s: for example in the USA (as shown by our\u000a      research[7]), and Canada, Australasia, Northern and Western Europe.[e]\u000a      Evidence for a potential prostate cancer-specific mortality benefit from\u000a      screening comes from a relatively robust European RCT,[f] published\u000a      alongside a USA RCT showing no benefit from screening.[g] Our research has\u000a      provided evidence about the harms of screening. A cohort study of men\u000a      undergoing prostate biopsy in the ProtecT study showed that 1.3% required\u000a      hospital admission and 10.4% consultation with a doctor because of\u000a      post-biopsy symptoms including pain, fever, and blood in urine, faeces and\u000a      ejaculate.[4] Among the two-thirds of men who received a negative or\u000a      inconclusive biopsy result, around 20% reported high distress persisting\u000a      up to 12 weeks.[5] Concerns about the harms caused by prostate cancer\u000a      diagnosis and treatment in the context of uncertain benefit, and\u000a      increasing realisation that high levels of PSA-testing did not reflect\u000a      clinical need, led to a policy review in the USA in 2011. The review\u000a      focussed on the harms and uncertain benefits[h] and so in 2011, USA policy\u000a      changed explicitly not to recommend prostate cancer screening &#8212; 14 years\u000a      after the 1997 UK policy decision.\u000a    Formal review of UK policy in 2010\u000a    The UK NSC formally reviewed policy for prostate cancer screening in 2010\u000a      using evidence from an independent option appraisal analysis based on\u000a      ProtecT trial data (acknowledged, p.xi).[i] The appraisal analysis\u000a      estimated rates of diagnosis, potential benefits and harms of treatment,\u000a      as well as impact on survival and costs to the UK economy of introducing\u000a      prostate cancer screening at age 50 years, annually, or every two or four\u000a      years, using statistical modelling. The harms of treatment always\u000a      outweighed any possible benefit of screening in each potential\u000a      scenario.[i] The clinical costs alone, without administrative costs, were\u000a      estimated to be &#163;0.6 to &#163;1.7 billion per year.[i] The 2010 review\u000a      concluded that UK policy should remain as established in 1997, and\u000a      re-iterated that any change needed to await evidence from this research\u000a      team's ProtecT[3] and CAP[6] RCTs.[j]\u000a    Health Technology Assessment in the UK, review 2013\u000a    This review, written by an independent team, specifically identified the\u000a      ProtecT study as \"The outstanding example of 143 projects for screening\u000a      and diagnostics funded by the HTA programme,\" and noted ProtecT had\u000a      \"affected clinical practice ... by allowing the UK to reaffirm its policy\u000a      of no routine screening\" and through its qualitative research that\u000a      \"pioneered ways to involve patients\" in recruitment, and research on the\u000a      psychosocial effect of screening.[k, page 1280]\u000a    In summary, UoB-led research established UK policy in 1997, and UoB-led\u000a      and collaborative research has supported policy implementation since then,\u000a      including providing evidence for the formal confirmation of UK policy in\u000a      2010. UK policy, underpinned by this research, has ensured that knowledge\u000a      about prostate cancer screening has increased, very many men have avoided\u000a      known harms of testing, and the UK economy has saved billions of &#163;s every\u000a      year.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research at the University of Bristol (UoB) led to the Department of\u000a      Health (DH) decision in 1997 that screening for prostate cancer would not\u000a      be introduced in the UK until there was evidence that benefits outweighed\u000a      harms. UoB-led and collaborative research subsequently provided evidence\u000a      to support informed decision-making in the NHS. A formal review by the DH\u000a      in 2010 endorsed the policy and confirmed that any change would be based\u000a      on evidence from the team's randomised trials.

The primary outcome\u000a        (prostate cancer mortality) will be analysed in 2015 (with 10 years'\u000a        median follow up). A nested cohort study of 1,100 men undergoing\u000a        prostate biopsy investigated side-effects of prostate biopsy, including\u000a        symptoms, health-care use,[4] and psychological impact.[5].\u000a      The CAP (Cluster RCT of testing for Prostate Cancer) (joint PIs:\u000a        Martin and Donovan (UoB), Hamdy, Neal) randomised 573 general practices\u000a        to enable a comparison between PSA testing and treatment in ProtecT\u000a        (screening) and usual NHS care (control) in 415,000 UK men.[6] An\u000a        ecological study confirmed a much lower incidence of prostate cancer in\u000a        the UK compared with the USA,[7] and a cohort study confirmed low rates\u000a        of PSA testing in UK primary care[8] &#8212; reflecting much higher rates of\u000a        screening in the USA compared with the UK.\u000a    \u000a    The research programme began by exposing the lack of evidence for\u000a      prostate cancer screening,[1] and then carried out a study to investigate\u000a      the feasibility of mounting an RCT to provide robust evidence.[2] The\u000a      success of the feasibility study,[2] led to the launch of the ProtecT RCT\u000a      to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment[3] and the CAP RCT to evaluate\u000a      the population impact of screening.[6] Studies embedded in these RCTs have\u000a      produced policy-relevant evidence about the impacts on men of undergoing\u000a      prostate biopsy,[4,5] and levels of PSA testing and cancer diagnosis\u000a      compared with the USA,[7] and in UK primary care.[8]\u000a    Research team (positions held at UoB or dates of leaving; and\u000a      researchers outside UoB)\u000a    Principal investigators: at UoB &#8212; Donovan (Professor), Martin\u000a      (Professor); outside UoB &#8212; Hamdy (Professor, Oxford), Neal (Professor,\u000a      Cambridge).\u000a    Key researchers at UoB: Collin (Research Fellow &#8212; RF), Metcalfe (Reader),\u000a      Turner (Research Associate &#8212; RA), Lane (Senior RF), Peters (Professor),\u000a      Wade (RA); outside UoB: Williams (RA Sheffield), Rosario (CSL Sheffield),\u000a      Hughes (RA Cambridge).\u000a    Left UoB: Selley (RA, 1998), Faulkner (RF, 1999), Coast (Reader, 2005).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40166","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2186224","Name":"New Zealand"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Implementation in the UK of SIDS risk reduction programmes based on UoB\u000d\u000a      research findings was followed by a 67% fall in SIDS rates by 1992; the\u000d\u000a      number of SIDS deaths in England and Wales fell from 1597 in 1988 (2.3\u000d\u000a      deaths per 1000 live births) to 531 in 1992 (0.77 per 1000 live births).\u000d\u000a      As the Figure below shows, the number of deaths fell by a further 54% to\u000d\u000a      244 by 2011 (0.34 per 1000 live births), the last year for which national\u000d\u000a      data is available.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000aPublication dates (number of studies): &#8216;CESDI&#8217; study - 1995(1), 1996(2), 1999(3), 2000(3), 2001(1), 2002(2), 2003(2), 2004(2), 2006(3) and 2007(1). &#8216;SWISS&#8217; study - 2009(1) and 2010(1).\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a    This further fall was not due to any change in prone positioning in\u000d\u000a      England but concomitant with changes in other identified risk factors (see\u000d\u000a      Table in Section 2).\u000d\u000a    If death rates had remained the same as 1992 over 10,000 infants would\u000d\u000a      have died in England and Wales between 1993 and 2011 rather than the 6434\u000d\u000a      SIDS deaths that did occur. Over 2,100 would have died from 2008 to 2011\u000d\u000a      rather than the 1075 deaths that did occur. The persistent year on year\u000d\u000a      fall in SIDS rates over the last two decades has been instrumental in the\u000d\u000a      halving of the post-neonatal infant mortality rate in England and Wales\u000d\u000a      over the same time period (from 2.2 deaths to 1.2 deaths per 1000 live\u000d\u000a      births).\u000d\u000a    At every stage of this process the UoB researchers have been closely\u000d\u000a      involved: generating the findings; developing the risk-reduction messages;\u000d\u000a      changing statutory law in 2008 on how child deaths are investigated (see\u000d\u000a      below); and collaborating with national and international organisations to\u000d\u000a      ensure families are given accurate information to care for their infants\u000d\u000a      in ways that lead to the lowest possible risk of SIDS. In the last 5 years\u000d\u000a      they have been particularly involved in the translational work of getting\u000d\u000a      their evidence-based findings implemented into public health policy.\u000d\u000a    In UK [a] and Australian [b] parent information leaflets, every\u000d\u000a      recommendation to reduce the risk of SIDS is based partly or fully on the\u000d\u000a      results of the UoB studies. Collaborative work with other groups in\u000d\u000a      Germany, New Zealand, and Scandinavia has led to the development of\u000d\u000a      standardised protocols for data collection in the investigation of\u000d\u000a      unexpected infant deaths, which in turn have allowed more rapid\u000d\u000a      identification and evaluation of significant changes in parenting\u000d\u000a      practices and their effects.\u000d\u000a    UoB studies on infant thermal balance have produced charts of optimal\u000d\u000a      thermal conditions adopted by both manufacturers and parents in many\u000d\u000a      countries, and sequential studies show a clear reduction in covering\u000d\u000a      (infant clothes and bedding combined) from an average of 8 tog (unit of\u000d\u000a      thermal resistance) 20 years ago to just 2.4 tog more recently.[4 &#8212; page\u000d\u000a      8]\u000d\u000a    Fleming and Blair recognise that findings from their studies need to fit\u000d\u000a      with current evidence of infant care practices outside the field of SIDS\u000d\u000a      so that consistent public health messages can be given to parents and\u000d\u000a      health professionals. They have worked closely in the last five years with\u000d\u000a      UNICEF UK [c, d], who are currently promoting breastfeeding in Baby\u000d\u000a      Friendly Hospitals, to produce a leaflet `Caring for your baby at night'\u000d\u000a      which encourages breastfeeding, acknowledges some parents may want to\u000d\u000a      bed-share but outlines the circumstances in which bed-sharing may be\u000d\u000a      unsafe. An evidence-based guideline for health professionals [e, f]\u000d\u000a      accompanies the leaflet (lead author Blair). The leaflets and guidelines,\u000d\u000a      printed in January 2012, have proved popular &#8212; over 210,000 have so far\u000d\u000a      been distributed, mainly to NHS hospitals, trusts and health visiting\u000d\u000a      teams. Blair is a regular invited speaker at health care professional\u000d\u000a      conferences and seminars (see a selection of UK and International lectures\u000d\u000a      since 2008 [g, h, i]) to promote the UoB-based findings.\u000d\u000a    The UoB approach to the investigation of unexpected infant deaths and the\u000d\u000a      care of families was adopted by the Kennedy Committee which was set up by\u000d\u000a      the Royal College of Pathologists and Royal College of Paediatrics and\u000d\u000a      Child Health to improve the quality of such investigations after a series\u000d\u000a      of miscarriages of justice in 2003, and was subsequently incorporated into\u000d\u000a      the Children Act 2004, becoming a statutory requirement throughout England\u000d\u000a      from 2008. This process of child death reviews (in which Fleming was\u000d\u000a      centrally involved) has led to a major change in the way medico-legal\u000d\u000a      agencies involved in providing services to children interact, with a\u000d\u000a      resultant improvement in the quality of such investigations and services\u000d\u000a      to bereaved families.[j, k]\u000d\u000a    Fleming was elected as Vice Chair of the International Society for the\u000d\u000a      Study and prevention of Perinatal and Infant Deaths (ISPID) in 2008,\u000d\u000a      succeeded in that role in 2010 by Blair. The Society is instrumental in\u000d\u000a      the delivery of SIDS public health campaigns in different countries. Both\u000d\u000a      have been involved in developing risk reduction messages on the ISPID\u000d\u000a      website (http:\/\/www.ispid.org\/) which\u000d\u000a      receives around 300 visits a day. Blair currently helps co-ordinate the\u000d\u000a      website activities and chairs the epidemiology group working towards\u000d\u000a      consensus positional statements on safe infant care practices. Both\u000d\u000a      researchers have worked extensively on the development of internationally\u000d\u000a      agreed policies for parent education and support, and on advice about\u000d\u000a      parenting practices, which have been adopted in many countries.\u000d\u000a    In 2006 Fleming was included in the \"Eureka UK\" publication celebrating\u000d\u000a      the 100 most important research achievements of British Universities. In\u000d\u000a      2009 Blair was awarded an Honorary Fellowship by UNICEF for work in the\u000d\u000a      SIDS field and in 2012 both Fleming and Blair were awarded the UoB\u000d\u000a      Vice-Chancellor Impact award for their translational research in this\u000d\u000a      field.

Subsequently, two\u000d\u000a      case-control studies were conducted by Peter Fleming (Professor of Infant\u000d\u000a      Health and Developmental Physiology, UoB since 1982) and Peter Blair\u000d\u000a      (Senior Research Fellow, UoB since 1992).

These included\u000d\u000a      post-natal smoking, parental drug and alcohol use when bed-sharing,\u000d\u000a      co-sleeping on a sofa, putting the baby to sleep on their side and loose\u000d\u000a      covering found over the infant's head. The team also identified factors\u000d\u000a      not contributory to the risk of SIDS (e.g. immunisation and toxic gas\u000d\u000a      emanating from mattresses) and some that were beneficial (e.g. infants\u000d\u000a      sleeping in the same room as parents, dummy use and breastfeeding). Advice\u000d\u000a      against the prone sleeping position had already been widely adopted prior\u000d\u000a      to CESDI in 1993-6. In the ten years between CESDI and SWISS, prone\u000d\u000a      sleeping position rates did not change, but rates of infants being placed\u000d\u000a      on their side to sleep, infants exposed to tobacco smoke after the birth\u000d\u000a      and infants found with bedding over their heads decreased while rates of\u000d\u000a      infants being placed `feet to foot' (with their feet at the foot of the\u000d\u000a      cot to avoid wriggling under the covers) and infants being breastfed\u000d\u000a      increased suggesting that the subsequent 54% fall in SIDS rates was\u000d\u000a      related to the further contributory factors identified by the UoB team\u000d\u000a      (see table below).

Laboratory and community studies of thermal balance (solely\u000d\u000a      conducted in Bristol) have led to detailed recommendations in current\u000d\u000a      safety guidelines regarding how much bedding infants should have,\u000d\u000a      according to bedroom temperature.[4, 5] In the last five years the team\u000d\u000a      has identified potential risks to the baby if they share the same sleep\u000d\u000a      surface and have been working with UNICEF to provide a more evidence-based\u000d\u000a      approach that acknowledges the importance of breastfeeding while outlining\u000d\u000a      specific hazards when bed-sharing deaths occur.\u000d\u000a    UoB-led studies in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children\u000d\u000a      (ALSPAC) study showed no adverse effects from changes in sleeping position\u000d\u000a      advice and findings published in 2010 suggest an interdependent effect\u000d\u000a      with bed-sharing and breastfeeding.[6]\u000d\u000a    The UoB team also includes PJ Berry (Pathologist 1983-2001), P Sidebotham\u000d\u000a      (Sen Clinical Lecturer 1997-2005) and J Golding (Prof of Paediatric &amp;\u000d\u000a      Perinatal Epidemiology 1985-present).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40167","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    During the 1990s rationing of surgery for visually impairing cataract was\u000d\u000a      common with contract limits placed on secondary care providers. 2nd\u000d\u000a      eye surgery was particularly targeted for access restrictions and NHS\u000d\u000a      waiting times for surgery were typically a year or more. For older people,\u000d\u000a      for example, the implications of long waits and poor vision were\u000d\u000a      substantial, leading to potentially reduced confidence and higher\u000d\u000a      functional dependence. Following publication of our Randomised Controlled\u000d\u000a      Trial of 2nd eye cataract surgery in the Lancet in 1998[2], the\u000d\u000a      DH `Action on Cataracts' policy document released in 2000 recommended 2nd\u000d\u000a      eye surgery as uncontroversially good practice[a]. Our Lancet paper was\u000d\u000a      referred to as 1 of just 7 references in the policy document. The clear\u000d\u000a      benefits, both in terms of visual function and self reported symptoms\u000d\u000a      which our research demonstrated, informed a firm and strong policy\u000d\u000a      recommendation in favour of 2nd eye surgery across the NHS.\u000d\u000a      During the early and mid 1990s, prior to the publication of our research\u000d\u000a      report, 2nd eye surgery comprised around 25% of operations[b].\u000d\u000a      Data from the National Ophthalmology Database (NOD &#8212; 30 contributing NHS\u000d\u000a      trusts) for the years 2004-2010 show a steady increase each year of 2nd\u000d\u000a      eye surgery from 24.2% in 2004 to 34.9% in 2010 based on around 232,000\u000d\u000a      operations[c], with our own published analysis of over 55,000 operations\u000d\u000a      (12 trusts) in the mid to late 2000s indicating 41.5% of operations being\u000d\u000a      on 2nd eyes[d] reflecting widespread acceptance within the NHS\u000d\u000a      of the benefits gained from 2nd eye surgery for bilateral\u000d\u000a      cataract. Similarly the European Registry of Quality Outcomes for Cataract\u000d\u000a      and Refractive Surgery (EUREQUO) reported that based on 318,000 operations\u000d\u000a      from 2009 to August 2011, 40.6% of cataract surgery was for 2nd\u000d\u000a      eyes [e].\u000d\u000a    The findings of our RCT have since been corroborated through studies in\u000d\u000a      which the benefits of 1st and 2nd eye surgery have\u000d\u000a      been found to be either similar or, as in the Swedish National Cataract\u000d\u000a      Register data, greater from 2nd eye surgery for certain\u000d\u000a      subgroups compared with 1st eyes[f].\u000d\u000a    Our research report on the population requirements for both 1st\u000d\u000a      and 2nd eye cataract surgery[7] provided a robust estimate of\u000d\u000a      the cataract surgical backlog facing the NHS. Our estimate of around half\u000d\u000a      a million additional operations needed to clear the backlog was based on\u000d\u000a      sound applied epidemiological and ophthalmological methodology and\u000d\u000a      provided an empirically evidenced and considerably more accurate estimate\u000d\u000a      of unmet need for surgery than earlier inflated estimates. During the\u000d\u000a      decade following publication of our research an uplift of just over half a\u000d\u000a      million operations cleared the backlog (HES data), confirming the accuracy\u000d\u000a      of our estimate.\u000d\u000a    The 2000 DH `Action on Cataracts' document referred to our randomised\u000d\u000a      trial and recommended 2nd eye cataract surgery along with\u000d\u000a      process and commissioning changes to increase efficiency, delivery and\u000d\u000a      access for cataract surgery [a]. This document was reinforced by the\u000d\u000a      subsequent NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement publication,\u000d\u000a      `Focus on Cataracts' [g], and sequential updates of the Royal College of\u000d\u000a      Ophthalmologists Cataract Surgery Guidelines in 2010[h] which directly\u000d\u000a      cited our research. Internationally our RCT on 2nd eye cataract\u000d\u000a      surgery has been referred to in the previous and the current American\u000d\u000a      Academy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Pattern: Cataract in the Adult\u000d\u000a      Eye, 2011 [i] and in Guidelines based on data in the European Registry of\u000d\u000a      Quality Outcomes for Cataract[e], with the International Centre for Eye\u000d\u000a      Health [j] having recommend the Royal College 2010 Guidelines which\u000d\u000a      directly cite our research.\u000d\u000a    In the NHS, with achievable numbers [7] and the strong policy impetus\u000d\u000a      provided by the DH significant inroads were made into the unmet need for\u000d\u000a      cataract surgery. A 65% increase in the frequency of cataract surgery\u000d\u000a      resulted across England, from 201,682 operations in 1998-1999 to 332,625\u000d\u000a      in 2009-2010. During the 1990s long waiting times for cataract surgery\u000d\u000a      patients were routine, typically around a year. As a consequence of the\u000d\u000a      policy adjustments informed by our research, this increase in cataract\u000d\u000a      surgery reduced waiting times in England to below 18 weeks from referral\u000d\u000a      to surgery for well over 90% of NHS patients.\u000d\u000a    In addition to the direct benefits to vision [d] and QoL [f] provided by\u000d\u000a      cataract surgery, there are downstream benefits to health such as a\u000d\u000a      reduction in falls for people with improved vision. These benefits are\u000d\u000a      difficult to quantify but include prevention of falls and associated\u000d\u000a      mortality and morbidity among elderly people. Recent austerity-driven\u000d\u000a      reductions in numbers of cataract operations has attracted professional\u000d\u000a      and media interest. Giving evidence to a hearing of the public accounts\u000d\u000a      committee in January 2013 the Medical Director of the NHS, Sir Bruce Keogh\u000d\u000a      said: \"We do know that about 50 per cent of PCTs have restricted access to\u000d\u000a      cataract surgery, and we do know that the bulk of policies used by PCTs\u000d\u000a      actually haven't used the best evidence that's available in order to\u000d\u000a      ration that care.\"\u000d\u000a    The Royal National Institute for Blind people (RNIB) has cited our RCT[2]\u000d\u000a      in its collaborative report with the RCOphth `Don't turn back the clock:\u000d\u000a      Cataract surgery- the need for patient-centred care', June 2011[k]. The\u000d\u000a      RNIB is investigating the variation in cataract surgery across England and\u000d\u000a      has done a FOI request to each PCT with regards to their commissioning\u000d\u000a      policies on 2nd eye surgery.

In the 1990's\u000d\u000a      there were long waiting times for cataract surgery with rationing most\u000d\u000a      frequently restricting surgery on the 2nd eye. A randomised\u000d\u000a      controlled trial undertaken at the University of Bristol (UoB)\u000d\u000a      demonstrated clear QoL benefits from 2nd eye cataract surgery,\u000d\u000a      followed by a population study quantifying population requirements for 1st\u000d\u000a      and 2nd eye surgery and the surgical backlog. Government\u000d\u000a      policy, announced in `Action on Cataracts &#8212; Good Practice Guidance, 2000',\u000d\u000a      advised that the volume cataract surgery, including on the 2nd\u000d\u000a      eye, should be increased. This policy ensured timely access to surgery\u000d\u000a      becoming routine practice in the NHS, thus improving the lives of\u000d\u000a      thousands of people. Second-eye surgery rates rose from ~25% of operations\u000d\u000a      to 35-40%, with overall increases in operations for patients needing\u000d\u000a      surgery (e.g. in England up from 201,682 operations in 1998-1999 to\u000d\u000a      332,625 in 2009-2010) and reduced waiting times.

There were widespread limits to the\u000d\u000a      number of NHS procedures permitted, with more stringent restrictions\u000d\u000a      applied to 2nd eye surgery on the assumption that good vision\u000d\u000a      in one eye was sufficient for the needs of most people.

These\u000d\u000a      NHS delivery and clinical issues provided the rationale for the UoB\u000d\u000a      research, which aimed to address two key questions:\u000d\u000a    Q1. What are the benefits of a 2nd eye\u000d\u000a        cataract operation following a successful 1st eye\u000a        operation?\u000d\u000a    A Wellcome Trust funded[1] randomised controlled trial of 2nd\u000d\u000a      eye cataract surgery, published in 1998 in the Lancet[2] was undertaken\u000d\u000a      collaboratively between the University of Bristol and the Bristol Eye\u000d\u000a      Hospital from 1993 to 1998. People who had undergone a successful 1st\u000d\u000a      eye cataract operation and who were awaiting surgery for their 2nd\u000d\u000a      cataract were eligible for recruitment. The intervention group underwent\u000d\u000a      expedited surgery and were compared at 6 months following randomisation\u000d\u000a      with the control group (who were still awaiting 2nd eye\u000d\u000a      surgery). Outcomes included visual function and patient reported benefits\u000d\u000a      which were assessed with a valid cataract specific instrument, the Visual\u000d\u000a      Symptoms and Quality of life (VSQ) questionnaire[3] developed by the\u000d\u000a      research group for the trial. 208 patients were recruited into the study\u000d\u000a      which showed significant visual function and vision related QoL benefits\u000d\u000a      from 2nd eye surgery. Distance acuity, near acuity, contrast\u000d\u000a      sensitivity and particularly stereo-acuity and self reported vision\u000d\u000a      problems (such as reading and seeing faces) improved when assessed with\u000d\u000a      both eyes open[1].

To date 25 health bodies in England and the\u000a      Channel Islands have been issued with licences costing up to &#163;34K each. A\u000a      more substantial licence has also been issued covering the whole of Wales,\u000a      where ASSIST is being implemented at a rate of 40-50 schools per annum.\u000a      Company turnover in the year ending July 2013 was &#163;240K [i]. In its recent\u000a      tobacco control policy the Scottish government committed to pilot ASSIST\u000a      and discussions are ongoing with state and educational institutions in\u000a      France and Germany about implementing ASSIST.[i] To date over 350 UK\u000a      schools have been involved in the programme and over 150 staff from former\u000a      primary care trusts and local authorities have been trained to deliver the\u000a      programme.\u000a    Impact on teenagers\u000a    The use of ASSIST is growing every year. In the academic year 2012\/2013\u000a      over 25,000 Year 8 students (via more than 4,500 peer supporters)\u000a      were involved in DECIPHer-ASSIST. By summer 2013 more than 60,000 Year 8\u000a      students and over 11,000 peer supporters were involved in DECIPHer-ASSIST,\u000a      resulting in 1674 fewer teenagers taking up smoking.[i]\u000a    Recognition of the impact on health\u000a    In 2011 DECIPHer-IMPACT was the overall winner of the Bristol Health\u000a      Partners Health Innovation Award [j] which recognises outstanding health\u000a      innovation achievements.

Tobacco users who die\u000a      prematurely leave their families without income, increase the cost of\u000a      healthcare, and impede economic development. In the UK, smoking accounts\u000a      for nearly 20% of deaths and costs the NHS around &#163;2.7 billion every year.\u000a      Children who start smoking before the age of 16 are twice as likely to\u000a      continue as adults (compared to those who start later). They are also more\u000a      likely to have respiratory illnesses, use alcohol and drugs, and be absent\u000a      from school compared to those who do not smoke.\u000a    Preventing young people from starting to smoke is a key element of\u000a      tobacco-control strategies. ASSIST is based on an American model where\u000a      opinion leaders in the gay community train others to promote better sexual\u000a      health choices. ASSIST adapted this model and trained and supported\u000a      influential Year 8 school students (aged 12-13) to support their friends\u000a      and classmates [1]. These `peer supporters' have informal conversations\u000a      with other Year 8 students about the risks of smoking and the benefits of\u000a      being smoke-free.\u000a    ASSIST was a joint initiative of the Universities of Bristol and Cardiff.\u000a      In the major part of the research the intervention was further developed\u000a      and evaluated by a randomised controlled trial (RCT) funded by the Medical\u000a      Research Council [2]. Rona Campbell from the University of Bristol led\u000a      this research jointly with Laurence Moore of Cardiff University. The RCT\u000a      followed young people for two years and found ASSIST was effective in\u000a      reducing smoking uptake by 22% over this period [3]. The trial results\u000a      were published in The Lancet and estimated that if implemented\u000a      throughout the UK, the programme would prevent 40,000 young people taking\u000a      up smoking each year. The research also evaluated the delivery process to\u000a      help understand what made the programme successful. It found that ASSIST\u000a      was implemented with a high degree of fidelity and was acceptable to\u000a      schools and teachers, and to the young people who received it [4,5].\u000a      Further analysis also indicated that the ASSIST intervention was cost\u000a      effective [6].\u000a    More detailed follow-on research on the peer supporters found that those\u000a      who were asked to work informally, rather than under the supervision of\u000a      teaching staff, took the responsibility seriously and were effective at\u000a      passing on messages about not smoking to their peers [5]. This is a\u000a      research finding of considerable significance that can be applied to other\u000a      health areas.\u000a    The RCT fieldwork was carried out equally by Bristol and Cardiff\u000a      universities. The data analysis for the RCT was conducted in Bristol and\u000a      Bristol took the lead in publishing research from the RCT: eight of the\u000a      nine journal papers produced have a Bristol-based first author (Campbell,\u000a      Audrey, Starkey and Hollingworth) and in six of the nine papers Rona\u000a      Campbell is the senior (last-named) author.

Implementation of these approaches has\u000d\u000a      resulted in significant reductions in suicides.\u000d\u000a    Local research and its wider impact\u000d\u000a      UoB research led to the construction of effective barriers on the Clifton\u000d\u000a      Suspension Bridge, Bristol. Evaluation of the impact of these barriers on\u000d\u000a      suicide in Bristol indicates that they have prevented over 60 suicides by\u000d\u000a      jumping (1998-2012): deaths from the bridge declined from eight per year\u000d\u000a      (1994-98) to four per year (1998-2003) [6], with further reductions to\u000d\u000a      three per year in (2008-11). An estimated 30 fewer suicides occurred in\u000d\u000a      2008-13 as a result of the barriers [a]. This research has been used to\u000d\u000a      inform the planned introduction of prevention barriers at the Golden Gate\u000d\u000a      Bridge, USA (a process that has included consultation with Gunnell in 2006\u000d\u000a      during the planning of the barriers), and at other sites [b,c]. The\u000d\u000a      Department of Health (England) used the research findings in their Impact\u000d\u000a      assessment of the National Suicide Prevention Strategy [d]. The Bristol\u000d\u000a      research on preventing suicides by jumping has also been used to inform\u000d\u000a      position statements from important NGOs on this issue, e.g. the National\u000d\u000a      Suicide Prevention Lifeline (USA) statement on preventing suicide from\u000d\u000a      bridges.\u000d\u000a    Paracetamol and Co-proxamol in the UK\u000d\u000a      The pain killers paracetamol and co-proxamol accounted for almost half of\u000d\u000a      all the UK's overdose suicide deaths in the 1990s. UoB work on method\u000d\u000a      restriction [1] and the relationship between paracetamol availability,\u000d\u000a      pack size and mortality following paracetamol overdose [4] has contributed\u000d\u000a      to policies to restrict paracetamol pack size. Subsequent evaluative\u000d\u000a      research (with Oxford (lead) and Manchester) showed that restrictions in\u000d\u000a      the UK led to reductions in paracetamol deaths and liver transplantation\u000d\u000a      (estimated 765 fewer deaths in 1999-2009; this equated to 400 fewer in\u000d\u000a      2008-13[e]). Similarly, UoB's collaborative work with Oxford (lead) and\u000d\u000a      Manchester on the impact of co-proxamol withdrawal [7] demonstrated that\u000d\u000a      there have been 600 fewer co-proxamol suicides since its withdrawal\u000d\u000a      (2005-10).\u000d\u000a    Impact on countries' national policies\u000d\u000a      UoB research has materially influenced recommendations in national policy\u000d\u000a      documents. For example: The 2012 National Suicide Prevention Strategy for\u000d\u000a      England Preventing Suicide in England: a cross-government outcomes\u000d\u000a        strategy to save lives includes citations concerning prevention of\u000d\u000a      suicide by hanging and bridge jumping [f]; Ireland's 2000 Strategy Reach\u000d\u000a        Out (hanging), the 2012 USA National Strategy for Suicide\u000d\u000a        Prevention (pesticide poisoning) [g]; and the Canadian Institute of\u000d\u000a      Health Economics report Means Restriction for Suicide Prevention\u000d\u000a      (pesticides, paracetamol and coproxamol).\u000d\u000a    Global impact\u000d\u000a      UoB-led research on pesticide poisoning has been used widely by the WHO to\u000d\u000a      inform priorities for prevention in both global and regional (Western\u000d\u000a      Pacific) suicide prevention documents [h,i]. The research, including that\u000d\u000a      carried out in collaboration with colleagues in the South Asian Clinical\u000d\u000a      Toxicology Research Collaboration (SACTRC), encouraged the WHO to respond\u000d\u000a      to the global problem of pesticide suicides. Gunnell was a member of the\u000d\u000a      WHO advisory group and wrote an editorial to disseminate the work jointly\u000d\u000a      with the WHO leads for the strategy. Since the publication of these\u000d\u000a      documents, the Registrar of Pesticides in Sri Lanka has banned paraquat,\u000d\u000a      one of the most toxic pesticides ingested by humans; and China, where\u000d\u000a      pesticides account for two thirds of all suicides in rural areas, has\u000d\u000a      banned over 20 highly toxic pesticides (see: http:\/\/www.reach24h.com\/en\/news-a-events\/item\/439-production-ban-on-22-highly-toxic-pesticides.html).\u000a      Bans have also been introduced in Korea, Europe and India. Bristol researchers'\u000d\u000a      evaluation of bans on the most toxic pesticides in Sri Lanka indicated\u000d\u000a      that they resulted in 19,769 fewer suicides in 1996-2005 as compared with\u000d\u000a      1986-95 [2]. Based on these estimates, recent bans will have resulted in\u000d\u000a      many thousands of fewer suicides globally, as there are an estimated\u000d\u000a      370,000 pesticide suicides worldwide every year [3]. UoB researchers\u000d\u000a      worked with the company Syngenta to evaluate the impact of an improved\u000d\u000a      formulation of paraquat on case-fatality. It was shown that such new\u000d\u000a      formulations failed to substantially reduce case-fatality and imports of\u000d\u000a      paraquat were subsequently restricted in Sri Lanka [8].\u000d\u000a    Working with the mass media\u000d\u000a      UoB's work on suicide has informed the revised media guidelines produced\u000d\u000a      by the Samaritans (2013) and was used in briefings given to major national\u000d\u000a      news and media organisations (including ITV and the BBC). Gunnell met with\u000d\u000a      national newspaper editors in Parliament (organised by Madeleine Moon MP,\u000d\u000a      30 Jun 2009), the Press Complaints Commission (London, 20 Jan 2011), the\u000d\u000a      Evening Post (Bristol, 21 Dec 2011) and BBC, S4C and ITV and other news\u000d\u000a      agencies in Wales (Cardiff, 4 Dec 2012) to discuss their reporting of\u000d\u000a      suicide methods and to urge caution in describing suicide methods,\u000d\u000a      particularly those that are novel, highly lethal and readily accessible\u000d\u000a      such as those that have led to rises in suicide in some countries in East\u000d\u000a      Asia. The Samaritans used our research on the impact of their proactive\u000d\u000a      approach to advise the press on how to report (and when not to report)\u000d\u000a      novel methods of suicide in their submission to the Leveson Inquiry [j]\u000d\u000a    Additional benefits to society, the economy, and the police and health\u000d\u000a        services\u000d\u000a      It is estimated that for every suicide, six people are seriously affected,\u000d\u000a      so the overall fall in suicide rates reduces the emotional toll on friends\u000d\u000a      and family, who may require bereavement and counseling services and time\u000d\u000a      off work due to the bereavement (which also carries a cost to the\u000d\u000a      economy).

In 1994 University of Bristol (UoB) researchers carried\u000d\u000a      out the first systematic review of suicide prevention strategies [1]; they\u000d\u000a      identified that restricting access to commonly used, highly lethal methods\u000d\u000a      of suicide is one of the few effective approaches to suicide prevention\u000d\u000a      strategies. This is because the risk of death varies enormously depending\u000d\u000a      on the method used in a suicide attempt. Following an overdose of\u000d\u000a      paracetamol and most antidepressants it is under 1%; after taking as\u000d\u000a      little as a tablespoonful of the toxic weed-killer paraquat it is over\u000d\u000a      70%. The risk rises to over 95% in people who jump from high structures\u000d\u000a      such as the Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol. Most people who survive\u000d\u000a      a suicide attempt, even one using a high-lethality method, do not make a\u000d\u000a      repeat attempt.\u000d\u000a    The researchers' seminal review led to a series of studies, many led by\u000d\u000a      the UoB, to clarify the factors that influence people's choice of suicide\u000d\u000a      method [2], the key methods of suicide used in the UK and internationally\u000d\u000a      [3,9], which methods were likely to respond to being restricted [4,5,9],\u000d\u000a      and evidence of the effectiveness of such approaches [5,6,7].\u000d\u000a    Research underpinning this impact included: (i) qualitative interviews\u000d\u000a      (led by Biddle, Donovan and Gunnell, in collaboration with University of\u000d\u000a      Taipei) with people who have survived high lethality suicide attempts in\u000d\u000a      order to better understand their choice of suicide method [2,11]; (ii)\u000d\u000a      evaluations (using natural experimental designs) of specific approaches\u000d\u000a      aimed at reducing suicide by restricting access to methods such as\u000d\u000a      pesticides and analgesics (UoB, Oxford and Edinburgh leads) [5-7,9,12];\u000d\u000a      (iii) systematic reviews [1,3,9] and (iv) collaboration with industry\u000d\u000a      (Syngenta, the manufacturer of paraquat and other pesticides) to evaluate\u000d\u000a      how a new formulation of paraquat affected death rates following\u000d\u000a      self-poisoning with paraquat (Gunnell, epidemiology lead) [8].\u000d\u000a    This research has been complemented by systematic reviews of the evidence\u000d\u000a      concerning use of specific methods of suicide (pesticides, hanging,\u000d\u000a      firearms, paracetamol and the painkiller co-proxamol) &#8212; how common they\u000d\u000a      are, how preventable they are and death rates [3,9].\u000d\u000a    Key findings of the research:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Pesticide self-poisoning accounts for approximately one third of\u000d\u000a        global suicides [3].\u000d\u000a      Bans on toxic pesticides can have a profound impact on method-specific\u000d\u000a        and overall suicide rates.

The bar chart on page 2 (based on unpublished ART-CC data) shows that\u000d\u000a      patients started treatment earlier in the UK, Europe and North America\u000d\u000a      after guidelines were changed in 2009-10. The Health Protection Agency\u000d\u000a      (HPA) 2012 report stated that between 2010 and 2011 AIDS diagnoses in the\u000d\u000a      UK decreased by 33% and mortality by 18% [e].\u000d\u000a    Low income countries: UNAIDS reported that the number of people in\u000d\u000a      Africa receiving ART increased from less than a million in 2005 to 7.1\u000d\u000a      million in 2012, with nearly 1 million added in 2012 alone. During 2009-11\u000d\u000a      the recommended threshold for treatment in at least 29 low and middle\u000d\u000a      income countries changed (based in part on ART-CC's work) from 200 to 350\u000d\u000a      cells\/mm3 [d]. This has led to more and earlier treatment,\u000d\u000a      particularly in Africa. Data from Western Cape, South Africa, show the\u000d\u000a      steep increase in numbers of people treated and their increased CD4 count\u000d\u000a      at start of ART as a consequence of the adoption of the new guidelines\u000d\u000a      (graph &#8212; personal communication, Cape Town University, South Africa).\u000d\u000a      During this period, AIDS-related deaths in Africa fell by 32% from\u000d\u000a      approximately 1.75 to 1.19 million (calculated from UNAIDS 2012 global\u000d\u000a      report). The massive scale-up in treatment due to increasing the threshold\u000d\u000a      from 200 to 350 cells\/mm3 has been replicated across the globe.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000a    4.3 Raised public awareness of consequences of starting treatment late\u000d\u000a    May worked with the UK Collaborative HIV Cohort (UK CHIC) Study to raise\u000d\u000a      awareness of the loss in life expectancy due to starting HIV treatment\u000d\u000a      later than guidelines recommend [6]. This work was extensively reported in\u000d\u000a      the UK and worldwide, for example in a two-page feature in The\u000d\u000a        Independent in October 2011 [f] and in The China Daily [f]\u000d\u000a      and was also discussed by professional publications such as Nursing\u000d\u000a        Times, on 8 November 2011 [f]. The same research was presented in a\u000d\u000a      poster [f] displayed in hospital waiting rooms across the UK, to\u000d\u000a      communicate the findings to patients as part of a wider effort by UKCHIC\u000d\u000a      to disseminate information to key patient communities. According to the\u000d\u000a      2012 HPA UK HIV report, the proportion of HIV positive people diagnosed\u000d\u000a      late (with CD4 count below 350 cells\/mm3) fell by 3% during\u000d\u000a      2011 [e].\u000d\u000a    The ART-CC paper on life expectancy [4] influenced a campaign to halve\u000d\u000a      the proportion of people diagnosed late with HIV [g]. The UK CHIC life\u000d\u000a      expectancy paper [5] contributed evidence to \"Standard 1: HIV Testing and\u000d\u000a      Diagnosis\" in the policy document from BHIVA on \"Standards of Care for\u000d\u000a      People Living with HIV\" [h]. Earlier diagnosis and prompt treatment\u000d\u000a      reduces onward transmission since successfully treated people with\u000d\u000a      suppressed virus replication do not transmit HIV [h]. This not only avoids\u000d\u000a      illnesses and early deaths, but also has the potential to deliver huge\u000d\u000a      financial savings. The HPA 2011 report estimated that the prevention of\u000d\u000a      one new HIV infection saves the public purse between &#163;280,000 and &#163;360,000\u000d\u000a      in direct lifetime healthcare costs [e]. This research therefore impacts\u000d\u000a      not only the 22,600 people the HPA estimated were living with undiagnosed\u000d\u000a      HIV in the UK in 2011 (2012 report) [e] but also uninfected individuals,\u000d\u000a      who are less likely to be exposed to HIV if those infected with HIV are\u000d\u000a      diagnosed and treated [e].\u000d\u000a    4.4 Improved access to insurance.\u000d\u000a    The opportunity to obtain life insurance has a major impact on quality of\u000d\u000a      life, particularly since a term of 20 years is required for a mortgage.\u000d\u000a      ART-CC research [1,6] had a commercial impact by providing data to\u000d\u000a      insurance companies that led them to improve the provision of life\u000d\u000a      insurance and open up the insurance market to HIV positive people. Swiss\u000d\u000a      Re [i], Hannover Re (UK) and AERAS (France) [i] based their assessment of\u000d\u000a      insurability of HIV positive people on ART-CC's publications [1,6] and\u000d\u000a      web-based mortality risk calculator. Based on our 2002 data [1], SwissRe\u000d\u000a      recommended that certain patient groups should be offered up to 10 years'\u000d\u000a      insurance. During 2010-12, ART-CC worked with SwissRe to extend this to 20\u000d\u000a      years and estimate the excess premium that HIV positive individuals would\u000d\u000a      need to pay [6]. This had an impact prior to publication: ART-CC tables\u000d\u000a      were presented at a national meeting of insurers in Paris [i], and New\u000d\u000a      York [i] by Swiss Re, and to the French AIDS research agency (Agence\u000d\u000a      Nationale de Recherche sur la Sida et les hepatites virales, ANRS) by\u000d\u000a      May[i]. Based on this research, Swiss Re updated its underwriting\u000d\u000a      guidelines for western Europe resulting in cheaper insurance costs and\u000d\u000a      broader coverage with policies offered up to 25 years [j]. The Head of\u000d\u000a      Research Innovation and Product Development, Swiss Re, stated that there\u000d\u000a      would be \"greater access to home ownership and to business loans for HIV\u000d\u000a      positive persons\" and the research \"has led to increased normalisation of\u000d\u000a      HIV compared to other chronic diseases... The study has also influenced\u000d\u000a      Swiss Re's ratings for HIV+ lives in South Africa and the ratings of\u000d\u000a      direct insurers\" and \"has influenced debate on HIV ratings in India and\u000d\u000a      Australia\" [j].\u000d\u000a    ART-CC research on insurability [6] has impacted awareness of insurance\u000d\u000a      products among HIV positive people through the work of advocacy groups\u000d\u000a      such as HIV i-base [i] and the European AIDS Treatment Group, which in\u000d\u000a      discussing our paper [6] wrote \"People doing well on HIV therapy should be\u000d\u000a      eligible for life insurance\" [i]. The proportion of UK insurers that\u000d\u000a      provide services to HIV positive people increased from 33% to 66% between\u000d\u000a      2010 and 2012 [i]. A 2012 UK survey found that the percentage of HIV\u000d\u000a      positive people who knew of the existence of life insurance products\u000d\u000a      increased from only 20% in 2012 to 78% in 2013 [i].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    In 2011, 34 million people worldwide were living with, and 1.7 million\u000d\u000a      died from, HIV\/AIDS.

Funded by four\u000d\u000a      successive grants from the Medical Research Council, it includes nineteen\u000d\u000a      cohorts from Europe and North America and is coordinated by a team based\u000d\u000a      in the SSCM, UoB, led by Professor Jonathan Sterne and Dr Margaret May.\u000d\u000a    2.2 Informing treatment strategies\u000d\u000a    Analyses published in The Lancet in 2002, based on over 12000\u000d\u000a      patients, identified that the most important predictor of mortality was\u000d\u000a      the CD4 count, a measure of immune deficiency, at which patients started\u000d\u000a      ART [1]. Estimates of cumulative mortality for 80 risk groups were made\u000d\u000a      available via a web-based calculator (www.art-cohort-collaboration.org).\u000a      Scale-up of treatment in low-income countries started in 2002, and in 2006\u000d\u000a      ART-CC published the first comparison of mortality of patients starting\u000d\u000a      ART between low and high-income countries [2]. When patients and\u000d\u000a      physicians consider starting ART, they must balance its beneficial effects\u000d\u000a      in preventing AIDS and death with harmful side-effects and the\u000d\u000a      inconvenience of taking lifelong medication. Before 2009 the CD4 count at\u000d\u000a      which ART should be started was a central, unresolved issue in the care of\u000d\u000a      HIV positive people. ART-CC provided evidence that 350 cells\/mm3\u000d\u000a      should be the minimum CD4 count below which ART should be started [3].\u000d\u000a    2.3 Life expectancy and the consequences of late treatment\u000d\u000a    ART-CC found that improvements in treatment for HIV decreased mortality\u000d\u000a      by nearly 40% and increased life expectancy by 13 years in high-income\u000d\u000a      countries between 1996-2005 [4], but that starting treatment too late\u000d\u000a      resulted in poorer survival [1,4]. May worked with the UK Collaborative\u000d\u000a      HIV Cohort (UK CHIC) Study to raise awareness amongst the general public\u000d\u000a      that starting treatment later than guidelines recommended resulted in up\u000d\u000a      to 15 years' loss of life [5]. For patients treated in the UK between 1996\u000d\u000a      and 2008, life expectancy was 13 years less than that of the UK general\u000d\u000a      population, and lower the later in the course of HIV disease that patients\u000d\u000a      started treatment. Life expectancy at age 20 was 38 years in those who\u000d\u000a      started ART with CD4 count &lt;100, but &gt;53 years in those who started\u000d\u000a      with CD4 between 200 and 350 cells\/mm3.\u000d\u000a    2.4 Insurability of people living with HIV\u000d\u000a    In 2009, access to life insurance was very limited for people living with\u000d\u000a      HIV. Swiss Re (a reinsurance company based in Zurich, Switzerland)\u000d\u000a      collaborated with ART-CC to analyse data in the manner most useful for\u000d\u000a      promoting insurance by estimating excess mortality in HIV positive people\u000d\u000a      compared with expected mortality in the insured populations in 6 European\u000d\u000a      countries based on actuarial tables. This research showed that up to 50%\u000d\u000a      of HIV patients in lower risk groups could be eligible for life insurance\u000d\u000a      with terms up to 25 years [6].\u000d\u000a    ART-CC Co-ordinating Centre, University of Bristol team members\u000d\u000a    Prof Matthias Egger (2000-4 (Visiting Prof from 2004)); Prof Jonathan\u000d\u000a      Sterne (2000-present); Dr Margaret May (2000-present); Ross Harris\u000d\u000a      (2004-8); Dr Suzanne Ingle (2010-present).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40171","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The UoB MPES group contributed to the 2008 and 2013 Revisions of the NICE\u000d\u000a      Methods Guide, which define the role for MTC methods in submissions to\u000d\u000a      NICE [a,b].

NICE Technology Appraisals determine whether new\u000d\u000a      technologies are cost-effective for the UK National Health Service (NHS),\u000d\u000a      and if they are then they must be adopted by law (i.e. provided to\u000d\u000a      patients by the NHS) within three months of the guidance being issued.\u000d\u000a      NICE Technology Appraisals therefore impact directly on healthcare policy\u000d\u000a      governing which new treatment options are available to health\u000d\u000a      professionals to treat patients. Because NICE guidance is primarily based\u000d\u000a      on cost-effectiveness, it secures more health-related quality of life per\u000d\u000a      pound spent by the NHS.\u000d\u000a    For example, TA199 [f] cites MTC methods (p.213), the research of the\u000d\u000a      MPES group (references 204, 205, 230), and uses WinBUGS code derived from\u000d\u000a      the MPES groups code (p.224). Based on MTC methods TA199 recommends that\u000d\u000a      Etanercept, infliximab or adalimumab may be used for the treatment of\u000d\u000a      active and progressive psoriatic arthritis, but that the least expensive\u000d\u000a      should be used based on locally available prices. This was based on the\u000d\u000a      view that these products were equally effective, a conclusion that could\u000d\u000a      not be reached without MTC methods.\u000d\u000a    Impact of MTC methods via NICE Clinical Guidelines\u000d\u000a    The UoB MPES group has provided consultancy work to assist the\u000d\u000a      incorporation of MTC methods into several NICE Clinical Guidelines (CG) in\u000d\u000a      a range of clinical areas[d]. For example, research by the MPES group is\u000d\u000a      cited in CG153 Psoriasis (Oct 2012). The research methods that were\u000d\u000a      developed during this consultancy work, and which were used in these\u000d\u000a      guidelines, have since been published [d]. Although NICE Clinical\u000d\u000a      Guidelines are not mandatory, there is evidence that uptake is generally\u000d\u000a      good for those guidelines evaluated in the ERNIE Uptake Database,\u000d\u000a      available on the NICE web-pages. NICE Clinical Guidelines are based on\u000d\u000a      cost-effectiveness, and so uptake of the guidelines implies impact in\u000d\u000a      terms of maximising the health-related quality of life obtained from NHS\u000d\u000a      resources.\u000d\u000a    Impact of MTC methods in Canada\u000d\u000a    The Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) has used\u000d\u000a      MTC methods in its reports and recommendations on second and third line\u000d\u000a      therapies for Type 2 Diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin, and\u000d\u000a      for their Therapeutic Review on Biologics in Rheumatoid Arthritis [g]. The\u000d\u000a      various biologic drugs have not been compared directly in head-to-head in\u000d\u000a      trials, and so MTC methods are essential to compare their effectiveness\u000d\u000a      and cost-effectiveness.

All research outputs were\u000d\u000a      published in peer reviewed journals.\u000d\u000a    MPES methods statistically combine evidence from multiple sources. The\u000d\u000a      research underpinning the impact was the development (2002-present) of\u000d\u000a      Mixed Treatment Comparison (MTC) methods (also known as Network\u000d\u000a      Meta-Analysis). Standard meta-analysis combines estimates of the relative\u000d\u000a      effects of two treatments (e.g. drug A versus drug B, or drug C versus\u000d\u000a      placebo) from all available randomized trials. However there are often\u000d\u000a      many competing health technologies for a given condition\/patient group\u000d\u000a      (e.g. drugs A, B, C, D and placebo). MTC methods allow information from all\u000d\u000a      the trials of all the treatments of interest to be compared\u000d\u000a      simultaneously (A versus B versus C versus D, etc). The simplest example\u000d\u000a      of an MTC is an \"indirect comparison\", where in the absence of trials\u000d\u000a      comparing A versus B, the effect of A versus B is inferred from trials\u000d\u000a      comparing A versus C and trials comparing B versus C.\u000d\u000a    Because MTC methods allow more evidence to be combined, relative\u000d\u000a      treatment effects can be estimated more precisely than with standard\u000d\u000a      meta-analysis methods. Treatments can also be ranked according to both\u000d\u000a      efficacy and cost-effectiveness, allowing policymakers and guideline\u000d\u000a      development groups, whether in insurance- or state-funded health systems,\u000d\u000a      to make better-informed decisions, supporting equitable and optimum\u000d\u000a      resource allocation by health service purchasers.\u000d\u000a    The UoB MPES group firstly set out the theoretical framework for MTC\u000d\u000a      methods, showing them to be natural extensions of standard meta-analysis,\u000d\u000a      and developing robust software for estimating them, published in peer\u000d\u000a      review journals 2004-2008[1,2,3,4]. The scope of the methods was further\u000d\u000a      extended and generalised, so that it could be applied to trials reporting\u000d\u000a      a variety of different types of outcomes (probabilities; rates;\u000d\u000a      continuous; ordinal; competing risks)[5]. The group has also developed\u000d\u000a      theory on the robustness and reliability of MTC, and developed methods to\u000d\u000a      check consistency of the different evidence sources[5,6].\u000d\u000a    These methodology developments were led and conducted by the MPES group,\u000d\u000a      which also developed general computer code (written for the freely\u000d\u000a      available WinBUGS software) to conduct MTC and made this code freely\u000d\u000a      available through its website. These methods are now widely accepted, and\u000d\u000a      were adopted in the 2008 and 2013 updates of the NICE Guide to the Methods\u000d\u000a      of Technology Appraisal. NICE, through its Decision Support Unit,\u000d\u000a      commissioned the MPES group to write a series of Technical Support\u000d\u000a      Documents, including general code for a range of different types of\u000d\u000a      outcomes and evidence structures [5] to guide those making submissions to\u000d\u000a      NICE. These were first published on the NICE Decision Support Unit website\u000d\u000a      in 2011 following peer-review, and have subsequently all been published in\u000d\u000a      the journal Medical Decision Making (July 2013, Vol 33 No.5), following\u000d\u000a      further peer review.

The trial findings and cost effectiveness\u000a      analysis [5], supported through a case study [a] and web-based publicity\u000a      [b] were presented to meetings of local health care commissioners in\u000a      conjunction with local third sector organisations\u000a    Programme Implementation\u000a    Maximising impact was an integral part of the IRIS research programme.\u000a      Following the success of this trial, `IRIS &#8212; strengthening impact'\u000a      (IRISimp), an implementation vehicle to mainstream the IRIS model into\u000a      practices across the country, was created. This two-year programme of work\u000a      was undertaken in conjunction with and, funded by, the Health Foundation.\u000a      Beginning in June 2010, it facilitates the commissioning of the IRIS model\u000a      by primary care trusts and provides advocate educator training. UoB\u000a      researchers then secured a Department of Health Innovation, Excellence and\u000a      Strategic Development Grant to fund further implementation of IRIS in\u000a      England. A key part of the implementation programme was the translation of\u000a      the findings of the trial into a commissioning document designed to enable\u000a      and support the commissioning of the programme by CCGs and local\u000a      authorities in England [c].\u000a    Up to July 2013, 12 localities have commissioned the programme, and 122\u000a      practices in 7 localities have received training and started to use the\u000a      IRIS referral pathway. [d]\u000a    Benefits to women\u000a    Currently 683 women are being referred annually to IRIS domestic violence\u000a      advocates in the areas that have implemented the programme. [c] This is\u000a      estimated to be at least six times the number of referrals occurring in\u000a      the absence of IRIS. We know from our previous systematic reviews of\u000a      advocacy interventions [1] [3] that this will result in a reduction of\u000a      recurrence of domestic violence, improved quality of life and probably\u000a      improved mental health of these women. The other benefit for patients is a\u000a      safer and more appropriate response of clinicians to disclosure of\u000a      domestic violence, a core feature of the IRIS intervention. We have\u000a      evidence for this impact from interviews with patients who disclosed abuse\u000a      to their GPs and were referred to an IRIS advocate educator.\u000a    For example, here is the account of a woman who spoke to her GP about\u000a      abuse after seeing an IRIS poster in the waiting room: \"I had been\u000a      experiencing verbal, emotional and financial abuse from my husband for\u000a      over 26 years. I felt sad, low and unable to cope. The doctor referred me\u000a      to someone who could help... I don't need to go to the doctor's as much\u000a      now and have cut down on the tablets I take for depression and\u000a      sleeplessness. I have slowly got my freedom back and am so happy to be\u000a      making my own decisions and planning my own way in life. This is not just\u000a      for me, it's for my children and women like me out there. I feel\u000a      empowered. I feel proud of me.\" The patient narratives, as referenced in\u000a      the corroborative sources, provide further evidence. [e]\u000a    Benefits to NHS staff\u000a    Intermediate beneficiaries from the widespread implementation of IRIS\u000a      have been the doctors, nurses and other members of the practice teams in\u000a      the 122 IRIS practices nationally (Bristol, Hackney, Lambeth, Manchester,\u000a      Nottingham, Portsmouth, Southampton). IRIS has been commissioned in an\u000a      additional four areas (South Gloucestershire, Berkshire West, Enfield and\u000a      Nottingham) and practice training will be delivered in Autumn 2013. From\u000a      our nested qualitative study [6] we know that the participating clinicians\u000a      think that the training and support from IRIS allows them to engage with\u000a      the difficult challenge of domestic violence. The clinician narratives, as\u000a      referenced in the corroborative sources, provide further evidence. [e]\u000a    Impact on national policy\u000a    The trial findings were made available pre-publication to the Department\u000a      of Health taskforce on the health aspects of violence against women and\u000a      children [f] and they were a key source of evidence on training of health\u000a      care professionals. The IRIS model was cited as an exemplar alongside the\u000a      recommendation about training of staff (recommendation 3, p. 31) and was\u000a      highlighted as a case example in the commissioning guidance, [g] (p.58)\u000a      based on the report. Draft NICE guidelines have a specific training and\u000a      support recommendation for primary care based explicitly on IRIS (p.21).\u000a      [h] The 2012 Welsh Assembly Government White Paper [i] specifies IRIS as\u000a      an effective primary care training model (pp.48-49) and this will be the\u000a      basis of implementation of IRIS in Wales. Twelve IRIS advocate educators\u000a      have been trained in Scotland. They are delivering the IRIS practice\u000a      training and referral pathway in three Health Boards.[j] IRIS\u000a      implementation has been part of the recommendations of Home Office\u000a      Domestic Homicide Reviews [k].\u000a    Impact on international policy\u000a    The landmark 2013 WHO publication `Responding to intimate partner\u000a      violence and sexual violence against women: WHO clinical and policy\u000a      guidelines' drew heavily on the research of the UoB team in framing their\u000a      approach and in making recommendations about the training of healthcare\u000a      providers with specific citation of the IRIS model (p.33). [l]\u000a    Economic impact\u000a    With the current number of IRIS practices, the annual societal cost\u000a      saving is estimated to be greater than &#163;1m annually.

Public Health England describes HSE as \"currently the most\u000d\u000a        robust data source to monitor trends in adult obesity in England\" [a].\u000d\u000a      HSE data are used extensively by the Department of Health, NHS and local\u000d\u000a      authority staff, the media, and the public. In one year alone (1 April\u000d\u000a      2012-1 April 2013) there were 36,803 page views (26,928 unique) of HSE\u000d\u000a      pages on the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC)'s website.\u000d\u000a      The three months April-June 2013 saw 7,796 downloads [b]. The UK\u000d\u000a      Data Service reported that the HSE was the second most frequently\u000d\u000a      downloaded dataset in the UK in 2011 [c]. Here we present key\u000d\u000a      evidence for how, during the period 2008-13, HSE has informed the\u000d\u000a      quantification of the obesity problem, the development of Government\u000d\u000a      policy and strategy, the development of clinical guidelines, and the\u000d\u000a      monitoring of progress.\u000d\u000a    Measuring the obesity problem\u000d\u000a    HSE data have enabled the extent and escalation of obesity within the\u000d\u000a      population to be quantified, drawing the attention of Government and\u000d\u000a      policymakers to the issue. Importantly, HSE data enabled the\u000d\u000a      quantification of the obesity problem within sub-groups of the population,\u000d\u000a      highlighting the high rates in children and among adults from lower\u000d\u000a      socioeconomic positions. The Foresight Report, funded by the Government\u000d\u000a      Office for Science, used HSE 1994-2004 data to project population trends\u000d\u000a      to 2050 and examine future impacts on life expectancy and economic costs\u000d\u000a      of overweight and obesity [d]. The 2010 adult update [e]\u000d\u000a      used HSE data from 1993 to 2007. The adult obesity projections varied\u000d\u000a      little: future health problems were predicted to soar, with\u000d\u000a      obesity-related diabetes rising by 98%, strokes by 23%, and heart disease\u000d\u000a      by 44% by 2050.\u000d\u000a    Influencing Government policy and strategy\u000d\u000a    HSE measurement data are used by Government to produce evidence-based\u000d\u000a      strategies to combat obesity. The Chief Medical Officer (CMO), the\u000d\u000a      Government's most senior medical advisor, publishes an annual report to\u000d\u000a      identify priorities in health and recommend action to improve public\u000d\u000a      health. The CMO's 2011 report used a range of HSE data, including on\u000d\u000a      obesity [f]. The UCL team were responsible for the analyses which\u000d\u000a      identified obesity as one of the main risk factors behind the differences\u000d\u000a      in prevalence of multiple lifestyle risk factors by age and by\u000d\u000a      socio-economic position.\u000d\u000a    The research on the HSE that was cited in the Foresight report was used\u000d\u000a      to justify investment of money and Government focus on obesity. For\u000d\u000a      example, in the 2008 Healthy Weight, Healthy Lives: A Cross-Government\u000d\u000a        Strategy for England, a range of commitments for reducing obesity\u000d\u000a      were identified [g]. It states: \"the Government will make\u000d\u000a        available an additional &#163;372 million for promoting the achievement and\u000d\u000a        maintenance of healthy weight over the period 2008-11.\" The 2011\u000d\u000a      document Healthy Lives, Healthy People: A call to action on obesity in\u000d\u000a        England set out specific plans for dealing with the obesity problem\u000d\u000a      [h]. One specific area in which our data influenced this report was\u000d\u000a      in relation to the Change4Life campaign, an extensive public\u000d\u000a      health programme run by the Department of Health which started in 2009.\u000d\u000a      HSE data were used to choose the appropriate adult age group to target for\u000d\u000a      a new phase of the health promotion campaign entitled Change4Life: One\u000d\u000a        Year On [i]. In addition, a calorie reduction target set out\u000d\u000a      in this document was derived from HSE weight gain data, to estimate that a\u000d\u000a      mean reduction in daily energy intake of 100 calories (kcal) per person\u000d\u000a      would correct the energy imbalance nationally.

NICE 2012 guidance Obesity:\u000d\u000a        working with local communities also used HSE obesity data to\u000d\u000a      quantify the extent of the problem [k].

It combines\u000d\u000a      self-reported data (including demographic, socio-economic, health, and\u000d\u000a      lifestyle data) with objective measures of health (such as measured\u000d\u000a      height, weight, and waist circumference) [1]. It has been run by\u000d\u000a      the Joint Health Surveys Unit of UCL and NatCen Social Research since\u000d\u000a      1994; the 23rd survey is currently in the field. HSE provides\u000d\u000a      data from nationally representative samples to monitor trends in the\u000d\u000a      nation's health; identifies the prevalence of specified health conditions\u000d\u000a      in the general population; measures the rates of certain risk factors and\u000d\u000a      combinations of risk factors; examines differences between subgroups of\u000d\u000a      the population; and monitors progress towards selected health targets. The\u000d\u000a      UCL contribution to the HSE falls into three categories: providing the\u000d\u000a      clinical and methodological expertise for the survey; jointly writing and\u000d\u000a      editing the annual HSE reports; and leading the work on secondary data\u000d\u000a      analysis and policy evaluation. The fieldwork and operational side of the\u000d\u000a      HSE are conducted by NatCen, with UCL providing clinical oversight.\u000d\u000a    UCL has developed internationally acclaimed expertise in survey\u000d\u000a      methodology. For example, we have compared the effect of mode and context\u000d\u000a      of survey on response rates, non-response bias, and responses; and of\u000d\u000a      demographic and socio-economic variation in survey participants by time\u000d\u000a      and day interviewed [2].\u000d\u000a    HSE is one of the few health surveys in Europe to obtain objectively\u000d\u000a      measured anthropometric data, rather than relying on self-reporting which\u000d\u000a      consistently under-reports obesity. HSE provides objective, national,\u000d\u000a      general population data on prevalence of general and abdominal obesity [3,\u000a        4]. Extensive demographic and socio-economic data also permit\u000d\u000a      assessment of inequalities in obesity by age, sex, geography, and several\u000d\u000a      markers of socio-economic position.\u000d\u000a    The HSE team at UCL have conducted a considerable amount of secondary\u000d\u000a      analysis work using the HSE data. In 2009, for example, we used HSE data\u000d\u000a      to analyse trends in obesity, and to make projections into the future [5].\u000d\u000a      In 2011 we conducted the analyses and wrote the commentary for the section\u000d\u000a      of the Chief Medical Officer's 2011 report on co-occurrence of multiple\u000d\u000a      risk factors, which could be determined in the general population only\u000d\u000a      through use of HSE data. We identified obesity as one of the main risk\u000d\u000a      factors behind the differences in prevalence of multiple lifestyle risk\u000d\u000a      factors by age and by socio-economic position, and for which the trend was\u000d\u000a      upwards, unlike most other lifestyle risk factors [6]. Our 2012\u000d\u000a      paper used HSE data to demonstrate that waist circumference (a marker for\u000d\u000a      central\/abdominal obesity) had increased in adolescents at a greater rate\u000d\u000a      than generalised obesity (as shown by measuring BMI) [7].\u000d\u000a    Since 2005, the UCL team has been led by Dr Jennifer Mindell in the\u000d\u000a      Health and Social Surveys Research Group of the Research Department of\u000d\u000a      Epidemiology &amp; Public Health, with substantial contributions from Dr\u000d\u000a      Nicola Shelton and a number of post-doctoral and junior researchers.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40406","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"878675","Name":"Zimbabwe"},{"GeoNamesId":"337996","Name":"Ethiopia"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    TB is a major health problem, with 9.4 million new cases and 1.7 million\u000d\u000a      deaths in 2009 [a]. WHO guidelines issued in 2003 [b]\u000d\u000a      recommended a regimen of daily ethambutol, isoniazid, rifampicin and\u000d\u000a      pyrazinamide for 2 months, followed by ethambutol and isoniazid for 6\u000d\u000a      months (2EHRZ\/6HE) as one of the category 1 regimens for the treatment of\u000d\u000a      drug sensitive M Tuberculosis. However, that regimen had not been\u000d\u000a      evaluated in a randomised controlled trial. Study A found that this\u000d\u000a      regimen was clearly inferior to a regimen with the same 2-month intensive\u000d\u000a      phase, followed by 4 months of isoniazid and rifampicin.\u000d\u000a    The results of Study A were published in 2004. It took several years for\u000d\u000a      the results of the research to change international guidelines, perhaps\u000d\u000a      partly because the results were disappointing to international agencies,\u000d\u000a      who would have preferred not to use rifampicin after the initial intensive\u000d\u000a      phase of treatment because of the risk of acquired resistance to this drug\u000d\u000a      in patients who failed treatment. However, eventually the results did\u000d\u000a      begin to influence international policy, as they provided evidence that\u000d\u000a      filled an important gap in knowledge of how to treat TB.\u000d\u000a    In 2006 the International Standards for Tuberculosis Care cited the Study\u000d\u000a      A results [c], and recommended 2EHRZ\/4HR as the preferred\u000d\u000a      treatment regimen, but that 2EHRZ\/6HE could be used where adherence\u000d\u000a      through the continuation phase cannot be assessed. It was considered to be\u000d\u000a      of particular relevance for the developing world, where the majority of\u000d\u000a      people with active TB live.\u000d\u000a    Study A was included in an influential 2009 meta analysis, which said \"The\u000a        most important finding of this review is that all three treatment\u000d\u000a        outcomes were significantly worse with regimens that used rifampin for\u000d\u000a        the first 1-2 mo rather than throughout therapy. This finding adds\u000d\u000a        considerable weight to similar findings by Jindani and colleagues, who\u000d\u000a        compared regimens containing 2 mo versus 6 mo of rifampin\" [d].\u000d\u000a    Eventually, in 2010, the WHO guidelines were updated in a periodic review\u000d\u000a      [e]. This involved carrying out a systematic review of the\u000d\u000a      evidence, which included the results from Study A, which were graded as\u000d\u000a      the most convincing of the available evidence. One of the principal\u000d\u000a      investigators of the trial (Professor Andrew Nunn) was a member of the\u000d\u000a      expert advisory group which helped to develop the new guidelines. The new\u000d\u000a      WHO guidelines included the recommendation that \"New patients with\u000d\u000a        pulmonary TB should receive a regimen containing 6 months of rifampicin:\u000d\u000a        2EHRZ\/4HR\". Indeed, the foreword states the importance of this\u000d\u000a      change: \"The World Health Organization's Stop TB Department has\u000d\u000a        prepared this fourth edition of Treatment of tuberculosis: guidelines,\u000d\u000a        adhering fully to the new WHO process for evidence-based guidelines.\u000d\u000a        Several important recommendations are being promoted in this new\u000d\u000a        edition.\u000d\u000a    First, the recommendation to discontinue the regimen based on just 2\u000d\u000a        months of rifampicin (2HRZE\/6HE) and change to the regimen based on a\u000d\u000a        full 6 months of rifampicin (2HRZE\/4HR) will reduce the number of\u000d\u000a        relapses and failures. This will alleviate patient suffering resulting\u000d\u000a        from a second episode of tuberculosis (TB) and conserve patient and\u000d\u000a        programme resources.\"\u000d\u000a    WHO guidelines are very influential for national TB policy, particularly\u000d\u000a      in African countries, which face a high burden of TB. A survey of national\u000d\u000a      tuberculosis policymakers found that WHO was an important and frequent\u000d\u000a      source of information to inform TB policymaking in Africa. This means that\u000d\u000a      the WHO recommendation, based on Study A, has influenced which TB\u000d\u000a      treatment regimens are used in many countries. National guidelines for TB\u000d\u000a      have been updated to refect the new treatment regimes including Ethiopia,\u000d\u000a      South Africa, and Zimbabwe [f]. Routine data collected by WHO\u000d\u000a      shows that in 2011, 196 out of 206 countries reported using the 6 month\u000d\u000a      regimen with rifampicin throughout for new TB patients. The number of new\u000d\u000a      TB cases (excluding multi-drug resistant TB) in these 196 countries\u000d\u000a      totalled 7,883,245 in 2011, so the results of Study A have had a\u000d\u000a      wide-reaching impact (although it should be noted that not all of these\u000d\u000a      countries were previously using the 8 month regimen) [g].\u000d\u000a    From the perspective of these eight million patients, the 2EHRZ\/4HR has\u000d\u000a      several benefits over the previous 8-month regimen. As well as reducing\u000d\u000a      the number of people who have unfavourable outcomes and require\u000d\u000a      retreatment, it also reduces the inconvenience of attending for treatment\u000d\u000a      (whether fully supervised or not) and reduced the time in which they were\u000d\u000a      exposed to toxic drugs.\u000d\u000a    National Ministries of Health have benefited from the research, as the\u000d\u000a      2EHRZ\/4HR patient kit is US$ 4-10 less expensive than the 2EHRZ\/6HE\u000d\u000a      patient kit [d]. Reducing the number of people requiring\u000d\u000a      retreatment also reduces costs. This allows more people to be treated with\u000d\u000a      the available (limited) resources.\u000d\u000a    It is difficult to determine the exact impact Study A's finding have had\u000d\u000a      in reducing unfavourable outcomes. However if we assume that the reduction\u000d\u000a      of relapses and treatment failures is the same in real life as in the\u000d\u000a      trial, and that around 7.9 million people were treated with the 2EHRZ\/4HR\u000d\u000a      regimen in 2011, then the impact of Study A in that year alone was to\u000d\u000a      prevent over 400,000 relapses and failures, compared to if those people\u000d\u000a      had been treated with the eight month regimen. However, the actual number\u000d\u000a      of relapses prevented directly due to Study A is likely to be lower than\u000d\u000a      this, as not all countries were previously using the 8 month regimen, and\u000d\u000a      some of those countries that did change may have done so for other\u000d\u000a      reasons.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Prior to the change in WHO recommendations which occurred following this\u000d\u000a      study many patients in Africa and other developing countries were\u000d\u000a      receiving an inferior regimen for the management of tuberculosis, a\u000d\u000a      consequence of which meant that many had to be retreated. Since the\u000d\u000a      implementation of the revised WHO Guidelines in 2010 almost all countries\u000d\u000a      have now switched to the gold standard tuberculosis treatment regimen\u000d\u000a      based on 6 months of isoniazid and rifampicin\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Health","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University College London\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"University College London","InstitutionName":"University College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007784}],"Panel":"A         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a[1] Jindani A, Nunn AJ, Enarson DA.

The trial was sponsored by the\u000d\u000a      International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD) and\u000d\u000a      involved 1,355 patients from eight centres in Africa and Asia. This was\u000d\u000a      the first TB trial to utilise a non-inferiority trial design.\u000d\u000a    From 1993 onwards WHO recommended an 8-month regimen without rifampicin\u000d\u000a      in the maintenance phase, in preference to a 6-month regimen with\u000d\u000a      rifampicin throughout. WHO guidelines (issued in 2003) recommended a\u000d\u000a      regimen of daily ethambutol, isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide for 2\u000d\u000a      months, followed by ethambutol and isoniazid for 6 months (2EHRZ\/6HE).\u000d\u000a      However, that regimen had not been evaluated in a randomised controlled\u000d\u000a      trial. Study A compared that regimen with a 6-month regimen with the same\u000d\u000a      initial intensive phase as the first regimen, followed by four months of\u000d\u000a      daily rifampicin and isoniazid (2EHRZ\/4HR).\u000d\u000a    Study A demonstrated that the WHO-recommended 2EHRZ\/6HE regimen was\u000d\u000a      clearly inferior to the 2EHRZ\/4HR regimen [1]. 12 months after the\u000d\u000a      end of chemotherapy 10.4% treated with 2EHRZ\/6HE had unfavourable\u000d\u000a      outcomes, compared to only 4.9% of those treated with 2EHRZ\/4HR. At 30\u000d\u000a      months the failure\/relapse rates were 11.7% of those treated with\u000d\u000a      2EHRZ\/6HE and 6.0% of those treated with 2EHRZ\/4HR [2]. The study\u000d\u000a      was carried out between March 1998 and June 2004 and the results 12 months\u000d\u000a      after stopping treatment were presented at the IUATLD meeting in Montreal\u000d\u000a      in October 2002, and were published in 2004 [1]; the 30 month\u000d\u000a      follow-up results were published in 2011 [2].\u000d\u000a    Key researchers and the positions they held at the time of the\u000d\u000a        research\u000d\u000a    The International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease is a long\u000d\u000a      established NGO working to support national tuberculosis programmes\u000d\u000a      world-wide. Its mission is to bring innovation, expertise, solutions and\u000d\u000a      support to address health challenges in low- and middle-income\u000d\u000a      populations. The IUATLD conceived the trial and invited Andrew Nunn at the\u000d\u000a      MRC Clinical Trials Unit (MRC CTU) to be an investigator because of his\u000d\u000a      long-standing involvement in TB clinical trials, as he had been\u000d\u000a      statistician for previous practice-changing trials. The MRC CTU took the\u000d\u000a      lead in statistics, in the non-inferiority design of the study, in the\u000d\u000a      interim analyses for the Data Monitoring Committee and analyses for the\u000d\u000a      published findings. Andrew Nunn was also closely involved in the writing\u000d\u000a      of the papers for publication. IUALTD chose to work with MRC CTU because\u000d\u000a      of the Unit's expertise in trial design and statistical analysis.\u000d\u000a    Dr Amina Jindani and Professor Donald Enarson were both employed by the\u000d\u000a      IUATLD, Professor Enarson as the Scientific director, Dr Jindani was the\u000d\u000a      chief investigator on the study; Professor Andrew Nunn who was at that\u000d\u000a      time Head of Division Without Portfolio, MRC Clinical Trials Unit, was the\u000d\u000a      senior statistician.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"40408","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research of Hemingway's group has directly informed national and\u000a      international public health\u000a      policy, clinical guidelines and the development of underpinning methods\u000a      which have subsequently\u000a      been implemented and have had an important impact on the healthcare and\u000a      health of the UK and\u000a      international populations, and our capacity for carrying out research for\u000a      patient benefit.\u000a    Clinical investigation of patients with suspected or confirmed\u000a        coronary disease\u000a    Since the early post-war period the exercise electrocardiogram (ECG) has\u000a      been the most widely\u000a      performed diagnostic test for stable angina. In March 2010, however, NICE\u000a      guidelines on Chest\u000a        pain of recent onset (CG95) recommended the following: \"Do not\u000a        use exercise ECG to diagnose or\u000a        exclude stable angina for people without known CAD\". Hemingway was a\u000a      member of the Guideline\u000a      Development Group and his research is cited 16 times in the guideline [a].\u000a      This has led to one of\u000a      the most significant changes in the diagnostic pathway of patients with\u000a      suspected stable angina for\u000a      decades. In the light of recent evidence showing the modest incremental\u000a      value for exercise ECG &#8212;\u000a      the strongest contemporary UK evidence coming from our research &#8212; NICE\u000a      made this bold\u000a      recommendation, which has subsequently been implemented.\u000a    This recommendation has since gone on to change clinical practice. For\u000a      example, an analysis of\u000a      diagnostic testing at the Newcastle Rapid Access Chest Pain Clinic in 2011\u000a      reported that: \"The\u000a        proportion of the study population before and after the guidelines\u000a        undergoing exercise testing was\u000a        50.1% vs 0.0%; for calcium score\/CT coronary angiography 0.0% vs 14.7%;\u000a        for functional imaging\u000a        25.6% vs 13.4%; and for invasive coronary angiography 15.3% vs 25.8%.\u000a        The proportion not\u000a        requiring further testing was unchanged (30.0% vs 31.0%)\" [b].\u000a      An analysis from the Royal Derby\u000a      Hospital in 2013 reported that \"implementation of the 2010 NICE\u000a        guidance...resulted in a greater\u000a        proportion of initial discharge to primary care with less frequent\u000a        outpatient review and similar rates\u000a        of referral for coronary angiography\" [c].\u000a    CG95 also made recommendations based on our research on sex and ethnicity\u000a      in angina pain.\u000a      The guideline recommended: \"Do not define typical and atypical features\u000a        of anginal chest pain and\u000a        non-anginal chest pain differently in men and women\" (recommendation\u000a      1.3.3.2) and \"Do not\u000a        define typical and atypical features of anginal chest pain and\u000a        non-anginal chest pain differently in\u000a        ethnic groups\" (recommendation 1.3.3.3). These two recommendations\u000a      (arising from ref. 5 above)\u000a      for the first time make an unequivocal statement to clinicians that\u000a      typical anginal pain does not\u000a      differ by sex and ethnicity. This is important because it has previously\u000a      been used as a post-hoc\u000a      justification of why rates of procedure use might differ between these\u000a      groups.\u000a    Treatment of patients with angina\u000a    From the perspective of the patient, or the health system payer, one of\u000a      the most significant\u000a      decisions taken among patients with angina relates to the mode of\u000a      revascularisation (coronary\u000a      artery bypass graft [CABG] or percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]).\u000a      Our work was cited ten\u000a      times in the NICE guidelines on Management of stable angina\u000a      (CH126) issued in July 2011 and\u000a      directly influenced recommendations, all of which were `Key priorities for\u000a      implementation' [d].\u000a    First, `When either procedure would be appropriate, explain to the\u000a        person the risks and benefits of\u000a        PCI and CABG for people with anatomically less complex disease whose\u000a        symptoms are not\u000a        satisfactorily controlled with optimal medical treatment. If the person\u000a        does not express a\u000a        preference, take account of the evidence that suggests that PCI may be\u000a        the more cost-effective\u000a        procedure in selecting the course of treatment.'\u000a    Second, `When either procedure would be appropriate, take into account\u000a        the potential survival\u000a        advantage of CABG over PCI for people with multivessel disease whose\u000a        symptoms are not\u000a        satisfactorily controlled with optimal medical treatment and who have\u000a        diabetes or are over 65 years\u000a        or have anatomically complex three-vessel disease, with or without\u000a        involvement of the left main\u000a        stem.'\u000a    Our published unique `real world' cost and outcome data highlighted the\u000a      prevalence of patients\u000a      who are judged appropriate for both forms of revascularisation (refs [1]\u000a      and [3] above) and\u000a      underpinned to specification of these recommendations. Our UK evidence\u000a      base added to that\u000a      internationally has led to a slowing in the rate of increase of PCI for\u000a      stable coronary disease.\u000a    Co-existing depression among people with myocardial infarction\u000a    Our systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the role of depression in the\u000a      prognosis of coronary\u000a      disease have contributed in part to recommendations in European guidance\u000a      on the need to assess\u000a      psychosocial factors in these patients. Hemingway contributed to the 2007\u000a      guidelines on\u000a      cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice from European\u000a      Society of Cardiology, and the\u000a      most recent (2012) guidelines directly cite our work in support of the\u000a      identification of depression as\u000a      a specific risk factor in CVD [e]. These are the strongest\u000a      recommendations to date that clinicians\u000a      might consider psychosocial factors in addition to the better recognised\u000a      behavioural and biological\u000a      factors.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research led by Professor Harry Hemingway at UCL on the quality and\u000a      outcomes of care of\u000a      people with, or at risk of, cardiovascular diseases has informed\u000a      guidelines and clinical\u000a      management in a number of areas. The work influenced NICE guidelines on Chest\u000a        pain of recent\u000a        onset (CG95) with regard to the use of exercise electrocardiography\u000a      (ECG) in the diagnosis of\u000a      stable angina and approaches to sex and ethnicity in diagnosis. Our\u000a      research also underpinned\u000a      recommendations on revascularisation in the NICE guidelines on Management\u000a        of stable angina\u000a      (CH126). Additionally, the research has led to recommendations about the\u000a      need to assess\u000a      psychosocial factors including depression in people with myocardial\u000a      infarction.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Health","Institution":"\u000a    University College London\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"University College London","InstitutionName":"University College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007784}],"Panel":"A         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a[1] Hemingway H, Crook AM, Feder G, Banerjee S, Dawson JR, Magee P,\u000a      Philpott S, Sanders J,\u000a      Wood A, Timmis AD.

Previous\u000a      studies had suggested that\u000a      `appropriateness' might offer a missing link in optimising clinical\u000a      practice with evidence-based care,\u000a      for several inter-related reasons. However, it was unknown whether these\u000a      ratings of\u000a      appropriateness for coronary revascularisation or coronary angiography\u000a      were valid in terms of\u000a      clinical outcomes. Among consecutive `real world patients' we hypothesised\u000a      that people who were\u000a      appropriate for a procedure but who did not receive it (underuse) would go\u000a      on to experience worse\u000a      outcomes. Ours was the first (and still among the few) studies to\u000a      prospectively test, and confirm,\u000a      this hypothesis [1].\u000a    Our appropriateness studies allowed us to go beyond clinically na&#239;ve but\u000a      widely published crude\u000a      differences in rates of procedures e.g. between ethnic minorities, women\u000a      and men (which are to be\u000a      expected based on well known differences in the epidemiology of coronary\u000a      disease) to assess\u000a      whether procedure rates are clinically fair. What we demonstrated was that\u000a      there was little\u000a      evidence that South Asians had clinically important (in terms of death and\u000a      heart attack risk)\u000a      differences from the rest of the population in appropriateness for\u000a      revascularisation [2].\u000a    We used a novel method to address the clinically important decision\u000a      arising when revascularisation\u000a      with both coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and percutaneous coronary\u000a      intervention (PCI)\u000a      are considered clinically appropriate. Based on our formally-defined\u000a      appropriateness criteria, and\u000a      long-term follow up (five years) we demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of\u000a      revascularisation with\u000a      CABG, but showed that revascularisation with PCI was not cost effective [3].\u000a      These results were\u000a      subsequently demonstrated (among selected patients) in randomised trials.\u000a    We exploited linked electronic health records in primary care in Finland\u000a      to provide the first large-scale\u000a      evidence that stable angina has a considerably higher incidence than\u000a      myocardial infarction\u000a      and affects women and men with similar incidence risks. Furthermore,\u000a      stable angina in women,\u000a      among easily identifiable clinical subgroups, has similarly high absolute\u000a      rates of prognostic\u000a      outcomes compared with men [4].\u000a    Between 1996 and 2002 we investigated the role of exercise\u000a      electrocardiography in the initial\u000a      evaluation of people with suspected stable angina and found that it\u000a      contributed little new prognostic\u000a      information beyond simpler clinical measures [5].\u000a    Our systematic reviews and meta-analyses since the late 1990s have tested\u000a      the long-held clinical\u000a      impression that social and psychological factors might influence outcome\u000a      in coronary disease.\u000a      Most recently, in a systematic review looking at depression in particular,\u000a      we found some evidence\u000a      that depression may be important but also identified the need for\u000a      methodological improvements in\u000a      the research [6].\u000a    Our research has led to the establishment of the Farr Institute of Health\u000a      Informatics Research,\u000a      funded to a total of &#163;9.3m from 10 UK funders (including MRC, Wellcome\u000a      Trust, NIHR, British\u000a      Heart Foundation.)

The principal beneficiaries are people\u000a      with sickle cell disease and their families whose management has moved\u000a      from the margins of the NHS to the mainstream. Individuals with sickle\u000a      cell disease have benefited from earlier diagnosis and better treatment.\u000a      Carriers of the sickle cell trait have benefited through being enabled to\u000a      make informed reproductive choices when a pregnancy may be affected.\u000a    King's hosts the national Screening Programme Centre\u000a    Following up the research on newborn bloodspot coverage, King's was\u000a      commissioned by the Department of Health to implement a National Audit of\u000a      the Newborn Bloodspot Programme. As a result of a 1999 workshop convened\u000a      by the National Screening Committee (NSC), at which the King's research on\u000a      bloodspot programme coverage was presented alongside the results of two\u000a      Health Technology Assessment reviews, universal newborn screening for\u000a      sickle cell disease was recommended. In 2000, the Department of Health\u000a      committed to introduce newborn and antenatal screening for\u000a      haemoglobinopathies including sickle cell disease and thalassaemia. The\u000a      National Programme Centre for the NHS screening programme was established\u000a      at King's College London from 2000 to 2013 through a contract between the\u000a      Department of Health and King's, which had a value of &#163;7.75 million in the\u000a      period 2008-2013. The Programme was directed by Dr Streetly (2000- 2013),\u000a      reporting to Dr Anne Mackie as Director of Programmes, for the National\u000a      Screening Committee. The Programme Centre transferred to Public Health\u000a      England in 2013. The aim of the NHS Haemoglobinopathy Screening Programme\u000a      is to support people to make informed choices during pregnancy and before\u000a      conception, to improve infant health through prompt identification of\u000a      affected babies, to provide high quality and accessible care for these\u000a      conditions throughout England and promote greater understanding and\u000a      awareness of the disorders (NHS\u000a        Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia Screening Programme, 2013).\u000a    King's leads implementation of the National Screening Programme\u000a    With national leadership based at King's, universal newborn and antenatal\u000a      screening for sickle cell disease was introduced in England while\u000a      implementation in Scotland and Northern Ireland was also supported. This\u000a      was achieved through setting standards (Ryan\u000a        et al. 2010); designing pathways for screening and care; education\u000a      and training; establishing communications and preparing materials for\u000a      professionals and the public; establishing data collection systems for\u000a      surveillance and monitoring; and quality assurance and evaluation.

The King's group proposed that under-ascertainment of\u000a      the condition may have allowed a downplaying of the scale of need and\u000a      contributed to infant mortality rates in urban areas as babies died\u000a      without a diagnosis or treatment (Streetly\u000a        et al., 2009).\u000a    Influenced by the results of King's SHIFT Trial (whose Trial Manager,\u000a      Dormandy, became Screening Programme Deputy Director), the national NHS\u000a      Screening Programme has set a minimum standard of requiring 50% of\u000a      prenatal diagnosis procedures to be implemented by 12 weeks and 6 days\u000a      gestation. The Data\u000a        Report for 2011\/12 (NHS Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia Screening\u000a      Programme, 2013) (Table AN-4) shows that 61% of all initial antenatal\u000a      screening tests in England are now performed by 12 weeks gestation. This\u000a      has been accompanied by an increase in the number of pre-natal diagnosis\u000a      procedures being performed from 307 in 2004\/5 to 418 in 2011\/12, with 52%\u000a      of these now being performed within 12 weeks 6 days of gestation (Table\u000a      PND- 6).\u000a    King's provides international advice on haemoglobinopathy screening\u000a    During the assessment period, the Screening Programme has benefitted from\u000a      strong stakeholder involvement, with the Archbishop of York chairing the\u000a      Programme Steering Group. There has been international interest in the\u000a      screening programme, which is recognised to be the best developed in\u000a      Europe, and arguably the world, providing a model for many other\u000a      countries. Dr Streetly has given invited presentations at the Centres for\u000a      Disease Control, Atlanta, USA, Ghana, and in Europe in Rome, Lisbon,\u000a      Barcelona, Paris and Berlin. The Programme has also hosted visits from, or\u000a      provided advice to, public health advisers to the Netherlands government,\u000a      US Centres for Disease Control, Sri Lanka and Nigeria among others. The\u000a      Programme website is regularly accessed and materials downloaded by\u000a      interested parties from across the world.\u000a    King's research stimulates action to improve patient care and\u000a        specialist treatment services\u000a    King's research drew attention to the difficulties that patients with\u000a      sickle cell disease experience in their interactions with hospital\u000a      services. Following on from the research, a National Confidential Enquiry\u000a      into Patient Outcomes and Death (NCEPOD,\u000a        2008) into sickle cell disease was launched. King's contributed to\u000a      the authorship of the NCEPOD report (Professor Sebastian Lucas, Dr Allison\u000a      Streetly). The NCEPOD findings confirmed and extended the results of the\u000a      King's research. Of 35 sickle cell disease patients who died in hospital,\u000a      19 had pain as an admitting complaint. In nine patients excessive doses of\u000a      opioids were judged to have been administered, contributing to the\u000a      patient's death in five cases. The NCEPOD report made 28 specific\u000a      recommendations for the improvement of clinical treatment and service\u000a      delivery for sickle cell disease including better management of acute pain\u000a      and improved care of the long-term illness by clinicians with specialist\u000a      expertise and training. The recommendations were circulated to Medical\u000a      Directors of all Trusts for action. Recognising the need for action to\u000a      improve the quality of care highlighted by this report, the Department of\u000a      Health commissioned a National Haemoglobinopathies project that produced\u000a      guidance for commissioners on effectively commissioning high quality\u000a      sickle cell and thalassaemia services. The guidance included designated\u000a      standards that Trusts must deliver to secure specialist status for\u000a      haemoglobinopathy care as well as model service specifications and a\u000a      commissioning framework. The final NHS guideline document (NHS\u000a        East Midlands 2011) included an endorsement written by Dr Streetly\u000a      from King's in her capacity as Programme Director of the National NHS\u000a      Haemoglobinopathy Screening Programme. The Department of Health also\u000a      prioritised this as an area for National Institute for Health and Care\u000a      Excellence (NICE) guidance leading to sickle cell crises being defined as\u000a      an emergency condition (NICE,\u000a        2012).\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    King's College London research identified the feasibility of implementing\u000a      newborn screening for sickle cell disease, which was advocated. King's\u000a      research also demonstrated the feasibility of antenatal screening for\u000a      sickle cell disease early in pregnancy. A new national NHS Programme for\u000a      antenatal and newborn screening for haemoglobin disorders was rolled out,\u000a      with the national Programme Centre based at King's, resulting in\u000a      increasing numbers of women and newborn infants being tested for sickle\u000a      cell disease and trait. The screening programme enables informed choices\u000a      for carrier individuals, and contributed to earlier diagnosis and better\u000a      care for those with disease.

King's research led by Dr Allison Streetly (Senior Lecturer in\u000a      Public Health, 1994-7; Honorary Senior Research Fellow, 1997-2013),\u000a      Professor Theresa Marteau (Professor of Health Psychology, King's 1993 to\u000a      2012) and Dr Elizabeth Dormandy (SHIFT Trial Manager, later Deputy\u000a      Director, Sickle Cell and Thalassaemia Screening Programme, King's 1999 to\u000a      2013); explored the feasibility of introducing a newborn screening\u000a      programme for the condition; demonstrated the effectiveness of screening\u000a      for haemoglobin disorders early in pregnancy; and evaluated the delivery\u000a      of care for patients with sickle cell disease.\u000a    King's research identifies the potential to screen newborns for Sickle\u000a        Cell Disease\u000a    King's research investigated the coverage of newborn bloodspot screening,\u000a      as a potential means of screening infants for sickle cell disease (Streetly\u000a        et al., 1994). This research found that overall coverage of\u000a      bloodspot screening was 96% but there were important inequalities in\u000a      coverage with lower screening coverage in infants of African ethnicity\u000a      than in white infants. The research pointed out that the newborn bloodspot\u000a      test could be used to screen for sickle cell disease but poorer coverage\u000a      of infants of African origins might result in cases of sickle cell disease\u000a      going undetected. The report authors advocated using the newborn bloodspot\u000a      in screening for sickle cell disease in subsequent\u000a        publications. The research showed that arrangements for monitoring\u000a      the existing screening programme were inadequate and the research report\u000a      recommended that an improved system for managing and monitoring the blood\u000a      spot programme should be established.\u000a    King's research shows Sickle Cell carriers may be identified very\u000a        early in pregnancy\u000a    King's research evaluated the potential for screening for sickle cell\u000a      disease early in pregnancy. Dormandy\u000a        et al. (2008) reported a study of 1,441 eligible women attending 25\u000a      general practitioner clinics offering universal antenatal screening. The\u000a      median time interval between pregnancy confirmation in primary care and a\u000a      screening test for sickle cell or thalassaemia being performed was 6.9\u000a      weeks, with only 4.4% of women being screened before 10 weeks gestation (Dormandy et al., 2008).\u000a      The King's SHIFT cluster randomised trial provided evidence of the\u000a      effectiveness, and impact on informed choice, of offering antenatal\u000a      screening at the earliest stage of pregnancy in primary care (Dormandy\u000a        et al., 2010a; Dormandy\u000a        et al., 2010b). The SHIFT trial showed that in a conventional\u000a      midwife-led model of care only 2% of women are screened for haemoglobin\u000a      disorders before 10 weeks' gestation, compared with over 25% of women\u000a      receiving general practitioner-led care with either parallel or sequential\u000a      partner testing. These results showed that offering antenatal screening\u000a      for haemoglobin disorders as part of consultations for pregnancy\u000a      confirmation in primary care substantially increases the proportion of\u000a      women offered screening before 10 weeks' gestation. This is important in\u000a      enabling carrier couples to choose their preferred option in early\u000a      pregnancy with less time pressure. Options may include prenatal diagnosis,\u000a      with amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling, leading to possible\u000a      termination of pregnancy.\u000a    King's research identifies problems experienced in seeking care for\u000a        Sickle Cell Disease\u000a    King's research (Maxwell\u000a        et al., 1999) showed that patients with sickle cell disease\u000a      experienced substantial difficulties in hospital care. These were\u000a      characterised by health professionals' mistrust of patients with sickle\u000a      cell disease; their stigmatisation of sickle cell disease patients as\u000a      potential drug addicts; professionals' control of treatment plans,\u000a      diminishing opportunities for self-care; neglect of patients' personal\u000a      care needs and monitoring of vital signs; and failure to offer\u000a      psychological support. The research found that individuals who usually\u000a      manage their pain at home showed different attitudes and strategies\u000a      towards hospital services from those who are frequently admitted to\u000a      hospital. The study recommended that models of care should be developed\u000a      that acknowledge the diversity of the population with sickle cell\u000a      disorders and prioritise the involvement and empowerment of patients in\u000a      their care (Maxwell\u000a        et al., 1999).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41173","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Medical Research Council","Natural Environment Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Impacts of King's air quality research include: evidence linking poor air\u000d\u000a      quality in urban environments to traffic; evidence to inform the policies\u000d\u000a      to improve air quality; contributing to the design and implementation and\u000d\u000a      evaluation of traffic control schemes in the UK; informing the development\u000d\u000a      of schemes in other countries; evidence of measurable improvements in air\u000d\u000a      quality; evidence of improvements in health outcomes. Beneficiaries from\u000d\u000a      the research include the populations of urban centres that have benefited\u000d\u000a      from control measures directed at traffic related air pollution.\u000d\u000a    King's research influences air quality strategy in London\u000d\u000a    In 2000, London's air quality was the worst in the UK and there was\u000d\u000a      evidence to show that these pollution levels caused serious health\u000d\u000a      impacts. Ken Livingstone, as Mayor of London published the `The Mayor's\u000d\u000a        Air Quality Strategy: Cleaning London's Air,' in 2001 (updated in\u000d\u000a      2002) which drew heavily on information from King's London Air Quality\u000d\u000a      Network (LAQN). The strategy put forward a range of policies and proposals\u000d\u000a      designed to move London toward the point where air pollution no longer\u000d\u000a      poses a significant risk to human health. The underpinning research from\u000d\u000a      King's, constituted an extensive programme that has delivered innovative\u000d\u000a      modelling and monitoring methodologies, guiding the design of the\u000d\u000a      Congestion Charging Scheme and subsequently the world's largest low\u000d\u000a      emission zone (LEZ). London's LEZ was proposed in order to \"accelerate the\u000d\u000a      introduction of cleaner vehicles and reduce the numbers of older, more\u000d\u000a      polluting vehicles\" into the capital. King's researchers engaged in the\u000d\u000a      LEZ feasibility study and, in 2005, King's was chosen to partner Transport\u000d\u000a      for London (TfL) in delivering the London LEZ, which became a key\u000d\u000a      component of The Mayor's Air Quality Strategy. In the assessment period,\u000d\u000a      results from King's monitoring and modelling were used extensively by the\u000d\u000a      Mayor's office. `The Mayor's Air Quality Strategy' (2010) details current pollution\u000d\u000a      levels and highlights measures which `will result in significant\u000d\u000a      reductions in pollution concentrations across Greater London.' King's LAQN\u000d\u000a      is specifically identified for the contribution to monitoring of air\u000d\u000a      quality and emissions. The LAQN index, developed by King's, is used\u000d\u000a      throughout the report to `provide a useful picture of the overall\u000d\u000a      improvements in London's air quality'. The London Air Quality Network not only informs Transport for London, but can\u000d\u000a      be used by the public to find, for instance, street-level, interactive\u000d\u000a      current pollution maps; incidences of high pollution episodes; news,\u000d\u000a      videos and podcasts pertaining to air quality; interactive graphs by\u000d\u000a      London borough and yearly reports.\u000d\u000a    The LEZ was established in 2008 and has continued to the present. It\u000d\u000a      operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. It applies to diesel-engine,\u000d\u000a      heavy goods vehicles (HGVs), buses and coaches, larger vans and minibuses,\u000d\u000a      using cameras to identify the registration numbers of vehicles and the\u000d\u000a      Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) database to identify a\u000d\u000a      vehicle's emissions. The impact of the research undertaken by King's in\u000d\u000a      partnership with TfL, not only encompasses the evaluation the\u000d\u000a      effectiveness of the LEZ on an ongoing basis, but also ensured that key\u000d\u000a      projected impacts of the scheme were understood and characterised well in\u000d\u000a      advance of the implementation date, as part of the monitoring network\u000d\u000a      design process. The 2008 TfL report `London Low Emission Zone &#8212; Impacts Monitoring' details the collaboration\u000d\u000a      with the King's LAQN saying that measurements provided by them \"will be\u000d\u000a      the first point of reference for stakeholders assessing the air quality\u000d\u000a      impacts of the scheme and are the legal basis for assessing compliance\u000d\u000a      with UK and European air quality objectives.\" This report also discusses\u000d\u000a      the health impacts of the LEZ, utilising data that contributed to the Tonne et al, (2008)\u000d\u000a      and Kelly et al, (2011b) research reports.\u000d\u000a    King's scientists provide expert advice and advocacy to UK\u000d\u000a        policy-makers\u000d\u000a    Prof Frank Kelly from King's has actively advocated the merits of LEZs\u000d\u000a      when giving expert advice to Environmental Audit Committee enquiries into\u000d\u000a      air quality in the UK. Prof Kelly gave detailed verbal evidence to the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee to\u000d\u000a      aid in the compilation of their Air Quality Report. This report detailed the government's response to a\u000d\u000a      previous meeting of the committee that found that \"air quality was not\u000d\u000a      seen as a priority across Government\" and as such the UK was \"failing to\u000d\u000a      meet a range of domestic and European targets.\" Failure to meet standards\u000d\u000a      could incur millions of pounds of fines. The single most important\u000d\u000a      exposure to harmful air pollutants was known to be caused by transport. It\u000d\u000a      was decided local authorities must be involved in tackling poor air\u000d\u000a      quality. The government undertook this current enquiry to \"assess the\u000d\u000a      extent to which the Government had implemented the processes outlined in\u000d\u000a      its response and to assess their results.\" Prof Kelly was one of the key\u000d\u000a      people giving evidence and a reference was also made to LAQN documents\u000d\u000a      when discussing how, in London, PM10 daily limit values were\u000d\u000a      being exceeded. King's researchers have also compiled several reports for\u000d\u000a      the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). For\u000d\u000a      instance, in 2009 they produced a report on `Air pollution and emissions trends in London' that \"summarises detailed\u000d\u000a      and comprehensive assessment of trends in emissions and concentrations of\u000d\u000a      NOX and PM in London\". They also produced a review of air quality modelling that \"identifies specific policy needs for\u000d\u000a      the use of models and evaluates each model in turn in terms of the\u000d\u000a      scientific content and credibility of the models, their ease of use and\u000d\u000a      transparency and their fitness for purpose in delivering DEFRA's needs. Many UK cities are now investigating LEZs with 15 local authorities being\u000d\u000a      allocated central government funds to develop schemes similar to the\u000d\u000a      London LEZ. King's researchers are members of the Committee on the Medical\u000d\u000a      Effects of Air Pollutants, the expert advisory group of the Department of\u000d\u000a      Health in the UK for which Kelly is Chair; Quantification of air pollution\u000d\u000a      health effects, a sub-group of COMEAP; and the Air Quality Expert Group,\u000d\u000a      the DEFRA advisory group.\u000d\u000a    King's scientists provide expert advice to international agencies\u000d\u000a    Professor Kelly and colleagues played significant roles in the air\u000d\u000a      quality review process initiated by the WHO in 2005, 2010 and again in\u000d\u000a      2012. Members of King's staff are also members of influential national and\u000d\u000a      international scientific panels including: UN Economic Commission for\u000d\u000a      Europe Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution; and the US\u000d\u000a      Health Effects Institute investigation into the Health Effects of Traffic\u000d\u000a      pollution.\u000d\u000a    King's research informs similar interventions throughout Europe\u000d\u000a    Since the inception of the LEZ, King's has contributed innovative\u000d\u000a      analysis of pollution concentrations as part of our ongoing assessment of\u000d\u000a      the impacts of the LEZ on air quality. This work has been of benefit to\u000d\u000a      the UK, and other Governments around the globe, as they contemplate\u000d\u000a      measures to reduce traffic pollution in increasingly congested urban\u000d\u000a      areas. The LEZ was designed to move London closer to achieving national\u000d\u000a      and EU air quality objectives. The use of traffic intervention schemes to\u000d\u000a      achieve an improvement in air quality is now widespread. More than 200\u000d\u000a      cities in 13 European countries have introduced LEZ's and international teams are\u000d\u000a      following King's lead in assessing their potential health benefit.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Poor air quality is an important public health issue especially in cities\u000d\u000a      where traffic is the major source of pollution. It is estimated that\u000d\u000a      29,000 people die prematurely in the UK each year, and 310,000 in Europe,\u000d\u000a      because of air pollution. King's research, based on the London Air Quality\u000d\u000a      Network (LAQN), including emissions modelling and vehicle profiling,\u000d\u000a      indicated that improvements in air quality could be achieved by\u000d\u000a      restricting the entrance of specific vehicle classes into urban areas.\u000d\u000a      These research outputs were utilised by the Mayor of London to introduce\u000d\u000a      the Congestion Charging Scheme (CCS), from 2003 to the present, and the\u000d\u000a      London Low Emission Zone (LEZ), from 2008 to the present.

The Centre is led by Professor Frank Kelly (King's\u000d\u000a      1992-date). In 1995, King's established the London Air Quality Network, which has evolved into the largest urban air\u000d\u000a      quality network in Europe, consisting of over 120 fixed measurement sites\u000d\u000a      for a range of pollutants including oxides of nitrogen (NOx),\u000d\u000a      notably nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3) and\u000d\u000a      particulate matter (PM). King's research used information from the LAQN to\u000d\u000a      understand the sources of atmospheric pollution and to estimate the health\u000d\u000a      impacts of these pollutants in a major urban environment. In cities,\u000d\u000a      vehicles are the main contributors to air pollution; transport-related\u000d\u000a      pollutants are strong oxidants which, when in contact with the delicate\u000d\u000a      respiratory airways, lead to damage (Kelly, 2003). When these finding were linked to experimental chamber\u000d\u000a      studies in human volunteers demonstrating decreased airway function and\u000d\u000a      inflammation (Mudway and Kelly, 2004), this work contributed to the growing literature\u000d\u000a      that identified exposure to transport-related pollutants as a cause of ill\u000d\u000a      health.\u000d\u000a    King's scientists design and evaluate interventions to reduce harmful\u000d\u000a        exposures\u000d\u000a    The King's team began research to inform the design and evaluation of\u000d\u000a      traffic control schemes to improve air quality and hence health. Working\u000d\u000a      in partnership with Transport for London, King's researchers utilised\u000d\u000a      automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) data in combination with the\u000d\u000a      King's urban dispersion model to predict the air quality impact of the\u000d\u000a      introduction of a congestion charging scheme (CCS). A temporal-spatial\u000d\u000a      design was employed in which modelled and measured air quality data from\u000d\u000a      LAQN monitoring stations were used to compare time periods before\u000d\u000a      (2001-2002) and after (2003-2004) the CCS was introduced. Using a range of\u000d\u000a      approaches, King's researchers found evidence of only small changes in air\u000d\u000a      quality from the CCS (Beevers and Carslaw, 2005). However, attributing changes to the introduction\u000d\u000a      of the CCS alone is difficult because the scheme was introduced at a time\u000d\u000a      when other traffic and emissions interventions were also being implemented\u000d\u000a      (Kelly et al., 2011a).\u000a      King's research suggested that the health benefits of the CCS introduction\u000d\u000a      might be small (Tonne et al., 2008) and so began to determine the benefit of a London-wide\u000d\u000a      low emission zone (LEZ). Prior to activation of the first phase of the LEZ\u000d\u000a      in 2008, King's research showed that a LEZ could provide improvements in\u000d\u000a      urban air quality, crucially predicting that the emissions controls\u000d\u000a      enforced by the scheme were expected to have the greatest effect close to\u000d\u000a      major roads with high volumes of heavy-goods-vehicle traffic. This\u000d\u000a      research was instrumental in guiding the design of a carefully considered\u000d\u000a      and extensive environmental impacts monitoring network, directed from\u000d\u000a      King's, that generates robust air quality data from baseline to the\u000d\u000a      present as part of our ongoing evaluation of the effectiveness of the LEZ\u000d\u000a      (Kelly et al., 2011b).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41174","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    King's stroke research has had substantial impact through translation\u000a      into national and local\u000a      policies for stroke care, leading to improved commissioning and delivery\u000a      of stroke services. This\u000a      has contributed to reductions in mortality and cost savings for health\u000a      services, mainly through\u000a      transformation of services in cities and the implementation of Early\u000a      Supported Discharge, the latter\u000a      also being rolled out internationally. The ultimate beneficiaries of these\u000a      impacts are patients with\u000a      stroke, as well as their family members, who benefit from better health,\u000a      less disability and longer\u000a      lives. Other stakeholders benefit from our research through high quality\u000a      evidence to inform policy.\u000a      Such beneficiaries include the government and non-governmental\u000a      policy-makers, commissioners\u000a      and providers of health and social care, and the voluntary sector\u000a      including the Stroke Association\u000a      and aphasia charities.\u000a    King's research influences national policy for stroke\u000a      South London Stroke Register data informed the Department of Health National\u000a          Stroke Strategy on\u000a      the need for acute and longer term stroke care. King's data informed and\u000a      were embedded into\u000a      `Action\u000a        on Stroke Services: An Evaluation Toolkit (ASSET) for providers and for\u000a        commissioners'\u000a      which is cited as a `key resource' in Annex B of the National Stroke\u000a      Strategy. King's was also\u000a      commissioned by the Department of Health to develop recommendations for\u000a      the top\u000a        ten priorities in stroke service research.\u000a      The South London Stroke Register team was commissioned by the\u000a      National Audit Office (NAO) to write an annex to the report on\u000a      stroke care (NAO, 2010: `Progress\u000a        in improving stroke care').\u000a      This utilised King's estimates for risk of stroke, long term outcomes and\u000a      survival to inform recommendations for stroke care. King's data were used\u000a      to model cost-effective\u000a      options for stroke care (NAO, 2010: `Report\u000a        on the findings from our modelling of stroke care provision',\u000a      pages 15-16), informing the Parliamentary\u000a        Public Accounts Committee (2010) report on\u000a      the need for a step change in stroke care.\u000a    King's research informs major service reconfiguration in London\u000a      In response to Lord Darzi's 2007 report `Healthcare for London: A\u000a      Framework for Action', South\u000a      London Stroke Register data on incidence and patient outcomes were used by\u000a      Healthcare for\u000a        London to develop a Stroke\u000a        Strategy for London (2008). King's data were specifically employed\u000a      to estimate the number of people who can be expected to have a stroke and\u000a      thereby the number of\u000a      Hyper Acute Stroke Unit (HASU) and Acute Stroke Unit (ASU) beds required\u000a      in the city, and to\u000a      develop models of cost effective configurations of services (page 7).\u000a      Wolfe and Rudd led work\u000a      streams for the strategy development. The reconfiguration, implemented in\u000a      2010, consisted of 8\u000a      HASUs and 24 Stroke Units. An evaluation (Hunter\u000a        et al., 2013) found an estimated 12% reduction\u000a      in deaths at 90 days, as well as a reduction in the median length of stay,\u000a      with an estimated cost\u000a      saving of &#163;811 per patient (2011) in London after the reconfiguration.\u000a    King's provides professional leadership and research evidence to\u000a        inform clinical guidelines\u000a      The South London Stroke Register leadership has also been instrumental in\u000a      improving stroke care\u000a      nationally. Professor\u000a        Anthony Rudd from King's has chaired the Royal College of\u000a        Physicians'\u000a        (RCP) Intercollegiate Stroke Working Party (ISWP) since its\u000a      inception in 1995. The fourth edition of\u000a      the Working Party's National\u000a        Clinical Guideline for Stroke (2012) recommends that Early\u000a      Supported Discharge should be a component of stroke care. The Guidelines\u000a      also discuss the\u000a      unmet needs of stroke patients (following McKevitt et al., 2011 cited\u000a      above). The RCP's National\u000a        Sentinel Stroke Audit 2010\u000a      recommended that Early Supported Discharge should be made\u000a      available in all districts.' (page 11). Early Supported Discharge is now\u000a      provided by 66% of English\u000a      hospitals. (RCP Sentinel Audit 2012) and has been implemented\u000a      internationally (Fisher\u000a        et al.2011).\u000a      Earlier editions of the ICSWP National Stroke Guidelines, which also cite\u000a      King's stroke\u000a      research, have been used to inform the 2008 National Institute of\u000a        Health and Care Excellence\u000a      (NICE) guidelines\u000a        on stroke and the 2010 Stroke\u000a        Quality Standard, the latter recommending Early\u000a      Supported Discharge as a component of the rehabilitation pathway. In a\u000a      report authored by King's\u000a      stroke researchers, and using methods developed by King's researchers to\u000a      estimate the quality of\u000a      stroke care, data from the RCP National Stroke Audit data for the first 72\u000a      hours of stroke care in\u000a      NHS facilities, demonstrated reduced mortality in hospitals with better\u000a      organised stroke care (Bray\u000a        et al., 2013).\u000a      The work of King's is also influential in the NHS Improvement\u000a      initiative for stroke care.\u000a      For instance, the ISWP documents are referenced throughout their website\u000a      and publications,\u000a      especially in terms of calling for pathways that include Early Supported\u000a      Discharge.\u000a    King's works with voluntary sector and patients to articulate needs\u000a      The Stroke Association (SA) recently published `Saving\u000a          Lives. 20 years of investment in vital stroke research'\u000a      that identifies how the research it has funded has led to patient benefit.\u000a      This report\u000a      highlights King's research in developing and evaluating Early Supported\u000a      Discharge. The results of\u000a      the Stroke Association 2010 Stroke\u000a        Survivor Needs survey have informed Stroke Association\u000a      policy, and identified stroke survivor priorities, for areas of research\u000a      and service development\u000a      which have not previously been addressed, for example high prevalence of\u000a      stroke-related fatigue.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The King's South London Stroke Register is the world's longest running,\u000a      population-based stroke\u000a      research register, assessing the incidence of stroke; the acute and\u000a      long-term needs of stroke\u000a      patients; and quality of stroke care.

To date we have collected detailed information from almost 5,000\u000a      stroke patients in the\u000a      Register area, with each patient followed up at 3 months and annually\u000a      after stroke, for life.\u000a    King's stroke research has: 1) measured the incidence of stroke and its\u000a      immediate and long-term\u000a      consequences for patients, contributing to understanding needs for\u000a      services; 2) provided evidence\u000a      of the effectiveness of Early Supported Discharge and other models of\u000a      post-stroke care;\u000a      3) measured the quality and cost-effectiveness of care; and 4) explored\u000a      patient and carer\u000a      perspectives of need and outcome and developed a framework for\u000a      patient\/carer engagement in\u000a      stroke research and service development in the UK and Europe.\u000a    King's research provided epidemiological estimates of the needs for\u000a        stroke care\u000a      From its first key study (Stewart\u000a        et al., 1999), the South London Stroke Register has continued to\u000a      report changing patterns in stroke incidence since 1995, with a focus on\u000a      ethnic variations in risk\u000a      (Heuschmann et al.,\u000a        2008). Our research showed that stroke risk and stroke sub-types\u000a      vary\u000a      substantially between ethnic groups, with a large proportion of strokes\u000a      occurring in people with\u000a      untreated risk factors including hypertension with limited\u000a      improvement in detecting these risk\u000a      factors over time (Heuschmann\u000a        et al., 2008). We have used Register data to show that 20-30% of\u000a      survivors have a poor range of functional outcomes (e.g. walking\u000a      ability) up to ten years after\u000a      stroke (Wolfe et al.\u000a        2011), over half of all stroke patients have depression (Ayerbe et al., 2011),\u000aand stroke has a substantial long-term impact through cognitive impairment\u000a      (Douiri et al., 2013).\u000aWe and other research groups have used our epidemiological data to quantify\u000a      risk of stroke and\u000a      needs for long term care, as well as to develop interventions to reduce\u000a      the significantly poor\u000a      outcomes of stroke survivors.\u000a    King's research provided evidence of the effectiveness of Early\u000a        Supported Discharge\u000a      The South London Stroke Register team conducted the first and largest\u000a      randomised trial to assess\u000a      the clinical effectiveness of an Early Supported Discharge (ESD) policy (Rudd et al., 1997).\u000a      This\u000a      study provided evidence that outcomes following ESD were comparable to\u000a      conventional hospital\u000a      and community care, while the length of hospital stay was substantially\u000a      reduced. King's contributed\u000a      data and co-authored a meta-analysis that pooled data on the effectiveness\u000a      of ESD internationally\u000a      (Langhorne et al.,\u000a        2005), showing that appropriately resourced ESD services, provided\u000a      for selected\u000a      groups of stroke patients, can reduce long-term dependency and admission\u000a      to institutional care as\u000a      well as shortening hospital stays. Subsequently, the King's group has\u000a      reported on the cost-\u000a      effectiveness of ESD (Saka\u000a        et al., 2009).\u000a    King's researchers led and co-ordinated Europe-wide research on stroke\u000a      The team has co-ordinated a programme of collaborative research across the\u000a      European Union with\u000a      a focus on explaining variations in incidence (Heuchmann\u000a        et al. 2009), quality and costs of stroke\u000a      care in Europe (Grieve\u000a        et al, 2001) and outcomes (Heuschmann\u000a        et al., 2011). These studies\u000a      highlighted the high costs and poor outcomes associated with acute stroke\u000a      care in the UK,\u000a      contributing to making the case for more efficient service models that\u000a      provide higher quality care.\u000a      They also showed wide variations in quality of stroke care and\u000a      implementation of evidence-based\u000a      practice. The studies were the catalyst for research registers being\u000a      established in other European\u000a      centres which have enabled on-going comparative research to improve the\u000a      quality of stoke care.\u000a    King's researchers engaged with patients and families to inform stroke\u000a        research\u000a      The King's stroke research programme is informed by an active Stroke\u000a      Patient and Family Group,\u000a      established since 2005, with over 20 people participating in 6 research\u000a      meetings a year, at which\u000a      research priorities are identified and research methods refined. The group\u000a      contributed to the\u000a      development of a national survey of long term need that has informed the\u000a      Stroke Association's\u000a      policy on longer term care (McKevitt\u000a        et al., 2011). The group also produces a research newsletter\u000a      sent to 1,600 Stroke Register patients twice a year. It has contributed to\u000a      the national Stroke\u000a      Research Network strategy for public and patient involvement (PPI) in\u000a      research and service\u000a      development and to the European developments in PPI. The group is linked\u000a      to a social science\u000a      programme embedded within the Stroke Register; our European Programme has\u000a      also focused on\u000a      patient and public engagement well as facilitating patients and carers\u000a      involvement in designing\u000a      studies and tools for research and the dissemination of results.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41451","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3562981","Name":"Cuba"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"3932488","Name":"Peru"},{"GeoNamesId":"3703430","Name":"Panama"},{"GeoNamesId":"3686110","Name":"Colombia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3895114","Name":"Chile"},{"GeoNamesId":"1562822","Name":"Vietnam"},{"GeoNamesId":"2921044","Name":"Germany"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"3617476","Name":"Nicaragua"},{"GeoNamesId":"3489940","Name":"Jamaica"},{"GeoNamesId":"1168579","Name":"Pakistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"3996063","Name":"Mexico"},{"GeoNamesId":"3865483","Name":"Argentina"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"3585968","Name":"El Salvador"},{"GeoNamesId":"3625428","Name":"Venezuela"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Since Gilbert joined LSHTM in 2002 she has presented research findings\u000a      extensively which has led to greater awareness of the public health\u000a      problem of ROP. Dissemination has been through workshops attended by\u000a      ophthalmologists, neonatologists and neonatal nurses: 19 workshops in\u000a      Latin America (Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Cuba, Venezuela, Panama and\u000a      Peru), and 3 in Eastern Europe. Other facilitators are now taking over\u000a      this role to increase the reach. Presentations have been made since 2008\u000a      to Ministries of Health (Peru, Brazil, Jamaica), at two World ROP\u000a      Congresses (India 2009; China 2012), to NGOs who support prevention of\u000a      blindness (Sightsavers; ORBIS International; Standard Chartered Bank's\u000a      Seeing is Believing programme) and at numerous international, regional and\u000a      national meetings, conferences and seminars. Research findings have been\u000a      summarised in five textbooks (13 chapters, including updates in new\u000a      editions), one of which, The Epidemiology of Eye Disease, is the\u000a      standard textbook for several postgraduate training courses.5.1\u000a    The educational package developed for the Rio study was made available in\u000a      2013 as an online course (at http:\/\/neonatal.estacaodigitalsaude.org.br\/aia\/)\u000a      and over 4,500 professionals have registered.\u000a    Greater awareness that ROP is a major avoidable cause of blindness in\u000a      children has had the following impact:\u000a    \u000a      ROP continues to be recognised as a major cause of avoidable blindness\u000a        by VISION 2020: The Right to Sight, which is the 20-year global\u000a        initiative of WHO and the International Agency for the Prevention of\u000a        Blindness (IAPB). The latter is an umbrella organisation of all the\u000a        organisations involved in prevention of blindness including NGOs,\u000a        professional bodies, service providers, the corporate sector and\u000a        university departments. IAPB currently has 155 members.\u000a      In 2009 the control of blindness due to ROP was prioritised within the\u000a        Pan American Health Organization's prevention of blindness policy for\u000a        Latin America5.2 and the Caribbean in 2010.5.3,5.4,5.5\u000a\u000a      ROP is a priority in the Chinese National Plan for the Prevention and\u000a        Treatment of Blindness (2012-2015).\u000a      In 2008, neonatologists from 8 countries, ophthalmologists from 12\u000a        countries and neonatal nurses from 6 countries in Latin America met in\u000a        Panama to develop regional guidelines for ROP programmes, which have\u000a        since been published, referencing the applicant's research.5.6\u000a        These guidelines are being updated and modified by many other countries\u000a        in the region (e.g. Venezuela, Nicaragua). Guidelines are being drawn up\u000a        in India.\u000a      In Peru (2010),5.7 Mexico (2013),5.8 Argentina,\u000a        Chile, Colombia and El Salvador, legislation has been passed making eye\u000a        examination of preterm infants mandatory.\u000a      Ministries of Health in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador,\u000a        Mexico and Peru have issued resolutions recommending eye examination of\u000a        all preterm births, and in Rio de Janeiro programmes are fully\u000a        integrated within state and municipal health systems.\u000a      The Pan American Ophthalmology Society has established an ROP Society.\u000a      There has been increased support for the control of ROP in Latin\u000a        America and other countries (e.g. Pakistan, India, China, Vietnam) from\u000a        NGOs: ORBIS international (USA),5.9 CBM, (Germany), Seeing is\u000a        Believing (UK), the Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust (UK), Fred\u000a        Hollows Foundation (Australia). UNICEF has supported initiatives for\u000a        prevention in Argentina and is supporting initiatives in India.\u000a    \u000a    All these factors have led to rapid expansion of ROP programmes in many\u000a      countries in Latin and Central America, and in Asia. For example, in Rio\u000a      de Janeiro, Brazil, only 40% of preterm infants were admitted to neonatal\u000a      units with a screening programme in 2002, but this has increased so that\u000a      most government units now have programmes. Similar expansion has occurred\u000a      in other major cities in Brazil. Legislation in Peru has had a dramatic\u000a      impact, building consensus and leading to expansion of programmes in Lima\u000a      and many other cities across the country.\u000a    Treatment at a critical stage in the natural history of ROP is highly\u000a      effective at preventing blindness. In the screening programme in Rio de\u000a      Janeiro 1,444 infants most at risk of ROP were examined and 118 were\u000a      treated. The disease regressed completely in all but 5 infants. Without\u000a      treatment at least a quarter would have become blind. Data from Argentina\u000a      suggests that there has been a dramatic reduction in blindness from ROP,\u000a      with far fewer children being admitted to schools for the blind than 10\u000a      years ago, when almost 40% of blindness was due to ROP.5.10\u000a      Extrapolating these findings across Latin America and other low- and\u000a      middle-income countries means that many thousands of infants are having\u000a      their sight preserved.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Professor Gilbert's research identified retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)\u000a      to be a major cause of blindness in children in middle-income countries\u000a      and cities in Asia, and delineated those infants most at risk. Since\u000a      Gilbert joined LSHTM in 2002, her research and advocacy have led to ROP\u000a      being prioritised for control by the Pan American Health Organization,\u000a      with regional guidelines developed for Latin America, and national\u000a      guidelines in many middle-income counties. Programmes for control are\u000a      expanding and improving. Six Latin American countries have made eye\u000a      examination mandatory. Although difficult to quantify, these initiatives\u000a      are preserving the sight of many thousands of infants.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Health","Institution":"\u000a    London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine (LSHTM)\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine","InstitutionName":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007771}],"Panel":"A         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"3936456","Name":"Lima"},{"GeoNamesId":"3936456","Name":"Lima Peru"},{"GeoNamesId":"3451190","Name":"Rio de Janeiro"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a3.1 Gilbert, C, Fielder, A, Gordillo, L, Quinn, G, Semiglia, R, Visintin,\u000a      P and Zin, A, on behalf of the International NO-ROP Group (2005)\u000a      Characteristics of infants with severe retinopathy of prematurity in\u000a      countries with low, moderate, and high levels of development: implications\u000a      for screening programs, Pediatrics, 115(5): e518-e525, doi:\u000a      10.1542\/peds.2004-1180.

Initial research\u000a      entailed examining children in schools for the blind in Latin America,\u000a      Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia. Research published in 1997 demonstrated\u000a      for the first time that ROP was as an important cause of avoidable\u000a      blindness in children in middle-income countries.\u000a    In June 2002, Gilbert moved to LSHTM as Senior Lecturer in International\u000a      Eye Health. Population- based studies undertaken in a number of countries\u000a      (e.g. Vietnam and Bangladesh) showed the situation to be dynamic, with\u000a      some causes of blindness declining in importance while ROP was increasing\u000a      in the middle-income countries of Latin America and Eastern Europe, and in\u000a      the emerging economics of China, India and Vietnam.3.1\u000a    A multi-country study led by Gilbert clearly demonstrated that the\u000a      population of infants at risk of severe ROP varies by level of\u000a      development,3.2 and more detailed studies in South Africa3.3\u000a      and Brazil3.4 identified weaknesses in neonatal service\u000a      delivery. The large, prospective study in seven neonatal units in Rio de\u000a      Janeiro, Brazil3.4 had several purposes. An initial situation\u000a      analysis of the health system highlighted limitations in human resources,\u000a      technology and equipment, leadership and governance, and information\u000a      management. Most of the nursing was provided by nurse assistants who had\u000a      received no formal training. A further purpose was to determine which\u000a      babies were at risk of ROP, to inform screening criteria. Findings\u000a      supported the earlier work by Gilbert that bigger, more mature infants\u000a      develop severe ROP, which has important implications for screening\u000a      criteria. Researchers also explored the additional workload if wider\u000a      screening criteria were used. A case control study was nested within this\u000a      study, showing for the first time that neonatal units were an independent\u000a      risk factor. This supported the notion that ROP is a reflection of the\u000a      overall level of neonatal care and that improvement in many aspects of the\u000a      health system are needed to prevent ROP.\u000a    A further study in Rio,3.5 with a before and after design,\u000a      assessed whether an educational package for nurses, strengthening\u000a      information systems and building the capacity of nurse tutors would reduce\u000a      mortality and ROP. The results showed that `healthy survival' (i.e.\u000a      without ROP) was declining in the pre-intervention year, and that the\u000a      downward trend reversed in the post- intervention year. Unfortunately, the\u000a      change in trend was not statistically significant. However, a study in\u000a      Argentina in 20123.6 showed that better control of oxygen\u000a      reduced the risk of severe ROP.\u000a    A situation analysis of 32 neonatal units in five states in Mexico\u000a      highlighted limitations in service delivery, lack of awareness among\u000a      nurses of risk factors for ROP and poor nursing practices. Only 25% of\u000a      infants at risk of ROP were in units with an ROP programme of adequate\u000a      quality.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41452","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2434508","Name":"Chad"},{"GeoNamesId":"2363686","Name":"Togo"},{"GeoNamesId":"2453866","Name":"Mali"},{"GeoNamesId":"2245662","Name":"Senegal"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Following encouraging results of early trials of SMC, a meeting was held\u000a      in Dakar, Senegal, in October 2008 to discuss what further research\u000a      questions needed to be addressed before SMC could be considered as a\u000a      potential control tool. An important feature of this meeting was the\u000a      attendance of malaria control managers and policy-makers as well as\u000a      researchers. Areas identified for further research included drug safety,\u000a      delivery of SMC to older children and the added benefit of SMC to children\u000a      using an ITN. These were addressed subsequently in studies described\u000a      above.\u000a    In July 2010, WHO's Global Malaria Programme convened an informal\u000a      consultation to determine if there was sufficient evidence for a formal\u000a      review of SMC. The committee agreed but requested more information on cost\u000a      effectiveness, and on the geographical areas where SMC would be most\u000a      appropriate. Following provision of this information, the SMC dossier\u000a      compiled by LSHTM staff,5.1,5.2 was reviewed by WHO's Technical\u000a      Expert Group (TEG) on malaria treatment and prophylaxis.5.3\u000a      Professor D Schellenberg (LSHTM since 2003) was a co-opted member of the\u000a      TEG. On the basis of the dossier, the TEG recommended implementation of\u000a      SMC with SP+AQ in areas of the Sahel with seasonal transmission of malaria\u000a      but requested further information on the duration of protection provided\u000a      by each cycle, on the optimal dosing by age and on the level of malaria\u000a      transmission at which SMC would no longer be cost effective. This\u000a      information was generated by an SMC working group (including LSHTM staff\u000a      Cairns, Greenwood, Milligan) and provided to WHO. A GRADES assessment was\u000a      prepared.5.4 In March 2012, the report of the TEG was presented\u000a      to the recently established WHO Malaria Policy Advisory Committee (MPAC);\u000a      Greenwood is a member. The committee endorsed the TEG recommendations and\u000a      made a formal recommendation, endorsed by the Director General, that\u000a      children living in areas of the Sahel and sub-Sahel with highly seasonal\u000a      malaria transmission should receive SMC with SP+AQ for up to four months\u000a      of the year.5.5\u000a    The areas currently targeted for SMC have about 22m children under 5\u000a      among whom there are approximately 20m cases and 90,000 deaths annually\u000a      from malaria. Thus, there is a potential for SMC to prevent millions of\u000a      cases of malaria and tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths each year.\u000a      The speed at which SMC is implemented in the target areas, and hence its\u000a      impact, will depend upon local political commitment and the availability\u000a      of funds to purchase and distribute antimalarials, but the process has\u000a      already commenced. SMC implementation started in two countries in July\u000a      2012, and by December an implementation guide on SMC had been published by\u000a      WHO, and a total of 10 countries had plans for SMC.5.6 In 2012,\u000a      SMC was implemented by MSF in Koutiala district in southern Mali and in\u000a      two areas of Mo&#239;ssala district, in Chad. In Mali, malaria cases fell by\u000a      65% in the week following the first monthly cycle of SMC treatment and\u000a      malaria- associated hospitalisations by 70%.5.7 The Senegalese\u000a      Ministry of Health has secured finance to implement SMC in five regions\u000a      starting in 2013 and SMC will be implemented in Northern Togo starting in\u000a      2013. With support from the Medicines from Malaria Venture (MMV), steps\u000a      are being taken to obtain SP+AQ packages for SMC as cheaply as possible\u000a      from a manufacturer in China.\u000a    Several factors have contributed to the rapid adoption of SMC. Firstly,\u000a      LSHTM research has been conducted in close partnership with scientists in\u000a      the endemic countries where SMC might be implemented. Secondly, LSHTM\u000a      researchers and their partners kept in close contact with policy-makers in\u000a      WHO and with national Ministries of Health from early in the development\u000a      process. Thirdly, the implementation guide, based on experience in Senegal\u000a      (co-authors included LSHTM staff Milligan, Ciss&#233;, Diallo), was published\u000a      by WHO quickly,5.8 and meetings coordinated jointly by LSHTM\u000a      (Milligan) and the Universite Chiekh Anta Diop (Senegal), and subsequently\u000a      by WHO, were held5.6 with national malaria control programme\u000a      managers to help develop implementation plans.\u000a    The way in which SMC has progressed rapidly from pilot research studies\u000a      to early implementation is widely regarded as a model of how this process\u000a      should be conducted. Staff from LSHTM, working together with their\u000a      partners in Africa, have played a key role in all stages of this process.5.9,5.10\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research in West Africa by LSHTM and partners has shown that monthly\u000a      treatment with effective antimalarial drugs during the rainy season\u000a      provides children with a very high degree of personal protection against\u000a      malaria, can be delivered on a large scale by community health workers at\u000a      moderate cost, and with no serious side-effects.

However, this approach to malaria control\u000a      was not pursued due to increasing use of insecticide treated bednets\u000a      (ITNs) and concerns over safety and costs.\u000a    Interest in chemoprevention of malaria in children revived when, in 2002,\u000a      a LSHTM study with partners in Senegal, planned by Greenwood (Professor of\u000a      Clinical Tropical Medicine at LSHTM since 1996) and coordinated by Ciss&#233;\u000a      (then LSHTM PhD student), showed that administration of\u000a      sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) plus one dose of artesunate monthly for\u000a      three months to children under 5 reduced the incidence of malaria over\u000a      three months by 86%.3.1 The proportion of parasites with\u000a      genotypes associated with resistance to SP at the end of the malaria\u000a      transmission season was higher in children who had received the\u000a      intervention than in the controls, but the number of children carrying\u000a      resistant parasites was less in the intervention group.3.2\u000a      Several drug regimens for SMC were then considered.3.3 Two\u000a      long-acting drug combinations (SP combined with amodiaquine (AQ) or\u000a      piperaquine) were more effective than artemisinin-containing combinations,\u000a      giving a high degree of protection for about four weeks. Because both SP\u000a      and AQ retain efficacy in areas of the Sahel where SMC has a role, the\u000a      SP+AQ combination was chosen for further studies. Initial trials of SMC\u000a      had been conducted in communities with low use of ITNs. To determine\u000a      whether SMC would give any added benefit in populations with high ITN\u000a      coverage, trials planned by Greenwood and coordinated by Diallo (then\u000a      Research Fellow at LSHTM) were conducted simultaneously with partners in\u000a      Burkina Faso and Mali in 2009, in children who were all provided with an\u000a      ITN. A 77% reduction in the incidence of uncomplicated malaria was\u000a      observed in children who received SMC with the SP+AQ combination, with\u000a      similar protection being seen against severe malaria. There was no\u000a      evidence of substantial increase in risk of malaria in the first year\u000a      after the intervention in children who received SMC with SP+AQ.3.2,3.3\u000a    Important policy questions that remained following these trials concerned\u000a      the safety of SMC and the practicality and cost of administering SMC to\u000a      children in rural areas. These issues have been investigated with partners\u000a      in Senegal by Milligan (Reader in Epidemiology and Medical Statistics,\u000a      LSHTM staff since 2004 as Reader), Ciss&#233; (LSHTM staff since 2008 as\u000a      Clinical Lecturer) and colleagues. Their studies have shown that SMC with\u000a      SP+AQ delivered by community health workers coordinated by the district\u000a      health team is safe, acceptable to the community, can achieve high\u000a      coverage and is highly cost effective (papers in preparation). To\u000a      determine the geographical regions where SMC might be an appropriate\u000a      malaria intervention, research conducted by Cairns (Research Fellow, now\u000a      Lecturer, LSHTM staff since 2010) and colleagues defined the areas of\u000a      Africa where malaria is highly seasonal and where incidence is high enough\u000a      to warrant implementation of SMC.3.4\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41454","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"226074","Name":"Uganda"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    LSHTM's research into the effects of male circumcision as a strategy for\u000a      HIV prevention, as well as the prevention of other STIs, has been widely\u000a      used to underpin international policy recommendations on male\u000a      circumcision, in particular for sub-Saharan Africa. Its key contribution\u000a      was to use systematic reviews, meta-analyses and modelling to draw clear\u000a      conclusions from a wide body of research.\u000a    In March 2007, WHO\/UNAIDS convened a pivotal meeting bringing together\u000a      stakeholders, policy- makers and researchers. Weiss and Hayes presented a\u000a      meta-analysis of the three trials, providing a point estimate that\u000a      underscored the strength of the evidence and underpinned the document\u000a      issued by the meeting recommending male circumcision as an HIV prevention\u000a      strategy in combination with other methods like condom promotion.5.1\u000a      This key document laid the foundations for subsequent guidelines and\u000a      policy statements published after January 2008 and may be found\u000a      at www.malecircumcision.org.\u000a    In 2008, WHO\/UNAIDS' operational guidance for countries wishing to scale\u000a      up male circumcision for HIV prevention cited the research conducted by\u000a      Weiss and colleagues as evidence of a strong link between male\u000a      circumcision and reduced HIV prevalence, as well as evidence of male\u000a      circumcision providing protection against ulcerative STIs and penile\u000a      cancer.5.2 In the same year, the US Centers for Disease Control\u000a      and Prevention (CDC) made reference to the research in a paper laying out\u000a      the implications of the findings on male circumcision for the USA.5.3\u000a      In August 2012, the American Academy of Pediatrics published new\u000a      guidelines for infant male circumcision in the US (see http:\/\/pediatrics.aappublications.org\/content\/early\/2012\/08\/22\/peds.2012-1990),\u000a      which also cited the underpinning research.\u000a    In June 2009, Weiss chaired the first session of an international\u000a      consultation convened by WHO and UNAIDS on male circumcision and HIV\u000a      prevention, which focused on how to scale up male circumcision services in\u000a      sub-Saharan Africa following the March 2007 WHO\/UNAIDS recommendation.5.4\u000a    The UNAIDS\/WHO\/SACEMA expert group (including White and Weiss) on\u000a      modelling the impact and cost of male circumcision for HIV prevention\u000a      published a consensus statement aimed at policy-makers in September 2009,\u000a      building on earlier research including that by White and colleagues.3.5\u000a      This work helped estimate the number of circumcisions needed for maximum\u000a      impact, and the costs of scale-up.5.5 The paper cites our work,3.2,\u000a        3,3. 3.4, 3.5 and Hankins and colleagues show that an investment\u000a      of US$1.5bn between 2011 and 2015 could achieve 80% coverage in 13\u000a      priority countries in southern and eastern Africa and would avert 3.4m new\u000a      HIV infections, resulting in net savings of US$16.5bn. In November 2011,\u000a      WHO\/UNAIDS published a joint strategic five- year action framework to\u000a      accelerate the scale-up of voluntary medical male circumcision for HIV\u000a      prevention in eastern and southern Africa.5.6 Intended for use\u000a      by country, regional and global stakeholders, this highlights the\u000a      consensus modelling paper3.5 demonstrating the cost\u000a      effectiveness of medical male circumcision. The Framework set a goal of\u000a      circumcising 80% of males (20m circumcisions) in 14 priority countries by\u000a      2015, and an additional 8.4m circumcisions between 2016 and 2025.5.6\u000a      The most recent data available from WHO is to the end of 2011, by which\u000a      time an estimated 1.4m male circumcisions had been conducted since the\u000a      beginning of 2008 in the priority countries.5.7\u000a    As a direct result of her research expertise, Weiss serves on the WHO\u000a      Technical Advisory Group on Innovations In Male Circumcision. Following a\u000a      meeting in January 2012, in which Weiss participated, the Group\u000a      recommended the use of an elastic ring-controlled radial compression\u000a      device for adult male circumcision in preference to traditional surgery\u000a      (March 2012).5.8\u000a    Also as a direct result of her research, Weiss has frequently attended\u000a      other WHO\/UNAIDS meetings to present research findings and discuss policy\u000a      issues. She and members of LSHTM were commissioned by WHO to conduct\u000a      several further systematic reviews as input to their policy deliberations\u000a      (e.g. on male circumcision and the risk of HIV infection in women, 2009),5.9\u000a      presented at a meeting on implications of the research findings for women\u000a      in Nairobi in June 2008; and provided model projections on combining\u000a      microbiocide and male circumcision interventions in rural Uganda (2011).5.10\u000a    Weiss has raised the profile of male circumcision for HIV prevention in\u000a      public discourse in the UK through appearances in the media. In August\u000a      2008, she discussed the impact of male circumcision on their female\u000a      partners on Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4.

Discovering ways to prevent HIV\u000a      acquisition and transmission therefore remains a primary concern\u000a      worldwide.\u000a    In 1997, researchers from LSHTM &#8212; including Helen Weiss, Reader in\u000a      Epidemiology and International Health (joined LSHTM in 1997, then\u000a      Lecturer), and Richard Hayes, Professor of Epidemiology and International\u000a      Health (joined LSHTM in 1978, then Research Fellow) &#8212; joined the Study\u000a      Group on Heterogeneity of HIV Epidemics in African Cities. The group\u000a      carried out a series of large, population-based cross-sectional surveys in\u000a      four African cities, investigating why HIV had spread at very different\u000a      rates in East and West Africa and reached very different prevalence in the\u000a      two regions. The results showed that two biological variables &#8212; herpes\u000a      simplex virus type 2 (HSV- 2) and male circumcision &#8212; were independent\u000a      individual-level risk factors for HIV and differed between low and high\u000a      HIV prevalence areas.3.1\u000a    Weiss and Hayes subsequently carried out a systematic literature review\u000a      of studies published up to April 1999 that included circumcision as a risk\u000a      factor for HIV-1 infection in males in sub-Saharan Africa, and found\u000a      strong consistent evidence that circumcised men were at lower risk of HIV.3.2\u000a      Weiss presented the findings at an informal WHO consultation in 2000 in\u000a      Durban, and an updated meta-analysis at USAID in 2002, and helped provide\u000a      the justification for three subsequent randomised controlled trials (RCTs)\u000a      started in 2002\/2003 by French and US research teams. These trials showed\u000a      conclusively that male circumcision reduces the risk of HIV acquisition by\u000a      between 48 and 60%.3.3\u000a    LSHTM researchers then went on to examine whether this protective effect\u000a      of circumcision could be partly due to its protective effect against other\u000a      STIs, especially those causing ulcers. They conducted the first systematic\u000a      review and meta-analysis of circumcision and ulcerative STIs,3.4\u000a      quantifying the effect of male circumcision on syphilis, chancroid and\u000a      HSV-2. Published in 2006, the findings strongly indicated that circumcised\u000a      men are at lower risk of chancroid and syphilis. In other studies, Weiss\u000a      and colleagues reviewed the evidence of an association between male\u000a      circumcision and penile cancer (2011), and circumcision and human\u000a      papillomavirus (HPV) infection (2011), showing that both conditions could\u000a      be reduced by the expansion of circumcision services.\u000a    In 2008, Weiss and Richard White (Reader in Infectious Disease Modelling,\u000a      joined LSHTM 1998, then Research Assistant) participated in an Expert\u000a      Group formed by UNAIDS, the WHO and the South African Centre for\u000a      Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis (SACEMA), to model the likely\u000a      population-level impact of male circumcision on the HIV epidemic.3.5\u000a      The resulting modelling statement (2009), itself building on earlier\u000a      research by White and colleagues,3.6 predicted that\u000a      circumcision is capable of yielding large benefits among heterosexual men\u000a      in low-circumcision, high-HIV prevalence settings, with one HIV infection\u000a      being averted for every 5 to 15 male circumcisions performed.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41455","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2434508","Name":"Chad"},{"GeoNamesId":"3355338","Name":"Namibia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"2275384","Name":"Liberia"},{"GeoNamesId":"239880","Name":"Central African Republic"},{"GeoNamesId":"2413451","Name":"Gambia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2440476","Name":"Niger"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Research carried out by LSHTM's Andrew Hall in collaboration with the\u000a      GHIS team has been\u000a      central to informing WHO's current recommendations on controlling the\u000a      hepatitis B virus, a disease\u000a      estimated to have infected 2bn people worldwide, through an infant\u000a      vaccination programme.\u000a      Crucially WHO guidelines explicitly state that there is no evidence to\u000a      support the need for a booster\u000a      dose following three doses of hepatitis B vaccine in infancy, a\u000a      recommendation drawn directly from\u000a      the conclusions of Hall's body of research that the vaccine confers\u000a      adequate protection up to 15\u000a      years of age - since extended to 22 years.\u000a    The WHO position paper on hepatitis B vaccine,5.1 published in\u000a      2009 and replacing previous\u000a      guidelines issued in 2004, cites six papers co-authored by Hall between\u000a      1995 and 2008.

The WHO paper noted that 2006 data showed the first dose was\u000a      administered within 24\u000a      hours of birth in only 27 per cent of cases.\u000a    As of 2008, 177 countries had incorporated a hepatitis B vaccine into\u000a      their routine national EPI\u000a      programmes as a result of the success of the Gambia study.5.2\u000a      During the impact period, at least\u000a      five further countries in the African WHO region have added infant\u000a      hepatitis B vaccination to their\u000a      EPI, providing virtually universal coverage in the African region. These\u000a      countries are Liberia, Niger,\u000a      Central African Republic, Chad and Namibia. In 2012, given numbers of\u000a      babies born in these\u000a      countries and hepatitis B third dose coverage from the most recent\u000a      coverage surveys (for Liberia,\u000a      Central African Republic, Chad), and from official reports (for Niger and\u000a      Namibia),5.3 this means\u000a      that approximately an additional 1.2m infants per year are being protected\u000a      against developing liver\u000a      cancer later in life in these predominantly highly disadvantaged countries\u000a      which introduced the\u000a      vaccine during the impact period. The majority of remaining countries\u000a      globally not to have\u000a      introduced universal vaccination are in north-west Europe.\u000a    A series of follow-up studies by Hall into vaccine efficacy provided the\u000a      evidence underlying the\u000a      WHO 2009 recommendation that no booster programme for the hepatitis B\u000a      vaccine is required if\u000a      the vaccine is correctly administered at birth. The consequences of adding\u000a      a booster programme\u000a      on the budget of Ministries of Health in the less developed world would\u000a      have been significant. In\u000a      order to formulate the 2009 position paper, WHO's Strategic Advisory Group\u000a      of Experts (SAGE) on\u000a      immunisation, the principal advisory group to WHO for vaccines and\u000a      immunisation, assessed the\u000a      available scientific evidence to review the need for booster doses of the\u000a      vaccine.5.4,5.5 Hall was a\u000a      member of the SAGE sub-committee that used the GRADE system of assessing\u000a      evidence.5.6 The\u000a      Gambia study was judged the only `high-quality' study and therefore played\u000a      a critical role in the\u000a      final formulation of the booster policy recommendation.\u000a    Professor Hall was knighted in the Queen's Birthday Honours for 2013 for\u000a      services to public health.\u000a      His citation notes his seminal contribution to hepatitis B vaccination:\u000a      `He is leading the single most\u000a      important validation of the hepatitis B vaccine outside the Far East, in\u000a      which over 125,000 infants\u000a      in The Gambia have been enrolled.

The\u000a      GHIS is a collaboration\u000a      between WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), the\u000a      Gambian government\u000a      and the Medical Research Council Unit The Gambia.\u000a    As an IARC employee, Andrew Hall, Professor of Epidemiology, was\u000a      principal investigator on the\u000a      project at its inception before moving to LSHTM in 1990 (then Senior\u000a      Lecturer). Since 1993, Hall\u000a      has published more than 20 papers in leading journals, analysing the\u000a      efficacy of the vaccination\u000a      programme as the trial cohorts grow older.\u000a    Around 126,000 children were recruited to the study and, in the first\u000a      phase from 1986 to 1990, half\u000a      were randomised to receive hepatitis vaccination at birth, 2, 4 and 9\u000a      months of age in addition to\u000a      vaccines delivered under the Gambian Expanded Programme on Immunisation\u000a      (EPI). In Phase II\u000a      (1991-1997), the efficacy of the vaccine was evaluated and Phase III\u000a      (1998-present) continues to\u000a      follow up the children in the trial. A national cancer register was set up\u000a      in 1986 and continues to be\u000a      updated, enabling linkages to be drawn between cancer cases and\u000a      vaccination.\u000a    Hall was co-author of a paper published in The Lancet in 19933.1\u000a      that demonstrated the protection\u000a      conferred by the hepatitis B vaccine. Through examining 3- and 4-year-old\u000a      children who had\u000a      received the vaccine in infancy, the paper showed it to be 84% effective\u000a      against infection and 94%\u000a      effective against chronic carriage. Hall was lead author on a paper that\u000a      showed universal hepatitis\u000a      B immunisation was cost effective,3.2 offering a replicable\u000a      model for other African countries.\u000a    Hall was subsequently involved in a number of subgroup studies to\u000a      measure, at regular intervals in\u000a      childhood and adolescence, immune response and infections, generating data\u000a      on antibody decay\u000a      and vaccine efficacy against hepatitis B infection.3.3 Funded\u000a      by the IARC and the Italian and\u000a      Swedish governments, the ultimate aim was to determine whether there was a\u000a      need to implement\u000a      a hepatitis B booster programme. A paper in Vaccine in 1999\u000a      demonstrated vaccine efficacy at the\u000a      age of 9,3.4 supporting WHO recommendations to introduce\u000a      hepatitis B vaccination into the EPI\u000a      across Africa.\u000a    Research published in 2007 demonstrated, through serological assessments\u000a      of vaccines aged up\u000a      to 15, that hepatitis B vaccination early in life confers long-lasting\u000a      protection against carriage of the\u000a      virus despite decreasing antibody levels, highlighting the need for\u000a      further research to evaluate the\u000a      necessity of a booster.3.5 Subsequent studies found that good\u000a      levels of protection existed in 18-and\u000a      22-year-olds following vaccination in infancy, leading to the conclusion\u000a      that a costly booster\u000a      programme was not required.3.6\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41456","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2328926","Name":"Nigeria"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2275384","Name":"Liberia"},{"GeoNamesId":"163843","Name":"Syria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2309096","Name":"Equatorial Guinea"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"337996","Name":"Ethiopia"},{"GeoNamesId":"248816","Name":"Jordan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"},{"GeoNamesId":"3703430","Name":"Panama"},{"GeoNamesId":"272103","Name":"Lebanon"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    LSHTM's research has played a key role in promoting new approaches to\u000d\u000a      mental health care and\u000d\u000a      influencing policy-makers and donors, in the following ways.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Informing global and national policies for improving access to mental\u000d\u000a        disorders.

Roberts began communications with\u000d\u000a      the MOD in 2006 after discovering that British soldiers in Afghanistan and\u000d\u000a      Iraq were being treated with an experimental blood-clotting drug &#8212;\u000d\u000a      NovoSeven &#8212; that had not been fully tested. After the story broke in the\u000d\u000a      UK, Roberts alerted MOD officials to the potential of TXA. In March 2010,\u000d\u000a      the British Army incorporated TXA into combat care treatment protocols on\u000d\u000a      the basis of the results of the CRASH-2 trial. A subsequent news report on\u000d\u000a      British Forces News5.3 quoted the Surgeon-General as\u000d\u000a      saying that within weeks of the CRASH-2 trial results, they were using TXA\u000d\u000a      to treat wounded troops &#8212; the first time the drug had been used routinely\u000d\u000a      in trauma patients.\u000d\u000a    The US Army carried out its own analysis of the efficacy of TXA,5.4\u000d\u000a      reaching the same conclusions. US Army officials invited Roberts to\u000d\u000a      Washington in June 2011 to discuss the CRASH-2 trial and in the same month\u000d\u000a      announced TXA's inclusion in its treatment protocols.\u000d\u000a    In May 2011, the CRASH-2 trial won the Research Paper of the Year5.5\u000d\u000a      at the 2011 BMJ awards, raising the profile of TXA among doctors.\u000d\u000a      Two months later the Directors of Clinical Care for the UK ambulance\u000d\u000a      service agreed that TXA would be given to all adults and teenagers who\u000d\u000a      suffer major injury in the UK. At the same time, the Joint Royal Colleges\u000d\u000a      Ambulance Liaison Committee approved a pre-hospital guideline on the\u000d\u000a      administration of TXA and the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child\u000d\u000a      Health agreed to convene a meeting of its Medicines Committee to consider\u000d\u000a      TXA dosing requirements in paediatric trauma, with advice released in\u000d\u000a      November 2012.5.6\u000d\u000a    In January 2012, The Independent reported that TXA was to be\u000d\u000a      fast-tracked for use in the NHS, making it the first drug to be approved\u000d\u000a      under the UK government's new `medicines innovation scheme', designed to\u000d\u000a      speed up the adoption of promising medication. Ambulance crews in south-\u000d\u000a      west England had already been given access to TXA but the decision by the\u000d\u000a      Department of Health (DH) led to it being rolled out across the UK. Health\u000d\u000a      Secretary Andrew Lansley commented: `The successful use of this drug to\u000d\u000a      help some of our most seriously wounded troops in Afghanistan really shows\u000d\u000a      the wide potential it has for our civilian emergency services.'5.7\u000d\u000a    As TXA is a low-profit drug it misses out on large advertising budgets\u000d\u000a      but Roberts has led innovative campaigns to ensure more clinicians use\u000d\u000a      TXA. In 2011 he oversaw the production of an animated video featuring\u000d\u000a      cartoon character `Tranman'. Recorded in several languages, the cartoon is\u000d\u000a      designed to reach doctors in China, India, Brazil, Russia and Africa. The\u000d\u000a      video was published on YouTube and The Lancet websites, and the New\u000d\u000a        York Times5.8 covered the making of the cartoon as an\u000d\u000a      example of creative science communication.\u000d\u000a    The findings from the CRASH-2 trial resulted in follow-on funding\u000d\u000a      (announced in 2010; reported by BBC News)5.9 from the\u000d\u000a      DH and the Wellcome Trust to investigate whether TXA can help to save some\u000d\u000a      of the 100,000 lives lost every year when women bleed to death after\u000d\u000a      giving birth. The ongoing WOMAN trial, coordinated by LSHTM and involving\u000d\u000a      13 partners, attracted &#163;3.7m in funding. CRASH-3, to investigate TXA for\u000d\u000a      treatment of significant traumatic brain injury, has received &#163;400,000 for\u000d\u000a      the pilot phase.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research by LSHTM has alerted international health bodies, the UK and US\u000d\u000a      militaries, politicians and doctors around the world to a new trauma\u000d\u000a      treatment that could save over 100,000 lives each year.

Because\u000d\u000a      similar haemostatic mechanisms are activated in surgery and trauma,\u000d\u000a      researchers from LSHTM hypothesised that TXA might also reduce bleeding in\u000d\u000a      trauma patients, up to one third of whom die from acute haemorrhage.\u000d\u000a    A group of academics and doctors, led by Professor Ian Roberts (LSHTM\u000d\u000a      since 2001) and Senior Lecturer Haleema Shakur (LSHTM since 2002 then\u000d\u000a      Trial Manager), secured &#163;2.5m in funding from the National Institute of\u000d\u000a      Health Research in 2007 to carry out the CRASH-2 trial &#8212; a randomised\u000d\u000a      controlled trial of the effects of the early administration of TXA on\u000d\u000a      death, vascular occlusive events and blood transfusion.

The researchers found that\u000d\u000a      TXA reduced the chances of death from severe blood loss by one third, with\u000d\u000a      no side effects. The results were published in The Lancet3.1\u000d\u000a      in March 2010 (and subsequently republished in many languages), and the\u000d\u000a      academics recommended the inclusion of TXA on the WHO List of Essential\u000d\u000a      Medicines.

Violence, deprivation and exploitation are key\u000a      features of human trafficking.\u000a      The resulting damage to women's health and wellbeing is often profound and\u000a      enduring.\u000a    Prior to research led by Dr Cathy Zimmerman, Senior Lecturer working with\u000a      Charlotte Watts\u000a      (LSHTM since 2000, then Research Fellow), the health of trafficked persons\u000a      and their particular\u000a      medical needs were widely neglected within policy discussions and guidance\u000a      documents. Pre-2006\u000a      editions of the US State Department Trafficking in Persons Report,\u000a      the most comprehensive global\u000a      trafficking report, are a case in point: the focus of anti-trafficking\u000a      initiatives was immigration and law\u000a      enforcement.\u000a    As Zimmerman showed in the research on which this case study is based,\u000a      the trafficking of women\u000a      into forced sex work has serious implications for their physical, sexual\u000a      and, above all, mental\u000a      health.\u000a    Zimmerman initially led a two-year qualitative study on women's health\u000a      and trafficking in the EU in\u000a      2000-2003 with the aim of highlighting the health risks and consequences\u000a      of trafficking in women\u000a      and providing information on their health needs for service providers, law\u000a      enforcement officials and\u000a      policy-makers.\u000a    A second study, Stolen Smiles, carried out in 2003-2005, surveyed\u000a      207 women in seven European\u000a      cities who had either been trafficked into sex work or sexually abused as\u000a      domestic labourers.\u000a      Results of this study, the first quantitative survey of the physical and\u000a      mental health of trafficked\u000a      persons, were produced as a report by LSHTM and highlighted in a Lancet\u000a      editorial in 2006.The\u000a      study, funded by the European Commission and the International\u000a      Organization for Migration, was\u000a      the first to employ rigorous epidemiological methods to investigate the\u000a      physical, sexual and mental\u000a      health of trafficked women and adolescents.\u000a    The Stolen Smiles survey found that trafficked women's physical\u000a      and sexual health problems\u000a      include high levels of injury and sexually transmitted infections, for\u000a      which the women are often\u000a      unable to seek treatment.3.1 However, the most persistent\u000a      problems are related to mental health.3.2\u000a      Up to 14 days after entry into post-trafficking care, 58% of women showed\u000a      symptoms associated\u000a      with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Symptoms of depression and\u000a      anxiety were in the 90th\u000a      percentile compared to a general population of adult women who had not\u000a      been trafficked. For over\u000a      50% of trafficked women, these symptoms did not decrease significantly\u000a      even 90 days after\u000a      entering an assistance programme.\u000a    Based on this research, Zimmerman, collaborating with Amnesty UK,\u000a      recommended that the\u000a      `recovery and reflection' period &#8212; the period trafficked people are given\u000a      to decide on whether to\u000a      cooperate with any criminal investigation &#8212; should be extended to at least\u000a      90 days to ensure that\u000a      the women's health had improved sufficiently for them to be able to make\u000a      informed and thoughtful\u000a      choices.\u000a    Follow-on research, designed to strengthen the knowledge base related to\u000a      human trafficking and\u000a      health and further raise awareness, has provided a basis for conceptual\u000a      thinking about policy,\u000a      implementation and research,3.3 and undertaken a systematic\u000a      review of the prevalence and risk of\u000a      violence and the physical, mental, and sexual health problems associated\u000a      with human trafficking.3.4\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41460","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1668284","Name":"Taiwan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1643084","Name":"Indonesia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research described above has influenced both individual countries and\u000a      international organisations to modify their influenza preparedness\u000a      policies and plans. The following aspects are key.\u000a    Improving national pandemic planning and response capacities\u000a    Since 2008, research findings on existing plans for an influenza\u000a      pandemic, together with further capacity evaluations, have led some\u000a      governments in Europe and Southeast Asia to significantly alter their\u000a      influenza pandemic plans.\u000a    In the UK, for example, the published results on pandemic planning in\u000a      Europe led the government, through the Cabinet Office, to commission Coker\u000a      and Mounier-Jack to help develop cross-government strategy on human\u000a      pandemic and avian influenza.5.1 In addition, Mounier-Jack\u000a      became specialist adviser to the House of Lords inquiry into pandemic\u000a      preparedness in the UK in 2008, which stated: `we are enormously grateful\u000a      for her assistance'.5.2 During this inquiry she provided\u000a      insight and advice to scrutinise whether the response to the 2009 H1N1\u000a      pandemic was adequate.5.2 In 2011, she was also appointed\u000a      specialist adviser to a House of Commons inquiry reviewing scientific\u000a      advice and evidence in emergencies,5.3 and she contributed to\u000a      Dame Deirdre Hine's report on the H1N1 pandemic response.5.4\u000a      Specific recommendations to which she contributed included clarifying the\u000a      function and operation of the national flu line service and the need to\u000a      ensure adequate capacity for critical care, which was responded to by the\u000a      government.\u000a    An evaluation led by collaborators in the AsiaFluCap project revealed a\u000a      number of impacts in several Asian countries.5.5 Some of these\u000a      impacts occurred even before the outputs detailed in Section 3 had been\u000a      published, due to strong and ongoing engagement with policy-makers\u000a      throughout the programme of work. In Taiwan, supplies of the anti-viral\u000a      drug, Osetamivir, were redistributed to ensure more equitable coverage\u000a      across administrative areas.5.6 Policies in Taiwan were also\u000a      revised to improve strategies for risk communication,5.6 after\u000a      these were identified as a weakness by AsiaFluCap. In Indonesia, the\u000a      research led to a countrywide `Health Facility Framework Survey'\u000a      (`RIFASKES') by the National Institute for Health Research and Development\u000a      (NIHRD). This, modelled on work conducted through AsiaFluCap, was carried\u000a      out in 2011 to enumerate and map health care resources across the country\u000a      and is informing policy on the allocation of health care resources across\u000a      Indonesia.5.7 In Cambodia, policy-makers are drawing upon the\u000a      research to support decisions around investments for preparedness.5.8\u000a    Based on responses of policy-makers, the AsiaFluCap evaluation also\u000a      concluded that the project had `strengthened cooperation and information\u000a      exchange between national ministries and government institutions, national\u000a      communicable disease control institutions, policy-makers, district health\u000a      care administrations and hospital administrations'.5.5 This is\u000a      echoed by the former Director of the Taiwan CDC who writes: `I applaud\u000a      Professor Coker's coordination skills to bring so many countries with\u000a      various cultures together, which in fact has also resulted in an informal\u000a      yet useful network to fight future infectious diseases in the region.'5.6\u000a    An innovative software tool for influenza-related resource allocation\u000a      developed by Coker and colleagues on the basis of the research was\u000a      launched online in 2012 and allows policy-makers and other stakeholders to\u000a      estimate and display the availability, needs and gaps of 28 key health\u000a      care resources for a selected pandemic scenario in a country or region\u000a\u0009  (http:\/\/www.biomedcentral.com\/1471-2458\/12\/870).\u000a      The tool was considered among project partners, including several\u000a      policy-makers, to be very useful for informing policy decisions for\u000a      resource allocation, particularly at the national level and for major\u000a      hospitals.\u000a    Shaping global policy on influenza control\u000a    At the invitation of the UN System Coordinator for Influenza, Coker and\u000a      his team have contributed time and personnel to feed research findings\u000a      into the annual UN\/World Bank reports 2006-2010.

Professor Richard Coker (LSHTM since 2001, then Senior\u000a      Lecturer) has focused his research on preparedness for influenza\u000a      pandemics.\u000a    In 2005\/2006, Coker and Mounier-Jack (Lecturer, LSHTM since 2005, then\u000a      Research Fellow) developed an innovative framework to analyse national\u000a      strategic preparedness for an influenza pandemic, which was used to\u000a      evaluate plans produced by countries in regions across the world &#8212; for\u000a      example, Europe3.1 and Asia-Pacific.3.2 In 21\u000a      European countries they found that, although preparation was good in some\u000a      areas, maintenance of essential services, putting plans into action and\u000a      public health interventions were inadequate. Plans for the timely\u000a      distribution of available medical supplies were notably absent, and\u000a      substantial variations existed between countries.\u000a    The evaluations in other parts of the world showed that low-and\u000a      middle-income countries were much less well prepared than European\u000a      countries. It was clear that, in addition to evaluating national plans,\u000a      novel frameworks were needed to evaluate systematically, and identify\u000a      strategies for improving, the capacity of countries to implement their\u000a      plans. This was (and still is) of particular importance in Southeast Asia,\u000a      where conditions are fertile for the emergence of novel (and possibly\u000a      highly lethal) influenza viruses with pandemic potential, not least due to\u000a      the continued circulation of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1.\u000a    In 2007, Coker and country partners conducted a pilot project in Thailand\u000a      using three pandemic scenarios to determine resource needs, availability\u000a      and gaps.3.3 Building on this, the EU and the Rockefeller\u000a      Foundation funded the AsiaFluCap project which developed a framework to\u000a      assess pandemic response capacity, including analyses of governance\u000a      arrangements, modelling pandemic scenarios and mapping the availability\u000a      and shortages of key health care resources. Working directly with\u000a      policy-makers, Coker and colleagues applied the framework across six\u000a      Southeast Asian countries. They found marked inequities in the\u000a      distribution of resources within and between countries, and showed how\u000a      such inequities and resource gaps could greatly increase the number of\u000a      pandemic deaths, and how resolving resource mismatches and cross-border\u000a      sharing of resources might pay dividends.3.4\u000a    In 2011, Coker and colleagues built on the results of AsiaFluCap with two\u000a      detailed country case studies extending their analyses of pandemic\u000a      preparedness in Cambodia and Indonesia in collaboration with country\u000a      academics and government officials. In Cambodia, research focused on\u000a      prioritising pandemic mitigation investment options. Analysis of\u000a      stakeholder perspectives, H5N1 case outcomes and cost of illness, and\u000a      social contact patterns fed into a cost effectiveness mathematical model\u000a      characterising epidemiological, clinical and economic aspects of pandemic\u000a      influenza events and potential interventions. Methodological development\u000a      in the pandemic cost effectiveness models included a critical appraisal of\u000a      previous studies;3.5 inclusion of health system capacity within\u000a      the model; and an analysis of parameter uncertainty identifying\u000a      time-to-pandemic as a key driver of uncertainty in cost effectiveness\u000a      results.\u000a    The Indonesian study integrated influenza pandemic preparedness into a\u000a      multi-hazards framework to inform policy to enhance the health system's\u000a      ability to cope with other types of surges in demand.3.6\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41461","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research into PROMs carried out at LSHTM has led directly to their\u000a      introduction across the\u000a      NHS in England for four elective surgical procedures. It is the first time\u000a      that such measures have\u000a      been introduced on a nationwide scale with the aim of comparing the\u000a      performance of hospitals.\u000a    After Black and colleagues reported their research findings to the\u000a      Department of Health (DH) in\u000a      July 2007 and recommended the use of PROMs, the NHS Management Board\u000a      decided in\u000a      December 2007 that from April 2009 it would be mandatory for all NHS\u000a      patients undergoing the\u000a      designated operations to be invited to complete pre- and postoperative\u000a      PROMs questionnaires\u000a      (2009\/2010 NHS Operating Framework).5.1 The Chair of the DH\u000a      PROMs Stakeholder Reference\u000a      Group, Dr Andrew Vallance-Owen,5.2 recognised that `Nick Black\u000a      and his colleagues were pivotal in\u000a      giving the DH the confidence to start the National PROMs Programme', and\u000a      Lord Darzi, then\u000a      Minister of Health, addressing the Health Select Committee, stated: `I\u000a      think the best investment we\u000a      have made was actually in this report ... It is good reading actually. It\u000a      has come from LSHTM, and\u000a      was done jointly with the Royal College of Surgeons.'5.3 In\u000a      June 2008, High Quality Care for All (a\u000a      key policy document for the DH under the Labour government) provided a\u000a      strong endorsement:\u000a      `Just as important [as clinical measures] is the effectiveness of care\u000a      from the patient's own\u000a      perspective which will be measured through patient-reported outcome\u000a      measures.'5.4\u000a    During 2008-2009, Black and colleagues briefed Conservative shadow\u000a      ministers several times on\u000a      the opportunities that PROMs presented. Despite the change of government\u000a      in 2010, there has\u000a      been seamless political support for the use of PROMs; in July 2010 the\u000a      coalition government in its\u000a      White Paper, Equity and Excellence &#8212; Liberating the NHS stated:\u000a      `Information generated by\u000a      patients themselves will be critical ... and will include much wider use\u000a      of effective tools like\u000a      PROMs.' Ministers' positive views on PROMs were reflected in the NHS\u000a      Operating Framework\u000a      2011\/2012 (pp. 25-26)5.5 and by the inclusion of PROMs in the\u000a      NHS Outcomes Framework\u000a      2011\/2012 (p20).5.6\u000a    The value of PROMs for more sophisticated estimates of NHS productivity\u000a      has been recognised by\u000a      the Office of National Statistics5.7 and the National Audit\u000a      Office.5.8 The latter stated that, `When\u000a      producing productivity measures, new data on quality such as PROMs should\u000a      be considered' (p.\u000a      10).\u000a    The historical importance for surgeons was recognised in 2012 by\u000a      Professor Norman Williams,\u000a      President of the Royal College of Surgeons, when he stated that `the\u000a      introduction of PROMs has\u000a      been a major development in the history of surgery'.5.9 \u000a    Since April 2010, PROMs data have been published online (http:\/\/www.ic.nhs.uk\/proms)\u000a      for the\u000a      use of clinicians, managers, commissioners and the public. The huge scale\u000a      of the programme is\u000a      indicated by the 515,000 patients who participated over the first three\u000a      years (over 70% of those\u000a      eligible). In 2012, the DH's Branch Head of Strategy, Finance and NHS\u000a      Directorate, David Nuttall,\u000a      commended Black and colleagues' continued research after the introduction\u000a      of PROMs as having\u000a      `informed decisions on how data should best be analysed, presented and\u000a      used'.5.10\u000a    Another indication of success is that coronary revascularisation will be\u000a      included from 2014 using a\u000a      PROM (CROQ) developed at LSHTM. The University of Oxford has undertaken\u000a      preliminary work\u000a      on the use of PROMs in long-term conditions, but the impact described in\u000a      this case study is a\u000a      direct result of the work of LSHTM alone.\u000a    Black has raised awareness and understanding of PROMs among clinicians,\u000a      NHS managers and\u000a      patient organisations by chairing many national conferences and giving 11\u000a      keynote talks since\u000a      2009, including at the Royal College of Nursing (March 2010); the\u000a      Pre-Operative Assessment\u000a      Association (September 2010); the NHS Medical Directors Conference\u000a      (October 2010); the\u000a      National PROMs Summit (December 2012, 2013); and the International Society\u000a      for Quality in\u000a      Healthcare (October 2013) at which his contribution internationally was\u000a      recognised by the award of\u000a      the first Career Achievement Prize in PROMs, funded by the Medical\u000a      Outcomes Trust in the USA.\u000a      He is advising the US National Institute of Medicine and the American\u000a      Medical Association.\u000a    The introduction of PROMs was widely reported in the press, raising\u000a      awareness and understanding\u000a      among the general public. In a Financial Times report on 19 August\u000a      2011, Professor Sir Bruce\u000a      Keogh, Medical Director of the NHS, was quoted as saying he hoped PROMS\u000a      `would shift the\u000a      focus among doctors [away] from technocratic results, where an operation\u000a      was deemed a success\u000a      regardless of whether the patient remained in pain'.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research carried out by LSHTM to develop and test patient reported\u000a      outcome measures (PROMs),\u000a      which measure health outcomes from the patient perspective, has\u000a      demonstrated the feasibility of\u000a      routinely collecting such measures before and after elective operations.\u000a      In 2009, the Labour\u000a      government mandated that PROMs should be collected on all NHS patients in\u000a      England undergoing\u000a      one of four surgical operations, a policy endorsed by the coalition\u000a      following the 2010 election.

While many universities around\u000a      the world have\u000a      contributed to the first of these areas and some have focused on the\u000a      second, Black and colleagues\u000a      have been unique in researching the third.\u000a    In terms of developing and psychometrically testing patient\u000a      questionnaires, under the leadership of\u000a      Donna Lamping (Professor of Health Psychology, LSHTM from 1992, until her\u000a      death in 2011,\u000a      initially Senior Lecturer), major contributions have been made to the\u000a      development of new PROMs\u000a      for a wide range of surgical procedures: stress incontinence (1996);\u000a      benign prostatic hypertrophy\u000a      (1998); menorrhagia (1998);3.1 venous disorders (2003); plastic\u000a      surgery on hands\/arms and on\u000a      head \/neck procedures (2004); and coronary revascularisation (2004).3.2\u000a      Rigorous qualitative and\u000a      quantitative methods were used by LSHTM experts in sociology, psychology,\u000a      epidemiology and\u000a      statistics.\u000a    Work in the second area was undertaken on a range of methodological\u000a      aspects of the use of\u000a      PROMs, including: the influence of patients' preoperative expectations;\u000a      the impact of late response\u000a      and non-response to follow-up; 3.3 the use of minimally\u000a      important differences;3.4 and many others.\u000a    Finally, Black, Jan van der Meulen (Professor of Clinical Epidemiology,\u000a      LSHTM since 2000, then\u000a      Senior Lecturer) and other colleagues have made a unique contribution to\u000a      the routine\u000a      implementation of PROMs in the NHS. In 2005 they undertook a systematic\u000a      review of instruments\u000a      for the routine assessment of outcomes following five common elective\u000a      operations (hip and knee\u000a      replacement, varicose vein surgery, hernia repair and cataract surgery).\u000a      This led directly to a study\u000a      to develop pre- and postoperative questionnaires for four procedures and\u000a      to test the feasibility of\u000a      using them routinely in the NHS. Findings reported in 2007 confirmed that\u000a      it was possible to recruit\u000a      patients, follow them up and make risk-adjusted comparisons of providers,\u000a      all at reasonable cost.\u000a      To confirm these findings on a larger scale, in 2008 Black established a\u000a      much larger study with\u000a      about 35,000 patients. In parallel, since 2009, studies have included\u000a      equity of use and outcomes,\u000a      the impact of choice of metric3.5 and clinicians' and\u000a      patients' views of how best to feed back\u000a      comparisons of health care providers' performance to maximise the\u000a      likelihood that the data will\u000a      stimulate improvements in the quality of care.3.6\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41463","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"},{"GeoNamesId":"3723988","Name":"Haiti"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"},{"GeoNamesId":"1282988","Name":"Nepal"},{"GeoNamesId":"2328926","Name":"Nigeria"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    As a direct result of Curtis' research, HWWS is now a key strategy in the\u000d\u000a      international fight against\u000d\u000a      diarrhoeal disease, attracting both public and &#8212; increasingly &#8212; private\u000d\u000a      investment.

As a result, an increasing number of\u000d\u000a      countries have been\u000d\u000a      developing their own national policies since 2008.5.5\u000d\u000a    Curtis' research into behaviour change for handwashing also galvanised\u000d\u000a      industry to invest in its\u000d\u000a      own HWWS public health campaigns. Chief among these is Unilever's\u000d\u000a      `Lifebuoy Way of Life' (LWL)\u000d\u000a      launched in 2008. LWL targets mothers and schoolchildren across Asia and\u000d\u000a      much of Africa, aiming\u000d\u000a      at getting hands washed at five key times to reduce diarrhoeal illness.\u000d\u000a      LSHTM is now included\u000d\u000a      among Lifebuoy's global partners, and Curtis is listed as one of\u000d\u000a      Lifebuoy's experts. In this capacity\u000d\u000a      she and her research continue to contribute to the evolution of the\u000d\u000a      company's strategy.5.6 Lifebuoy\u000d\u000a      says its campaign has already reached 48 million people in eight countries\u000d\u000a      in Asia and Africa. The\u000d\u000a      goal is to reach a billion by 2015.5.7 LWL has given good\u000d\u000a      results for Unilever and as a result other\u000d\u000a      manufacturers have started investing in their own HWWS campaigns.

They came\u000d\u000a      to the surprising conclusion that HWWS could reduce the risk of diarrhoeal\u000d\u000a      disease by 42-47%\u000d\u000a      and might save a million lives per year.3.1 Cost-effectiveness\u000d\u000a      studies calculated that hygiene\u000d\u000a      promotion costs around US$3.35 per Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY)\u000d\u000a      averted,3.2 putting\u000d\u000a      HWWS at the top of the list for the most cost-effective interventions to\u000d\u000a      prevent disease in\u000d\u000a      developing countries.\u000d\u000a    Between 2000 and 2007, Curtis and her team (including Aunger, joined\u000d\u000a      2003) conducted extensive\u000d\u000a      field research into handwashing behaviour in 11 countries, using a\u000d\u000a      combination of focus groups,\u000d\u000a      behaviour trials and structured observations. They identified key drivers\u000d\u000a      of handwashing behaviour:\u000d\u000a      disgust, nurture and the desire to conform to social norms &#8212; not simply a\u000d\u000a      desire for better health.3.3\u000d\u000a      Using these insights, novel handwashing promotion programmes were rolled\u000d\u000a      out in Africa and\u000d\u000a      India. These proved to be effective in improving HWWS behaviour among\u000d\u000a      those reached.3.4\u000d\u000a    In 2002 at Curtis' instigation a coalition of international stakeholders,\u000d\u000a      including the World Bank,\u000d\u000a      Colgate-Palmolive, USAID, UNICEF and Unilever among others, founded the\u000d\u000a      global PPPHW. Built\u000d\u000a      on their understanding of handwashing behaviour and on the process used by\u000d\u000a      industry to market\u000d\u000a      soap, Curtis worked with the Ghanaian Ministry of Water and the PPPHW to\u000d\u000a      roll out an innovative\u000d\u000a      nationwide handwashing campaign in 2003. Subsequent evaluation found that\u000d\u000a      71% of Ghanaian\u000d\u000a      mothers knew the TV ad and the reported rates of HWWS increased\u000d\u000a      substantially. Overall the\u000d\u000a      initiative proved that there are many economic and public health benefits\u000d\u000a      to be gained from public-private\u000d\u000a      collaboration. For example, the public sector can employ the marketing\u000d\u000a      skills of the private\u000d\u000a      sector and both can benefit from academia's insights into behaviour\u000d\u000a      change.3.5\u000d\u000a    Realising that the private sector often commissions studies explicitly to\u000d\u000a      generate media attention,\u000d\u000a      Curtis and LSHTM's Hygiene Centre team have carried out a series of\u000d\u000a      studies for release annually\u000d\u000a      on Global Handwashing Day (2009-2012).

Wyeth Lederle stopped production of the 9-valent\u000a      vaccine shortly after\u000a      completion of the Gambian and South African trials but made a donation of\u000a      the 7-valent vaccine\u000a      (Prevenar&#174;) used in the USA to the Gambian Ministry of Health\u000a      in 2009. This allowed introduction\u000a      of this vaccine into the routine immunisation programme of The Gambia,\u000a      only the second country\u000a      in sub-Saharan Africa (after Rwanda) to take this step. In 2011, with\u000a      financial support from GAVI,\u000a      the seven-valent vaccine, which lacks some of the key serotypes needed for\u000a      a maximally effective\u000a      pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in Africa, was replaced by a 13-valent\u000a      vaccine. The impact on\u000a      mortality and morbidity of introducing PCVs into a national infant\u000a      immunisation programme in\u000a      Africa is currently being studied in detail in Upper River Region, The\u000a      Gambia, with support from the\u000a      Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It is too early to determine the extent\u000a      of the impact on mortality\u000a      and morbidity of this vaccine, which has now been received by nearly\u000a      100,000 Gambian infants,\u000a      but it is likely that many lives have already been saved.\u000a    Internationally\u000a      The results of the Gambian phase 3 trial, together with those of the\u000a      parallel study undertaken in\u000a      South Africa, provided key information which led the WHO Strategic\u000a      Advisory Group of Experts\u000a      (SAGE) committee to recommend to WHO that pneumococcal conjugate vaccines\u000a      should be\u000a      introduced into the routine infant immunisation programmes of all\u000a      countries with a high child\u000a      mortality. This recommendation was accepted by WHO in 2007, with the\u000a      findings of the Gambian\u000a      trial being influential in this decision.5.1,5.2 The unique\u000a      evidence provided from The Gambia of an\u000a      effect on mortality proved especially influential. Economic data collected\u000a      during the Gambian trial\u000a      allowed demonstration that deployment of the vaccine in developing\u000a      countries would be highly cost\u000a      effective5.3 and this information also contributed to the\u000a      positive recommendation by SAGE.\u000a    Because of their complex nature, PCVs are relatively expensive and so\u000a      there were concerns\u000a      whether it would be possible to implement the WHO recommendation in some\u000a      of the poorest\u000a      countries of the world where PCVs would be most effective. However,\u000a      substantial progress has\u000a      been made in achieving this goal through the financial support obtained\u000a      for the introduction of new\u000a      vaccines in poor countries provided through GAVI and the Advanced Market\u000a      Commitment5.4 (an\u000a      innovative financing method which guarantees a market if a vaccine or\u000a      medicine is successfully\u000a      developed). By 31 March 2013, 24 GAVI-eligible countries had introduced a\u000a      PCV into their routine\u000a      immunisation programme (8 of these were supported by the Advanced Market\u000a      Commitment), and\u000a      a further 27 countries were approved by GAVI for introduction, including\u000a      nearly all countries in sub-Saharan\u000a      Africa,5.5 a dramatic uptake over a period of only three years.5.6\u000a    PCVs would have been introduced into most developing counties eventually,\u000a      but experience with\u000a      hepatitis B and Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccines indicates\u000a      that the lag between uptake in\u000a      industrialised and developing countries may be up to 15 years. PCVs are\u000a      being introduced more\u000a      rapidly than this as the international community has found better ways of\u000a      accelerating the uptake of\u000a      new vaccines. A strong case can be made that the Gambian PCV trial has\u000a      played an important\u000a      part in achieving this success and thus helped in saving many thousands of\u000a      young lives in poor\u000a      countries which would otherwise have been lost to pneumococcal infection.5.7\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    A trial of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) coordinated by\u000a      Greenwood (LSHTM) and\u000a      conducted in Gambian infants, showed a significant reduction in invasive\u000a      pneumococcal disease,\u000a      severe pneumonia, hospital admissions and deaths in vaccinated children.\u000a      These results played an\u000a      important role in encouraging WHO to recommend the introduction of a PCV\u000a      into the routine\u000a      immunisation programme of all countries with a high child mortality.\u000a      Fifty-one GAVI eligible\u000a      countries have now introduced, or made a commitment to introduce, a PCV\u000a      into their routine infant\u000a      immunisation programme with the consequent saving of many young lives.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Health","Institution":"\u000a    London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine (LSHTM)\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine","InstitutionName":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10007771}],"Panel":"A         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a3.1 Cutts, FT, Zaman, SMA, Enwere, G, Jaffar, S, Levine, OS, Okoko, JB,\u000a      Oluwalana, C, Vaughan, A,\u000a      Obaro, SK, Leach, A, McAdam, KP, Biney, E, Saaka, M, Onwuchekwa, U,\u000a      Yallop, F, Pierce, NF,\u000a      Greenwood, BM &amp; Adegbola, RA 2005, `Efficacy of nine-valent\u000a      pneumococcal conjugate vaccine\u000a      against pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease in The Gambia:\u000a      randomised, double-blind,\u000a      placebo-controlled trial', Lancet; vol. 365, no. 9465,\u000a      pp.1139-1146, doi:10.1016\/S0140-6736(05)71876-6.\u000a      Citation count:432\u000a    \u000a\u000a3.2 Leach, A, Ceesay, SJ, Banya WAS and Greenwood, BM (1996) Pilot trial\u000a      of a pentavalent\u000a      pneumococcal polysaccharide\/protein conjugate vaccine in Gambian infants,\u000a      Pediatric Infectious\u000a        Disease Journal, 15(4): 333-339,\u000a      doi:10.1097\/00006454-199604000-00010.

Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) is\u000a      the most important cause of\u000a      severe pneumonia in children. Developing a vaccine that could prevent\u000a      pneumococcal infections in\u000a      young children is, therefore, a high public health priority. Initial\u000a      vaccines based on the capsular\u000a      polysaccharide of the pneumococcus were not effective as they induced only\u000a      a poor immune\u000a      response in young children. Coupling of capsular polysaccharides to a\u000a      protein to produce a PCV\u000a      overcame this problem. Initial trials of a 7-valent PCV (Prevenar&#174;)\u000a      in the USA showed that this\u000a      vaccine was highly effective in protecting vaccinated infants and\u000a      unvaccinated members of their\u000a      family by preventing nasopharyngeal carriage and thus interrupting\u000a      transmission.

Evidence from the trials in Ghana made\u000a      substantial contributions to all the new guidelines:\u000a    \u000a      The Ghana VAST trials constituted 28.9% of the total evidence\u000a        concerning the impact of VAS on all-cause mortality in children aged\u000a        6-59 months and the continued recommendation that this is a key child\u000a        survival intervention.5.1, 5.2\u000a\u000a      The latest Countdown to 2015 (maternal, newborn and child survival)\u000a        report5.9 estimated a median coverage of 80% for children\u000a        aged 6-59 months receiving VAS in low- and middle-income countries; the\u000a        2013 Lancet nutrition review series highlights the importance of\u000a        continuing to improve this coverage, estimating that this could prevent\u000a        an additional 145,000 deaths each year at a cost of $159 per life saved.\u000a        This estimate was derived using the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) which models\u000a        the number of child deaths that could be saved with different\u000a        interventions. The cause-specific findings from the Ghana VAST trials\u000a        make a major contribution to the evidence base on effect sizes for VAS\u000a        used in LiST.\u000a      The EPI-Plus trial provided 11.3% of the mortality evidence behind the\u000a        recommendation not to recommend VAS in infants 1-5 months of age.5.3,\u000a          5.4 This is a reversal of the previous policy recommending\u000a        supplementation in this age group and which was not evidence based.\u000a      Both the EPI-Plus trial and the ObaapaVitA trial contributed evidence\u000a        behind the recommendation not to recommend VAS in postpartum women.5.5,\u000a          5.6 This is also a reversal of previous policy which recommended\u000a        postpartum supplementation.\u000a      The ObaapaVitA trial contributed 61.9% of the evidence concerning no\u000a        overall impact of VAS to pregnant women on maternal mortality and 61.9%\u000a        of the evidence concerning no overall impact on neonatal mortality.5.7,\u000a          5.8 Supplementation of pregnant women is not recommended.\u000a    \u000a    The VAS trial findings have also had a major influence within Ghana. The\u000a      establishment of the National Vitamin A Programme was in direct response\u000a      to the Ghana VAST trials, and the content of the programme has been\u000a      influenced and informed by the subsequent trials in Ghana. The 2012\u000a      Countdown report5.9 gives 93% coverage of two doses per year of\u000a      VAS to children aged 6-59 months. The national vitamin A programme no\u000a      longer supports VAS given with vaccines in the first six months of life or\u000a      supplementation of postpartum women, saving the programme considerable\u000a      money and opportunity costs each year, and, following the ObaapaVitA\u000a      trial, VAS for women of reproductive age will not be introduced. The\u000a      definitive no impact findings of the ObaapaVitA trial emphasize that good\u000a      research can make important contributions by showing that something\u000a      doesn't work; Esi Amoaful, the National Vitamin A Programme Manager, Ghana\u000a      Health Service5.10 commented: `Research does not just tell us\u000a      what new things to do, it also tells us what not to do. The remarkable\u000a      finding has made the case that had the Ghana Health Sector implemented\u000a      this policy all over the country to women without the requisite\u000a      information about its benefits, we might have spent millions of dollars\u000a      each year to no avail.\"\u000a    Finally, the vitamin A trials in Ghana have made a major contribution to\u000a      research capacity, building the initial infrastructures for the Navrongo\u000a      and Kintampo Health Research Centres which are making substantial research\u000a      contributions to global health. For example, the Kintampo Health Research\u000a      Centre has a widespread malaria programme and was one of the seven African\u000a      sites carrying out trials to assess the GlaxoSmithKline RTS,S malaria\u000a      vaccine which has just been reported to almost halve the number of malaria\u000a      cases in young children. The vitamin A trials have also trained staff who\u000a      have gone on to senior research and policy positions in Ghana including\u000a      two current university Vice-chancellors and Directors of two health\u000a      research centres.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is a major public health problem in low- and\u000a      middle-income countries with young children and pregnant women\u000a      particularly at risk.

LSHTM has been\u000a      at the forefront of research since then, leading a series of definitive\u000a      randomised controlled trials in collaboration with the Ghana Health\u000a      Service to evaluate the impact of different VAS strategies on child\u000a      survival.\u000a    The Ghana VAST Survival and Health trials3.1 in the early\u000a      1990s were led by Professors David Ross (LSHTM since 1983, then Research\u000a      Fellow) and Betty Kirkwood (LSHTM since 1979, then Lecturer) respectively.\u000a      The survival trial was cluster randomised and involved 21,906 children\u000a      aged 6 to 59 months, while the health study was individually randomised\u000a      and involved 1,455 children followed weekly for one year. The trials were\u000a      unique in including a detailed assessment of VAS on morbidity alongside\u000a      mortality.

In the 1990s, population-based HIV prevalence\u000d\u000a      surveys in sub-Saharan African countries, led by Richard Hayes (Professor\u000d\u000a      of Epidemiology &amp; International Health, LSHTM since 1978, then\u000d\u000a      Research Fellow) and others, highlighted a relatively low prevalence of\u000d\u000a      HIV and other STIs in 15-19-year-olds but a dramatic increase in\u000d\u000a      prevalence in 20-24-year-olds. There was a clear need for sexual and\u000d\u000a      reproductive health (SRH) interventions targeted specifically at youth.\u000d\u000a    Two major collaborative intervention programmes were subsequently\u000d\u000a      conducted by Hayes, David Ross (Professor of Epidemiology and Public\u000d\u000a      Health, LSHTM since 1983, then Research Fellow) and others, with\u000d\u000a      collaborators from University College London, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.

They\u000d\u000a      showed that it was feasible to implement high-quality interventions in\u000d\u000a      schools, health facilities and the community using government employees\u000d\u000a      and\/or youth volunteers, and to scale these up. The trials also showed\u000d\u000a      that these interventions had a substantial and sustained impact on young\u000d\u000a      people's SRH knowledge and self-reported attitudes to sexual risks, and on\u000d\u000a      key self-reported sexual risk behaviours. However, there was no consistent\u000d\u000a      impact on pregnancy or HIV rates, which highlighted the importance of\u000d\u000a      including biomedical evidence in trials.3.1, 3.2, 3.3\u000d\u000a    HALIRA, a comprehensive qualitative study carried out in 1999-2002\u000d\u000a      alongside the Tanzanian trial (in collaboration with the Medical Research\u000d\u000a      Council's Social and Public Health Sciences Unit and the National\u000d\u000a      Institute for Medical Research, Tanzania) highlighted key societal and\u000d\u000a      social barriers to sexual behaviour change among young people. The\u000d\u000a      findings showed that societal norms predispose against young people\u000d\u000a      avoiding risky sex, for example by condoning and even encouraging\u000d\u000a      transactional sex; for young women, exchanging sex for gifts or support is\u000d\u000a      seen as normal and acceptable.3.4\u000d\u000a    Hayes, Ross and colleagues subsequently used data from the Tanzanian and\u000d\u000a      Zimbabwean trials, along with other data from South Africa, Zimbabwe and\u000d\u000a      Uganda, to show a lack of association between reported adolescent risk\u000d\u000a      behaviours and adolescent HIV prevalence. These findings suggest that it\u000d\u000a      is primarily sex with adults rather than each other that puts adolescents\u000d\u000a      at risk, and so future interventions should include adults.3.5\u000d\u000a    Meanwhile, Ross and colleagues (in collaboration with WHO) led the\u000d\u000a      `Steady..., Ready..., Go!' reviews published in 2006 for the UN\u000d\u000a      Inter-Agency Task Team for Young People. These examined what kinds of\u000d\u000a      interventions work to prevent HIV infection among youth in low- and\u000d\u000a      middle-income countries. Among the interventions graded as Go!

Save the Children employed the tool in the\u000d\u000a      preparation of their Missing Midwives report (2011) to show that\u000d\u000a      1.3 million newborns annually could be saved using eight key\u000d\u000a      interventions.5.5\u000d\u000a    Born Too Soon: The Global Action Report on Preterm Birth, produced\u000d\u000a      in May 2012 by WHO, Save the Children, March of Dimes (an NGO that works\u000d\u000a      to improve the health of mothers and babies) and The Partnership for\u000d\u000a      Maternal, Neonatal and Child Health, with 50 partner organisations, used\u000d\u000a      LiST to identify priority packages and interventions for preterm babies.5.6\u000d\u000a      This initiative achieved wide media coverage, including reports in The\u000d\u000a        Guardian, Reuters and on the BBC in the UK, and in the New York\u000d\u000a        Times, USA Today and The Wall Street Journal in the USA.

He concluded that The Lancet Neonatal\u000d\u000a      Survival series 2005, to which Cousens and colleagues had contributed\u000d\u000a      vital research, was important in solidifying links between key individuals\u000d\u000a      in the field and became `a point of reference on the severity, causes,\u000d\u000a      costing, and solutions to the problem of newborn mortality and had\u000d\u000a      substantial influence in agenda setting'.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    LSHTM research led to the development of a computer-based tool known as\u000d\u000a      the Lives Saved Tool (LiST), which has been made available to\u000d\u000a      international organisations, governments and NGOs free of charge.

Along with Joy Lawn, formerly\u000d\u000a      Director Global Evidence and Policy, Saving Newborn Lives, Save the\u000d\u000a      Children, and Professor of Maternal Reproductive and Child Health\u000d\u000a      Epidemiology at LSHTM since 2013, he developed a statistical model using a\u000d\u000a      multinomial modelling approach applied to vital registration data and\u000d\u000a      datasets identified from a review of the literature. This produced\u000d\u000a      national estimates of neonatal deaths by cause,3.1 an approach\u000d\u000a      now also used for post-neonatal child deaths.\u000d\u000a    These estimates were key inputs into the 2005 Lancet Neonatal\u000d\u000a      Survival series (co-led with Lawn). As part of the series, Cousens\u000d\u000a      developed a computer model, building on that developed previously for the\u000d\u000a      2003 Lancet Child Survival Series, using the estimates of neonatal\u000d\u000a      deaths by cause, to estimate the number of neonatal deaths that could be\u000d\u000a      prevented with different interventions.3.2 Subsequently Cousens\u000d\u000a      developed a cohort model for child mortality which formed part of the Lancet\u000d\u000a      Maternal and Child Undernutrition series and provided estimates of the\u000d\u000a      number of deaths and cases of stunting that could be averted by providing\u000d\u000a      nutrition.3.3 These models were the predecessors of LiST.\u000d\u000a    In 2008, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation provided funding through\u000d\u000a      the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health to enable the Futures Institute\u000d\u000a      to integrate the models mentioned above into Spectrum, a pre-existing\u000d\u000a      suite of policy models which provide policy-makers with `analytical tools\u000d\u000a      to support the decision-making process'. This process directly led to the\u000d\u000a      launch of LiST as a publicly available tool later that year.\u000d\u000a    A key input for LiST are estimates of the effectiveness of different\u000d\u000a      interventions in terms of the proportion of deaths due to specific causes\u000d\u000a      that an intervention can prevent. Cousens played a key role in setting the\u000d\u000a      standards for the literature reviews from which these effect estimates\u000d\u000a      were derived, and in establishing rules for deriving effect estimates.3.4\u000d\u000a      He and Hannah Blencowe, Research Fellow at LSHTM since 2010, also\u000d\u000a      contributed to or led many of the reviews of interventions to prevent\u000d\u000a      neonatal deaths that were coordinated by Lawn and published in a\u000d\u000a      supplement to the International Journal of Epidemiology in 2010.3.5,3.6\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41548","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"2328926","Name":"Nigeria"},{"GeoNamesId":"1512440","Name":"Uzbekistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"},{"GeoNamesId":"2413451","Name":"Gambia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1036973","Name":"Mozambique"},{"GeoNamesId":"1562822","Name":"Vietnam"},{"GeoNamesId":"630336","Name":"Belarus"},{"GeoNamesId":"2029969","Name":"Mongolia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1168579","Name":"Pakistan"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research carried out by the LSHTM team as part of the Hib Initiative\u000a      directly contributed to a\u000a      large number of low- and middle-income countries deciding to introduce the\u000a      vaccine, reducing their\u000a      paediatric death and disease burden very significantly.\u000a    The research LSHTM did within the Hib Initiative allowed health\u000a      ministries in developing countries\u000a      to establish the disease burden of Hib and make evidence-based arguments\u000a      in favour of\u000a      introducing a suitable vaccine.

In India and Nigeria, Hib vaccine is used only regionally.\u000a    According to the 2013 WHO report on GAVI progress, 153m children were\u000a      vaccinated with Hib\u000a      through GAVI support during 2000-2012, which has prevented approximately\u000a      658,000 deaths.5.2\u000a      Deaths prevented in GAVI countries during the period 2008-2013 are\u000a      estimated as 509,000.5.2 In\u000a      2011, the GAVI Alliance committed to vaccinating a further 224m children\u000a      with Hib vaccine by\u000a      2015.\u000a    The example of Mozambique (which introduced the vaccine in 2009 following\u000a      a country-specific\u000a      study supported by the LSHTM team to aid decision-making) impressively\u000a      illustrates the impact of\u000a      Hib vaccine adoption on a country's death and disease burden in a rural\u000a      high-HIV epidemic area.\u000a      Among children under 1 and under 5, significant reductions occurred in\u000a      rates of invasive Hib\u000a      disease (91% and 85%, respectively) and very severe pneumonia (29% and\u000a      34%, respectively).5.3\u000a      Radiologically-confirmed pneumonia incidence fell by 33% in children under\u000a      2.\u000a    Another pertinent example is Bangladesh, which also introduced the Hib\u000a      vaccine in 2009, citing\u000a      advocacy by the Hib Initiative as a catalyst for action for its adoption.5.4\u000a      The measure is expected to\u000a      save 20,000 lives in Bangladesh per year.5.5\u000a    A number of other countries specifically studied by the LSHTM team to aid\u000a      decision-making also\u000a      introduced the Hib vaccine within the impact assessment period. These\u000a      included Pakistan (2008),\u000a      Uzbekistan (2009) and Vietnam (2010). Work in India is ongoing as the\u000a      country slowly moves\u000a      towards full implementation, with implementation strongly recommended by\u000a      local authorities.5.6\u000a    Apart from their direct research input into the Hib Initiative, the LSHTM\u000a      team also actively helped\u000a      promote awareness and understanding of their findings among\u000a      decision-makers at country and\u000a      international organisation level. They actively sought to change country\u000a      policy,5.7 with Griffiths\u000a      presenting the findings at no fewer than nine high-level international\u000a      gatherings between 2008 and\u000a      2012. These included, among others:\u000a    \u000a      a meeting involving the Indian Ministry of Health and WHO in 2008,\u000a        which discussed proposed\u000a        plans for estimating the cost-effectiveness of Hib vaccine in India\u000a      a meeting with officials from the Belarus Ministry of Health in Minsk\u000a        in 2009, where Griffiths\u000a        again reported on cost-effectiveness\u000a      a presentation at WHO in Geneva in 2012, where Griffiths highlighted\u000a        that the vaccine has\u000a        been shown to be cost-effective for all countries, and is likely to be\u000a        cost-saving in Africa.5.8\u000a\u000a    \u000a    Since 2008, other team members have been engaged in similar advocacy work\u000a      based on the\u000a      research. Mulholland has spoken at 15 international meetings in major\u000a      plenaries as well as at\u000a      smaller regional and country meetings, and Edmond built a trusting\u000a      relationship with decision-\u000a      makers in Mongolia (2007-2010).\u000a    The GAVI Alliance calls the Hib Initiative a `success story', stating\u000a      that `By pooling the knowledge\u000a      and expertise of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,\u000a      LSHTM, and the CDC, the\u000a      Hib Initiative used a combination of collecting and disseminating existing\u000a      data, research and\u000a      advocacy to help countries build a case for adopting the Hib vaccine.'5.9\u000a      The Deputy Chief\u000a      Executive Officer of the GAVI Alliance has affirmed that `the success of\u000a      the Hib Initiative program\u000a      can be seen by the excellent uptake of Hib vaccine by GAVI eligible\u000a      countries during the relatively\u000a      short period of the project. LSHTM played a major role in this project,\u000a      particularly in the areas of\u000a      gathering, synthesizing and generating the epidemiology and economic\u000a      evidence'.5.10\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research at LSHTM has been central to the introduction of the Hib vaccine\u000a      in developing\u000a      countries.

However, the use of Hib vaccine in developing countries\u000a      remained low due to high\u000a      cost and uncertain disease burden.\u000a    A team at LSHTM has focused a substantial programme of research on\u000a      supporting decision-\u000a      making for Hib vaccine introduction. Between 1993 and 1996, a large trial\u000a      in The Gambia\u000a      demonstrated the efficacy of the vaccine for the prevention of Hib\u000a      invasive disease and pneumonia\u000a      in Africa for the first time.3.1 LSHTM staff members at that\u000a      time (Peter Smith, Professor of Tropical\u000a      Epidemiology, at LSHTM since 1979, and Shabbar Jaffar, now Professor of\u000a      Epidemiology, at\u000a      LSHTM since 1996, then Lecturer ) were involved in the design, oversight\u000a      and analysis of the trial,\u000a      which was led by Professors Kim Mulholland and Sir Brian Greenwood, both\u000a      of whom later joined\u000a      LSHTM (in 2005 and 1996, respectively). However, by 2000, only one\u000a      sub-Saharan African country\u000a      (The Gambia) had introduced Hib vaccine.\u000a    The GAVI Alliance, a private-public global health partnership, was set up\u000a      in 2000 to increase\u000a      access to immunisation in poor countries. Initially, it offered Hib\u000a      vaccine free of charge to eligible\u000a      countries for five years. However, by early 2005, only 14 countries had\u000a      made use of this offer due\u000a      to lack of awareness and concerns about financial sustainability. In\u000a      response, the GAVI Alliance\u000a      invited proposals for a project aiming to accelerate the use of\u000a      evidence-informed decision-making\u000a      about Hib vaccine. In late 2005, Kim Mulholland (by then Professor of\u000a      Child Health and\u000a      Vaccinology at LSHTM) secured the US$37m project in partnership with Johns\u000a      Hopkins University,\u000a      with WHO and US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as collaborators.\u000a    Within the Hib Initiative consortium, LSHTM was responsible for\u000a      epidemiological studies (lead, Kim\u000a      Mulholland; also Karen Edmond, LSHTM 2002-12, initially Research Fellow),\u000a      health economics\u000a      (lead, Ulla Griffiths, LSHTM Lecturer since 2006) and mathematical\u000a      modelling (Andrew Clark,\u000a      LSHTM Research Fellow since 2002). The group developed epidemiological\u000a      methods for\u000a      determining the effectiveness of Hib vaccine.3.2 It contributed\u000a      to estimating the global burden of Hib\u000a      disease,3.3,3.4 showing that Hib caused 371,000 deaths in\u000a      children under 5 each year, and that the\u000a      substantial disease burden caused by Hib is almost entirely\u000a      vaccine-preventable.3.3 The group also\u000a      showed that Hib conjugate vaccine is cost saving or highly cost effective\u000a      in low- and middle-income\u000a      countries.3.5 In addition, starting in 2007, a number of\u000a      country-specific studies were undertaken in\u000a      Mozambique, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Vietnam, Belarus and\u000a      Uzbekistan, all with a view to\u000a      aiding decision-making on introducing the vaccine.3.6 The\u000a      project supported countries through the\u000a      various stages of decision-making and vaccine introduction.

LSHTM\u000a      research on the size of the\u000a      private market and on private sector antimalarial prices was one of the\u000a      few pieces of empirical\u000a      evidence available. This evidence underlined the need to include the\u000a      private sector in the subsidy\u000a      mechanism, and was used to estimate the magnitude of price reduction\u000a      needed to crowd out non-\u000a      artemisinin therapies.5.1, 5.2 Hosted and managed by the Global\u000a      Fund, the AMFm was implemented\u000a      in 2009 at national scale in eight African countries as a result of the\u000a      IOM proposals, which were\u000a      championed by the Roll Back Malaria partnership (which implements\u000a      coordinated action against\u000a      malaria).\u000a    The hypotheses that a subsidy programme would increase access to ACT and\u000a      reduce the\u000a      availability of artemisinin monotherapies which can encourage the spread\u000a      of artemisinin-resistant\u000a      strains of malaria, were tested in pilot antimalarial subsidy programmes\u000a      in Kenya and Tanzania in\u000a      2008-2010, for which LSHTM researchers provided key methodological\u000a      guidance5.3 and which\u000a      also informed the design of the AMFm.\u000a    The working groups designing the AMFm made direct reference to LSHTM work\u000a      and LSHTM\u000a      researchers were consulted on aspects of the design.5.4 LSHTM\u000a      research was also included\u000a      among the evidence used to establish the success metrics against which\u000a      AMFm would be\u000a      assessed in the 2010-2012 independent evaluation5.5 which would\u000a      guide future board decisions.\u000a    LSHTM researchers (Hanson, Goodman and Tougher) were key members of the\u000a      (competitively\u000a      selected) AMFm independent evaluation team, and led the design and\u000a      analysis of the outlet survey\u000a      in the eight AMFm countries in Africa. LSHTM researchers also designed the\u000a      qualitative case\u000a      studies which generated data used to interpret and attribute programme\u000a      impact. AMFm countries\u000a      started ordering subsidised ACT in mid-2010, and by the end of 2012 over\u000a      292m doses of\u000a      subsidised ACT had been ordered, of which 56% were paediatric.5.6,\u000a        5.7 The independent evaluation\u000a      showed that purchases of quality-assured ACT increased substantially in\u000a      all but two countries, with\u000a      ACT market share increasing from 16 to 40%. Subsidised antimalarials were\u000a      reaching rural and\u000a      remote areas and drug affordability was substantially improved, with price\u000a      reductions observed in\u000a      rural as well as urban areas.5.7\u000a    The research methods developed by LSHTM for studying retail antimalarial\u000a      medicine supply have\u000a      subsequently been adapted and used on a much larger scale by ACTwatch, a\u000a      consortium including\u000a      LSHTM and funded by Gates to monitor programme implementation in 2008-2013\u000a      and provide\u000a      evidence on how to improve ACT availability and reduce private sector\u000a      prices. ACTwatch adapted\u000a      the tools of Goodman et al. for more than 30 nationwide surveys of retail\u000a      outlets in 10 developing\u000a      countries across Africa and Southeast Asia. Methodological innovations\u000a      included sampling outlets\u000a      where no sampling frame exists; ways to question informal medicine\u000a      suppliers; metrics for\u000a      comparing volumes across different antimalarial classes and formulations;\u000a      methods for measuring\u000a      sales volumes; and approaches for documenting the distribution chain.\u000a      ACTwatch helped stimulate\u000a      funding for new research and policy advocacy. The data have also been used\u000a      for policy advocacy\u000a      at country level, contributing, for instance, to the decision in Zanzibar\u000a      to strengthen regulation to\u000a      remove oral artemisinin monotherapies from drug selling outlets.5.8\u000a    The independent evaluation ultimately led to the integration of AMFm into\u000a      core Global Fund\u000a      processes in 2012.

As recently as 2008,\u000a      only about 16% of febrile children under 5 (the population group most at\u000a      risk of dying from malaria\u000a      in high transmission settings) received an artemisinin-based combination\u000a      therapy (ACT), the\u000a      recommended drug for malaria case management. Research by LSHTM\u000a      established the\u000a      importance of the private sector in treating malaria, in many settings\u000a      exceeding 50% of care-seeking\u000a      for fever.\u000a    Catherine Goodman (then Research Fellow, now Senior Lecturer) started her\u000a      PhD in 2000,\u000a      supervised by Anne Mills (Professor of Health Economics and Policy), on\u000a      the nature of the private\u000a      retail market for antimalarial medicines in rural Tanzania. Kara Hanson\u000a      (then Lecturer, now\u000a      Professor of Health System Economics) joined them in leading research on\u000a      the role of the private\u000a      sector in delivering malaria medicines, supported by Research\u000a      Fellows\/Lecturers Benjamin\u000a      Palafox, Edith Patouillard, Sarah Tougher (from 2008), and Sergio Torres\u000a      Rueda, Barbara Willey\u000a      and Andrea Mann (from 2011). All were based at LSHTM throughout their\u000a      research involvement.\u000a    The research fell into three main areas. First, an investigation into the\u000a      use of the private sector for\u000a      malaria case management and the conditions under which medicines are\u000a      supplied.3.1 Research in\u000a      2000-2002 explored the retail market for antimalarials from both a supply\u000a      and demand\u000a      perspective, using qualitative and quantitative methods. The results\u000a      showed that antimalarial\u000a      medicines were widely available from retail outlets, which provided easier\u000a      access to the drugs than\u000a      health facilities, and were widely used by the population. The research\u000a      highlighted the importance\u000a      of these private retail providers, but also the weaknesses of drug sales\u000a      regulation. The same\u000a      research examined competition in the antimalarial medicine market,3.2\u000a      identifying the effects of\u000a      market concentration in rural Tanzania as having a significant impact on\u000a      the price of antimalarials.\u000a      LSHTM also contributed to research in 2009&#8212;2010 showing the widespread\u000a      market penetration of\u000a      artemisinin monotherapies in some countries3.3 via surveys of\u000a      outlets in Benin, the Democratic\u000a      Republic of the Congo (DRC), Madagascar, Uganda and Zambia.\u000a    Second, the development and strengthening of methods for collecting data\u000a      on the characteristics\u000a      and practices of private sector drug retailers. For example, a\u000a      standardised metric was developed\u000a      for comparing quantities of antimalarials - the Adult Equivalent Treatment\u000a      Dose &#8212; and retail audit\u000a      methods were developed to capture the range of antimalarials available in\u000a      an outlet, their prices\u000a      and mark-ups, and volumes sold. Many of these methods were subsequently\u000a      extended and\u000a      adapted through the multi-country ACTwatch project.3.4\u000a    Third, research studies which evaluated the impact of subsidies and\u000a      interventions. These were\u000a      carried out at sub-national (pilot) scale, using a cluster randomised\u000a      controlled trial in Kenya (2008&#8212;2009)3.5\u000a      and a controlled before-and-after study design in Tanzania (2007-2008).\u000a      Finally, a mixed-\u000a      method, multi-country study was conducted in 2010-2012 to evaluate ACT\u000a      subsidies at a national\u000a      scale in Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Niger, Nigeria, Uganda and Tanzania\u000a      (including Zanzibar).\u000a      Subsidies and supporting interventions were shown to have been effective\u000a      in improving availability,\u000a      affordability and market share in the majority of settings.3.6\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41586","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"798544","Name":"Poland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The trial results were first published in the New England Journal of\u000a        Medicine in 2008, with an\u000a      accompanying editorial stating `HYVET puts the question of the usefulness\u000a      of treating hypertension\u000a      in the very old to rest and provides important guidance to physicians and\u000a      writers of such\u000a      guidelines'.5.1\u000a    As a result, updated national and international guidelines started to\u000a      appear from 2009 onwards, all\u000a      of which cited HYVET as their main source of evidence to support change.\u000a      While no guideline is\u000a      binding, in each case these are strong recommendations intended to improve\u000a      standards, assist in\u000a      the knowledge and training of health care professionals and help patients\u000a      make informed decisions\u000a      about their care.\u000a    The 2009 Canadian Hypertension Education Program recommendations for the\u000a      management of\u000a      hypertension stated `HYVET clearly demonstrates the beneficial effects of\u000a      antihypertensive therapy\u000a      in reducing the risk of stroke and death in very elderly patients; these\u000a      results form the basis of the\u000a      new recommendation to prescribe antihypertensive therapy regardless of\u000a      age'.5.2\u000a    The 2011 American College of Cardiology and American Hypertension\u000a      Association published a\u000a      joint consensus report with the European Society of Hypertension, and a\u000a      number of American\u000a      societies for various patient groups and clinical conditions.

The\u000a      revised guidelines prepared in\u000a      consultation with the British Hypertension Society were published in 2011\u000a      based on a meta-analysis\u000a      of HYVET data &#8212; used both in its entirety and divided into patient\u000a      subgroups. The\u000a      guidelines provided a firm recommendation to offer treatment to people\u000a      aged 80 and over with\u000a      hypertension.5.4\u000a    Updated guidelines were also published in a number of other countries\u000a      including Poland (2012)\u000a      and Russia (2012).5.5 Outside Europe, organisations including\u000a      the Brazilian Society of\u000a      Hypertension (2010)5.6 and the South African Hypertension\u000a      Society (2011) also published reviewed\u000a      clinical guidance as a direct result of research findings.\u000a    A further influential guideline update was anticipated in mid-2013 in the\u000a      USA but has been delayed.\u000a      The eighth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention,\u000a      Detection, Evaluation, and\u000a      Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 8) will be published by the National\u000a      Heart, Lung and Blood\u000a      Institute, part of the US Department of Health and Human Services, and\u000a      will replace the current\u000a      2003 guidelines. The reach of these recommendations extends beyond the USA\u000a      and they will be\u000a      seen and adopted by practitioners throughout the developed world.\u000a    The HYVET trial has been widely reported by the media, with both the\u000a      national and medical press\u000a      picking up on the story and highlighting the positive findings of the\u000a      trial. In 2008 HYVET was the\u000a      subject of articles in the New York Times, the Guardian\u000a      and the BBC and British Heart Foundation\u000a      websites, all of which praised the HYVET researchers for addressing the\u000a      needs of a frequently\u000a      neglected age group.

The incidence of hypertension increases dramatically with age,\u000a      affecting around 30% of the\u000a      population aged 40-49 and 75% of those aged over 70. Estimates suggest\u000a      that about 54% of\u000a      stroke, 47% of ischaemic heart disease and 25% of other cardiovascular\u000a      diseases worldwide are\u000a      attributable to hypertension. Given that heart disease and stroke rank in\u000a      the top three causes of\u000a      mortality and disability in the Global Burden of Disease Study, strategies\u000a      to address hypertension\u000a      are an urgent priority.\u000a    While prevention of hypertension through weight control, exercise and\u000a      diet is desirable, it is difficult\u000a      to achieve, leaving control by pharmacological treatment as the most\u000a      effective intervention. Trials\u000a      have demonstrated the benefit of drug treatment on stroke mortality and\u000a      morbidity. However these\u000a      trials included very few people aged 80 years and over and there was\u000a      concern that treatment for\u000a      this age group might be harmful.\u000a    The HYVET was designed to fill the gap in this knowledge and provide\u000a      evidence for this neglected\u000a      age group. The trial was particularly important in view of ethical\u000a      concerns that elderly people were\u000a      being denied the opportunity to benefit. Conversely, if treatment was\u000a      harmful this would have major\u000a      implications for those already on treatment.\u000a    The HYVET trial was conceived and designed by Professor Chris Bulpitt\u000a      (Hammersmith Hospital,\u000a      Imperial College) and Astrid Fletcher (Professor of Epidemiology of Ageing\u000a      at LSHTM, joined in\u000a      1992 as Senior Lecturer) and led on from previous collaborative research\u000a      in trials of hypertension\u000a      treatment. HYVET was coordinated from the Hammersmith Hospital. Astrid\u000a      Fletcher was\u000a      responsible for the statistical aspects of the trial (including the sample\u000a      size, trial stopping\u000a      boundaries and plan of analysis) and of the design of add-on studies\u000a      (dementia, fracture risk,\u000a      quality of life). She participated in regular trial monitoring meetings\u000a      and contributed to the\u000a      preparation of manuscripts.\u000a    HYVET was the first large trial of hypertension treatment in the over\u000a      80s. Nearly 4,000 patients\u000a      took part in 195 centres across 13 countries in Western and Eastern\u000a      Europe, China, Australasia\u000a      and North Africa. The results showed that pharmacological treatment\u000a      reduced overall mortality and\u000a      stroke mortality and the incidence of heart failure.3.1 The\u000a      results also suggested that treatment\u000a      reduced dementia, although the evidence here &#8212; as with three other\u000a      hypertension trials that had\u000a      assessed dementia &#8212; was inconclusive.3.2 When the four trials\u000a      including HYVET were pooled in a\u000a      meta-analysis, a significant reduction in dementia from treatment was\u000a      found, although the size of\u000a      the reduction was small at 13%. The trial provided reassurance that the\u000a      trial interventions (a\u000a      thiazide diuretic and indapamide) had no adverse effects on fracture risk,\u000a      an important result in the\u000a      elderly.3.3\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41605","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"3595528","Name":"Guatemala"},{"GeoNamesId":"3202326","Name":"Croatia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3923057","Name":"Bolivia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3658394","Name":"Ecuador"},{"GeoNamesId":"783754","Name":"Albania"},{"GeoNamesId":"357994","Name":"Egypt"},{"GeoNamesId":"3585968","Name":"El Salvador"},{"GeoNamesId":"3865483","Name":"Argentina"},{"GeoNamesId":"3437598","Name":"Paraguay"},{"GeoNamesId":"3595528","Name":"Guatemala"},{"GeoNamesId":"3932488","Name":"Peru"},{"GeoNamesId":"1168579","Name":"Pakistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"3617476","Name":"Nicaragua"},{"GeoNamesId":"3489940","Name":"Jamaica"},{"GeoNamesId":"587116","Name":"Azerbaijan"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    LSHTM models measuring the cost effectiveness and impact of new vaccines\u000a      are now being used by key stakeholders and vaccine policy-makers at\u000a      national and international levels to provide evidence for and support\u000a      health initiative decisions. The models have been used by country teams\u000a      including experts from Ministries of Health and Finance, and national\u000a      vaccination programme managers. In 10 of these countries the new vaccine\u000a      in question has been introduced, benefiting many thousands of children.\u000a      Sanderson and Clark have also been regularly called upon to provide\u000a      analysis and advice for policy-makers, donors and stakeholders at the\u000a      highest level.\u000a    TRIVAC and CERVIVAC\u000a    Launched in 2010, TRIVAC is now an integral part of international efforts\u000a      to collect and disseminate data and research to help countries build or\u000a      scrutinise the case for adopting vaccines. TRIVAC has been used to\u000a      expedite national decision-making around Hib vaccination in the developing\u000a      world (through GAVI's `Hib Initiative') 5.1 and to support\u000a      country-level evidence-based decisions about adopting new vaccines in\u000a      countries who are members of the PAHO through its ProVac Initiative.5.2\u000a      It has also been used by the GAVI Alliance (a public-private health\u000a      partnership aimed at increasing international access to immunisation).\u000a    Between 2010 and July 2013, TRIVAC and\/or CERVIVAC were used in 14\u000a      vaccine cost effectiveness studies in the PAHO region. Typically, this has\u000a      followed an invitation from national policy-makers to conduct workshops\u000a      for teams made up of local Ministry of Health and immunisation officials,\u000a      during which an LSHTM researcher (usually Clark) uses the model(s) to\u000a      scrutinise data, consider plausible scenarios and carry out sensitivity\u000a      analyses.\u000a    Following these studies, a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) has been\u000a      introduced in Argentina, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador,\u000a      Nicaragua, Paraguay, Peru and Guatemala. Guatemala has also introduced a\u000a      rotavirus vaccine. CERVIVAC was launched in 2011, and a study using this\u000a      model was reviewed prior to HPV vaccination being introduced in Argentina.\u000a      Decisions are pending following studies in Bolivia, Ecuador and Jamaica.5.3\u000a    In October 2012, a TRIVAC analysis by the Costa Rican Department of\u000a      Social Security restored public confidence in PCV for children under the\u000a      age of 2, after a controversially expensive universal vaccination\u000a      programme was introduced.5.4\u000a    In 2009\/2010 TRIVAC was used by Sanderson in a World Bank\/GAVI study of\u000a      cost-effectiveness and financial consequences of new vaccine introduction\u000a      in Pakistan.5.5 Since 2010 TRIVAC has also been used by WHO to\u000a      generate annual immunisation progress reports for GAVI.5.5\u000a      These reports include estimates of deaths prevented by new vaccines in the\u000a      world's 70 poorest countries, and estimates of the health benefits\u000a      attributable to GAVI-financed vaccines.\u000a    Seven further TRIVAC cost-effectiveness analyses are currently (7\/2013)\u000a      in progress in Albania, Azerbaijan, Croatia, Egypt, Georgia, Iran and\u000a      Senegal.\u000a    The rotavirus risk\/benefit model\u000a    In April 2012 Sanderson presented the results of the LSHTM rotavirus\u000a      study at a meeting of WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on\u000a      immunisation. LSHTM evidence regarding the additional lives saved by\u000a      changing the age restrictions for initiation of the rotavirus vaccination\u000a      resulted in their review. Further LSHTM findings were presented in a\u000a      follow-up meeting which resulted in SAGE issuing that same year a new\u000a      recommendation to relax age restrictions for rotavirus vaccination. LSHTM\u000a      findings are quoted as evidence in related WHO documents.5.6, 5.7\u000a    The schedules model\u000a    Results for Hib from the schedules model were presented by Clark and\u000a      Sanderson to SAGE at meetings in October and November 2012 and April 2013.\u000a      Drawing on this evidence, at the April meeting SAGE recommended two\u000a      possible schedules countries should choose between dependent on local\u000a      epidemiology and health system considerations. SAGE also recommended use\u000a      of the schedules model to help countries with this task,5.8 and\u000a      Clark and Sanderson have developed a website for WHO that carries relevant\u000a      country-level data and analyses (www.vaccine-schedules.com).\u000a    Making research findings available to policy-makers and other users\u000a    In 2012, supported by PAHO and WHO, LSHTM launched a new website `OLIVES'\u000a      (On-line International Vaccine Economics and Statistics) which provides\u000a      access to new analyses of data from LSHTM, new data and literature reviews\u000a      from universities in the PAHO region, including details and quality\u000a      assessments of studies reviewed, and relevant extracts from international\u000a      databases.5.9 Designed to be used by policy-makers and analysts\u000a      to provide financial and health benefit evidence and support for vaccine\u000a      decisions, the site is regularly updated and provides an accessible\u000a      reference source for information on vaccine economics and statistics, for\u000a      use in conjunction with LSHTM models or otherwise.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    LSHTM researchers have developed four computer models to help\u000a      decision-makers make evidence-based choices about new vaccines and vaccine\u000a      schedules.

New\u000a      vaccines are among the most effective health interventions ever developed,\u000a      but can also be costly. The development of tools to assist policy-makers\u000a      in weighing the impact of a vaccine against cost and other related factors\u000a      has been the focus of research led by Colin Sanderson, Professor of\u000a      Operational Research in Health Care (at LSHTM since 1981, then Lecturer)\u000a      and Andrew Clark, Research Fellow (LSHTM, 2002-).\u000a    In 2007, Sanderson and Clark began developing TRIVAC, a decision-support\u000a      model that calculates the impact and cost effectiveness ratios for\u000a      childhood vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib),\u000a      pneumococcus and rotavirus (RV).3.1 Parameters such as\u000a      demography, disease burden, vaccine costs, coverage, efficacy, health\u000a      service utilisation and costs, as well as data from international sources\u000a      (e.g. WHO and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &#8212; CDC) were\u000a      assembled and loaded into the model. Data from published literature were\u000a      also used. The aim was to allow national policy-makers to estimate the\u000a      benefits of each new vaccine in terms of mortality, morbidity and\u000a      disability adjusted life-years (DALYs) based on national estimates of\u000a      disease burden and of vaccine coverage and timeliness, and regional\u000a      estimates of vaccine efficacy. Most of this work was done as part of the\u000a      Pan-American Health Organization's (PAHO) ProVac project, and TRIVAC was\u000a      launched at ProVac workshops in South and Central America in 2008.\u000a    Clark also developed the CERVIVAC model in 2011 using a similar interface\u000a      to TRIVAC to evaluate the impact and cost effectiveness of human papilloma\u000a      virus (HPV) vaccine &#8212; used to help protect against cervical cancer. This\u000a      incorporates results from the model developed by Susan Goldie's group at\u000a      Harvard to allow for different cervical cancer screening scenarios.\u000a    Between 2008 and 2012, LSHTM researchers developed a risk\/benefit model\u000a      for rotavirus to conduct scenario analyses assessing the potential\u000a      benefits of mortality reduction from rotavirus versus the risk of fatal\u000a      intussusception when the first dose of vaccine has to be administered by\u000a      15 weeks of age, compared with 1 year of age. They concluded that in\u000a      developing countries, the additional lives saved by broadening the age\u000a      restrictions for initiation of rotavirus vaccination would far outnumber\u000a      the hypothetical excess intussusception deaths that might accompany such\u000a      an approach.3.2\u000a    The schedules model was developed (2012-2013) to help evaluate the public\u000a      health impact of alternative Hib vaccine schedules. For this purpose LSHTM\u000a      researchers have re-analysed existing national and regional data about the\u000a      distribution of deaths among children from diseases that are preventable\u000a      by vaccination, and actual ages at each vaccine dose. Additional research\u000a      by Sanderson and Clark has involved assembling other data necessary for\u000a      these models, including a review of literature on the prevalence of\u000a      disabling sequelae after bacterial meningitis,3.3 analysis of\u000a      vaccination coverage at different ages in 45 low- and middle-income\u000a      countries,3.4 and reviews of data to determine variations in\u000a      vaccine efficacy measured against number of doses and region.3.5\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41798","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000aThe findings of the Marmot Review and subsequent work conducted through the Institute of Health\u000d\u000aEquity (IHE) have contributed to the shaping of England's health policy. Health inequalities\u000d\u000aare at the centre of the new health system in England. In December 2010, the government's White\u000d\u000aPaper \"Healthy Lives, Healthy People: Our strategy for public health in England\" stated that it\u000d\u000a\"responds to Professor Sir Michael Marmot's Fair Society, Healthy Lives report and adopts its life\u000d\u000acourse framework for tackling the wider determinants of health\" [a]. In 2011, the Department of\u000d\u000aHealth's Public Health Outcomes Framework set out the strategy for achieving this with the\u000d\u000aintention to follow the Review's life course framework for tackling the wider social determinants of\u000d\u000ahealth, stating that: \"In improving the wider determinants of health, we have included a range of\u000d\u000aindicators that reflect factors that can have a significant impact on our health and wellbeing. These\u000d\u000aindicators are in line with those recommended by Sir Michael Marmot in his report Fair Society,\u000d\u000aHealthy Lives in 2010, and focus on the \"causes of the causes\" of health inequalities. Wherever\u000d\u000apossible, the indicators will follow the formulation published by the Marmot Review team and the\u000d\u000aLondon Health Observatory\" [b]. The principles set out in these documents were then followed by\u000d\u000ainequalities duties - introduced for the first time by the Health and Social Care Act 2012. As part of\u000d\u000ademocratic scrutiny of these policies, members of the team have given oral and written evidence to\u000d\u000aseveral Select Committees [c].\u000d\u000aThe Institute has worked with the Department of Health and other national and local bodies,\u000d\u000aincluding NHS bodies and local government to help embed a social determinants approach to\u000d\u000ahealth inequalities throughout the health system in England, including advising and influencing\u000d\u000anational organisations such as the Department of Health, local authorities, Clinical Commissioning\u000d\u000aGroups, health sector and public health professionals. The IHE's work has had measureable and\u000d\u000aimportant impacts across England, including influencing national and local government, the NHS,\u000d\u000athird and private sector organisations.\u000d\u000aThe shape of national health services has been influenced by our work. Public Health England\u000d\u000a(PHE) was established in April 2013, bringing together specialists from more than 70 organisations\u000d\u000ainto a single public health service. The organisation reports that \"the recommendations of the\u000d\u000a[Marmot] report have informed the design of PHE in general, and the Health and Wellbeing\u000d\u000adirectorate in particular\" [d].\u000d\u000aOver 70% of local authorities are now working to embed `Marmot principles' in their approaches\u000d\u000ato improving health and reducing inequalities [e]. For example, Coventry Council describe its\u000d\u000aapproach as follows:\u000d\u000a\"Coventry is a Marmot City, and the aim of the Health and Well-being Board is to improve\u000d\u000ahealth and well-being levels in Coventry so they match the best in the Country. The Health\u000d\u000aand Well-being Strategy is based around the six Marmot Themes which were identified in\u000d\u000aFebruary 2010 by Professor Michael Marmot in his report \"Fair Society, Healthy Lives\" (link\u000d\u000abelow). These themes identify the wider social determinants of ill-health and have been\u000d\u000aadopted by the Coventry Health and Well-being Board\" [f].\u000d\u000aThe Institute is engaged in a high profile programme of activity to encourage and support health\u000d\u000aprofessionals to tackle health inequalities. The programme has been enthusiastically supported\u000d\u000aby Royal Colleges, the British Medical Association (BMA) and other relevant organisations who\u000d\u000ahave provided many practical ideas for action and made commitments to embed them over the\u000d\u000anext few years. For example, the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) committed to:\u000d\u000a\"ensuring that health inequalities are taken into account across all areas of RCGP activity and\u000d\u000apolicy\" and the Royal College of Nursing committed to \"developing the workforce in terms of\u000d\u000aemphasis on the awareness of public health and social determinants of health in pre and post\u000d\u000aregistration training\" [g].\u000d\u000aWe have also been commissioned internationally to expand the impact of this work. The WHO\u000d\u000aRegional Office for Europe commissioned us to lead a review to support the development and\u000d\u000aimplementation of the new common health policy framework for Europe: Health 2020. It was\u000d\u000acarried out to answer demands from policy makers and public health advocates for practical\u000d\u000aguidance on identifying \"policies that work\" to reduce the inequities in health1 between and within\u000d\u000alow-, medium- and high-income European countries [h]. The European Commission awarded a\u000d\u000acontract for IHE to lead a consortium to review progress made by its Member States in reducing\u000d\u000ahealth inequalities action and recommend action by Governments and the EC [i]. IHE has\u000d\u000aestablished international partnerships to support implementation of work on social determinants,\u000d\u000aincluding a sub-network of WHO European Health Cities network [j]. IHE has also worked with the\u000d\u000aPan American Health Organisation (PAHO) to embed social determinants of health in its five year\u000d\u000astrategy, as shown in its recent update to Health in the Americas [k].\u000d\u000a","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000aIn November 2008, Professor Sir Michael Marmot and his team at UCL were asked by the\u000d\u000aSecretary of State for Health to chair an independent review to propose the most effective\u000d\u000aevidence-based strategies for reducing health inequalities in England.

The initial aims were to investigate the causes of\u000d\u000ainequalities in disease during the working life, such as the inverse social gradient in cardiovascular\u000d\u000adisease in Britain. In addition to the contribution of unhealthy behaviours and traditional risk factors\u000d\u000a(such as high blood pressure) in heart disease and diabetes, the Whitehall II study showed the\u000d\u000aimportance of psychosocial factors such as work stress, unfairness, and work-family conflict to\u000d\u000asocio-economic inequalities [1, 2].\u000d\u000aMarmot was Chair of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health set up by the World Health\u000d\u000aOrganization in 2005 to support tackling the social causes of poor health and avoidable health\u000d\u000ainequalities. The final report, entitled Closing the Gap in a Generation was published in 2008 [3].\u000d\u000aAt the request of the British Government, Marmot then chaired an independent review to propose\u000d\u000athe most effective evidence-based strategies for reducing health inequalities in England. The\u000d\u000aReview was tasked with identifying relevant evidence, showing how this could be translated into\u000d\u000apolicy, and advising on indicators and targets. The UCL secretariat team set up nine task groups in\u000d\u000atopic areas relevant to the review (e.g. the built environment, early years, employment and work).\u000d\u000aEach was made up of academic and practitioner experts in their area. The task groups produced\u000d\u000aevidence-based reports and proposals for action. These reports provided a basis for the final\u000d\u000areport, which was also informed by focus groups, consultation responses, policy dialogues and\u000d\u000ameetings with professionals. The final report was therefore able to bring together and draw\u000d\u000aconclusions from a wide range of up-to-date, expert research and data. Fair Society, Healthy Lives:\u000d\u000aA Strategic Review of Health Inequalities in England Post-2010 was published in February 2010\u000d\u000a[4] and had six main policy objectives, based around the social determinants of health:\u000d\u000aA.

Key\u000d\u000a      findings will be published in a series of papers in the Lancet in November\u000d\u000a      2013. While it is too early\u000d\u000a      to assess the impact on transmission, the papers provide population\u000d\u000a      estimates showing\u000d\u000a      considerable uptake of interventions including, HIV testing and HPV\u000d\u000a      vaccination and chlamydia\u000d\u000a      screening, interventions that were influenced by Natsal-2.\u000d\u000a    The Natsal surveys were undertaken in collaboration with colleagues at\u000d\u000a      the London School of\u000d\u000a      Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and NatCen Social Research and the Health\u000d\u000a      Protection Agency\u000d\u000a      (Natsal-3).

They were introduced in\u000d\u000a      England in May 2009, in Wales and Scotland in January 2010 and in Northern\u000d\u000a      Ireland in October 2010 [a]. The charts are available in two\u000d\u000a      formats: A5 charts that are included in the personal child health record\u000d\u000a      (PCHR) known as the \"red book\", and A4 professional charts (0-4 years,\u000d\u000a      2-18 years, NICM). All new mothers receive a copy of the PCHR, [b]\u000d\u000a      so that in 2012, for example, the PCHR was distributed to all parents of\u000d\u000a      the 813,000 infants born in the four countries that year. The charts and\u000d\u000a      their interpretation were also discussed in the government's Birth to\u000d\u000a        Five book, produced by the Department of Health in 2009 and\u000d\u000a      distributed free to all new parents in England until 2011; in Wales a\u000d\u000a      bilingual edition is issued [c].\u000d\u000a    The A4 professional charts are used in primary, secondary and tertiary\u000d\u000a      care, and for the year to April 2013 the numbers sold by the publishers,\u000d\u000a      Harlow Printing Limited, for each chart were as follows:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      0-4 years - 400,000 copies\u000d\u000a      2-18 years - 287,000 copies\u000d\u000a      NICM - 95,000 copies [d]\u000a\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    These numbers are impressive, not only in terms of their size, but also\u000d\u000a      because they show how rapidly the UK-WHO charts have superseded the\u000d\u000a      previous British 1990 charts (amounting to 90% of total growth chart\u000d\u000a      sales).\u000d\u000a    As they enable practitioners to recognise the range of normal\u000d\u000a      development, the UK-WHO charts are uniquely well designed to achieve UK\u000d\u000a      government policy aims in relation to child health, namely with regard to\u000d\u000a      early recognition of growth disorders and risk factors for obesity, as\u000d\u000a      defined in the Healthy Child Programme [b, e]. In June 2013, the\u000d\u000a      CPCM chart was released. This is a modification of the main school age\u000d\u000a      chart for use in children with growth or nutritional problems. It extends\u000d\u000a      to age 20 years and features a body mass index (BMI) chart; low and high\u000d\u000a      lines to monitor unusually short, thin or overweight children; puberty\u000d\u000a      phase specific thresholds to assess small children with late onset puberty\u000d\u000a      and tall children with early onset puberty [f].\u000d\u000a    The UK work has also had an impact internationally. For example, the 0-4\u000d\u000a      years and NICM charts have been adapted for use in New Zealand [g],\u000d\u000a      where they have been used since mid-2010. From January 2013, they have\u000d\u000a      also been in use in Ireland [h], where all newborn infants are\u000d\u000a      assessed using them. As an indication of reach, 72,000 babies were born in\u000d\u000a      Ireland in 2012 [i].\u000d\u000a    The guiding principles in the chart design were that the charts should be\u000d\u000a      evidence-based, useful and easy to use &#8212; and hence more likely to be\u000d\u000a      effective. Parents often claim to understand growth charts, yet they show\u000d\u000a      only limited comprehension when tested [j]. Therefore the charts\u000d\u000a      were developed with better layout than before, and with instructions for\u000d\u000a      the PCHR and A4 charts targeted at their respective audiences, parents and\u000d\u000a      professionals [k].\u000d\u000a    The new and improved elements on the charts also benefit both parents and\u000d\u000a      professionals. These include a reduced emphasis on the 50th\u000d\u000a      centile, as sometimes parents expect all `normal' children to grow along\u000d\u000a      the 50th centile line. On the new charts however, there are more centile\u000d\u000a      labels and the curve labels sit on the 50th centile to assist orientation\u000d\u000a      when plotting and interpreting [l]. A `dip' in weight between 2-4\u000d\u000a      weeks is no longer seen, as the charts have more information on weight\u000d\u000a      gain in the first few weeks, and they allow for the average tendency for\u000d\u000a      infants to show a slower net weight gain up to age 2 weeks [l].\u000d\u000a    The new adult height predictor tells parents how tall their child will\u000d\u000a      be, a matter of endless interest. It also allows professionals to compare\u000d\u000a      the prediction with the parents' heights, and hence detect a possible\u000d\u000a      growth disorder. For this a graphical parent height comparator is\u000d\u000a      provided, which improves on the British 1990 calculator by avoiding the\u000d\u000a      need for any calculations.\u000d\u000a    Child obesity is a considerable public health concern, and these charts\u000d\u000a      provide better tools for assessing possible weight problems in children.\u000d\u000a      In the past, BMI in children has been relatively little used as a\u000d\u000a      screening tool, due to the need for calculation and a separate BMI chart.\u000d\u000a      The new charts include a BMI look-up, which provides the BMI centile from\u000d\u000a      the height and weight centiles, avoiding both BMI calculation and a BMI\u000d\u000a      chart. This makes it easy to plot the child's BMI centile over time, and\u000d\u000a      it is likely to considerably increase parental and professional awareness\u000d\u000a      of a child's overweight, which parents are poor at recognising [m].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Research at the UCL Institute of Child Health underpinned the update in\u000d\u000a      2009 of children's growth charts, which allow for more accurate\u000d\u000a      determination of a child's growth pattern and provide better tools for\u000d\u000a      assessing possible weight problems in children.

Following a recommendation by the English Department of Health\u000d\u000a      (DH) Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN), they were replaced\u000d\u000a      by new charts based on the World Health Organization (WHO) 2006 growth\u000d\u000a      standard. These new UK-WHO charts were designed by a Growth Chart Expert\u000d\u000a      Group commissioned through the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child\u000d\u000a      Health (RCPCH), which included Professors Tim Cole and Gary Butler, and Dr\u000d\u000a      Helen Bedford (all UCL Institute of Child Health). The Expert Group was\u000d\u000a      chaired by Professor Charlotte Wright (Glasgow University), who is using\u000d\u000a      her chart development work as a separate REF case study.\u000d\u000a    The charts for 0 to 4 year olds, launched in May 2009, used WHO growth\u000d\u000a      standard data from two weeks to four years, and reanalysed birth data from\u000d\u000a      the British 1990 reference [1]. Further charts extending the age\u000d\u000a      range to 18 years were launched in May 2012, based on the same British\u000d\u000a      1990 reference as before but to an improved design. In addition more\u000d\u000a      specialised \"close monitoring\" charts were developed for neonates and\u000d\u000a      infants (NICM) and childhood and puberty (CPCM). They incorporate a series\u000d\u000a      of innovative plotting aids devised by Professor Cole, who was thus\u000d\u000a      responsible for the following features:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      Centiles for birth weight, length and head circumference for 23-42\u000d\u000a        weeks of gestation constructed using Cole's LMS method [2, 3].\u000d\u000a        For this Cole used the LMS method to update pre-existing birth centiles\u000d\u000a        to augment the WHO growth standard (which lacked preterm data).\u000d\u000a      A Body Mass Index (BMI) look-up that converts height centile and\u000d\u000a        weight centile to a BMI centile [4]. Here Cole used the strong\u000d\u000a        relation between centiles of weight, height and BMI to predict BMI\u000d\u000a        centile. As a result, knowing centiles of weight and height, BMI centile\u000d\u000a        can be predicted to reasonable accuracy without having to calculate or\u000d\u000a        plot BMI on a centile chart.\u000d\u000a      An adult height predictor, a nomogram to convert the child's current\u000d\u000a        height centile (at any age) to a predicted adult height, adjusted for\u000d\u000a        regression to the mean [5]. This was joint work with Wright, and\u000d\u000a        a simplified version was included with the growth chart. As well as\u000d\u000a        being popular with parents and children, the height prediction is used\u000d\u000a        in conjunction with the parent height comparator (see below) to detect\u000d\u000a        growth disorders.\u000d\u000a      A parent height comparator, a nomogram to compare the child's height\u000d\u000a        centile to the mid-parent height centile adjusted for regression to the\u000d\u000a        mean. Again, in joint work with Wright, it provides a graphical method\u000d\u000a        to calculate an improved version of mid-parent height that, with the\u000d\u000a        height predictor (above), detects disordered growth where the two height\u000d\u000a        estimates are discordant.\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a    Centiles for height and weight for three phases of puberty were\u000d\u000a      constructed using the LMS method. This was joint work with Butler and\u000d\u000a      Wright, where the five Tanner pubertal stages were rationalised into three\u000d\u000a      pubertal phases, and reference centiles for height and weight were\u000d\u000a      constructed for children in each of the three phases separately. Elements\u000d\u000a      of these centiles were incorporated in the CPCM charts to monitor growth\u000d\u000a      in delayed puberty.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"41842","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"927384","Name":"Malawi"},{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"},{"GeoNamesId":"337996","Name":"Ethiopia"},{"GeoNamesId":"226074","Name":"Uganda"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"1282988","Name":"Nepal"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    As a result of the underpinning research described above, scale-up of\u000a      participatory women's groups has begun in various parts of India. Our work\u000a      has also begun to influence policy in other low and middle-income\u000a      countries. The results of our meta-analysis influenced WHO's decision to\u000a      develop a training module on the intervention for global dissemination.\u000a    From 2008-13, UCL and Ekjut worked to scale up the intervention in the\u000a      high-mortality eastern Indian states of Jharkhand and Odisha. In total,\u000a      the project led to work with 4,676 women's groups across 17 districts in\u000a      four states, covering a population of over two million people [a].\u000a      In 2012, the Department of Health and Family Welfare in Jharkhand\u000a      incorporated the intervention into the curriculum of the Accredited Social\u000a      Health Activist, a cadre of community health volunteers working in the\u000a      country's poorest areas, and rolled out the intervention across the state\u000a      [b]. In 2013, the intervention was rolled out in the state of\u000a      Odisha in a collaboration between the Departments of Health, Women and\u000a      Child Development, and Rural Development, together with the UK Department\u000a      for International Development (DFID). DFID India made the decision to\u000a      promote the women's group intervention as a cost-effective strategy to\u000a      improve maternal and newborn health and to test its application to other\u000a      health issues, including maternal and child under-nutrition [c].\u000a      The roll-out in Odisha covers a population of over one million women [d].\u000a    The results of our work have received vast media coverage in India and\u000a      internationally. An article in The Hindu in 2010 interviewed\u000a      mothers who had benefited from the programme. One described the impact of\u000a      the programme as follows: \"Earlier, we didn't clean our hands before\u000a        cooking and eating. We'd just leave the baby and go off to work. Now we\u000a        clean and grow vegetables ourselves. We keep the water clean in the\u000a        house. Women in the village help one another and sometimes pool money to\u000a        transport someone to hospital for delivery and visits to the doctor.\"\u000a      Another said: \"Earlier, when a problem arose, we would pray. Now, I go\u000a        to a doctor at the slightest problem. I ate spinach, fish and vegetables\u000a        during and after my recent pregnancy. I breast-fed for six months from\u000a        the first day\" [e]. This story was also covered by the Guardian\u000a      and Time, as well as on Indian national television [f].\u000a      The New York Times also reported favourably on the publication of\u000a      our first Mumbai trial, where the results were less successful, reflecting\u000a      on the use of evidence in global policy and the political pressure to show\u000a      only positive findings [g].\u000a    In Malawi, the intervention has been adopted as a model for improving\u000a      maternal and newborn health by the Ministry of Health, UNFPA and the\u000a      Uchembere Network. Project team members participated in the development of\u000a      the Government of Malawi's plan for community interventions, part of the\u000a      Health Sector Strategic Plan (2011-6) and the Malawi Road Map for\u000a      Accelerating the Reduction of Maternal and Neonatal Mortality [h].\u000a      Further media coverage for MaiKhanda included an interview with Voice of\u000a      America in June 2013 [i].\u000a    Through the non-governmental organisation Women and Children First, we\u000a      are supporting further uptake of the women's group intervention in\u000a      Bangladesh, Malawi, Ethiopia and Uganda, using an implementation guide\u000a      developed jointly with UCL, the Perinatal Care Project of the Diabetic\u000a      Society of Bangladesh and Ekjut India [j]. The organisation aims\u000a      to extend the thematic content of the women's groups model to test its\u000a      effectiveness for addressing other maternal and child health issues,\u000a      including family planning, prevention of mother to child transmission of\u000a      HIV, and under- five's health and nutrition.\u000a    In December 2012, Costello and Prost participated in a World Health\u000a      Organisation (WHO) workshop to design a module on community mobilisation\u000a      with women's groups for maternal and newborn health, which will supplement\u000a      WHO's existing guidance on Caring for Newborns and Children in the\u000a      Community [k]. The results of our meta-analysis were also\u000a      presented to WHO in early 2013 and influenced their decision to develop a\u000a      training module for community health workers intended for global\u000a      dissemination; this will have an impact on developing country health\u000a      systems around the world [l]. The meta-analysis results were also\u000a      launched at a large event in the Houses of Parliament and at the Women\u000a      Deliver International Conference, both in May 2013.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    UCL researchers and overseas partners have developed a successful\u000a      community intervention to improve maternal and newborn health, which is\u000a      now saving lives in India's poorest communities and is being taken up in\u000a      other low- and middle-income countries.

South Asian and African\u000a      nations shoulder a substantial proportion of this burden.\u000a    From 2000 to 2004, Professor Anthony Costello and Dr David Osrin at the\u000a      UCL Institute for Global Health (IGH) worked with MIRA, an NGO in Nepal,\u000a      to develop and test a community intervention, which involved women's\u000a      groups in identifying, prioritising, and addressing common problems during\u000a      the perinatal period using participatory methods. The intervention was\u000a      tested in a large community cluster-randomised controlled trial (RCT) in\u000a      Nepal, where it led to a 30% reduction in neonatal mortality [1].\u000a      The intervention increased care-seeking during pregnancy and institutional\u000a      deliveries, and was also linked to improved newborn care practices in the\u000a      home.\u000a    From 2005 to 2012, Costello and Osrin, along with Dr Tim Colbourn, Dr\u000a      Edward Fottrell (both IGH) and Dr Audrey Prost (UCL Institute of Child\u000a      Health) worked with partner organisations in India, Malawi, Nepal and\u000a      Bangladesh to test the impact of the women's group intervention on\u000a      maternal and newborn health in other under-served communities.\u000a    In rural India, the trial of the women's group intervention led by our\u000a      partner, Ekjut, resulted in a 45% reduction in newborn deaths over two\u000a      years in rural, largely indigenous communities among the poorest in India\u000a      [2]. Further research also found that, in this rural trial,\u000a      mortality reduction was greatest among the poorest mothers, suggesting\u000a      that women's groups can be an effective way of targeting inequalities [3].\u000a      The intervention's evaluation won the Society for Clinical Trials' 2011 Trial\u000a        of the Year award.\u000a    The intervention was also tested in slum communities in Mumbai, India, in\u000a      a project led by local organisation SNEHA (Society for Nutrition,\u000a      Education &amp; Health Action) in collaboration with Osrin. In this\u000a      setting, the effects were not as great as for the rural population. One\u000a      reason for this was that newborn survival was already better than in the\u000a      other settings in which groups were implemented [4].\u000a    Research in Malawi has been ongoing since 2003, when the MaiMwana project\u000a      was set-up by UCL researchers Sonia Lewycka and Mikey Rosato to test the\u000a      effect of the women's group intervention in Africa for the first time. The\u000a      results of the MaiMwana women's group intervention were impressive: a 74%\u000a      reduction in maternal mortality, and a 41% reduction in newborn mortality\u000a      [5]. In 2007 another less-intensive women's group intervention,\u000a      MaiKhanda, was tested, also by cluster randomised trial, by UCL\u000a      researchers Tim Colbourn and Bejoy Nambiar. MaiKhanda also achieved\u000a      significant results: a 16% reduction in perinatal mortality (stillbirths\u000a      and deaths in the first week of life) and a 23% reduction in newborn\u000a      mortality in areas where the women's group intervention was combined with\u000a      a health facility quality improvement intervention [6].\u000a    The intervention did not have the same impact on mortality as observed in\u000a      Nepal and rural India when applied to a population of around 500,000 in\u000a      rural Bangladesh with partners BADAS-PCP between 2005 and 2007. This\u000a      caused us to question why the intervention had been so successful in some\u000a      settings but not in others and we concluded that population coverage of\u000a      the intervention was likely to be key (i.e. the ratio of community women's\u000a      group per population). We therefore decided to test the intervention at a\u000a      higher population coverage, increasing the number of groups from a\u000a      coverage of one per 1,400 to one per 300 population. The results showed\u000a      that when delivered at this higher population coverage and with greater\u000a      participation or pregnant women and women of reproductive age, the\u000a      intervention reduced newborn mortality by more than one third and was\u000a      highly cost-effective [7].\u000a    In 2013, a meta-analysis led by Prost and Colbourn collated data from\u000a      seven trials testing the impact of women's groups, and found that the\u000a      intervention reduced maternal mortality by around a third, or, in trials\u000a      where the groups had greater than 30% of pregnant women as members, by 55%\u000a      [8]. This is the first time that a community intervention other\u000a      than training Traditional Birth Attendants has demonstrated an impact on\u000a      maternal mortality at a population level.\u000a    Partner organisations:\u000a    \u000a      Ekjut, India: http:\/\/ekjutindia.org\u000a\u000a      SNEHA, India: http:\/\/www.snehamumbai.org\/\u000a\u000a      MaiMwana Project, Malawi: http:\/\/www.maimwana.malawi.net\/MaiMwana\/Home.html\u000a\u000a      Diabetic Association of Bangladesh: http:\/\/www.dab-bd.org\/pcp.php\u000a\u000a      MIRA, Nepal http:\/\/www.mira.org.np\/mira\/\u000a\u000a      MaiKhanda, Malawi http:\/\/www.maikhandatrust.org\/About_Us.html\u000a\u000a    \u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42220","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1668284","Name":"Taiwan"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1861060","Name":"Japan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2017370","Name":"Russia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2658434","Name":"Switzerland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Impacts include: health and welfare; public policy and services;\u000d\u000a      practitioners and services Main beneficiaries include: patients; NICE;\u000d\u000a      health professionals; industry; international guideline bodies\u000d\u000a    The relatively healthy elderly aged 80 and over are one of the fastest\u000d\u000a      growing sectors of the population, both in the UK and globally (in both\u000d\u000a      developed and developing countries). Systolic blood pressure tends to rise\u000d\u000a      with age as does the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and\u000d\u000a      dementia. The rise in blood pressure with ageing means that a substantial\u000d\u000a      proportion of those aged 80 and over suffer from hypertension, estimated\u000d\u000a      at ~70% in the UK (Health Survey for England 2009). The results of the\u000d\u000a      HYVET research not only show the reduction in risk of cardiovascular\u000d\u000a      events but the identification of a safe goal blood pressure in this group\u000d\u000a      and are applicable to a large and growing group. This Imperial-led study\u000d\u000a      was the first in this age group and has directly influenced hypertension\u000d\u000a      guidelines internationally.\u000d\u000a    The results from HYVET have shaped hypertension guidelines in the UK,\u000d\u000a      Europe, Canada, Japan, the USA, China, Russia, Latin America, and South\u000d\u000a      Africa. In the UK the NICE guidelines (2011) indicate that people aged &#8805;80\u000d\u000a      should be treated [1] and the consultation on new indicators for the UK\u000d\u000a      2013\/14 Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) proposes inclusion of new\u000d\u000a      indicators specifically for the over 80s, using the HYVET goal systolic\u000d\u000a      blood pressure [2].\u000d\u000a    The European guidelines (2009) now recommend that antihypertensive\u000d\u000a      treatment can be extended to help patients aged 80 years and above,\u000d\u000a      stating that `gap in the evidence has been filled with...the results of\u000d\u000a      HYVET' [3].\u000d\u000a    The Canadian Hypertension Education Program (2009) `specifically\u000d\u000a      recommends that age not be used as a factor in prescribing' based on HYVET\u000d\u000a      results [4]. The Japanese guidelines (2009) now specify that hypertension\u000d\u000a      should be treated in patients of all ages [5; chapter 3] and the adequate\u000d\u000a      antihypertensive treatment is recommended in elderly patients (chapter 8).\u000d\u000a      Guidelines on hypertension in China, Latin America, Russia [6-8] also\u000d\u000a      recommend treatment of high blood pressure in the elderly and cite HYVET.\u000d\u000a      Beyond the ten sources of evidence provided, we can also evidence changes\u000d\u000a      to guidelines in Taiwan and South Africa.\u000d\u000a    A consensus document in the US on hypertension in the elderly (American\u000d\u000a      College of Cardiology Foundation\/American Heart Foundation, 2011)\u000d\u000a      concludes that HYVET provides clear evidence that blood pressure lowering\u000d\u000a      drugs are associated with definite cardiovascular benefits in patients 80\u000d\u000a      years and over and US guidelines from the National Heart Lung and Blood\u000d\u000a      Institute (JNC8) are expected to include HYVET at their next update [9].\u000d\u000a    More generally, medical professionals globally have benefitted in terms\u000d\u000a      of receiving clearer guidance, elderly individuals benefit in health terms\u000d\u000a      and health service providers in economic terms. A Swiss group have\u000d\u000a      calculated that applying the results of HYVET means a lower total cost per\u000d\u000a      patient receiving antihypertensive treatment as compared to an untreated\u000d\u000a      group and that the additional medication cost is covered by the reduction\u000d\u000a      of costs related to the treatment of strokes, myocardial infarction and\u000d\u000a      heart failure. The potential decrease in incident dementia and fracture\u000d\u000a      suggests that this may be an underestimate [10].\u000d\u000a    The pharmaceutical company (Servier) that provided part of the funding\u000d\u000a      and the medication for HYVET report that in the company financial year\u000d\u000a      during which the HYVET results were published their own sales of\u000d\u000a      indapamide (the first line medication used in HYVET) rose by 4% across 11\u000d\u000a      countries. Data provided by Servier also show generic indapamide sales\u000d\u000a      increasing year on year from 2009 to 2012 with the largest increase in the\u000d\u000a      Sustained Release formulation as used in the trial.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Before the Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET) it was not\u000d\u000a      clear whether people aged 80 and over with hypertension should receive\u000d\u000a      antihypertensive treatment. The over 80s are one of the fastest growing\u000d\u000a      groups in society and are at high risk of hypertension and its sequelae\u000d\u000a      due to age. HYVET demonstrated benefit of treatment including reduced\u000d\u000a      mortality and cardiovascular comorbidity. Guidelines around the world for\u000d\u000a      the treatment of hypertension have changed as a result. In the UK it is\u000d\u000a      proposed that the Quality Outcomes Framework (QOF) for GPs now includes\u000d\u000a      those over 80 and uses the target blood pressure used in HYVET.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Health","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    Imperial College London\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Imperial College London","InstitutionName":"Imperial College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10003270}],"Panel":"A         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    \u000a(1) Bulpitt, C., Beckett, N., Cooke, J., Dumitrascu, D., Gil-Extremera,\u000d\u000a      B., Nachev, C., Nunes, M., Peters, R., Staessen, J., Thijs, L., on behalf\u000d\u000a      of the HYVET-pilot investigators.

In response to the new\u000a      research, Member States and\u000a      international partners requested WHO to review the guidelines on sodium\u000a      intake for adults, and\u000a      also for the first time to generate a guideline on sodium intake for\u000a      children. At the same time,\u000a      guidelines for potassium intakes for adults and children were requested as\u000a      there were none\u000a      previously.\u000a    The 2012 WHO guidelines [1, 2] have set the world standards on sodium and\u000a      potassium intakes in\u000a      both adults and children, and are a template being used by governments,\u000a      policy makers and\u000a      industry for reductions in sodium and increases in potassium intakes\u000a      worldwide [3, 4]. Both\u000a      guidelines cite Imperial College-led research. The guidelines recommend a\u000a      reduction in sodium\u000a      intake to &lt;2 g\/day sodium (5 g\/day salt) in adults to reduce the\u000a      worldwide burden of high blood\u000a      pressure, heart disease and stroke, and a reduction in sodium intake to\u000a      control blood pressure in\u000a      children (intake to be based on the energy requirements of children\u000a      relative to those of adults) [1].\u000a      For potassium, WHO recommends an increase in potassium intake from food to\u000a      reduce blood\u000a      pressure and risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke and coronary heart\u000a      disease in adults with a\u000a      suggested potassium intake of at least 90 mmol\/day (3510 mg\/day); and an\u000a      increase in potassium\u000a      intake from food to control blood pressure in children (intake to be based\u000a      on the energy\u000a      requirements of children relative to those of adults) [2].\u000a    As noted in section 2, the WHO guidelines were developed by the Nutrition\u000a      Guidance Expert\u000a      Advisory Group (NUGAG) Subgroup on Diet and Health (Geneva, March 2011 and\u000a      Seoul,\u000a      November 2011) with substantial intellectual input from Professor Elliott\u000a      and other subject-matter\u000a      experts, using the WHO evidence-informed guideline development procedures\u000a      and the Grading of\u000a      Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria.\u000a      The guidelines\u000a      drew on results of systematic reviews and meta-analyses undertaken by WHO\u000a      staff and their\u000a      consultants working with the subject matter experts, including Professor\u000a      Elliott. Meetings of\u000a      NUGAG and its subject-matter experts including Professor Elliott were held\u000a      to agree on study\u000a      design and inclusion\/exclusion criteria for the supporting meta-analyses,\u000a      which were subsequently\u000a      published in the peer-reviewed literature (research refs. 4, 5). These\u000a      publications in BMJ (2013)\u000a      provided the science-base for both guidelines; as noted in the BMJ\u000a      papers \"WHO agreed with the\u000a        publication of this systematic review in a scientific journal as it\u000a        serves as the background evidence\u000a        review for updating the WHO guideline on sodium intake for adults and\u000a        for the establishment of a\u000a        guideline on sodium intake in children [for establishing the WHO\u000a        guideline on potassium intake]\u000a        and should therefore be widely available.\" The author contributions\u000a      state that Professor Elliott and\u000a      colleagues \"provided substantial intellectual input on research methods\u000a        and interpretation of\u000a        results.

The\u000a      report adopting the Global Monitoring Framework and Voluntary Global\u000a        Targets for the Prevention\u000a        and Control of NCDs dated 27 May 2013, following the 2011\u000a        Political Declaration of the United\u000a        Nations High Level Meeting on NCDs, cites the WHO sodium guideline\u000a      [3; page 43] and both the\u000a      sodium and potassium guidelines as relevant WHO tools to achieve the\u000a      targets [3; page 47]. A joint\u000a      technical meeting convened by WHO and The George Institute for Global\u000a      Health was held in\u000a      Sydney, Australia, in March 2013 (attended by Professor Elliott as a\u000a      subject-matter expert and\u000a      Chair of session) to agree methods to take forward salt reduction and\u000a      iodine fortification strategies\u000a      in public health. The report of that meeting [4] cites both the WHO sodium\u000a      and potassium\u000a      guidelines, based on the work of WHO staff, Professor Elliott and\u000a      colleagues, as key documents\u000a      \"to help develop and guide national policies [on sodium and potassium]\u000a        and public health nutrition\u000a        programmes\".\u000a    Imperial College-led research has also influenced US CDC efforts\u000a      underpinning the US\u000a      government strategy for monitoring population-wide sodium intakes. Thus\u000a      our demonstration of the\u000a      use of spot urines as a valid, low-cost alternative to 24-hr urine\u000a      collections for monitoring\u000a      population sodium intakes (research ref. 6) has had impact on the US CDC\u000a      approach to use of\u000a      biomarkers for monitoring sodium intakes in the US population [5, page 13;\u000a      6]. INTERMAP and\u000a      INTERSALT are cited by CDC as being among the top ten resources on sodium\u000a      reduction and\u000a      biomarkers [5, page 14 and 15]. CDC's own research using INTERSALT\u000a      equations developed by\u000a      Imperial College (research ref. 6) concludes \"[INTERSALT] equations\u000a        could be used with a single\u000a        spot urine specimen to monitor temporal trends in population mean sodium\u000a        intake among young\u000a        US adults... as part of a national surveillance system critical to\u000a        evaluating US efforts to reduce\u000a        sodium intake\" [6]. CDC is now taking this forward in its approach\u000a      to evaluating sodium intakes in\u000a      the US population. Specifically it is using spot urines collected in the\u000a      National Health and Nutrition\u000a      Examination Survey (NHANES) to examine trends over time in sodium intakes\u000a      in the US adult\u000a      population [7].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research by Professor Elliott and colleagues at Imperial College on\u000a      worldwide salt and potassium\u000a      intakes, their relationships to blood pressure, and co-authored systematic\u000a      reviews and meta-analyses\u000a      of their effects in adults and children on blood pressure and\u000a      cardiovascular disease &#8212; and\u000a      potential adverse effects &#8212; has played an instrumental role in developing\u000a      international\u000a      guidelines and public policy on sodium reduction strategies.

In the INTERSALT study, 24 hour\u000a      urinary sodium collections\u000a      (the 'gold standard' measurement of sodium intake) were obtained from more\u000a      than 10,000 men-and\u000a      women aged 20 to 59 years from 52 different population groups across 32\u000a      countries. This\u000a      study created the largest set of standardized data on 24 hour urinary\u000a      sodium samples in the world.\u000a      The INTERMAP study obtained 24 hour urinary sodium collections from men\u000a      and women aged 40-to\u000a      59 years from 17 population groups in 4 countries: China, Japan, the\u000a      United Kingdom, and the\u000a      United States. Both studies were led jointly by Professor Elliott\u000a      (Imperial College London from\u000a      1995) and Northwestern University Chicago. In 1996 analyses of the\u000a      INTERSALT study, led by\u000a      Imperial College researchers, provided updated estimates of the size of\u000a      associations of sodium\u000a      intake to blood pressure both within and across the 52 populations\u000a      studied, including significant\u000a      associations of sodium intake with the rise of blood pressure with age\u000a      (key to determining the high\u000a      prevalence of raised blood pressure and hypertension at older ages) (1).\u000a      In addition to 24 hour\u000a      urine collections, the INTERMAP study collected blood pressure readings\u000a      and multiple 24 -hour\u000a      dietary recalls. Except in China, where sodium urine values were higher,\u000a      the INTERMAP study &#8212; reported,\u000a      in 2003, similar findings to that of the INTERSALT study with respect to\u000a      24 hour urinary\u000a      sodium excretions (Stamler J, Elliott P, Chan Q. INTERMAP Appendix Tables.\u000a      J Hum. Hypertens-.\u000a      2003; 17:759 -775). Results for US adults indicate that 24 hour urinary\u000a      sodium excretions were\u000a      well in excess of the limits recommended in the Dietary Guidelines for\u000a        Americans 2010, averaging-4.2\u000a      g of sodium per day in men and 3.3 g in women. In the UK, averages were\u000a      3.7 g of sodium per\u000a      day in men and 2.9 g in women.\u000a    Professor Elliott and Dr Brown drew heavily on this evidence in their\u000a      analysis of sodium intakes\u000a      worldwide (3) for the World Health Organization (WHO) Forum and Technical\u000a      Meeting on\u000a      Reducing Salt Intakes in Populations held in Paris, 2006\u000a      (http:\/\/www.who.int\/dietphysicalactivity\/reducingsaltintake_EN.pdf).\u000a      It showed that in the vast\u000a      majority of populations, salt intake is well above recommended levels; it\u000a      was argued that simple\u000a      and cost-effective public health initiatives, in tandem with efforts by\u000a      the food industry, have the\u000a      potential to lower salt consumption and consequently lower cardiovascular\u000a      disease burden and\u000a      increase life expectancy. The paper published in the peer-reviewed\u000a      literature in 2009 (3) was a\u000a      distillation of the original technical report for WHO presented at the WHO\u000a      meeting in 2006 by\u000a      Professor Elliott\u000a      (http:\/\/www.who.int\/dietphysicalactivity\/Elliot-brown-2007.pdf).\u000a    WHO published guidelines on sodium and potassium intakes in adults and\u000a      children in 2012,\u000a      according to procedures laid down in the WHO Handbook for guideline\u000a        development. This includes\u000a      identification of priority questions and outcomes, and retrieval,\u000a      assessment and synthesis of the\u000a      evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment,\u000a      Development and\u000a      Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. These systematic reviews were planned and\u000a      refined in\u000a      meetings of the Nutrition Guidance Expert Advisory Group (NUGAG) Subgroup\u000a      on Diet and Health\u000a      (Geneva, March 2011 and Seoul, November 2011) including definition of the\u000a      scientific questions\u000a      and design of the supporting meta-analyses. Professor Elliott was an\u000a      invited expert at these\u000a      meetings providing specialist subject-matter knowledge and provided\u000a      substantial intellectual input\u000a      to, and co-authored, the subsequent peer-reviewed publications in BMJ\u000a      (4,5), the substance of\u000a      which formed the scientific basis of the guidelines.\u000a    Imperial College research, funded by the US CDC, has additionally\u000a      influenced work by CDC to\u000a      develop a national strategy for monitoring sodium intakes in the US\u000a      population. The 'gold standard'\u000a      for monitoring sodium intakes via biomonitoring of 24-hr urine collections\u000a      is expensive and\u000a      burdensome to participants. Imperial College-led research (in\u000a      collaboration with INTERSALT\u000a      investigators) has shown that analysis of spot (casual) urine may be a\u000a      viable low-cost and less\u000a      burdensome alternative to 24-hr urine collections (6).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42222","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2542007","Name":"Morocco"},{"GeoNamesId":"878675","Name":"Zimbabwe"},{"GeoNamesId":"3355338","Name":"Namibia"},{"GeoNamesId":"927384","Name":"Malawi"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Impacts include: health and welfare, public policy and services,\u000d\u000a      international development Main beneficiaries include: UNAIDS,\u000d\u000a      International Government bodies, international donors\u000d\u000a    The methods developed at Imperial are used by UNAIDS, the UN agency with\u000d\u000a      responsibility to lead the international response to AIDS (www.unaids.org),\u000a      to generate AIDS statistics for almost every country in the world (http:\/\/www.unaids.org\/en\/dataanalysis\/).\u000a      These statistics are used by countries and international donors (e.g. the\u000d\u000a      Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria) to track the epidemic\u000d\u000a      and determine funding and policy decisions for HIV prevention and\u000d\u000a      treatment interventions. These estimates have been crucial in describing\u000d\u000a      the scale and the nature of the HIV epidemic. Without this basic\u000d\u000a      information, effective and sustained action against the epidemic would not\u000d\u000a      have been possible. Furthermore, it would not be possible to detect\u000d\u000a      reductions in HIV prevalence that may be ascribed to programmes, which are\u000d\u000a      expected to be vital in strengthening the response to epidemics. Without\u000d\u000a      these estimates, neither the numbers in need of treatment nor the\u000d\u000a      potential impact of interventions would have been known, both of which\u000d\u000a      have been crucial in allowing major international and bilateral donors to\u000d\u000a      donate billions of dollars to tackling HIV.\u000d\u000a    The routine use and impact of these statistics are typified by citations\u000d\u000a      by President George W Bush as he announced the President's Plan for AIDS\u000d\u000a      Relief (PEPFAR, which continued between 2008 and 2013) and more recently\u000d\u000a      by President Barack Obama and Senator Hilary Clinton in public addresses\u000d\u000a      in 2009, 2011 and 2012. In his keynote speech in 2009, President Obama is\u000d\u000a      quoted as saying: \"Globally, there are over 33 million people living with\u000d\u000a      HIV. While millions have died from this disease, the death rate is slowly\u000d\u000a      declining due, in part, to our Nation's global effort through the\u000d\u000a      President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program.\" [1]. In a\u000d\u000a      keynote speech (2012), Hilary Clinton cited the UNAIDS estimates of HIV\u000d\u000a      impact: \"Just last week, UNAIDS announced that, over the past decade, the\u000d\u000a      rate of new HIV infections has dropped by more than half in 25\u000d\u000a      low-and-middle-income countries, most of them in Sub-Saharan Africa. Just\u000d\u000a      listen to these numbers: In Zimbabwe, a 50% reduction; in Namibia, a 68%\u000d\u000a      reduction; and in Malawi, a 73% in the rate of new infections. So as we\u000d\u000a      continue to drive down the number of new infections and drive up the\u000d\u000a      number of people on treatment, eventually we will be able to treat more\u000d\u000a      people than become infected every year. That will be the tipping point. We\u000d\u000a      will then get ahead of the pandemic, and an AIDS-free generation will be\u000d\u000a      in our sight. Now, we don't know how long it will take to do this\u000d\u000a      everywhere...\" [2]. The only source for the statistics is the UNAIDS\u000d\u000a      reports that are developed using the Imperial methods.\u000d\u000a    For each country, UNAIDS also recommends application of the `Modes of\u000d\u000a      Transmission' model (research reference 4) as part of a UNAIDS-GAMET\u000d\u000a      (Global AIDS Monitoring and Evaluation Team) supported synthesis process,\u000d\u000a      a component of the UNAIDS `know your epidemic, know your response'\u000d\u000a      strategy, and the World Bank's Epidemic, Response and Policy Syntheses\u000d\u000a      [3]. Over 30 countries have completed, or are currently conducting,\u000d\u000a      analyses with the model [4, 5]. The results from these applications have\u000d\u000a      been used for the design of prevention programmes, for resource allocation\u000d\u000a      and prioritisation and to inform the development of national strategic\u000d\u000a      planning for HIV. In many cases, the findings have led to realignment of\u000d\u000a      funding, sometimes increasing the focus of intervention in key populations\u000d\u000a      that had been previously neglected. For example, in Morocco strategic\u000d\u000a      information has been used to optimize the allocation of resources [6]. The\u000d\u000a      distribution of the people newly infected with HIV according to the\u000d\u000a      Imperial-developed model was compared with recent spending patterns to\u000d\u000a      focus future prevention planning. As a result, the 2012-2016 National\u000d\u000a      Strategic Plan for Morocco proposed to allocate 63% of AIDS resources\u000d\u000a      towards prevention among key populations at higher risk, up from about 25%\u000d\u000a      according to the 2008 spending assessment, which the model indicated would\u000d\u000a      generate a far greater health impact in that setting.\u000d\u000a    Estimates of Mother-To-Child Transmission events and numbers in need of\u000d\u000a      Antiretroviral Therapy in every country in the world are used by WHO to\u000d\u000a      track progress toward their goals of eliminating mother-to-child\u000d\u000a      transmission and universal access to antiretroviral therapy [7]. The UN\u000d\u000a      methods of estimating child mortality were updated to correct for the bias\u000d\u000a      effects that our research demonstrated, and these estimates are now used\u000d\u000a      to measure progress against a key Millennium Development Goal [8]. Without\u000d\u000a      a demonstration of that effect, it is possible that child mortality could\u000d\u000a      have been substantially under-estimated which could have resulted in an\u000d\u000a      inappropriate reduction in focus on child mortality in post-2015 targets.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV\/AIDS (UNAIDS) and World Health\u000d\u000a      Organisation (WHO) regularly report estimates for the prevalence of HIV\u000d\u000a      and associated metrics for almost every country in the world. These\u000d\u000a      statistics are essential for tracking the scale and the impact of HIV\u000d\u000a      epidemic and are used routinely in the policy decisions and funding\u000d\u000a      allocation decisions of national governments and international donors and\u000d\u000a      therefore have a major impact on international public health.

Methods developed by Professor Grassly and Professor Garnett\u000d\u000a      provided a way to integrate those sparse data points within a unified\u000d\u000a      theory for epidemiological dynamics so that reliable estimates of the\u000d\u000a      time-course of HIV prevalence could be generated (1). In 2005, Professor\u000d\u000a      Grassly and colleagues created a method to estimate the number of orphans\u000d\u000a      generated by the HIV epidemic (a key impact of HIV) (2), and, in 2003, the\u000d\u000a      group also invented a decision-making tool, the `Modes of Transmission'\u000d\u000a      model (3), and showed that it could be used to analyse surveillance data\u000d\u000a      and identify priority groups for HIV prevention interventions. These\u000d\u000a      estimates were then used in extended models to investigate the impact that\u000d\u000a      expanded responses to the HIV epidemic can generate (4).\u000d\u000a    The group has since led the continuous evaluation and development of the\u000d\u000a      estimation methods. The methods have been adapted to produce estimates of\u000d\u000a      mother-to-child transmission rates and the numbers in need of\u000d\u000a      antiretroviral therapy. Additional methods developed by the group\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that changes in sexual behaviour had led to a decline in the\u000d\u000a      HIV epidemic in Zimbabwe, at that time the largest epidemic for which such\u000d\u000a      a change had occurred. Methods developed in 2008 by Professor Hallett and\u000d\u000a      Professor Gregson allow for the sex-ratio and age-pattern of new HIV\u000d\u000a      infections to be estimated reliably from available data (5), allowing for\u000d\u000a      substantially refined estimates of demographic impact of HIV and\u000d\u000a      highlighting the burden of HIV among women.

The research of\u000a      Professor Ferguson\u000a      and colleagues at Imperial supported UK and international pandemic\u000a      preparedness policy, notably\u000a      in (a) influencing the size of antiviral stockpile purchased and policies\u000a      on treatment and\u000a      prophylaxis, (b) policies on the use of travel restrictions and school\u000a      closure for pandemic\u000a      mitigation.

This research\u000a      finding directly influenced the 2009 WHO guidelines for pandemic\u000a      surveillance [1, page 3], building\u000a      on the earlier WHO protocol for pandemic containment [2, pages 2, 4, and\u000a      23]. Professor Ferguson\u000a      actively advised WHO directly during the formulation of these and other\u000a      guidelines.\u000a    Research on pandemic mitigation and the impact of travel restrictions\u000a      informed UK policy decisions\u000a      on pandemic planning &#8212; most notably, providing evidence to support\u000a      stockpiling antiviral drugs and\u000a      for their use for treatment and prophylaxis, in recommendations that\u000a      travel restrictions would have\u000a      a limited role in mitigation, and in recommendations around the potential\u000a      use of school closure as a\u000a      public health measure. Much of this evidence was synthesised via the Dept.\u000a      of Health (DH) UK\u000a      Scientific Pandemic Influenza Advisory Committee (SPI) Modelling subgroup\u000a      evidence summaries,\u000a      [3A cites research references 1 and 2, plus unpublished work for DH on\u000a      antiviral prophylaxis, while\u000a      source 3B cites most of the research listed above]. In turn, these\u000a      modelling evidence summaries\u000a      informed national planning assumptions and policy on travel restrictions,\u000a      antiviral stockpiling and\u000a      use and school closure. The recent (2011) UK Pandemic Preparedness\u000a      strategy [4] cites Imperial\u000a      College work on travel restrictions (page 38), work on the use of\u000a      antivirals for prophylaxis (page\u000a      41), and analysis of the 2009 pandemic (page 11). Additional corroboration\u000a      on the influence of the\u000a      MRC Centre's work is available from DH.\u000a    The research also informed pandemic planning in Europe (e.g. European\u000a      Centre for Disease\u000a      Prevention and Control [ECDC] 2009 antiviral recommendations [5; ref 19,\u000a      cited on pages 5, 11, 17\u000a      and 19]) and the United States (US Homeland Security Council Key Elements\u000a      of Departmental\u000a      Pandemic Influenza Operational Plans 2008 [6; references 31 and 32].\u000a      Interestingly, while plans in\u000a      Europe and the US were both heavily informed by Professor Ferguson's\u000a      research (and role on\u000a      multiple advisory panels), the resulting policies differed in emphasis: in\u000a      the EU, more focus was\u000a      placed on the stockpiling and use of antivirals, while in the US, emphasis\u000a      was placed on the\u000a      potential for intensive use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g.\u000a      school closure) to achieve\u000a      pandemic mitigation. Additional corroboration on the impact of this work\u000a      on US policy is available\u000a      from DHHS in the US.\u000a    The work of the MRC Centre for Outbreak Analysis and modelling continues\u000a      to have a lasting\u000a      impact on policy for pandemic planning.

The single most influential piece of work was the\u000a      initial assessment of the\u000a      pandemic (research reference 6), which played a substantial role in (a)\u000a      informing the WHO\u000a      decision to move from pandemic phase 4 to 5; (b) reassuring policymakers\u000a      that the H1N1\u000a      pandemic was no `severe', and therefore default UK, US and WHO policy\u000a      which had been\u000a      formulated to mitigate a severe pandemic (e.g. arising from H5N1) could be\u000a      appropriately modified\u000a      (e.g. cessation of the UK `containment' phase and of using school closure\u000a      in the US, policies on\u000a      use of vaccines).\u000a    Much of the UK modelling advice was summarised in updates published\u000a      throughout the pandemic\u000a      by the `SPI-M-O' advisory group [8]: these summaries are referred to in\u000a      multiple UK SAGE and DH\u000a      policy documents, and in the `Lessons learned' inquiry reports following\u000a      the pandemic (e.g. the\u000a      Hine review). However, the nature of both research and policy-making in an\u000a      emergency means the\u000a      impact of the MRC Centre's research is most easily corroborated by the\u000a      individuals listed under\u000a      `Sources' below.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The work of Professor Ferguson and colleagues at Imperial College on\u000a      modelling the effect of\u000a      different intervention measures on the spread and health impact of a new\u000a      influenza pandemic has\u000a      substantially shaped UK and international public policy-making over the\u000a      last 7 years.

This research:\u000a    a) Analysed data collected in historical influenza pandemics (1-5) to\u000a      improve our epidemiological\u000a      understanding of pandemics and the effectiveness of interventions (notably\u000a      school closure [5]\u000a      and other non-pharmaceutical interventions [4]). This work, undertaken\u000a      from 2004-2009,\u000a      provided some of the first reliable estimates of the transmissibility of\u000a      pandemic influenza,\u000a      demonstrating that the reproduction number, R, of the 3 twentieth\u000a      century pandemics lay in the\u000a      range 1.6-2.0, and thus that control measures needed only to have\u000a      relatively moderate effects\u000a      to achieve substantial reductions in the rate of spread and overall impact\u000a      of a pandemic.\u000a      Analysis of historical records of the 1918 `Spanish flu' H1N1 pandemic in\u000a      the US highlighted\u000a      that public health measures could substantially slow spread (4), while\u000a      detailed statistical\u000a      analysis of seasonal influenza transmission patterns in contemporary\u000a      France (5) provided the\u000a      first quantitative estimates of the role of schools in both seasonal and\u000a      pandemic influenza\u000a      transmission, suggesting that school closure as a public health measure\u000a      might have a\u000a      substantial impact on peak incidence in a pandemic (and thus healthcare\u000a      demand) but more\u000a      moderate impacts on overall attack rates.\u000a    b) Developed, in 2004, the first continental-scale epidemic simulator to\u000a      examine the potential\u000a      impact of multiple interventions on the transmission of pandemic\u000a      influenza. The feasibility of\u000a      containing a lethal pandemic at source was examined (1), together with a\u000a      wide range of\u000a      potential mitigation strategies (2). This work highlighted that the\u000a      timescale of spread of a\u000a      pandemic would make it unlikely that pandemic vaccine would be available\u000a      in the first wave of\u000a      transmission, meaning it would be necessary to rely on layered\u000a      combinations of antiviral use\u000a      and non-pharmaceutical interventions to achieve substantial mitigation of\u000a      a severe influenza\u000a      pandemic. Professor Ferguson developed a simulation platform to inform\u000a      pandemic planning\u000a      which combined epidemiological information on influenza transmission\u000a      dynamics with data\u000a      derived from clinical trials and observational studies on the impact of\u000a      vaccines, antivirals and\u000a      public health measures on influenza disease burden and transmission. This\u000a      platform allowed\u000a      flexible modelling of the likely impacts of different combinations of\u000a      interventions on the speed\u000a      of spread and overall attack rate of an unfolding pandemic. Logistical\u000a      constraints could be\u000a      specified, and resource requirements (e.g. antiviral stockpile sizes)\u000a      assessed. The work\u000a      concluded that if a severe pandemic (e.g. caused by H5N1) was detected\u000a      within the first few\u000a      generations of human-to-human transmission, it might be feasible to\u000a      achieve containment of\u000a      spread through the intensive use of antiviral prophylaxis, quarantine,\u000a      school and workplace\u000a      closure and travel restrictions (1). However, once an outbreak exceeded a\u000a      few hundred cases,\u000a      containment was predicted to be very unlikely to succeed (1), and use of\u000a      more sustainable\u000a      layered interventions to mitigate pandemic impact was indicated (2).\u000a      Related work by\u000a      Professor Ferguson and colleagues demonstrated that the use of\u000a      international travel bans\u000a      would be unlikely to have a major impact on the global spread of a\u000a      pandemic (3).\u000a    c) Analysed surveillance data collected in the first few weeks of the\u000a      2009 H1N1 pandemic to\u000a      provide the first estimates of pandemic transmissibility and severity (6).\u000a      This work was\u000a      undertaken in collaboration with colleagues in the World Health\u000a      Organisation (WHO) and the\u000a      Mexican Ministry of Health. It concluded that the transmissibility of the\u000a      2009 pandemic was\u000a      less than the previous 3 pandemics, and that severity was at worst\u000a      moderate, with a 1918-like\u000a      high severity scenario being able to be excluded. Throughout the pandemic,\u000a      the MRC Centre\u000a      for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling at Imperial analysed surveillance data\u000a      for WHO and\u000a      multiple governments (notably UK, US and China), to improve situational\u000a      awareness and\u000a      decision-making.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42224","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1168579","Name":"Pakistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"},{"GeoNamesId":"1149361","Name":"Afghanistan"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Impacts include: health and welfare; public policy and services;\u000a      international development Main beneficiaries include: patients; WHO; GPEI\u000a    The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) is the largest coordinated\u000a      public health effort in history, with an `endgame' budget during 2013-2018\u000a      of $5.5 billion. The four spearheading partners of the GPEI are the WHO,\u000a      US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Rotary International and UNICEF. The\u000a      vaccine epidemiology research group at Imperial College London has\u000a      provided critical information that has driven strategy at the GPEI and\u000a      helped to support polio eradication. In 2013 we were formally recognised\u000a      as the WHO collaborating institute on polio data analysis and modelling.\u000a    Perhaps most significantly, our research has provided evidence that\u000a      contributed to changing polio immunisation strategies in India, which\u000a      resulted in the elimination of infection from that country in 2011. The\u000a      GPEI Strategic Plan 2010-12 [1] notes that `Compounding the problem of\u000a      achieving sufficiently high population immunity to stop transmission in\u000a      western Uttar Pradesh, and possibly in central Bihar, is the compromised\u000a      efficacy of OPV compared with the rest of India15' (see page\u000a      18); citing our work demonstrating OPV failure in northern India (research\u000a      reference 2). Our subsequent demonstration of the greater efficacy of\u000a      monovalent and bivalent vaccines licensed in 2005 and 2009 respectively,\u000a      together with the geographic and targeted approaches described in the\u000a      Strategic Plan for 2010-2012, led to the eradication of polio from India,\u000a      with the last case reported in January 2011 (www.polioeradication.org).\u000a      Only three countries remain endemic for polio, and the group at Imperial\u000a      works closely with government and WHO staff in these countries and in WHO\u000a      headquarters to analyse surveillance data and optimise vaccination\u000a      strategy and campaign quality. For example, Dr O'Reilly was in northern\u000a      Afghanistan and Pakistan in July 2012 to monitor programme performance,\u000a      drawing from her findings on vaccination coverage and efficacy.\u000a    In the GPEI Strategic Plan 2010-2012, the Executive Summary identifies at\u000a      the outset four `major lessons learned', which each led to major changes\u000a      in the eradication programme. Two of these lessons drew directly from our\u000a      research findings on immunity induced by newly licensed poliovirus\u000a      vaccines and the epidemiology of poliovirus in endemic and re-infected\u000a      countries.\u000a    The first lesson learnt was that immunity thresholds to stop polio\u000a      differ, being higher in Asia than Africa, leading to a `\"Geographic\"\u000a      strategy, with OPV campaign and monitoring strategy tailored to local\u000a      circumstances. This was based on our findings that \"The differential\u000a      progress by country towards polio eradication globally has long suggested\u000a      that the population immunity thresholds at which WPV transmission stops\u000a      can differ substantially between geographic areas, with implications for\u000a      programme strategy, planning, and prioritization\" [1; see page 12, where\u000a      research references 1 and 4 are the cited evidence]. The resulting\u000a      `process indicators' in the Strategic Plan include targets based on our\u000a      estimates of vaccine-induced immunity [1; see page 15]. Our work is\u000a      therefore central to this new strategy and we provide updated analysis\u000a      when requested by the GPEI. As a result of these targeted approaches to\u000a      polio eradication and efforts to improve vaccination campaign coverage,\u000a      the global incidence of poliomyelitis is at an all time low (just 223\u000a      cases in 2012).\u000a    The second lesson drawing from our work was that `Routes of poliovirus\u000a      spread &amp; outbreaks are now largely predictable', leading to, among\u000a      others, `Pre-planned, synchronized campaigns.' We had shown that polio\u000a      outbreaks in sub-Saharan Africa could be predicted with reasonable\u000a      accuracy 6 months ahead of time using a simple statistical (mathematical)\u000a      model (described in research reference 6 above). The Strategic Plan notes\u000a      that `In view of the substantial resource demands of implementing this\u000a      [pre-emptive vaccination campaign] strategy, a mathematical model has been\u000a      developed to help prioritize countries and areas based on the risk of both\u000a      an importation and a subsequent outbreak (Figure 4). Regular assessments\u000a      of polio immunity among the \"WPV importation belt\" countries using NP AFP\u000a      data, this model and other relevant information, will continue to inform\u000a      this prioritization.'; Figure 4 was provided by us, based on work\u000a      described in research reference 6 [1; see page 35]. We therefore continue\u000a      to provide assessments and forecasts of the risk of outbreaks in\u000a      sub-Saharan Africa to support immunization planning. These risk\u000a      assessments allow the programme to prioritize vaccination campaigns in a\u000a      time of serious resource constraints, maximising the cost-effectiveness of\u000a      the programme.\u000a    The World Health Assembly (May 2012) and WHO Strategic Advisory Group of\u000a      Experts (SAGE) recently recommended a switch from trivalent to bivalent\u000a      OPV during routine immunisation and global cessation of vaccination with\u000a      any serotype-2-containing OPV. The motivation for this switch came from\u000a      the recognition of the significant burden of vaccine-associated paralytic\u000a      poliomyelitis (VAPP) and vaccine-derived poliovirus outbreaks associated\u000a      with continued use of a serotype 2 OPV, when this serotype of\u000a      wild-poliovirus was eradicated over 10 years previously. Our work\u000a      demonstrating equivalent pathogenicity and transmissibility of serotype 2\u000a      vaccine-derived and wild-type poliovirus was an important piece of\u000a      evidence underlying this decision [2].\u000a    Our work demonstrating rapid waning of intestinal mucosal immunity\u000a      following vaccination with OPV and the detection of vaccine and wild-type\u000a      poliovirus in stool samples collected from OPV vaccinated children\u000a      provided motivation for two clinical trials on the use of inactivated\u000a      poliovirus vaccine (IPV) to boost intestinal immunity (Grassly et al. J\u000a      Infect Dis 2009, 2010, 2012). The first of these trials was led by WHO and\u000a      enrolled 990 children in northern India [3]. Results from this trial, for\u000a      which Professor Grassly is a co-investigator, were presented to WHO SAGE\u000a      in November 2012 for their consideration. They provided evidence for one\u000a      of the benefits of IPV that led to the WHO SAGE recommendation made in\u000a      January 2013 for universal vaccination with IPV at the time of the switch\u000a      from trivalent to bivalent OPV in routine programmes [4].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research by Professor Grassly and colleagues at Imperial College on the\u000a      epidemiology of poliovirus and the efficacy of new vaccines has played a\u000a      critical role in the thinking and strategy of the Global Polio Eradication\u000a      Initiative (GPEI). This research has supported the introduction of new\u000a      vaccines, guided the timing and location of vaccination campaigns and\u000a      influenced polio `endgame' policy. This is documented in the GPEI\u000a        Strategic Plan 2010-2012, where Imperial research informed 2 of the\u000a      4 `major lessons' concerning poliovirus epidemiology described in the\u000a      executive summary that led to changes in the programme. The research has\u000a      also informed our understanding of mucosal immunity induced by oral\u000a      poliovirus vaccines, and led to two clinical trials of the potential role\u000a      of inactivated vaccine to boost mucosal immunity. Results from one of\u000a      these trials were used to support the recent World Health Organisations\u000a      (WHO) recommendation for universal vaccination with inactivated vaccine\u000a      following the switch to bivalent oral vaccine in routine programmes.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Political","Institution":"\u000a    Imperial College London\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Imperial College London","InstitutionName":"Imperial College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10003270}],"Panel":"A         ","PlaceName":[{"GeoNamesId":"1253626","Name":"State of Uttar Pradesh"},{"GeoNamesId":"1275715","Name":"State of Bihar"}],"References":"\u000a    \u000a(1) Grassly, N.C., Fraser, C., Wenger, J., Deshpande, J.M., Sutter, R.W.,\u000a      Heymann, D.L., &amp; Aylward, R.B.

The original intention of the research was to maximise the\u000a      utility of routine poliovirus surveillance data by providing more\u000a      sophisticated statistical and mathematical model-based analyses than were\u000a      in use at the time. Over time a vaccine epidemiology research group was\u000a      established at Imperial by Professor Grassly and the research effort has\u000a      expanded beyond secondary analysis of data to include clinical trials of\u000a      poliovirus vaccines. The group collaborates closely with field and\u000a      laboratory staff in polio affected countries, and has strong international\u000a      links, particularly in India. During 2004-2013 several of our research\u000a      findings with a significant impact on the strategies and success of the\u000a      GPEI can be highlighted:\u000a    1) In 2005 we found that the standard trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine\u000a      (OPV) has extremely poor efficacy in northern India, explaining the\u000a      persistence of polio at that time in the country despite frequent\u000a      vaccination campaigns (1).\u000a    2) We provided the first estimate of the efficacy of serotype 1\u000a      monovalent OPV, which was licensed in 2005, showing that this vaccine was\u000a      three times more efficacious per dose compared with the standard trivalent\u000a      OPV in northern India (2). This finding supported the widespread use of\u000a      this vaccine by the GPEI, and we have recently used similar methods to\u000a      demonstrate efficacy of bivalent OPV that was licensed in 2009 (3).\u000a    3) The clinical characteristics and attack rate for a vaccine-derived\u000a      poliovirus circulating in Nigeria were shown to be equivalent to that for\u000a      wild-poliovirus, making it clear that vaccine-derived polioviruses can\u000a      fully revert to neurovirulent and transmissible phenotypes (4).\u000a    4) Intestinal (mucosal) immunity, important for preventing infection and\u000a      transmission of polioviruses, was shown for the first time to wane over\u000a      time since vaccination with OPV (5).\u000a    5) Outbreaks of polio were shown to be predictable on the basis of known\u000a      risk factors, allowing strategic planning of the timing and scale of\u000a      pre-emptive vaccination campaigns (6).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42225","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Impacts include: health and welfare; society; public policy and services;\u000a      environment; production Main beneficiaries include: UK and Welsh Assembly\u000a      Governments, Defra, cattle industry\u000a    Bovine TB in cattle remains a high priority for the Defra and one of the\u000a      key challenges facing cattle farmers, particularly in the west and south\u000a      west of England and in Wales. Although the Krebs Committee (of which\u000a      Professor Donnelly was a member) identified in 1997 \"compelling\" evidence\u000a      that badgers were involved in transmitting infection to cattle, it was the\u000a      Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT, 1998-2006) which demonstrated\u000a      conclusively that badger transmission contributed significantly to the\u000a      incidence of bovine TB in cattle and that badger culling could\u000a      significantly decrease that incidence. Badger culling is a politically\u000a      sensitive issue, and the results of this trial have been critically\u000a      examined by various stakeholders. They have undoubtedly stimulated public\u000a      debate [1] and have informed Government policy.\u000a    In light of the trial results, Defra had considered Government-led (and\u000a      Government-funded) culling but their impact assessment showed that the\u000a      costs were \"too high to justify the benefits achieved in the RBCT\" (para\u000a      3.26 [2]). Instead the Government proposed that farmers apply for licences\u000a      to undertake farmer-led badger culling to control TB in cattle. The\u000a      Government [3, 4, 5] used scientific evidence published by Professor\u000a      Donnelly and colleagues as the basis for several of their proposed\u000a      criteria for culling licenses, including:\u000a    \u000a      that the culling areas were large (at least 150sq-km, based on\u000a        extrapolation of RBCT results);\u000a      that there is land access for culling for &gt;70% of the area (as in\u000a        the RBCT);\u000a      that culling in a licensed area would be carried out annually for at\u000a        least 4 years (as undertaken in the RBCT proactive areas).\u000a    \u000a    The Government stated that \"the RBCT provides the best scientific\u000a      evidence available from which to predict the effects of a future culling\u000a      policy\" [5; see page 1].\u000a    The research impacted upon the Welsh government, who similarly proposed\u000a      to undertake badger culling in a large area, again based on the RBCT\u000a      finding that the overall benefits were increased as the culling area\u000a      increased in absolute size (\"based on previous experience and studies of\u000a      badger culling strategies, including the latest published results of the\u000a      Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT), reducing the reservoir of\u000a      infection in this way is expected to reduce the number of confirmed cattle\u000a      herd breakdowns in the area. There is evidence from the RBCT that 40-50%\u000a      of confirmed herd breakdowns in high incidence areas can be attributed to\u000a      a local badger source. Although the RBCT differs considerably from the\u000a      approach we are proposing for the Intensive Action Area, the analysis of\u000a      its results suggests that a sustained reduction in confirmed herd\u000a      breakdowns within the area following culling can be achieved.\") [6; see\u000a      page 5].\u000a    Furthermore, the Welsh government proposal followed the RBCT protocol of\u000a      culling using cage-trapping and shooting and used RBCT results to predict\u000a      the expected minimum impact: \"The data from the RBCT shows that there was\u000a      a benefit in the cull area but there was a short term increase in bovine\u000a      TB in cattle in the surrounding area. Accounting for this, at the end of a\u000a      cull and post cull period of 10 years, we expect to have reduced bovine TB\u000a      by approximately 22%, overall preventing an estimated 83 confirmed herd\u000a      breakdowns that would otherwise have occurred in the absence of culling\u000a      badgers in the area.\" [6; see page 5]\u000a    On 20 March 2012 the Welsh Government [7] announced it would launch a\u000a      badger vaccination project, rather than a badger culling programme, as\u000a      part of its work to eradicate cattle TB from Wales. This decision was\u000a      based on the judgement that the effects of culling, informed by RBCT\u000a      results, would be not sufficient \"to eliminate or substantially reduce the\u000a      incidence of bovine TB in cattle\" [7].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The bovine tuberculosis (TB) research programme led by Professor Donnelly\u000a      at Imperial College has been informing policymakers for over a decade.\u000a      Professor Donnelly played a leading role in the design, oversight,\u000a      analysis and interpretation of the &#163;50 million Randomised Badger Culling\u000a      Trial (RBCT, 1998-2006), overseeing a bovine-TB research team at Imperial\u000a      since 2001. The RBCT compared two candidate culling policies (large-scale\u000a      culling repeated annually and one-off small-scale culls near farms\u000a      affected by bovine TB) with areas in which no badger culling took place.\u000a      Informed by RBCT results (in which widespread culling decreased cattle\u000a      incidence inside the culling area but increased it on neighbouring farms),\u000a      the Secretary of State Hilary Benn ruled out badger culling as a control\u000a      measure in July 2008. However, the coalition government took a different\u000a      view and in December 2011 announced that farmers could apply for licences\u000a      to undertake farmer-led (and farmer-funded) badger culling to control TB\u000a      in cattle. Several of the government's licensing requirements for badger\u000a      culls in England were based on many of the team's results. In contrast,\u000a      having proposed in 2010 a large government-led cull, the Welsh government\u000a      chose in March 2012 to vaccinate, rather than cull, badgers informed by\u000a      the same set of results.\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Political","Institution":"\u000a    Imperial College London\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"Imperial College London","InstitutionName":"Imperial College London","PeerGroup":"A","Region":"London","UKPRN":10003270}],"Panel":"A         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000a    \u000a(1) Donnelly, C.A., Woodroffe, R., Cox, D.R., Bourne, J., Gettinby, G.,\u000a      Le Fevre, A.M., McInerney, J.P., &amp; Morrison, W.I.

She joined Imperial College in October 2000 and between 2001 and\u000a      2007 she led a team of (two to four) government-grant-funded research\u000a      associates undertaking RBCT-related research within the Department of\u000a      Infectious Disease Epidemiology at Imperial.\u000a    The RBCT was very large in scope involving 30 areas of England each of\u000a      100sq-km. Each area was randomised to one of three study arms: no culling;\u000a      small-scale reactive culling undertaken in response to confirmed infection\u000a      found in a cattle herd within the area; and large-scale, annually\u000a      repeated, proactive culling which was carried out across the entire\u000a      100sq-km area. Badger culls were undertaken within the trial between 1998\u000a      and 2005.\u000a    The reactive culling strategy was suspended in 2003 when Professor\u000a      Donnelly and colleagues found it to be associated with increased TB\u000a      incidence in cattle herds (1). Proactive culling continued until 2005 and\u000a      in 2006 Professor Donnelly and colleagues found that proactive culling was\u000a      associated with significantly decreased TB incidence in cattle herds\u000a      within proactively culled trial areas, but significantly increased TB\u000a      incidence among cattle herds up to 2km outside proactively culled trial\u000a      areas (2, 6).\u000a    There were several other strands of complementary research being\u000a      undertaken as part of the bovine TB research programme, published in\u000a      peer-reviewed scientific journals but also summarised in the Final Report\u000a      of the ISG to Ministers (5). Of particular note was the baitmarking study\u000a      in which the ranging behaviour of badgers was compared in the three\u000a      different types of areas (no culling; reactive culling and proactive\u000a      culling). Badger densities were, as expected, highest in the unculled\u000a      areas and lowest in the proactive culled areas. Furthermore, badgers in\u000a      culled areas (reactive and proactive) and crucially up to 2km outside\u000a      proactively culled areas were found to range significantly more widely\u000a      than badgers in undisturbed unculled areas (3). Thus, it was hypothesized\u000a      that this social \"perturbation\" to badger populations was responsible for\u000a      the increased transmission risks to cattle within reactively culled areas\u000a      and up to 2km outside proactively culled areas.\u000a    Badgers culled in follow-up proactive culls (i.e. those after the initial\u000a      proactive cull) were found to be significantly more likely to be infected\u000a      with Mycobacterium bovis, the aetiological agent of bovine TB (4). This is\u000a      consistent with the social perturbation caused by recent culling\u000a      increasing the risk of badger-to-badger transmission, as well as the risk\u000a      of badger-to-cattle transmission.\u000a    Professor Donnelly's current TB research (with two post-doctoral\u000a      researchers) focuses on modelling and cost-effectiveness analysis of\u000a      cattle vaccination in the presence of transmission risks from both badgers\u000a      and bought-in cattle. She met with Defra officials in March 2013 to\u000a      discuss how the results of current work could inform the government's\u000a      planned field trial of a Bacillus Calmette-Gu&#233;rin (BCG) cattle vaccine.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"42580","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2361809","Name":"Burkina Faso"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"149590","Name":"Tanzania"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Few strategies exist to control malaria, despite the fact that, every\u000a      year, it kills at least 600,000 people, predominantly very young children\u000a      in Africa. The trials and analyses of IPTi led by LSHTM staff made key\u000a      contributions to the WHO decision to recommend IPTi as policy.\u000a    The IPTi Consortium, developed by Prof. D Schellenberg at LSHTM in 2003,\u000a      brought together some of the leading centres of malaria research in\u000a      Africa, Europe and the USA, plus two UN agencies, to complete the\u000a      evaluation of IPTi. The Consortium generated key evidence to move beyond\u000a      the proof of concept towards a strategy for deployment as part of routine\u000a      immunisation programmes. At the time, the Consortium model was a novel\u000a      approach to generate all the critical information for policy\u000a      consideration. Under the Consortium, staff from all LSHTM faculties\u000a      generated information on issues surrounding the choice of drug for IPTi,\u000a      the relationship between IPTi and the development of drug resistance, and\u000a      the cost effectiveness, acceptability, mortality impact and community\u000a      effectiveness of IPTi.\u000a    School staff presented evidence to WHO technical expert groups in 2006\u000a      and 2007, but the WHO policy-making process became politicised and the US\u000a      Institute of Medicine (IOM) undertook its own review of the evidence.\u000a      Prof. D Schellenberg participated in the IOM committee meeting in January\u000a      2008,5.1 giving a two-hour presentation on the acceptability,\u000a      cost effectiveness and applicability of IPTi, plus an assessment of the\u000a      impact of IPTi on drug resistance. This was based primarily on data from\u000a      the pilot implementation study he led in southern Tanzania.\u000a    LSHTM staff presented to all three WHO technical review meetings,\u000a      including the key session in April 2009 which recommended IPTi as policy.5.2\u000a      At this meeting, the Consortium presented robust information on the\u000a      efficacy and safety of IPTi in different epidemiological settings and\u000a      excluded the possibility of adverse interactions between IPTi and the\u000a      serological response to EPI vaccinations. Prof. D Schellenberg presented\u000a      information on the safety of IPTi, its health impacts, effect on drug\u000a      resistance and the feasibility of large-scale deployment based on\u000a      experience in the southern Tanzania study.\u000a    In September 2009 another WHO expert committee was convened to consider\u000a      the relationship between IPTi and drug resistance.5.3 Dr Roper\u000a      presented her analyses of the molecular markers of resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine\u000a      and their relationship to IPTi efficacy in the Consortium's studies. Prof\u000a      D Schellenberg presented the evaluation of the impact of IPTi on the\u000a      spread of resistant parasites in the pilot implementation study in\u000a      southern Tanzania. This led to a key resistance-based criterion for\u000a      countries to consider prior to implementation.\u000a    The final step in the policy process was the endorsement in October 20095.4\u000a\u0009  of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) for the WHO\u000a      Expanded Programme on Immunisation. Prof. D Schellenberg once more\u000a      presented information (on efficacy, coverage, effectiveness,\u000a      acceptability, cost effectiveness, implementation lessons and impact on\u000a      EPI time use) from the southern Tanzania project.\u000a    WHO recommended IPTi as a malaria control tool for implementation in\u000a      areas of moderate to high transmission in March 2010.5.5 This\u000a      recommendation was based on the findings of seven studies, including those\u000a      carried out by LSHTM staff, showing the benefits of IPTi in reducing\u000a      malaria, anaemia and hospital admissions. Joint WHO\/UNICEF implementation\u000a      guidelines5.6 were released in September 2011. These draw\u000a      heavily on the LSHTM-led southern Tanzanian pilot implementation study. At\u000a      the time of writing, IPTi has been adopted by the national malaria control\u000a      programme of Burkina Faso.5.7 In 2012 a further eight nations\u000a      met to discuss implementation.5.8 Unpublished estimates suggest\u000a      that up to a million malaria episodes could be prevented annually if IPTi\u000a      were rolled out in the countries where studies have been conducted.\u000a    LSHTM's work on IPTi produced a number of additional benefits. Firstly,\u000a      the Consortium model of malaria research has been adopted by others,\u000a      including the Artemisinin-based Combination Treatment (ACT) Consortium\u000a      funded in 2007 and led by Prof. D Schellenberg since 2009. Secondly, the\u000a      review and modelling-based exercise to understand the age-pattern of\u000a      malaria disease and death in different transmission settings, led by Dr\u000a      Ilona Carneiro, continues to inform discussions in WHO, regulators and\u000a      within industry, about the possible deployment and dose scheduling of new\u000a      tools to control malaria. For example, this work has been presented and\u000a      discussed at several meetings during the reporting period of WHO's Joint\u000a      Technical Expert Group on malaria vaccines in pivotal phase 3 evaluation.5.9\u000a      Finally, the complexities of the policy-making process provided a learning\u000a      opportunity, as captured by the LSHTM's Dr Cruz,5.10 helping\u000a      groups (including the ACT Consortium) to engage better with policy-makers.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    LSHTM researchers carried out the initial trials of intermittent\u000a      preventive treatment in infants (IPTi), a strategy to improve malaria\u000a      control in very young children.

IPT involves the administration of a treatment dose of an\u000a      antimalarial drug at pre-specified times, irrespective of the presence of\u000a      malaria parasites.\u000a    Randomised, controlled trials (RCTs) of IPTi were led by LSHTM's\u000a      Professor Daniel Chandramohan in Ghana3.1 and northern\u000a      Tanzania.3.2 Both provided evidence of a beneficial effect of\u000a      IPTi, the Tanzanian study also providing insights into the drug\u000a      characteristics (for example, long half-life) required for efficacy of\u000a      IPTi. This study was undertaken under the auspices of the IPTi Consortium,\u000a      a research collaboration with partners across Europe, the USA and Africa,\u000a      set up in 2003 by David Schellenberg at LSHTM. In addition to evaluating\u000a      the safety and efficacy of IPTi with a number of antimalarial drugs across\u000a      a range of malaria transmission settings,3.2 the Consortium\u000a      generated operational experience of IPTi implementation3.3\u000a      through a large-scale pilot implementation study led by Professor David\u000a      Schellenberg. Additional in-depth studies led by LSHTM staff included\u000a      evaluations of the effect of the routine use of IPTi on the spread of drug\u000a      resistance,3.4 the cost effectiveness and acceptability3.5\u000a      of IPTi and an assessment &#8212; through a systematic review and modelling\u000a      exercise &#8212; of the potential impact of IPTi in a range of settings. A\u000a      pooled analysis with major contributions from LSHTM staff showed that IPTi\u000a      reduces clinical malaria by 30% and anaemia by 21% in the first year of\u000a      life.3.6 LSHTM staff presented evidence to a series of\u000a      policy-making meetings at WHO which recommended in 2009 the inclusion of\u000a      IPTi as part of the global malaria control recommendations.\u000a    Key academics involved in the underpinning research are D. Schellenberg\u000a      (role pre 2004 LSHTM\/Ifakara Health Institute, 2003-2007; Senior Lecturer,\u000a      LSHTM 2004-5 and Professor of Malaria and International Health, LSHTM,\u000a      2005-present); D. Chandramohan (Professor of Public Health, 2009-present,\u000a      LSHTM since 1992, then Research Fellow ); and B. Greenwood (LSHTM\u000a      Professor of Clinical Tropical Medicine 1996-present). Other involved\u000a      LSHTM staff include Dr I. Carneiro, who examined the potential health\u000a      impacts of IPTi in different settings and led the development of a web\u000a      tool (http:\/\/ipti.lshtm.ac.uk\/) to\u000a      support decision-making at country level (2004-2007, Lecturer); Dr L.\u000a      Conteh, who showed that IPTi costs only USD 1.36-4.03 per malaria episode\u000a      averted (2010, Senior Lecturer); Drs C. Roper and R. Pearce, who confirmed\u000a      the modest impact of IPTi on drug resistance (2004-2009, Senior Lecturer\u000a      and Research Fellow); Dr R. Pool, who confirmed the acceptability of IPTi\u000a      (2004-2008, Senior Lecturer); and Dr J.

Since its inception NICE has radically changed the way in\u000a      which health technologies are assessed and appraised &#8212; using evidence on\u000a      both clinical and cost-effectiveness1,2. Evidence regarding\u000a      health technologies on both clinical and cost-effectiveness is identified,\u000a      collated and synthesised by both commissioned academic groups and the\u000a      pharmaceutical industry\/device manufacturers (often subcontracted to\u000a      specialist healthcare consultancy companies), and which is then appraised\u000a      by an independent technology appraisal committee at NICE. This comprises\u000a      NHS healthcare professionals, academics (including Abrams since\u000a      2006), industry representatives and lay members. The ensuing guidance\u000a      issued regarding the use of such health technologies is mandatory within\u000a      the NHS in England and Wales. In addition to the academic and\u000a      pharmaceutical\/device company submissions NICE may also call upon its own\u000a      Decision Support Unit (DSU), in which Leicester (Abrams, Cooper &amp;\u000a        Sutton) is a key member, to undertake ad hoc analyses and\u000a      bespoke methodological work,. For example, Abrams3 led\u000a      the NICE response to the judicial review of the NICE appraisal of\u000a      alendronate, etidronate, risedronate, raloxifene and strontium ranelate\u000a      for the primary (TA 160) and secondary (TA 161) prevention of osteoporotic\u000a      fragility fractures in post-menopausal women. In addition to appraising\u000a      health technologies, NICE also has a remit to undertaken the assessment of\u000a      public health interventions under the auspices of its Public Health\u000a      Guidance Committee (of which Jones is a member).\u000a    Methods Employed by NICE &amp; Pharmaceutical\/Device Industry for\u000a          Technology Appraisal &amp; Public Health Guidance\u000a    The methods to be employed by academic groups, DSU and industry in\u000a      undertaking submissions for NICE are set out in the NICE Methods Guide,\u000a      to which Abrams &amp; Sutton have contributed extensively\u000a      as members of Methods Task Forces ,and are specialist advisers on\u000a      evidence synthesis methodology1,2. In particular, Abrams,\u000a      Cooper and Sutton have pioneered at NICE, (through\u000a      membership of the Appraisal Committee, DSU and contributors to the Methods\u000a        Guide}, the use of indirect comparisons or network meta-analysis in\u000a      technology appraisals and this has led to an increase in its use, for\u000a      example all 10 of the 212 technology appraisals published to 2011 which\u000a      used indirect comparisons or network meta-analysis appeared after\u000a      publication of 2004 Methods Guide which approved its use4.\u000a      Abrams &amp; Sutton has further contributed extensively to a series\u000a      of NICE DSU Technical Support Documents which have further\u000a      articulated the rationale and use of network meta-analysis5. In\u000a      addition Abrams, Cooper &amp; Sutton have run\u000a      tailored bespoke courses for the pharmaceutical industry on network\u000a      meta-analysis, including courses for Novartis, Pfizer &amp; Roche (approx.\u000a      150 participants), as well as for NICE (approx. 50 participants) and\u000a      general courses (approx. 600 participants from consultancy companies,\u000a      industry and academia). Further, Abrams has provided\u000a      methodological consultancy services to both major pharmaceutical companies\u000a      (Bristol-Meyers-Squibb, GSK, Janssen, Novartis, &amp; Roche) and\u000a      healthcare consultancy companies (Amaris, OptumInsight, &amp; PRMA) on\u000a      network meta-analysis. Abrams, Bujkiewicz, Cooper\u000a      &amp; Sutton undertook implementation of comprehensive decision\u000a      model in user-friendly real-time software and piloted it in a NICE\u000a      Technology Appraisal Committee meeting in order to aid more timely\u000a      decision making on tumour necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors in psoriatic\u000a      arthritis6.\u000a    In addition to short courses and consultancy activities on evidence\u000a      synthesis, including network meta-analysis, Abrams &amp; Lambert\u000a      have delivered courses, provided consultancy and undertaken contract\u000a      research projects on methods for dealing with treatment switching in\u000a      oncology clinical trials to inform HTA for ABPI, Amaris, GSK,\u000a      OptumInsight, and Roche. For example, in the area of locally advanced or\u000a      metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive malignant melanoma Abrams\u000a      provided expert advice on most appropriate methods for adjusting for\u000a      treatment switching which led to an eventual positive decision by NICE\u000a      (subject to a patient access scheme) for Vemurafenib [Roche] which\u000a      represents an innovative therapy in this poor prognosis condition in which\u000a      80% die within 2 years of diagnosis7. Lambert has also\u000a      provided methodological advice as a member of the Academic Reference Group\u000a      to the International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership.\u000a    As a measure of contribution to UK economy, since 2010 the ability to Abrams\u000a      to provide expert methodological advice on methods for evidence synthesis\u000a      and treatment switching to Amaris (a health-care consultancy company) has\u000a      resulted in them being awarded projects with a combined revenue of [text\u000a      removed for publication], including them being awarded `preferred vendor\u000a      status' by Roche in 2013.\u000a    In terms of Public Health decision making, Cooper &amp; Sutton\u000a      undertook a network meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of\u000a      interventions to increase the uptake of smoke alarms as part of a NIHR\u000a      Programme Grant and which has been included in an update to NICE Public\u000a      Health Guidance 29: Strategies to prevent unintentional injuries among\u000a        children and young people aged under158. Using\u000a      comprehensive decision modelling techniques pioneered at Leicester, Abrams\u000a      &amp; Gillies undertook further modelling for the Department of\u000a      Health to inform the UK Vascular Screening Programme9.\u000a    International Impact\u000a    As well as disseminating and promoting methodological developments in the\u000a      UK, Abrams, Cooper &amp; Sutton have delivered\u000a      short courses of evidence synthesis in the US to the Agency for Healthcare\u000a      Research and Quality (AHRQ) which have adopted some of these innovative\u000a      methods10. In addition Abrams has acted as an advisor\u000a      to both the Brazilian and Colombian Ministries of Health as regards\u000a      methods for HTA, whilst Lambert has delivered short courses on\u000a      advanced survival methodology, developed at Leicester, to the\u000a      International Association of Cancer Registries (approx. 60 individuals)\u000a      and North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (approx. 30\u000a      individuals).\u000a    This significant body of translational activity &#8212; delivered through\u000a      committee membership, contract research, consultancy and training\u000a      delivered by key academics &#8212; is fundamentally underpinned by research in Evidence\u000a        Synthesis and Decision Modelling Methodology and Survival\u000a        Analysis Methodology pioneered at Leicester.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The National Institute for health Care Excellence (NICE) in England and\u000a      Wales makes timely and equitable decisions regarding the use of health\u000a      technologies (medical devices and pharmaceuticals) within the NHS in order\u000a      to improve patient care.

The\u000a      pioneering work that researchers in Biostatistics at Leicester have\u000a      undertaken over the last 15 years is briefly summarised below.\u000a    Evidence Synthesis &amp; Decision Modelling\u000a    In HTA the evidence on clinical effectiveness is often disparate and\u000a      heterogeneous in both source and nature. As such the methods that have to\u000a      used are by necessity flexible and often complex. Members of the\u000a      Biostatistics Group at Leicester have been at the forefront of developing\u000a      such methodology in the field of evidence synthesis over the last 15 years\u000a      funded by MRC, NIHR, and the pharmaceutical industry. Such methodological\u000a      developments have included: allowing for different types of evidence\u000a      within a generalised evidence synthesis framework, publication bias, and\u000a      network meta-analysis. Such syntheses are often undertaken in order to\u000a      inform either a clinical net benefit model or an economic decision model,\u000a      and it is important that the uncertainty (and correlation derived from the\u000a      same source informing a numbers of inputs into such models) is\u000a      appropriately accounted for. Many of these issues have been addressed\u000a      using Bayesian methods which both allow for the heterogeneous nature of\u000a      the evidence to be synthesised and the often complex structure, whilst\u000a      enabling appropriate inputs into the decision models to be obtained.\u000a    Survival Analysis\u000a    The Cox proportional hazards model is one of the most widely cited\u000a      methods in medical research and is used in wide variety of clinical\u000a      setting in which time to an event is the main outcome, e.g. mortality,\u000a      discharge, disease recurrence. However, the model makes a number of\u000a      assumptions that often do not hold and that hinder the complexity of data\u000a      that can be modelled, and hence the clinical questions that can be\u000a      answered. Extension of these regression based survival models to\u000a      accommodate more realistic aspects of the data is a key component of\u000a      research in Biostatistics at Leicester &#8212; often using flexible parametric\u000a      models. In HTA interest often focuses on differences in overall survival\u000a      for decision making, but this can be problematic when patients switch from\u000a      the treatment to which they have been randomised to in RCTs. Research at\u000a      Leicester has focused on the evaluation of a variety of different methods\u000a      that have been proposed for adjusting RCTs to account for treatment\u000a      switching, and this work has been funded by ABPI, NICE and NIHR.

Deaths from passive smoking in Scotland\u000d\u000a      had been estimated to be in the region of 1000 to 1200 per year, which is\u000d\u000a      about 10% of the total deaths from smoking related diseases.\u000d\u000a    Passive smoking was known to increase risk of lung cancer and ischaemic\u000d\u000a      heart disease, with growing evidence of a causal effect for other\u000d\u000a      diseases. Passive smoking was also known to aggravate respiratory\u000d\u000a      diseases, such as asthma and chronic bronchitis. The costs of treating\u000d\u000a      smoking related diseases in Scotland was estimated at &#163;200 million in\u000d\u000a      2004; if the cost attributable to passive smoking were pro rata to the\u000d\u000a      share in mortality then this would be approximately &#163;20 million per year.\u000d\u000a      The Aberdeen team was approached because of its reputation for high\u000d\u000a      quality evidence reviews and economic modelling. The Scottish Executive\u000d\u000a      required a robust evidence base to underpin their decision-making. There\u000d\u000a      was particular controversy about the potential impact of smokefree\u000d\u000a      legislation on the hospitality sector (bars, restaurants and hotels), with\u000d\u000a      the industry claiming that there would be a significant negative effect on\u000d\u000a      this area of the Scottish economy. Despite the evidence from studies of\u000d\u000a      smoking restrictions in other jurisdictions, it was important to provide\u000d\u000a      results relevant to Scotland through the modelling process.\u000d\u000a    Systematic reviews were undertaken of evidence relating to the health\u000d\u000a      effects of exposure to ETS, the impact of restrictions on exposure levels\u000d\u000a      and on tobacco use behaviours and the economic impacts of restrictions on\u000d\u000a      workplaces, in general, and on the hospitality sector in particular.\u000d\u000a      Effect sizes from the reviews were used in the modelling. Specific health,\u000d\u000a      health service and economic information relating to the Scottish context\u000d\u000a      was also collected to assist in the modelling of impacts.\u000d\u000a    The model combined information relating to the main health and economic\u000d\u000a      impacts of smoking in public places and was estimated to show the impact\u000d\u000a      of moving from the existing situation, under a voluntary code of practice,\u000d\u000a      to a complete ban. The model provided a framework in which to compare the\u000d\u000a      expected benefits of smokefree legislation with the potential costs,\u000d\u000a      estimated on the basis of the best available evidence and using expert\u000d\u000a      judgement where evidence did not exist or was unclear. The model was\u000d\u000a      estimated across a range of assumptions to test its robustness and\u000d\u000a      demonstrated a positive net benefit under all assumptions.

In particular, the research included a wide range of\u000d\u000a      estimates relating to the impact on the hospitality sector. Although\u000d\u000a      previous studies using robust methods had found no significant effect, the\u000d\u000a      model scenarios included possible negative economic effects, using\u000d\u000a      confidence intervals from this literature. The research could then\u000d\u000a      demonstrate that, in the worst-case scenario, the scale of any negative\u000d\u000a      economic impact was outweighed by the value of the health benefits.

Varicose veins are a common medical\u000a      condition, with approximately 25% of women and 15% of men having some form\u000a      of visible varicose veins. The recently introduced minimally invasive\u000a      therapies for the treatment of varicose veins has led to their\u000a      effectiveness being assessed in a number of observational studies and\u000a      randomised controlled trials. The AVVQ has become the most commonly used\u000a      disease specific questionnaire in venous studies and has been used in all\u000a      of the large recent randomised controlled trials eg a review of published\u000a      venous studies in the Journal of Vascular Surgery, European Journal of\u000a        Vascular and Endovascular Surgery and Phlebology found that out of\u000a      60 studies assessed, 47 studies adopted the AVVQ as the gold standard\u000a      measure for assessment of disease-specific quality of life. The AVVQ has\u000a      also been translated into Dutch in 2009 [a] and Portuguese in 2012 [b] by\u000a      international groups in the Netherlands and Brazil and validated for use\u000a      in these countries.\u000a      \u000aRecommendation of the AVVQ as a preferred measurement tool by\u000a          international agencies: Reporting standards for the treatment of\u000a        varicose veins issued by the American Venous Forum and the\u000a          Society of Interventional Radiology recommended from 2007 that the\u000a        use of both generic and venous disease-specific measures to be the\u000a        accepted standard for studying quality-of-life (QOL) changes.\u000a        Specifically, it recommended the AVVQ as one of only three acceptable\u000a        disease-specific validated questionnaires worldwide. More recently in\u000a        2011, the clinical practice guidelines of the Society for Vascular\u000a        Surgery and the American Venous Forum strongly recommended that, as part\u000a        of the assessment of the outcome of treatment, a disease-specific\u000a        instrument (such as the AVVQ) be used to evaluate patient-reported\u000a        outcomes [c]. The current UK NICE guidelines [d] on the diagnosis and\u000a        treatment of varicose veins also highlights the key role\u000a        disease-specific quality of life measures, including the AVVQ,\u000a        contribute to the assessment of the effectiveness of different treatment\u000a        options and subsequent recommendations on their use in the NHS.\u000a      \u000aAdoption of the AVVQ as the mandated measurement of quality\u000a          of varicose vein treatment in the NHS in England to in form\u000a        NHS service planning: In 2008, Lord Darzi\u000a        published a review of the NHS in England entitled High Quality Care\u000a          for All. The review was commissioned by the Prime Minister, the\u000a        Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Health to develop a vision of\u000a        a health service fit for the 21st century. A core tenet of\u000a        this review was that \"quality should be at the heart of the NHS\" and a\u000a        recommendation made that the NHS should \"systematically measure and\u000a        publish information about the quality of care ... including patients'\u000a        own views on the success of their treatment and the quality of their\u000a        experiences\" &#8212; so called \"PROMs\", or Patient Reported Outcome Measures.\u000a        This information would then be used to assess the quality of services\u000a        provided across the NHS and inform service redesign [e]. To enable this,\u000a        the Standard NHS Contract for Acute Services, was revised to include a\u000a        requirement for all licensed providers of NHS-funded procedures\u000a        including varicose vein surgery to ask patients to complete PROM\u000a        questionnaires before and after surgery, from April 2009. The associated\u000a        guidance document produced by the Department of Health mandated the use\u000a        of the AVVQ as the disease-specific PROM for varicose vein surgery [f].\u000a        Since April 2009, all patients in England undergoing varicose vein\u000a        surgery now complete the AVVQ before and after their surgery. To date\u000a        over 27,000 patients have already completed these multiple assessments\u000a        using the AVVQ. Data from these measures are collated centrally by the\u000a        NHS Information Centre in England and reports produced quarterly to\u000a        allow the assessment of quality of service across the country and the\u000a        planning of service delivery nationwide [g]. Already the PROMs data for\u000a        varicose vein surgery &#8212; ie the AVVQ data &#8212; has shown that treatment in\u000a        England results in significant improvement in health for patients [h].\u000a        Patients with the lowest &#8212; less severe &#8212; pre-treatment scores have been\u000a        found to benefit least from surgery. These observations are now being\u000a        used by individual NHS providers to assess the quality of their care\u000a        (the NHS Information Centre provides data by provider) and to improve\u000a        their services in line with providers seen to provide high quality care.\u000a        Data is also being used for planning and commissioning of services\u000a        nationwide. Data is now also being linked routinely to national Hospital\u000a        Episode Statistics by the National Information Centre to allow long-term\u000a        tracking of outcomes.\u000a    \u000a    The claimed impact, as defined by REF guidance, therefore includes impact\u000a      on: public policy and services particularly through the\u000a      specification of AVVQ-reporting as part of the NHS contract;\u000a        practitioners and professional services through the widespread use\u000a      and adoption of the measure and health and welfare through its use\u000a      to plan NHS services.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    University of Aberdeen research has directly impacted on clinical\u000a      practice with regard to the treatment of varicose veins.

Through\u000a      its Aberdeen Centre for\u000a      Implementation Research it provided international guidance on which\u000a      strategies were most\u000a      effective for improving implementation of research findings [1]. It also\u000a      undertook research into\u000a      specific trial methodology (especially cluster randomised trials) and\u000a      methods for designing and\u000a      conducting innovative national evaluations [2]. With this strong\u000a      reputation for innovation, clinical\u000a      collaborators routinely approached HSRU with possible clinical questions\u000a      and HSRU led the\u000a      translation into robust study designs. This trial related to dental\u000a      fissure sealants placement is one\u000a      such example of this practice.\u000a    Dental decay is very common in childhood. By age 15, 50% of UK children\u000a      have experienced\u000a      decay in their first permanent molars. Dental decay is closely linked to\u000a      social deprivation and, in\u000a      Scotland, 69% of five year olds in the least affluent areas have caries.\u000a      Methods of prevention are\u000a      well-known and placement of fissure sealants has been shown to reduce\u000a      decay in children's teeth\u000a      by up to 86% at 12 months. Adoption in Scotland was poor, however, with\u000a      only 15% of 11-year-olds\u000a      having any first molars sealed prior to 2005.\u000a    Reasons suggested for the poor adoption of the sealant method by dentists\u000a      included lack of\u000a      financial reimbursement for placing sealants on children over 11-years-old\u000a      and dentists' lack of\u000a      knowledge of the evidence base for the treatments in older children. To\u000a      address this adoption\u000a      problem, methodologists at the University of Aberdeen's HSRU worked with\u000a      clinical colleagues at\u000a      the University of Dundee, to design a national cluster randomised trial\u000a      (the ERUPT trial) to test\u000a      these implementation strategies. Aberdeen researchers led on the design\u000a      and implementation of\u000a      the trial interventions (HSRU researchers were the recognised\u000a      international experts in\u000a      implementation research interventions and had developed the evidence base\u000a      [1]) and on the\u000a      design and analysis of the trial (HSRU researchers were also the\u000a      international experts in cluster\u000a      trial methodology [2]).\u000a    University of Aberdeen researchers engaged directly in the ERUPT trial\u000a      were:\u000a    \u000a      Craig Ramsay, Senior Statistician, Aberdeen Centre for Implementation\u000a        Research\u000a      Jeremy Grimshaw, Director, Aberdeen Centre for Implementation Research\u000a      Graeme MacLennan, Statistician, HSRU,\u000a        together with clinical input from Jan Clarkson and Nigel Pitts, Dental\u000a        Health Services Research\u000a        Unit, Dundee.\u000a    \u000a    Additional University of Aberdeen researchers who were integral to the\u000a      development of the\u000a      evidence base and the cluster trial methodology underpinning the ERUPT\u000a      trial were:\u000a    \u000a      Ruth Thomas, Research Assistant, HSRU (implementation evidence base)\u000a      Liz Shirran, Research Assistant, HSRU (implementation evidence base)\u000a      Marion Campbell, Senior Statistician, HSRU (methodology of cluster\u000a        trials for implementation\u000a        research)\u000a      Jill Mollison, Statistician, Department of Public Health (methodology\u000a        of cluster trials for\u000a        implementation research)\u000a    \u000a    The ERUPT trial [3] was completed in 2005 and continues to be the largest\u000a      randomised trial\u000a      internationally of a fee-for-service intervention in primary dental care.\u000a      Some 140 dentists and 2833\u000a      high risk of caries children were randomised for the dentists to receive\u000a      either a fee for fissure\u000a      sealant placement (each dentist received &#163;6.80 per tooth sealed) or\u000a      training in evidence-based\u000a      practice. The trial demonstrated that placement of fissure sealants\u000a      increased by 10% (when a\u000a      small fee-for-service was offered). There was no effect of the education\u000a      intervention. The\u000a      economic evaluation conducted as part of the study clearly demonstrated\u000a      that the fee-for-service\u000a      was a cost-effective intervention.\u000a    At the completion of the trial in 2005, a dissemination conference was\u000a      organised by the trial team\u000a      to which service providers, national decision makers (such as the British\u000a      Dental Association) and\u000a      policy-makers including the Deputy Chief Dental Officer who was\u000a      responsible for recommending\u000a      any changes to the Scottish Dental Contract were invited. After the\u000a      conference, the Deputy Chief\u000a      Dental Officer recommended a change to the contract informed by the\u000a      findings of the trial. The\u000a      Scottish Dental Contract was amended in Nov 2005 to include a\u000a      fee-for-service for the placement\u000a      of fissure sealants in children over 11-years-old.\u000a    From 2008, guidance documents from the NHS Department of Health (England)\u000a      and the Scottish\u000a      Dental Clinical Effectiveness Programme have recommended placement of\u000a      fissure sealants on\u000a      children above 11-years-old. These guidance documents are provided to some\u000a      10,000 dentists\u000a      throughout the UK.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43270","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The results of this research programme have demonstrated that, in younger\u000d\u000a      women undergoing\u000d\u000a      IVF replacing one embryo at a time (ie. eSET), results in livebirth rates\u000d\u000a      are comparable to the usual\u000d\u000a      policy of double embryo transfer. This research also established that eSET\u000d\u000a      leads to higher rates of\u000d\u000a      term singleton liveborn babies i.e. healthy babies in comparison with\u000d\u000a      double embryo transfer.\u000d\u000a    The Aberdeen research group's Cochrane systematic review [2] and\u000d\u000a      subsequent print publication\u000d\u000a      [3] was influential in informing policy within the United Kingdom, where\u000d\u000a      the Human Fertilisation and\u000d\u000a      Embryology Authority (HFEA) &#8212; the IVF regulatory body for the UK &#8212; set up\u000d\u000a      an expert group to\u000d\u000a      advise on Multiple Births after IVF. This Group referenced the Aberdeen\u000d\u000a      review in its\u000d\u000a      recommendation, which advised eSET (with transfer of a second frozen\u000d\u000a      embryo) and set targets\u000d\u000a      for twin rates after IVF [a]. This resulted in an increase in the uptake\u000d\u000a      of eSET from 4.8% in 2008 to\u000d\u000a      14.7% in 2010 and a corresponding decrease in multiple pregnancy rates\u000d\u000a      [b]. The implementation\u000d\u000a      of eSET has been particularly noticeable in younger women who have the\u000d\u000a      best chance of\u000d\u000a      achieving a livebirth, but the overall success rate has not been affected\u000d\u000a      as a consequence of this\u000d\u000a      policy.\u000d\u000a    Although the results of the initial Cochrane systematic review led to a\u000d\u000a      degree of change in the IVF\u000d\u000a      sector, many practitioners remained unconvinced until the publication of\u000d\u000a      the individual patient data\u000d\u000a      meta-analysis of all relevant randomised trials [4]. This meta-analysis\u000d\u000a      showed that eSET in a fresh\u000d\u000a      IVF treatment cycle (without an additional frozen embryo replacement)\u000d\u000a      resulted in a higher chance\u000d\u000a      of a single healthy baby (live baby born at full term). This work was\u000d\u000a      widely publicised by the\u000d\u000a      national and international media, the NHS and the global professional\u000d\u000a      organisation for\u000d\u000a      Obstetricians and Gynaecologists [c,d,e] and highlighted by the HFEA on\u000d\u000a      its website [a]. It was\u000d\u000a      also promoted by the \"One at a time\" website &#8212; a professionally-led\u000d\u000a      website in the UK aimed at\u000d\u000a      reducing the risks of multiple pregnancies associated with fertility\u000d\u000a      treatment. This meta-analysis\u000d\u000a      was also cited in the updated NICE guideline [f] on infertility published\u000d\u000a      in 2013 as clear evidence of\u000d\u000a      the benefit of eSET to mothers and their babies. Along with the paper from\u000d\u000a      the Aberdeen group\u000d\u000a      on the cost effectiveness of alternative embryo transfer strategies (eSET\u000d\u000a      versus DET) in IVF in\u000d\u000a      women of different ages, it also served to inform NICE guidance on\u000d\u000a      selective use of eSET in\u000d\u000a      women of different ages [f]. In the UK, the impact of the research\u000d\u000a      directly and indirectly through\u000d\u000a      HFEA recommendations is evident from national data published by HFEA [b].\u000d\u000a      Between 2008 and\u000d\u000a      2011, HFEA data show that rates of eSET have increased from 4% to 18% (25%\u000d\u000a      in women aged\u000d\u000a      18-34 years) in all IVF cycles in the UK and twin rates have fallen from\u000d\u000a      27% to just under 20%\u000d\u000a      [a,b]. There is no evidence of any compromise in livebirth rates per IVF\u000d\u000a      treatment in the UK over\u000d\u000a      this period with perhaps even a modest increase from 26% to 32%.\u000d\u000a    Results of the Aberdeen research group's individual patient data\u000d\u000a      meta-analysis on eSET, which\u000d\u000a      included data from over 1300 women, has also informed clinical guidelines\u000d\u000a      on IVF embryo transfer\u000d\u000a      policies internationally in countries such as Canada and South Africa\u000d\u000a      [g,h]. Most recently, the\u000d\u000a      United States, which has also used our research as evidence to inform its\u000d\u000a      eSET policy [i] has also\u000d\u000a      witnessed an increase in eSET in women under 35 years of age &#8212; from 4.5%\u000d\u000a      in 2007 to 11.75% in\u000d\u000a      2011 [j].\u000d\u000a    In summary, the initial impact in the UK occurred just after the Cochrane\u000d\u000a      review and received a\u000d\u000a      further boost after the publication of the IPD meta-analysis and health\u000d\u000a      economic papers prompting\u000d\u000a      policy changes within the regulators, HFEA, [a] and NICE [f].

The effects of these more recent changes on international\u000d\u000a      guidance on eSET are\u000d\u000a      already apparent with evidence continuing to accrue.\u000d\u000a    The claimed impact as defined by REF guidance is, therefore on public\u000d\u000a        policy and services;\u000d\u000a        practitioners and professional services and health and welfare\u000d\u000a      in the UK and internationally.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Multiple births following in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment\u000d\u000a      leads to serious health risks in the\u000d\u000a      mother and offspring.

The research has been funded by Wellcome Trust and the Chief\u000d\u000a      Scientist Office for\u000d\u000a      Scotland. Initial work involved exploring patient and service providers'\u000d\u000a      views on risks of multiple\u000d\u000a      pregnancy in IVF and the level of equipoise regarding a strategy of\u000d\u000a      elective single (eSET) versus\u000d\u000a      double embryo transfer [1]. This was accompanied by a Cochrane review of\u000d\u000a      randomised trials of\u000d\u000a      eSET versus double embryo transfer in IVF [2] conducted by the Aberdeen\u000d\u000a      group and a widely\u000d\u000a      cited updated version of this review published in 2005 [3]. Pooled results\u000d\u000a      showed that multiple\u000d\u000a      pregnancy rates were significantly higher following transfer of two\u000d\u000a      embryos. Although double\u000d\u000a      embryo transfer led to a higher live birth rate in a single fresh IVF\u000d\u000a      treatment in a fresh IVF cycle,\u000d\u000a      comparable results were obtained by subsequent transfer of a frozen\u000d\u000a      embryo.\u000d\u000a    Dr McLernon and Professor Bhattacharya subsequently conducted an\u000d\u000a      individual patient data (IPD)\u000d\u000a      meta-analysis [4] of all randomised trials (including unpublished data\u000d\u000a      from two additional trials in\u000d\u000a      the United Kingdom and Australia). This individual patient meta-analysis\u000d\u000a      included data on more\u000d\u000a      than 1300 women. This study showed that eSET in a fresh IVF cycle (even\u000d\u000a      without the need for an\u000d\u000a      additional frozen embryo) resulted in a 5-fold increase in the odds of\u000d\u000a      having a healthy baby (i.e. a\u000d\u000a      singleton baby after 37 weeks) in comparison with double embryo transfer\u000d\u000a      (odds ratio 4.93, 95%\u000d\u000a      confidence intervals 2.98 to 8.18) [4].\u000d\u000a    Further research conducted by the Aberdeen researchers [5] used data from\u000d\u000a      Scottish IVF units to\u000d\u000a      model the cost effectiveness of eSET and double embryo transfer in women\u000d\u000a      of different age\u000d\u000a      groups with varying prognoses for livebirth. The results demonstrated that\u000d\u000a      eSET was particularly\u000d\u000a      useful in younger women but not in those who were older and\/or had a\u000d\u000a      poorer chance of achieving\u000d\u000a      pregnancy through IVF. Finally, a systematic review of worldwide\u000d\u000a      implementation of eSET\u000d\u000a      conducted by the Aberdeen researchers provided much needed data on why\u000d\u000a      certain countries\u000d\u000a      were able to use eSET successfully in order to reduce IVF risks without\u000d\u000a      compromising livebirth\u000d\u000a      rates [6] but not others. This study also identified the personal,\u000d\u000a      organisational and societal barriers\u000d\u000a      to the uptake of an eSET policy and provided information relevant to\u000d\u000a      patients, clinicians, regulators\u000d\u000a      and policy makers.\u000d\u000a    In summary, University of Aberdeen researchers led the first systematic\u000d\u000a      review and meta-analysis\u000d\u000a      of eSET versus double embryo transfer. They led the only individual\u000d\u000a      patient data meta-analysis\u000d\u000a      ever undertaken in this field.

The Initiative provided a framework for the implementation of\u000a      best practice by hospitals, other health-care facilities and higher\u000a      education institutions, with the aim of ensuring that all parents make\u000a      informed decisions about feeding their babies. Until 2012, best practice\u000a      was represented by UNICEFs evidence-based \"Ten Steps to Successful\u000a        Breastfeeding\". New standards were introduced in December 2012 which\u000a      adopt a more mother and parent centred approach. Hospitals can apply to be\u000a      a UNICEF \"Baby Friendly\" accredited hospital if they can show they\u000a      are implementing UNICEF guidance. Research has shown that implementation\u000a      of the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative has led to increases in\u000a      breastfeeding rates and subsequent child health.\u000a    The results of the BIG trial directly influenced a change to Step 10 of\u000a      the UNICEF UK's Ten Step guidance. The 10 steps were the standard guidance\u000a      until December 2012, when new standards incorporating, updating and\u000a      expanding the 10 steps were published. Prior to the BIG trial results\u000a      being published, Step 10 read \"Step 10: Foster\u000a        the establishment of breastfeeding support groups and refer mothers to\u000a        them on discharge from the hospital or clinic.\" with the expectation\u000a      that hospitals routinely promote the establishment of breast feeding\u000a      support groups. Following publication of the BIG trial in 2009 which\u000a      showed no evidence that these peer-support groups improved breastfeeding\u000a      rates, Step 10 was reworded, after consultation with the trial team, to: \"Step\u000a          10 - Identify sources of national and local support for\u000a        breastfeeding and ensure that mothers know how to access these prior to\u000a        discharge from hospital\" thus removing the expectation that\u000a      hospitals should be routinely establishing these groups [b]. Clearly this\u000a      results in savings to national health services, as these groups are no\u000a      longer being routinely set up.\u000a    In the UK, the Baby Friendly Initiative also accredits maternity\u000a      and community facilities that adopt the UNICEF internationally recognised\u000a      standards. Hospitals undergo a structured assessment to attain the award\u000a      and achieve \"Baby Friendly\" accreditation if successful. The National\u000a      Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has, through its\u000a      guidance on standards of postnatal care in the UK, recommended that the Baby\u000a        Friendly Accreditation be the minimum standard for the care of all\u000a      mothers and babies [c]. Thus this research from the University of Aberdeen\u000a      has directly influenced the care of all new mothers and babies across the\u000a      UK.\u000a    In November 2011, the UNICEF UK Baby Friendly quality standards were\u000a      further revised both in the language used and their content (to reflect\u000a      more recent changes in evidence). Again, this revision drew directly on\u000a      the findings of this University of Aberdeen programme of research (in\u000a      particular, the in-depth qualitative study of disadvantaged families),\u000a      recommending a move away from a breastfeeding-centred towards a more\u000a      realistic woman, baby and family centred approach to feeding care [d]. In\u000a      particular, Standard 3 recommends a more mother and parent-centred\u000a      approach to discussing infant feeding antenatally, and references\u000a      Aberdeen's work as supporting evidence.\u000a    The Aberdeen research on coaching has also been integral to the policies\u000a      developed by the Baby Caf&#233; Charitable Trust. The Baby Caf&#233; Charitable\u000a      Trust is an independent charity dedicated to providing free, top-quality\u000a      support to breastfeeding mothers and runs a network of drop-in centres in\u000a      the UK and worldwide. There are currently 111 Baby Cafe centres in the UK\u000a      and a further 27 overseas (source: babycafe.org). Baby Caf&#233; drop-ins are\u000a      run by health professionals such as midwives, health visitors, or\u000a      lactation consultants and they also run so-called \"Baby Caf&#233; Local\"\u000a      drop-ins which are run by healthcare practitioners (e.g. maternity support\u000a      worker) or breastfeeding counsellors from voluntary breastfeeding\u000a      organisations. Help is available on all aspects of breastfeeding. Anyone\u000a      wishing to set up a Baby Caf&#233; drop-in centre must apply to be licensed by\u000a      the Charitable Trust and agree to run their drop-in centre according to\u000a      pre-specified procedures. These procedures are outlined in the Baby Caf&#233;\u000a      \"toolkit\". The Baby Caf&#233; Charitable Trust have sought to ensure that their\u000a      \"toolkit\" is evidence-based and have drawn on research to inform their\u000a      best practice. They explicitly reference the findings from the coaching\u000a      intervention and the BIG trial in their toolkit as providing evidence to\u000a      inform their procedures [e].\u000a    The claimed impact, as defined by REF guidance, is therefore on policy\u000a        and services; practitioners and professional services; society\u000a      and economically.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    University of Aberdeen research has directly influenced worldwide\u000a      guidance for breastfeeding.

The World Health Organization recommends\u000a      exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life. However\u000a      breastfeeding rates in Scotland and the rest of the UK are amongst the\u000a      lowest in the developed world, with only around 40% of babies receiving\u000a      any breast milk at 6-8 weeks. Recognising the importance of addressing\u000a      this significant health need, researchers in the University of Aberdeen - led by Pat Hoddinott, then Senior Lecturer in Primary Care at the\u000a      University - developed an extensive programme of research into the\u000a      barriers and facilitators to breastfeeding as well as a rigorous\u000a      evaluation of interventions to improve breast feeding rates. This research\u000a      programme included three substantive elements:\u000a    \u000a      \u000aThe evaluation of peer-support groups to promote breastfeeding\u000a            in rural areas with below average rates of breastfeeding\u000a        [1,2]. This study evaluated the effectiveness of peer support for new\u000a        mothers. Peer support was provided through midwife\/health visitor\u000a        facilitated groups where actively breastfeeding mothers supported or\u000a        \"coached\" other new mothers to breastfeed. One-to-one coaching could\u000a        also be provided. The study, which followed the feeding outcomes of\u000a        around 600 babies, showed that breastfeeding rates at two weeks in the\u000a        intervention area rose significantly by 34.3% to 41.1%. Breastfeeding\u000a        rates increased at all time points until 8 months. Groups were reported\u000a        to be more popular than one-to-one coaching.\u000a      \u000aA large-scale, pan-Scotland evaluation of a policy to routinely\u000a            establish breastfeeding groups for new mothers [3,4].\u000a        Insights from the peer-support study above, which showed that\u000a        peer support groups looked to be effective in rural areas, led to the\u000a        development a large-scale, pan-Scotland evaluation of a policy to\u000a        routinely establish breastfeeding groups for new mothers. This large\u000a        scale cluster randomised trial - called the \"BIG\" (Breastfeeding in\u000a        Groups) Trial - involved primary care organisations across Scotland\u000a        being randomised to either set up new breastfeeding support groups or to\u000a        not change their existing breastfeeding support provision. This trial,\u000a        which followed more than 18,000 babies, showed no significant change in\u000a        breastfeeding rates at 8 weeks after birth. In-depth qualitative data,\u000a        collected while the trial was ongoing, allowed a model to be developed\u000a        which highlighted the circumstances under which peer support groups\u000a        worked best - strong leadership, evidence of multidisciplinary working\u000a        etc. The report of this study was nominated for the Royal College\u000a        General Practitioners Research Paper of the Year Award.\u000a      \u000aIn-depth qualitative investigation of factors to improve\u000a            breastfeeding in disadvantaged area [5].

The Aberdeen research team employed theories of compensating wage\u000d\u000a      variation and trade union wage bargaining, established in labour\u000d\u000a      economics, to model the determinants of local and regional variations in\u000d\u000a      the competitiveness of pay.

These variations were then related to\u000d\u000a      recruitment and retention.\u000d\u000a    The methodology was then applied in a number of important policy relevant\u000d\u000a      areas:\u000d\u000a    \u000d\u000a      To develop a new method to calculate the Market Forces Factor (MFF).\u000d\u000a        The MFF compensates for unavoidable cost differences in different areas\u000d\u000a        and is a critical element of the formula used to distribute funding to\u000d\u000a        Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in England and Wales. Here, research was\u000d\u000a        undertaken by a team at HERU, led by Elliott, in collaboration with\u000d\u000a        researchers at the universities of York and Glasgow and University\u000d\u000a        College, London. The first phase was carried out between November 2005\u000d\u000a        and December 2008 and was commissioned by the Advisory Committee on\u000d\u000a        Resource Allocation (ACRA) as part of a major review by the Department\u000d\u000a        of Health (DoH). The research recommended six major changes to the MFF\u000d\u000a        formula. A second phase was conducted between December 2009 and November\u000d\u000a        2010 and resulted in further changes [4, 5, 6]\u000d\u000a      To research regional pay of NHS medical and non-medical staff.

The path-breaking nature of the\u000a      work was referred to in a review of Resource Allocation for the Secretary\u000a      of State in 2008:\"A team from York University were awarded the contract\u000a        ... and produced an impressive report based on state-of-the art\u000a        techniques to derive estimates from small-area variations in utilization\u000a        (Carr-Hill et al, 1994a): this was well described by Ken Judge, in\u000a        evidence to the Health Select Committee as being `widely acknowledged to\u000a        be the most impressive and sophisticated undertaken so far in this\u000a        field' (source 1).\u000a    The DoH has been utilising this body of research for the allocation of\u000a      resources for almost 20 years and in 2011-2012, weighted capitation\u000a      formulae informed recurrent allocations of &#163;85 billion to Primary Care\u000a      Trusts and thence via Practice Based Commissioning (PBRA) to General\u000a      Practices, directing resources according to relative population needs.\u000a      Revising the formulae to take account of unmet need, rather than\u000a      just reflecting current utilisation patterns, ensured that particular\u000a      groups in the population (e.g., ethnic minorities and the socially\u000a      disadvantaged) who were not utilising health care services at the same\u000a      level as other groups with similar health characteristics, were not\u000a      unfairly treated in terms of the resources allocated for their care. The\u000a      decisive impact of York's research on NHS resource allocation is\u000a      corroborated in the official history of resource allocation (source 2).\u000a      Research led by, or involving York researchers as co-authors, is\u000a      referenced throughout the account of how the formulae have been developed.\u000a      The appendix shows that York's research features in 18 of the 27\u000a      \"external\" reports to the Dept of Health, used in the development of the\u000a      formulae over several years (source 3).\u000a    Through successive re-organisations of the NHS, York research has defined\u000a      and under-pinned the development of allocation formulae in order to ensure\u000a      that a more equitable distribution of resources is achieved, regardless of\u000a      which organisations (District Health Authorities, PCTs, Clinical\u000a      Commissioning Groups) have had responsibility for the provision and\u000a      purchasing of health care services (source 2). Without the\u000a      research, the financial allocations made to these organisations would have\u000a      been made on a cruder basis, ignoring many of the sources of the relative\u000a      difference in the healthcare needs of local communities. The impact of the\u000a      formula can be illustrated by comparing the allocations to a hypothetical\u000a      benchmark: in 2011\/12, adjusting the allocations to reflect population\u000a      needs (as in the most recent formula) has the effect of re-distributing\u000a      approximately 10% of the total budget of over &#163;100 billion compared with a\u000a      benchmark scenario under which each area received a share based purely on\u000a      the size of their population. The use of the formula, compared to this\u000a      \"equal shares\" scenario, would increase health care budgets by up to &#163;571\u000a      per head of the population in 56% of PCTs and reduce allocations by up to\u000a      &#163;440 in the remaining 44% of PCTs, thus reflecting a re-distribution to\u000a      areas most in need.\u000a    The research undertaken on general practice General Medical Services\u000a      (references 3 and 4) and in particular the element of the research by\u000a      Carr-Hill (reference 3) became widely known as the \"Carr-Hill formula\",\u000a      and has underpinned the capitation payments &#8212; the \"global sum allocation\u000a      formula\" &#8212; since 2004. The BMA said \"The new Carr-Hill allocation\u000a        formula will provide equity, recognise casemix and practice\u000a        circumstances, and ensure money will flow according to patient need\"\u000a      (source 4). The lack of adjustment for factors influencing workload\u000a      and the cost of providing services were perceived as flaws and the new\u000a      contract stated \"The introduction of a global sum payment, combined\u000a        with new rewards for quality, will address these flaws. A new GMS\u000a        resource allocation formula, developed by Professor Roy Carr-Hill of\u000a        York University, will provide the basis for allocating funds for global\u000a        sum resources and for quality payments\" (source 5). The\u000a      formula and its adjusted versions (reference 5) continues to inform\u000a      capitation payments to general practices, involving around &#163;3 billion per\u000a      annum (source 5).\u000a    In addition to the research impacting on the main allocation formula,\u000a      other York research has also had a significant effect on allocations.\u000a      Research on the mental health formula led the DoH working group (ACRA) to\u000a      recommend to Ministers: \"One of two recommendations to have a\u000a        significant impact on PCT target allocations is that for mental health.\u000a        ACRA recommends a new approach to the mental health component of the\u000a        weighted capitation formula. The approach is a major step forward in how\u000a        funding is allocated for mental health services\" (source 6)\u000a      Hence improving the accuracy with which resources can be allocated to\u000a      reflect the relative mental health needs of the population and the costs\u000a      to commissioners of delivering those services.\u000a    The most recently developed Person Based Resource Allocation (PBRA)\u000a      mechanism was the basis of the \"toolkit\" to enable PCTs to compare actual\u000a      expenditure on acute care at practice level with a needs-based standard\u000a      allowing for the differences in needs amongst general practices. This can\u000a      promote an even fairer distribution of NHS funds, to the direct benefit of\u000a      society. This research is cited in the Department of Health's Guidance to\u000a      PCTs which also cites the role of research on mental health (covered in\u000a      reference 6): \" The 2011\/12 toolkit introduces new methodologies for\u000a        the Prescribing and Mental Health parts of the toolkit. This is based\u000a        upon the results of the Resource Allocation for Mental Health and\u000a        Prescribing (RAMP) project, which was developed as part of the\u000a        methodology for PCT allocations. In the 2010\/2011 toolkit we introduced\u000a        a new methodology for the Acute care component. This was based on\u000a        research that the Department of Health commissioned ... to develop an\u000a        acute formula based on the prediction of individual patient costs.

York has been at the forefront of developing methods for\u000a      designing these formulae across the spectrum of NHS activity, encompassing\u000a      primary and secondary care services. This dates back to seminal work in\u000a      1993 when research at York resulted in a step change in the methodology of\u000a      NHS allocation formulae by combining small area level information on\u000a      health care utilisation with small area census data to produce a more\u000a      robust method of modelling population need than hitherto (1). Used by the\u000a      Department of Health (DoH) to allocate resources in the English NHS, the\u000a      `York formula' set the precedent for research and policy over the\u000a      following 20 years and York researchers have made a regular, sustained\u000a      intellectual contribution to this area of research introducing major\u000a      methodological innovations. Research on resource allocation brings\u000a      together a range of researchers from different institutions. York's main\u000a      contributions have centred on devising modelling strategies, developing\u000a      methods, interpreting results and advising on datasets.\u000a    The AREA research (Gravelle; jointly led with the University of Glasgow),\u000a      formed the basis of allocations made from 2003\/04 to 2009\/10 and for the\u000a      first time devised formulae suitable for allocations to Primary Care\u000a      Trusts (2). Using newly assembled data for 8414 geographical areas, the\u000a      research estimated utilisation models that took into account unmet need,\u000a      in order to make the distribution of resources more equitable. It was\u000a      innovative in deriving measures of specifb01c morbidities (to measure\u000a      relative need) at small area level from individual level survey data.\u000a    Capitation payments to general practices since 2004\/05 have been based on\u000a      work by York researchers, producing what is generally referred to as the\u000a      \"Carr-Hill formula\". Carr-Hill led analysis of the impact on GP workload\u000a      (and hence on the costs of delivering care) of a range of factors\u000a      including rurality, age\/sex of practice population and practice turnover\u000a      (3). The research utilised novel data sources, including Inland Revenue\u000a      accounts to explore the expenses attributable to GPs operating in rural\u000a      areas and analysed 99 million computerised \"file openings\" recorded at GP\u000a      practices in order to explore workload. Additional analyses (Gravelle;\u000a      collaborating with Imperial College), used small area data from the Health\u000a      Survey for England for the first time, to allow for socio-economic patient\u000a      factors affecting consultation rates (4). Research by Carr-Hill, Dixon and\u000a      Rice (collaborating with Brunel University) refined the measurement of\u000a      health care needs, incorporating more sensitive age-specific needs\u000a      adjustment and, for the first time, included outpatient hospital activity,\u000a      producing the CARAN formula (5).\u000a    York researchers utilised new data sources in order to improve the way in\u000a      which the formulae take account of the need for mental health services\u000a      (Gravelle, Dusheiko, Smith, in collaboration with Manchester University)\u000a      (6). In particular, use of the Mental Health Minimum Dataset allowed the\u000a      formula to reflect a substantial amount of community-based activity\u000a      delivered to people with mental health conditions, previously excluded\u000a      from the formula.\u000a    A major recent development (Dusheiko, Gravelle, Rice; in collaboration\u000a      with Nuffield Trust) was the derivation of a formula to assist PCTs in\u000a      setting fair share indicative allocations to over 8000 general practices\u000a      within PCTs in England. The analysis involved innovative data linkage\u000a      methods to combine the 55 million patients registered with a general\u000a      practice with around 16 million annual hospital admissions and 84 million\u000a      annual outpatient visits, together with demographic and morbidity\u000a      characteristics, area measures of deprivation and practice and area supply\u000a      characteristics. This research represents a significant innovation in\u000a      several ways: analysis is conducted at the individual, rather than at the\u000a      area level (\"Person Based Resource Allocation\"); the model is prospective\u000a      (it predicts next year's expenditures based on current year's needs\u000a      characteristics); and it includes detailed individual morbidity\u000a      information (7).\u000a    Hugh Gravelle (Prof, August 1995-); Nigel Rice (Senior Research Fellow\u000a      (SRF), Prof 1994-); Roy Carr-Hill (SRF, Prof, 1983-Sept 2011); Mark\u000a      Dusheiko (Research Fellow (RF), SRF 1998-); Peter Smith (Reader, Prof,\u000a      1991-Sept 2009); Paul Dixon (SRF, 1989-April 2010), Trevor Sheldon (SRF,\u000a      Prof, 1992-); Geoff Hardman (RF, 1984-Sept 2005), Steve Martin (RF,\u000a      1989-).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43411","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"}],"Funders":["Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    York research has had an impact on policy and practice in relation to the\u000d\u000a      measurement of overall NHS productivity and the analysis of variations in\u000d\u000a      productivity at hospital and at consultant level.\u000d\u000a    National NHS productivity\u000d\u000a    The annual NHS budget is approximately &#163;106 billion, accounting for 8.2%\u000d\u000a      of gross national product. By developing improved methods of measuring NHS\u000d\u000a      productivity and providing methodologically robust evidence on annual NHS\u000d\u000a      productivity growth, York research has played a significant role in the\u000d\u000a      processes by which the size of the NHS budget is determined. The 2002\u000d\u000a      Spending Review committed the Government to a new Public Service Agreement\u000d\u000a      target of 2% improvements in productivity per year. The DoH turned to York\u000d\u000a      researchers to find a way to incorporate quality of care improvements into\u000d\u000a      the measurement of the output of the NHS. This had not previously been\u000d\u000a      attempted. The methods that York developed then were adopted as national\u000d\u000a      policy and have been used continuously. These methods are incorporated\u000d\u000a      into the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates of NHS\u000d\u000a      productivity, which feed into the annual UK National Accounts (source 1).\u000a      Every year since, the ONS has used the method developed by York as a key\u000d\u000a      element in their triangulation of evidence. The statement \"ONS would\u000d\u000a        like to thank Professor Andrew Street, Dr Adriana Castelli and the\u000d\u000a        Centre for Health Economics (CHE) team at the University of York for\u000d\u000a        their work on healthcare quality adjustments\" appears in all ONS\u000d\u000a      publications relating to NHS productivity. The ONS states that \"Estimates\u000a        of Health gain, Short-term survival and Waiting times are provided by\u000d\u000a        the Centre for Health Economics (CHE) at the University of York. These\u000d\u000a        are derived from patient-level records and offer detailed information at\u000d\u000a        the level of the individual procedure for Inpatients and Day-cases.\u000d\u000a        These are combined into a single measure of quality following the\u000d\u000a        guidance of CHE et al ....\" (source 2). These quality\u000d\u000a      adjustments have added an average of 0.5 percentage points to estimates of\u000d\u000a      annual output growth (source 2) and without York's research, NHS\u000d\u000a      productivity would have been underestimated with negative consequences for\u000d\u000a      the size of future budget settlements for the NHS and hence less\u000d\u000a      investment in NHS services.\u000d\u000a    Estimates of input, output and productivity growth, along with details\u000d\u000a      of the methodological issues that York research addresses, are produced\u000d\u000a      regularly for the DoH for use in their calculations of NHS productivity.\u000d\u000a      Researchers have produced a tool for DoH analysts to use in order to\u000d\u000a      explore in detail the productivity estimates and the impact of different\u000d\u000a      assumptions on future productivity estimates. The estimates provided by\u000d\u000a      York are vital for negotiations with ministers and with agencies that have\u000d\u000a      the power to influence the size of the NHS budget. The research has been\u000d\u000a      used directly to provide numerical answers and context for Health Select\u000d\u000a      Committees and Public Accounts Committees, and Hansard records show that\u000d\u000a      York is often cited by name (source 3). The National Audit Office\u000d\u000a      report on Agenda for Change raised the issue of how measures of NHS output\u000d\u000a      were quality adjusted and, at the Public Accounts Committee, the DoH\u000d\u000a      responded by referring to the research commissioned from York in order to\u000d\u000a      improve the method of adjustment (source 4). The 2008\/9 Public\u000d\u000a      Expenditure Inquiry asked for a progress report on the York work and in\u000d\u000a      answering the question the DoH cited the York study on inputs and also\u000d\u000a      indicated that York would be producing productivity estimates at a\u000d\u000a      Strategic Health Authority level (source 5).\u000d\u000a    York research has also been influential internationally. Representatives\u000d\u000a      from the Italian, Swedish and Japanese governments visited York in 2011,\u000d\u000a      2012 and 2013 respectively, to learn more about the methods used to\u000d\u000a      measure productivity in the UK. York researchers are working on\u000d\u000a      measurement of productivity for the Italian Ministry of Health (with\u000d\u000a      colleagues at the University of Rome Tor Vergata), replicating for Italy,\u000d\u000a      the methods used in England. York staff have run invited workshops on\u000d\u000a      methods of productivity measurement to policy makers, national\u000d\u000a      statisticians and academics nationally and internationally.\u000d\u000a    Specialist hospital care\u000d\u000a    Research on the costs of specialist care was commissioned from York as\u000d\u000a      part of \"a fundamental review of the current methodology\" used to\u000d\u000a      calculate specialised service top-ups for the Payment by Results tariff (source\u000a        6). Our research resulted in changes in policy in 2011\/12, including\u000d\u000a      the introduction of new top-ups for neurosciences and spinal surgery and\u000d\u000a      revision of the level of existing top-ups for children's services and\u000d\u000a      orthopaedics (source 6, paras 11 and 94-101). York's report is\u000d\u000a      included on the DoH website alongside the Payment by Results Guidance\u000d\u000a      documents.\u000d\u000a    Hospital consultant productivity\u000d\u000a    Staff costs are the largest single component of NHS expenditure. York\u000d\u000a      research into productivity at consultant level has had significant policy\u000d\u000a      impacts in three ways. Firstly, the method of describing and exploring\u000d\u000a      variation in consultant productivity was adopted as a benchmarking tool by\u000d\u000a      the DoH's Workforce Directorate and the NHS Institute of Innovation and\u000d\u000a      Improvement as part of their `Delivering Quality and Value' programme,\u000d\u000a      which in 2008 distributed comparative data on consultant clinical activity\u000d\u000a      to all hospital Trusts in England (source 7). This document states\u000d\u000a      that their process: \"uses the methodology outlined in York University's\u000d\u000a        report: Measuring Productivity of Hospital Consultants using Hospital\u000d\u000a        Episode Statistics in England\".\u000d\u000a    Second, this research influenced the recent review of clinical excellence\u000d\u000a      awards by the Doctors' and Dentists' Review Body (DDRB). In evidence to\u000d\u000a      the Review Body, Bloor and Maynard recommended \"introducing an extended\u000d\u000a      career structure for doctors, with earned increments and a senior\u000d\u000a      consultant grade\" and this recommendation was adopted by the DDRB in their\u000d\u000a      report (source 8), and a `principal consultant grade' is now under\u000d\u000a      negotiation with the British Medical Association (source 9).

York researchers have conducted a programme of research to improve\u000d\u000a      the measurement of NHS productivity at macro, meso and micro levels.\u000d\u000a      Methods developed at York have been used to seek explanations for\u000d\u000a      variations in productivity.\u000d\u000a    National NHS productivity\u000d\u000a    In 2005, a York team (Street, Castelli, Gravelle, Dawson) developed novel\u000d\u000a      and substantially improved methods to measure the productivity of the NHS\u000d\u000a      in England (1). This was followed by an ongoing research programme which\u000d\u000a      has continuously refined and improved the methods over the subsequent 8\u000d\u000a      years.\u000d\u000a    The productivity estimates that researchers at York developed were\u000d\u000a      derived from detailed secondary analysis of routinely collected NHS data.\u000d\u000a      They represented an advance on standard practice in other sectors and\u000d\u000a      internationally in three important ways (1). Firstly, the index of outputs\u000d\u000a      was comprehensive, capturing activities in 5,381 healthcare\u000d\u000a      categories for all NHS patients treated by either NHS or non-NHS\u000d\u000a      providers, incorporating information about every patient treated in\u000d\u000a      hospital including outpatient and accident and emergency departments,\u000d\u000a      mental health and community care settings, diagnostic facilities, and\u000d\u000a      primary care. Second, the quality of output was assessed by\u000d\u000a      including indicators such as health outcomes, patient satisfaction,\u000d\u000a      waiting times and readmissions. Third, better measures of NHS input,\u000d\u000a      particularly labour and capital, were compiled. Annual estimates of NHS\u000d\u000a      input, output and productivity growth are now produced by York researchers\u000d\u000a      for the Department of Health (DoH) (2), incorporating updated methods and\u000d\u000a      new data each year. They include a range of sensitivity analyses to ensure\u000d\u000a      robust estimates. Methods to analyse regional productivity have also been\u000d\u000a      developed, with estimates showing significant variation across the country\u000d\u000a      which indicate potential savings of &#163;3.2bn (3).\u000d\u000a    Specialist hospital care\u000d\u000a    Research on specialist hospital care, undertaken by Street and Daidone in\u000d\u000a      2010 and 2011, applied advanced econometric methods to hospital data for\u000d\u000a      over 26 million patients. They isolated the extra costs associated with\u000d\u000a      the provision of specialist care, accounting for a range of other factors\u000d\u000a      that may also influence hospital costs. Results showed that higher costs\u000d\u000a      were legitimately associated with the provision of specialised care only\u000d\u000a      for a small number of conditions and groups, including cancer, cystic\u000d\u000a      fibrosis and children's care (4).\u000d\u000a    Hospital consultant productivity\u000d\u000a    Bloor and Maynard developed and applied methods of measuring the\u000d\u000a      productivity of individual hospital consultants (5). Linking NHS data with\u000d\u000a      information about consultants from the Medical Workforce Census for the\u000d\u000a      first time, datasets of inpatient activity were derived for all\u000d\u000a      consultants in ten specialties in England. Using multi-level modelling,\u000d\u000a      factors were identified that predict consultant productivity. Consultants\u000d\u000a      with a `maximum part-time contract' (permitting substantial private\u000d\u000a      practice) were found to treat more NHS patients on average than their\u000d\u000a      full-time NHS colleagues, as did those with clinical excellence awards\u000d\u000a      (bonus payments) (6). This finding was reinforced in a later study which\u000d\u000a      included exploration of associations between clinical excellence awards\u000d\u000a      and consultant productivity (7). Finally, using interrupted time series,\u000d\u000a      it was shown that reform of the consultant contract in 2003 failed to\u000d\u000a      improve consultant productivity, and indeed in some specialties such as\u000d\u000a      trauma and orthopaedic surgery, the effect was negative (8).\u000d\u000a    Contributors to the research:\u000d\u000a    Karen Bloor, (Senior Research Fellow (SRF), Prof, 1991-); Chris Bojke\u000d\u000a      (SRF 2009-); Adriana Castelli (Research Fellow (RF), SRF 2004-); Silvio\u000d\u000a      Daidone (RF, 2010); Diane Dawson (SRF 1997-2005; Nick Freemantle\u000d\u000a      (SRF,1993- 2000); Rosalind Goudie, (RF, 2011); Hugh Gravelle (Prof,\u000d\u000a      1995-); Mauro Laudicella (RF 2007-10); Alan Maynard (Prof 1971-); Andrew\u000d\u000a      Street (1999-SRF, Prof); Padraic Ward (RF 2008-12).\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43412","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255150","Name":"South America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"1605651","Name":"Thailand"},{"GeoNamesId":"453733","Name":"Estonia"},{"GeoNamesId":"3686110","Name":"Colombia"},{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"3469034","Name":"Brazil"},{"GeoNamesId":"1814991","Name":"China"},{"GeoNamesId":"6290252","Name":"Serbia"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research undertaken at York underpins NICE technology appraisal\u000d\u000a      methods. NICE's 2008 \"Guide to the Methods of Technology Appraisal\" (source\u000d\u000a        1) describes the key principles of appraisal methodology which must\u000d\u000a      be adhered to by all organisations submitting evidence to the technology\u000d\u000a      appraisal programme. The guidance was shaped by the York research and York\u000d\u000a      researchers involved in: the NICE Decision Support Unit (Palmer); the\u000d\u000a      Methodology Working Party (Sculpher); the Methods Guide Review Workshops\u000d\u000a      (Sculpher, Griffin); producing 3 briefing papers (source 2). The\u000d\u000a      Guide drew on York research showing the need to consider the uncertainty\u000d\u000a      and limitations of the evidence base and a requirement for rigorous\u000d\u000a      methods \"to assess the implications of uncertainty, including the\u000d\u000a        uncertainty around the appropriate structure of the economic model, the\u000d\u000a        choice of sources and analyses to inform the estimates of costs and\u000d\u000a        health effects, and the precision with which these are known.\" (para\u000d\u000a      5.1.11).\u000d\u000a    This Guide (and the 2013 version) has governed the methods used to\u000d\u000a      generate each of the 161 pieces of Technology Guidance issued by NICE\u000d\u000a      since 2008. These are relevant to clinical practice in conditions that are\u000d\u000a      major causes of mortality and morbidity which also place significant\u000d\u000a      demands on NHS resources. Over half of NICE guidance has been in the areas\u000d\u000a      of cancer, cardiovascular and respiratory heath, which, in 2008, were\u000d\u000a      responsible for almost 350,000 deaths (associated with over 2m years of\u000d\u000a      life lost) and accounted for over &#163;16bn of NHS spending. York research on\u000d\u000a      methods for evidence synthesis was cited extensively in four NICE Decision\u000d\u000a      Support Unit Technical guidance documents in 2011 (source 3). NICE\u000d\u000a      has reviewed the Methods Guide (2013) and York staff have been heavily\u000d\u000a      involved as members and facilitators of the Methods Guide Review Workshops\u000d\u000a      (Griffin, McKenna, Palmer, Sculpher, Spackman, Walker) and have produced a\u000d\u000a      briefing paper on the appropriate cost perspective for NICE appraisals to\u000d\u000a      adopt (ie, whether evaluation of healthcare interventions should include\u000d\u000a      costs that fall on non-health sectors) (source 4). Sculpher\u000d\u000a      participated in the decision-making meetings on perspective and the\u000d\u000a      revised Guide follows York recommendations in terms of limiting the\u000d\u000a      perspective to the NHS and personal social services, unless NICE\u000d\u000a      specifically requests a broader scope (source 5).\u000d\u000a    The Department of Health's consultation document on value based pricing\u000d\u000a      referred to the need to establish the evidence base for an appropriate\u000d\u000a      cost-effectiveness threshold, saying that \"Work is already in hand with\u000d\u000a        external experts to achieve this\", citing Sculpher's research as the\u000d\u000a      source of that evidence (source 6). The value and appropriateness\u000d\u000a      of NICE processes were reviewed by the House of Commons Health Select\u000d\u000a      Committee. Oral and written evidence was presented by York on the cost\u000d\u000a      effectiveness threshold used by NICE and expenditure decisions by Primary\u000d\u000a      Care Trusts. The Select Committee advocated that further research -\u000d\u000a      similar to that undertaken by York - takes place on the cost effectiveness\u000d\u000a      thresholds used by NICE. The Government endorsed the Committee's\u000d\u000a      expression of support for NICE's programmes and commended the processes by\u000d\u000a      which it discharges its responsibilities (source 7).\u000d\u000a    The York contribution to economic evaluation methods used by NICE is\u000d\u000a      internationally influential. Countries that have developed\/are developing\u000d\u000a      decision-making institutions like NICE are listed by NICE International\u000d\u000a      and the methods adopted are based on those developed by York (source\u000d\u000a        8). York researchers have been involved in directly advising other\u000d\u000a      health systems about their methods and processes of technology assessment,\u000d\u000a      for example, in Ireland: \"The guidelines for evaluating clinical\u000d\u000a        effectiveness have been developed in consultation with the Scientific\u000d\u000a        Advisory Group of the Authority... this group includes methodological\u000d\u000a        experts from the field of HTA.\" Drummond and Sculpher are listed in\u000d\u000a      the Scientific Group as the only non-Irish members (source 9). The\u000d\u000a      Belgian Guidelines external expert group lists York's Claxton and Gravelle\u000d\u000a      as the only UK experts (source 10) and Sculpher is the only\u000d\u000a      non-North American on the USA Cost-effectiveness Panel (source 11).\u000d\u000a      The establishment and\/or development of approaches to technology appraisal\u000d\u000a      in countries such as Brazil, USA, China, Colombia, Estonia, Serbia,\u000d\u000a      Thailand and Turkey are influenced by the methods and processes developed\u000d\u000a      by York and employed by NICE: eg, the Brazilian guidelines: \"The entire\u000d\u000a        methodology pointed out in the following topics is based on\u000d\u000a        internationally published methodological guidelines\" &#8212; and cites\u000d\u000a      NICE as one of the sources (source 12); the US Wellpoint HTA\u000d\u000a      Guidelines: \"The US Panel on Cost-Effectiveness and the latest NICE\u000d\u000a        Guide to the Methods of Technology Appraisal argue for the pivotal role\u000d\u000a        of a reference case in driving resource allocation decisions within\u000d\u000a        health care systems. This position is also taken by WP ...\" (source\u000d\u000a        13).\u000d\u000a    Our research has impacted on major NHS policy initiatives and has had a\u000d\u000a      wider impact on the health care system. York research on the Quality and\u000d\u000a      Outcomes Framework (QOF), whereby GPs are paid for achieving quality, has\u000d\u000a      informed the approach taken by NICE. Since 2009 NICE has been responsible\u000d\u000a      for producing an annual `menu' of new, evidence-based cost-effective\u000d\u000a      clinical and health improvement indicators. The methods used by NICE to\u000d\u000a      assess the value for money of potential QOF indicators are taken directly\u000d\u000a      from York's research: \"this appendix presents the underpinning\u000d\u000a        assumptions and data requirements that will be used to determine cost\u000d\u000a        effectiveness by the York Health Economics Consortium. The work has been\u000d\u000a        informed by research undertaken by York University and University of\u000d\u000a        East Anglia ...\" (source 14). By ensuring that QOF payments\u000d\u000a      reflect the value of the indicators in terms of the health benefit\u000d\u000a      produced, our research helps to ensure maximum health gain is achieved for\u000d\u000a      money spent on rewarding high quality care. The QOF indicators cover a\u000d\u000a      range of conditions and activities for the population of 54 million\u000d\u000a      registered patients in England served by over 8,000 GP practices, thus the\u000d\u000a      impact on quality is considerable.\u000d\u000a    Professor Sir Michael Rawlins, chair of NICE until 2012, supporting our\u000d\u000a      successful application for a Queen's Anniversary Prize, described York's\u000d\u000a      impact: \"The centre [CHE, Uni of York] has made extraordinary\u000d\u000a        contributions both nationally and internationally to the development of\u000d\u000a        health economics. It has done so from both a theoretical and practical\u000d\u000a        standpoint. In particular, its contributions to the work of NICE have\u000d\u000a        been so very important that I doubt if we would have achieved anything\u000d\u000a        without the rigour and expertise provided by the Centre and many of its\u000d\u000a        staff.\"\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    A programme of methodological research undertaken by the University of\u000d\u000a      York has shaped the economic evaluation methods used by the National\u000d\u000a      Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) since its inception, to\u000d\u000a      assess the cost-effectiveness of healthcare interventions. Therefore the\u000d\u000a      methods developed by York underpin many of the healthcare decisions by\u000d\u000a      NICE on which new and existing interventions and programmes should be\u000d\u000a      funded and used in the NHS. The methods used by NICE have also had a major\u000d\u000a      influence on the approach taken to technology assessment internationally\u000d\u000a      and so York's underpinning research has had wide impact beyond the UK.\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactType":"Political","Institution":"\u000d\u000a    University of York\u000d\u000a    ","Institutions":[{"AlternativeName":"York (University of)","InstitutionName":"University of York","PeerGroup":"B","Region":"Yorkshire And Humberside","UKPRN":10007167}],"Panel":"A         ","PlaceName":[],"References":"\u000d\u000a    Most of the research has been published in high quality peer reviewed\u000d\u000a      journals and was supported primarily by competitively awarded grants.\u000d\u000a    \u000a1.

The process\u000d\u000a      entails assessment of the benefits, harms and cost-effectiveness of\u000d\u000a      healthcare interventions. Given the nature of NICE's decision-making\u000d\u000a      responsibilities, the methods used for cost effectiveness analysis (CEA)\u000d\u000a      required further development. York research addressed important\u000d\u000a      methodological issues and has therefore shaped the methods adopted by NICE\u000d\u000a      in key areas (listed below). Developing methods for evaluation of\u000d\u000a      healthcare technologies brings together a range of research skills from\u000d\u000a      different institutions. Much of the work described was led by York whose\u000d\u000a      researchers have made a sustained intellectual contribution throughout the\u000d\u000a      period, centred on methods of cost effectiveness analysis to support\u000d\u000a      health system decision making; characterising and reflecting evidential\u000d\u000a      uncertainty and heterogeneity; and value of information analysis to\u000d\u000a      prioritise and design research. Much of the research was led by York or,\u000d\u000a      where undertaken in collaboration with other institutions, York\u000d\u000a      researchers made significant intellectual contributions focusing on the\u000d\u000a      economic issues.\u000d\u000a    (1) Approaches to dealing with decision uncertainty\u000d\u000a      We demonstrated: the sensitivity of evaluation results to key parameter\u000d\u000a      estimates and the centrality of handling uncertainty appropriately in\u000d\u000a      decision making; the importance of dealing with uncertainty in all sources\u000d\u000a      of evidence simultaneously using probabilistic methods; the need to link parameter\u000d\u000a      uncertainty to decision uncertainty and to the value of additional\u000d\u000a      research; the potential need to tie access to new technologies to\u000d\u000a      requirements for more data collection (1-3).\u000d\u000a    (2) Methods for evidence synthesis for use in economic evaluation\u000d\u000a      Research with the Bristol University (York co-investigators) considered\u000d\u000a      appropriate methods for evidence synthesis to support decisions by NICE\u000d\u000a      and similar organisations. We demonstrated how to estimate the\u000d\u000a      effectiveness of an intervention relative to policy relevant comparators\u000d\u000a      where no head-to-head comparison was available (4), building on earlier\u000d\u000a      York research (5).\u000d\u000a    (3) Approaches to dealing with heterogeneity\u000d\u000a      We showed the importance of exploring variation in both the effects and\u000d\u000a      the costs of health technologies according to patient clinical and\u000d\u000a      socio-demographic characteristics. The research can inform decisions on\u000d\u000a      which interventions should be recommended for which patients. We also\u000d\u000a      explored the methodological issues raised by undertaking sub-group\u000d\u000a      analysis in CEA (6).\u000d\u000a    (4) Methods to estimate the cost-effectiveness of increasing NHS\u000d\u000a        uptake of innovation\u000d\u000a      A major challenge for most healthcare systems is how to ensure the\u000d\u000a      adoption of cost-effective interventions. Value of implementation\u000d\u000a      analysis, which estimates the level of investment justified for\u000d\u000a      implementation activities was developed in York (7). With clinical input\u000d\u000a      from East Anglia, we proposed that the Quality and Outcomes Framework\u000d\u000a      performance indicators should use value of implementation analysis,\u000d\u000a      applying the same evidential standards as those used by NICE (8).\u000d\u000a    (5) Estimating the cost-effectiveness threshold\u000d\u000a      CEA assesses whether the expected health gain from the use of a new\u000d\u000a      medical technology exceeds the health likely to be forgone as other NHS\u000d\u000a      activities are displaced to cover the additional costs of the new\u000d\u000a      technology. The cost-effectiveness threshold represents an estimate of the\u000d\u000a      health forgone as services are displaced. York researchers developed\u000d\u000a      appropriate methods for threshold estimation to be used in decisions about\u000d\u000a      the use of NHS resources (9).\u000d\u000a    Researchers: Mark Sculpher (Prof Nov 1997-); Susan Griffin (Research\u000d\u000a      Fellow (RF) &amp; Senior Research Fellow (SRF) Oct 2002-) Richard Cookson\u000d\u000a      (Reader Aug 2006-); Simon Walker (RF Oct 2006-); Karl Claxton (SRF &amp;\u000d\u000a      Prof Oct 1989-); Anne Mason (RF &amp; SRF June 1998-); Stephen Palmer (SRF\u000d\u000a      &amp; Prof April 1995-); Mike Drummond (Prof May 1990-); Fuijan Song (SRF\u000d\u000a      July 1993-Oct 2000); Alison Eastwood (RF &amp; SRF Sept 1994-); Anne-Marie\u000d\u000a      Glenny (RF Oct 1995-April 1999); Elizabeth Fenwick (RF Oct 1999-Dec 2005);\u000d\u000a      Marta Soares (RF 2007); Seb Hind (RF Oct 2010-); Eldon Spackman (RF Feb\u000d\u000a      2010-)\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43413","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    (a) Screening for depression in primary care\u000d\u000a    Prior to the conduct and dissemination of our work, guidance issued by\u000d\u000a      NICE (source 1) and international bodies such as the US Agency for\u000d\u000a      Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) (source 2) had been\u000d\u000a      supportive of screening for depression.

York's research was directly cited as the\u000d\u000a      evidence underpinning the first `demonstration sites' in Doncaster (source\u000a        12). Due to the success of field trials this programme was scaled up\u000d\u000a      and one million NHS patients received new episodes of care under the IAPT\u000d\u000a      by 2013 (source 13).\u000d\u000a    (iv) York developed a secure and responsive computer support system to\u000d\u000a      record treatments and track patient progress over time (Primary Care\u000d\u000a      Management Information System &#8212; PC-MIS&#169;). This formed the\u000d\u000a      central I support for our collaborative care trials (www.pc-mis.co.uk\/).\u000a      PC-MIS&#169;has been widely adopted; it is being used in 69 NHS\u000d\u000a      trusts and has recorded the outcome of over one million patient episodes\u000d\u000a      (over six million individual patient contacts) since roll out in 2006 (source\u000a        14).\u000d\u000a    (v) We pioneered the analysis of PC-MIS IAPT clinical outcome data to\u000d\u000a      'benchmark' local clinical performance against national standards. This\u000d\u000a      system of service-level evaluations was adopted nationally and forms a\u000d\u000a      national template to allow mental health services to engage in `Payment by\u000d\u000a      Results' based on reliable and statistically significant measures of\u000d\u000a      clinical change (source 15). The metrics of treatment success which\u000d\u000a      York researchers developed though PC-MIS&#169; are now the `gold\u000d\u000a      standard outcome' for IAP `Payment by Results' (source 16), which\u000d\u000a      is being rolled out across the NHS, having initially been piloted in 23\u000d\u000a      sites in the UK.\u000d\u000a    International impact\u000d\u000a      Our research is cited in international guidelines in the US, Canada,\u000d\u000a      Europe and Australia. York's evidence synthesis, for example, formed an\u000d\u000a      organising principle in the US Veterans Affairs services for depression (source\u000a        17) and influenced (and was cited in) the 2009 revision of\u000d\u000a      depression guidelines by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality\u000d\u000a      &amp; US Preventative Services Task Force (source 9). York's 2006\u000d\u000a      review is cited as the evidential basis for a US-wide training programme\u000d\u000a      led from the University of Washington (the IMPACT evidence based\u000d\u000a        depression care programme www.impact-uw.org).\u000a      (`A meta-analysis of the evidence for collaborative depression care was\u000d\u000a        published by Gilbody, et al ...concluded that sufficient randomized\u000d\u000a        evidence had emerged by 2000 to demonstrate the effectiveness of\u000d\u000a        collaborative care beyond conventional levels of statistical\u000d\u000a        significance. ...and it is unlikely that further randomized evidence\u000d\u000a        will overturn this result.' (Source 18). This programme of\u000d\u000a      training and organisational enhancement for depression has now been\u000d\u000a      implemented in 31 states in the USA, and has been adopted by a number of\u000d\u000a      US healthcare providers, including Kaiser Permanente (serving over 3\u000d\u000a      million people) and the Institute for Urban Family Health) (source 18).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    York research showing that a) screening for depression in primary\u000d\u000a        care is ineffective and b) collaborative and stepped care\u000d\u000a      improves outcomes for depression in primary care, has changed national and\u000d\u000a      international policy. The National Institute for Health and Care\u000d\u000a      Excellence (NICE) revised its guidelines, the National Screening Committee\u000d\u000a      altered its recommendations, and money has been saved by no longer paying\u000d\u000a      GPs to screen for depression under the Quality and Outcomes Framework.

Exclusive breast-feeding rates have also increased (at three months\u000d\u000a      they were 17% in 2010 compared with 13% in 2005, and at four months they\u000d\u000a      were 12% in 2010 compared with 7% in 2005). Rates of increase were highest\u000d\u000a      in low income women, reflecting our research recommendations to focus on\u000d\u000a      those where the potential to impact on important health outcomes is\u000d\u000a      greatest (source 11).\u000d\u000a    -- Health outcomes\u000d\u000a    Increased rates of breastfeeding, particularly amongst those at higher\u000d\u000a      risk improves health outcomes in infants in the short and long term.

Following\u000d\u000a      implementation of recommendations from our reviews, the prevalence of\u000d\u000a      skin-to-skin care in neonatal units across Yorkshire &amp; the Humber\u000d\u000a      increased from 20% in 2010 to &gt;40% in 2012 and receipt of breast milk\u000d\u000a      on discharge from 40% to 52% (source 13). This has resulted in all\u000d\u000a      UK units now collecting breast (milk) feeding outcomes within the UK\u000d\u000a      national routine audit systems and the RCPCH National Neonatal Audit\u000d\u000a      Programme. This national audit found that the proportion of very preterm\u000d\u000a      infants receiving any breast milk at discharge rose from 54% in 2011 to\u000d\u000a      58% in 2012, which will reduce mortality and morbidity associated with\u000d\u000a      diseases such as necrotising enterocolitis (source 14).\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Our research, which identified effective and cost-effective interventions\u000d\u000a      to help women, particularly those in low income groups, make informed\u000d\u000a      choices and establish and maintain breastfeeding for newborn infants, has\u000d\u000a      changed health policy and practice nationally and internationally.

For\u000a      example, the London branch, My Fair London, developed a pledge for\u000a      candidates in the London\u000a      Mayoral election, stating \"we draw heavily on The Spirit Level\".5\u000a      Equality Bristol produced an\u000a      `Equality Declaration' for local election candidates to sign. The Newport\u000a      group successfully\u000a      campaigned for the setting up of a local Fairness Commission.\u000a    The Spirit Level has been extensively reviewed, discussed, and referred\u000a      to by commentators,\u000a      politicians and others in the international printed media (from the\u000a      Financial Times and The\u000a      Economist to The New York Times; quotes are available at:\u000a      www.equalitytrust.org.uk\/node\/200),\u000a      on radio, television (including the BBC and CNN), the internet, and in\u000a      legislative assemblies\u000a      including both Houses of Parliament in England, the Scottish Parliament,\u000a      the Welsh Assembly, the\u000a      New Zealand, Australian and Canadian parliaments.6\u000a    Inspiring the Production of Cultural Artefacts\u000a    A Spirit Level Documentary is in production by award-winning independent\u000a      documentary maker\u000a      Christopher Hird of Dartmouth Films and directed by Kathryn Round.

Inequality can\u000a        breed crime, disease and environmental degradation and hamper economic\u000a        growth.\"8 Nobel Prize\u000a      winning economist, Paul Krugman, wrote, \"Wilkinson-type views about the\u000a        corrosive effects of\u000a        inequality are going seriously mainstream.\"9 Wilkinson\u000a      was a keynote speaker at the High Level\u000a      Meeting on Wellbeing and Happiness at the UN in New York in April 2011,\u000a      which resulted in UN\u000a      resolution 65\/309 Happiness: towards a holistic approach to development,\u000a      which recognised that\u000a      \"gross domestic product...does not adequately reflect the...wellbeing\u000a        of people in a country\"\u000a    In terms of UK policy impact, The Spirit Level has perhaps been most\u000a      influential in the\u000a      establishment and outcomes of local Fairness Commissions.10\u000a      Since 2010, twelve Local\u000a      Authorities, (Birmingham, Blackpool, Islington, Leicester, Liverpool,\u000a      Newcastle, Newport,\u000a      Portsmouth, Sheffield, Southampton, Tower Hamlets, York) have established\u000a      `Fairness\u000a      Commissions', to investigate and implement ways of reducing inequality in\u000a      their areas such as\u000a      recommending and campaigning for, the payment of a Living Wage.\u000a      Wilkinson was a\u000a      Commissioner for Islington and York, and Pickett for York. All Fairness\u000a      Commissions cite The\u000a      Spirit Level as inspiration for their formation and objectives and all\u000a      that have reported so far\u000a      support the implementation of a Living Wage and pay ratios. Pickett was\u000a      appointed in July 2013 to\u000a      the independent Living Wage Commission. The Spirit Level also\u000a      influenced the High Pay\u000a      Commission,11 and the UK Drug Policy Commission.12\u000a    The Equality Act which received Royal Assent in 2010 included a duty that\u000a      local and national public\u000a      bodies must `have regard to the desirability of reducing socio-economic\u000a      inequalities' in their\u000a      decision-making.

The picture is consistent whether\u000a      comparing rich countries or\u000a      the 50 states of the USA, and the magnitude of the effect is very large:\u000a      for example, there are ten-fold\u000a      differences in teenage birth rates, three-fold differences in rates of\u000a      mental illness and two-fold\u000a      differences in infant mortality between more and less equal societies.\u000a    The York-based research by Pickett and Wilkinson which underpins The\u000a        Spirit Level established\u000a      that levels of absolute standards of living, measured as Gross National\u000a      Income per capita are\u000a      unrelated to levels of health and wellbeing in rich nations, whereas\u000a      income differences are key. It is\u000a      relative income, one's status within the social hierarchy of a society,\u000a      which matters more than\u000a      absolute income. Importantly, greater inequality seems to produce worse\u000a      outcomes for the vast\u000a      majority of the population (6). Analyses comparing people in more equal\u000a      societies with their\u000a      counterparts at the same socioeconomic position in less equal societies\u000a      showed that whilst those\u000a      lower down the social hierarchy benefit most from greater equality; even\u000a      those near the top benefit.\u000a    The pathways linking inequality to health and social problems are\u000a      psychosocial. Foremost among\u000a      the psychosocial risk factors for poor health are three intensely social\u000a      factors: low social status,\u000a      weak social support, and a poor quality of early childhood experience. To\u000a      improve the quality of\u000a      life, The Spirit Level suggests that attention must be paid to the\u000a      social environment and the quality\u000a      of social relations, and that reducing material inequality will improve\u000a      the psychosocial wellbeing\u000a      and social functioning of whole societies.\u000a    Pickett (L, then SL, then Prof; 2003 -) and Wilkinson (Prof at the\u000a      University of Nottingham until\u000a      retirement in 2008 and Honorary Visiting Professor at York, 2005 &#8212;\u000a      present).\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43526","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"895949","Name":"Zambia"},{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Work by LSHTM researchers into TB prevention among people with HIV has\u000d\u000a      directly informed the evolution of WHO guidelines on IPT since 1998,\u000d\u000a      including the most recent update in 2011, and updated guidance on TB and\u000d\u000a      HIV collaborative activities in 2012. It has also provided evidence for\u000d\u000a      key stakeholders to adopt IPT.\u000d\u000a    Drawing directly on Porter's Kenyan and Zambian trials, IPT became one of\u000d\u000a      the key interventions recommended by WHO in 19985.1 to reduce\u000d\u000a      the burden of TB in people living with HIV &#8212; yet implementation of IPT was\u000d\u000a      initially very slow. In 2005 only 25,000 people living with HIV worldwide\u000d\u000a      were reported to have received it.\u000d\u000a    A series of research articles about IPT, including Grant and\u000d\u000a      Godfrey-Faussett as co-authors, was published in 2010 in AIDS,5.2,\u000d\u000a        5.3 the International AIDS Society's official journal, made\u000d\u000a      publicly available, open access, via their website to 16,000 members from\u000d\u000a      196 countries including clinicians, public health and community\u000d\u000a      practitioners, policy and programme planners. The same edition also\u000d\u000a      contains an opinion piece that heavily draws on LSHTM research.5.4\u000d\u000a    At the AIDS 2012 Conference in Washington, Grant was invited to present\u000d\u000a      her research regarding new approaches for TB prevention.5.5\u000d\u000a      This was reported, among others, by HIV &amp; AIDS Treatment in\u000d\u000a        Practice, a widely read email newsletter distributed to\u000d\u000a      practitioners worldwide.5.6\u000d\u000a    As part of Grant's `Thibela TB' trial (ended 2012), over 24,000 miners\u000d\u000a      started IPT, the largest number in any clinical trial. Beyond the health\u000d\u000a      benefit experienced by those participating in the trial, the results, in\u000d\u000a      combination with Grant's data from the meta-analyses about drug resistance\u000d\u000a      after IPT, and on how to screen for active TB prior to IPT, were directly\u000d\u000a      fed into the revision of WHO guidelines on IPT. In 2010 Grant and\u000d\u000a      Godfrey-Faussett were invited to join the WHO Guidelines Group, reviewing\u000d\u000a      new scientific evidence and contributing LSHTM research into the process\u000d\u000a      which led to a revision of WHO guidelines.5.7 As a direct\u000d\u000a      result of LSHTM research, new recommendations included that isoniazid\u000d\u000a      should be offered to individuals regardless of previous tuberculosis\u000d\u000a      history,3.2 and that people living with HIV should be screened\u000d\u000a      for active TB using a tool derived largely from LSHTM research. The\u000d\u000a      guidelines also draw directly on the LSHTM research in addressing the\u000d\u000a      misconceptions that may contribute to the low uptake of isoniazid therapy\u000d\u000a      &#8212; for example the concern that using isoniazid without other TB\u000d\u000a      medications promotes drug resistance.\u000d\u000a    The following year (2011) Godfrey-Faussett was a member of WHO's policy\u000d\u000a      updating group, responsible for advising WHO concerning collaborative\u000d\u000a      TB\/HIV activities in response to demand from countries for guidance on\u000d\u000a      actions to decrease the dual burden of TB and HIV. Drawing on LSHTM\u000d\u000a      research,3.5 the updated policy emphasised the need to\u000d\u000a      establish mechanisms for integrated TB and HIV services, preferably at the\u000d\u000a      same time and location.5.8\u000d\u000a    Grant's Thibela TB research has been particularly influential in\u000d\u000a      promoting IPT use in South Africa. Through work with key collaborators\u000d\u000a      such as the Aurum Institute, greater stakeholder and political awareness\u000d\u000a      of the efficacy of IPT was raised. In 2009, the South African Minister of\u000d\u000a      Health said of the Thibela TB study: `your research on the community-wide\u000d\u000a      use of isoniazid has that ground-breaking feel'.5.9 In his\u000d\u000a      opening speech at the South African AIDS Conference (Durban, June 2013),\u000d\u000a      the Minister of Health, Dr Aaron Motsoaledi, referred directly to LSHTM\u000d\u000a      research when he said: `This decline [in TB deaths] has been attributed by\u000d\u000a      researchers to the increased number of HIV positive patients on ARVs as\u000d\u000a      well as the screening for TB and putting eligible patients on IPT...

As a direct result\u000d\u000a      of the research findings, WHO recommendations now promote wider use of\u000d\u000a      IPT.

In the pre-HIV\u000d\u000a      era, IPT was an important intervention for preventing TB, but its efficacy\u000d\u000a      among people with HIV was unknown. This has been the focus of work for\u000d\u000a      researchers at LSHTM including Professors of International Health Alison\u000d\u000a      Grant (LSHTM since 1994, MRC Training Fellow 1994-7), John Porter (LSHTM\u000d\u000a      since 1990, then Senior Clinical Lecturer) and Peter Godfrey-Faussett\u000d\u000a      (LSHTM since 1989, then Clinical Research Fellow).\u000d\u000a    Between 1992 and 1998, Porter led randomised trials to determine the\u000d\u000a      efficacy of isoniazid in preventing TB among HIV-positive adults in Kenya\u000d\u000a      (N=684) and Zambia (N=1053), the latter with Godfrey-Faussett.3.1\u000d\u000a      The results of the Kenyan trial were inconclusive, but the Zambian trial\u000d\u000a      demonstrated that preventive therapy with twice-weekly isoniazid for six\u000d\u000a      months reduced the incidence of TB among people with HIV.\u000d\u000a    Based on these findings, Godfrey-Faussett, currently on secondment to\u000d\u000a      WHO, led the development of new WHO guidelines on IPT use. With WHO\u000d\u000a      support, Godfrey-Faussett undertook pioneering research between 1999 and\u000d\u000a      2004, integrating TB and HIV care at primary care level, featuring IPT as\u000d\u000a      a key intervention.\u000d\u000a    Starting in 1999, Grant undertook a series of studies addressing\u000d\u000a      obstacles to IPT implementation, collaborating with South African\u000d\u000a      researchers, in the setting of the intense TB epidemic in South African\u000d\u000a      gold mines. An observational cohort study demonstrated effectiveness of\u000d\u000a      IPT among people with HIV and a past history of TB (for whom IPT was not\u000d\u000a      previously recommended in WHO guidelines).3.2 Using an\u000d\u000a      innovative study design, 1,655 HIV-positive male employees of a South\u000d\u000a      African gold-mining company were offered enrolment in HIV care, in a\u000d\u000a      randomly-allocated sequence. Key findings were that enrolment in a clinic\u000d\u000a      offering IPT (300mg daily for six months, self-administered) to these gold\u000d\u000a      miners reduced TB incidence by 38% overall, and by 46% among individuals\u000d\u000a      with no prior history of TB, although post-IPT TB incidence in this\u000d\u000a      setting remained unacceptably high.3.3\u000d\u000a    Further work led by Grant included a meta-analysis showing that the risk\u000d\u000a      of developing isoniazid resistance after IPT was small.3.4\u000d\u000a      Qualitative work in South Africa identified that health care worker\u000d\u000a      perceptions were a major barriers to IPT use. In 2010 Grant was\u000d\u000a      commissioned by WHO to produce a systematic review of TB\/HIV integration\u000d\u000a      which directly informed updated WHO guidelines on TB\/HIV collaborative\u000d\u000a      activities.3.5\u000d\u000a    In the `Thibela TB' trial (2004-12) Grant, with colleagues in South\u000d\u000a      Africa, led a cluster-randomised study of community-wide IPT among gold\u000d\u000a      miners in South Africa, as a population-level strategy to control the TB\u000d\u000a      epidemic. This study enrolled 24,221 miners to start IPT &#8212; the largest\u000d\u000a      number of people ever to receive IPT in a clinical trial. Prior to\u000d\u000a      enrolment, nurses used clinical criteria to screen participants for active\u000d\u000a      TB and increased risk of isoniazid toxicity using a questionnaire and\u000d\u000a      chest radiograph. Study-defined IPT-related adverse events were checked at\u000d\u000a      each study visit. Key findings were that adverse events were extremely\u000d\u000a      rare, and IPT could be safely implemented by nurses using clinical\u000d\u000a      criteria.3.6 The main study results are currently in press.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43528","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1036973","Name":"Mozambique"}],"Funders":["Wellcome Trust","Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Data and new algorithms developed by LSHTM researchers are fundamental to\u000a      ongoing global\u000a      strategies to combat TB. As a direct result of their research and case\u000a      findings, and their wide\u000a      experience in the field and in terms of TB service provision at community\u000a      level, LSHTM has been\u000a      called upon to advise policy-makers at the highest level.\u000a    The impact of LSHTM research is clearly evidenced by current WHO guidance\u000a      promoting the\u000a      integration of HIV and TB services. This guidance is based on LSHTM's\u000a      ProTEST research where\u000a      the case-finding approach was first formally articulated and recommended\u000a      in 20045.1 but has had\u000a      ongoing impact. WHO guidelines re-issued in 2012 stated: \"The [2004]\u000a      policy, which provided\u000a      guidance for Member States and other partners on how to address the\u000a      HIV-related TB burden, has\u000a        been one of the most widely accepted policies issued by both departments\u000a      ... more than 170\u000a      countries had reported implementing its components by the end of 2010.\"5.2\u000a    In 2010-2011, Ayles, Corbett and Grant undertook meta-analyses of data\u000a      from LSHTM's African\u000a      population surveys in collaboration with WHO and Centres for Disease\u000a      Control and Prevention\u000a      (CDC) and developed a simplified symptom-based screening algorithm that\u000a      relies on the absence\u000a      of all four clinical symptoms (current cough, night sweats, fever and\u000a      weight loss) to identify PWLH\u000a      who have less likelihood of active TB and hence are eligible for isoniazid\u000a      preventive therapy to\u000a      prevent latent TB infection. Use of this algorithm is included in WHO's\u000a      2010 revision of TB\u000a      guidelines. Wide dissemination through WHO and aimed at health care\u000a      workers, policy-makers\u000a      and health programme managers working in the field of HIV\/AIDS and TB\u000a      means the algorithms\u000a      now form a standard part of global diagnostic practice.5.3\u000a    The impact of LSHTM population surveys is demonstrated through WHO's\u000a      promotion, since 2011,\u000a      of prevalence surveys modelled after those developed by LSHTM as a key\u000a      measure to understand\u000a      the progress of TB control throughout the world. This guidance is included\u000a      in the new WHO\u000a      handbook published in 2011 designed for TB experts, survey investigators,\u000a      researchers and\u000a      advisors at national and international level. WHO says it has ensured the\u000a      standardisation of\u000a      methods across multiple surveys in more than 20 countries in African,\u000a      Eastern Mediterranean,\u000a      South-East Asian and Western Pacific regions. Ayles was lead author of\u000a      Chapter 6 which covers,\u000a      among other things, the purpose of interviews in a TB prevalence survey\u000a      and guidance on how to\u000a      design questionnaires. Findings and methods used in the ZAMSTAR project\u000a      are also heavily cited\u000a      in the workbook where it is featured as a full case study. LSHTM\u000a      approaches to design, sampling,\u000a      microbiology, data collection and analysis are offered as a template for\u000a      new studies.5.4\u000a    In 2012, Godfrey-Faussett chaired the WHO review of evidence that saw\u000a      LSHTM equivocal results\u000a      for the impacts of case-finding at a community level incorporated into new\u000a      guidelines on systematic\u000a      screening for TB. Based on LSHTM research, the resulting document sets out\u000a      basic principles for\u000a      prioritising risk groups and choosing a screening approach at community\u000a      level.5.5 Ayles and Corbett\u000a      were also members of the Guideline Development Group.\u000a    Also in 2012, WHO issued a new updated policy on collaborative TB\/HIV\u000a      activities for national\u000a      programmes and other stakeholders.5.2 Godfrey-Faussett was an\u000a      active member of WHO's Policy\u000a      Updating Group and Ayles acted as an external peer reviewer in the\u000a      preparation of this new policy\u000a      aimed at establishing and strengthening mechanisms for integrated delivery\u000a      of TB and HIV\u000a      services internationally. LSHTM findings and experience on the integration\u000a      of services for TB with\u000a      those for HIV through community-based organisations from the DetecTB\u000a      project are referenced\u000a      under the section on carrying out joint planning to integrate services.\u000a    Further impact has been made through LSHTM researcher participation in\u000a      international workshops\u000a      and meetings such as the Regional TB\/HIV Implementation Workshop and Core\u000a      Group Meeting of\u000a      the Global TB\/HIV Working Group held in Maputo, Mozambique, 10-12 April\u000a      2013. Ayles provided\u000a      an official commentary on the latest in TB diagnostic technologies to an\u000a      audience of &gt;120\u000a      participants, comprising key international partners (e.g. The President's\u000a      Emergency Plan for AIDS\u000a      Relief, Global Fund) and community and civil society representatives from\u000a      14 African countries\u000a      representing 70% of the TB\/HIV burden worldwide.5.6\u000a    WHO estimates that through the LSHTM-influenced collaborative TB-HIV\u000a      activities, more than\u000a      400,000 lives have been saved since 2005, and more than 3m PLWH are now\u000a      screened for TB\u000a      each year.5.7\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research carried out by LSHTM has had a major influence on the\u000a      development of international\u000a      strategies to screen for tuberculosis (TB) in HIV positive patients.

Despite this, in 2011, 8.7m\u000a      people fell ill with TB and\u000a      1.4m died. WHO has estimated in 2013 that among people living with HIV, TB\u000a      caused a quarter of\u000a      all deaths. Research conducted by Peter Godfrey-Faussett, Professor of\u000a      International Health\u000a      (joined LSHTM as MRC Training Fellow in 1989, Professor since 2005), Liz\u000a      Corbett (joined as\u000a      Wellcome Trust Clinical Training Fellow in 2000, Professor of Tropical\u000a      Epidemiology since 2012),\u000a      Helen Ayles (joined as Wellcome fellow in Tropical Medicine in 1998,\u000a      Senior Lecturer since 2007)\u000a      and other Department of Clinical Research researchers at LSHTM has been\u000a      responsible for\u000a      establishing the first clinical cohorts of HIV-infected and uninfected TB\u000a      patients in Africa, identifying\u000a      difficulties in diagnosis, and researching and developing effective new\u000a      strategies for screening and\u000a      treatment.\u000a    LSHTM researchers launched the ProTEST Initiative (1999-2004) to\u000a      demonstrate the feasibility of\u000a      providing collaborative TB\/HIV care for people living with HIV (PLWH) in\u000a      poor settings. ProTEST\u000a      facilitated collaboration between service providers. Voluntary counselling\u000a      and testing (VCT) acted\u000a      as the entry point for services including TB screening and preventative\u000a      therapy, clinical treatment\u000a      for HIV-related disease, and home-based and hospice care, in Zambia,\u000a      Malawi and South Africa.\u000a      Findings demonstrated that coordinating an integrated and comprehensive\u000a      package of services for\u000a      PLWH was relatively inexpensive.\u000a    Previous research by Godfrey-Faussett among Kenyan sex workers and South\u000a      African gold miners\u000a      (1995-1999) used molecular and conventional epidemiology to demonstrate\u000a      that most of the HIV-\u000a      related TB in these communities was due to ongoing transmission rather\u000a      than reactivation. Further\u000a      findings were that for PLWH, recurrent TB was more likely to be the result\u000a      of reinfection; recurrent\u000a      TB for HIV-uninfected patients was the result of relapse.3.1\u000a      These conclusions were reinforced by\u000a      similar findings from work by other LSHTM researchers working in other\u000a      South African goldmines\u000a      and in Malawi.\u000a    Population-based HIV and TB disease surveys conducted by Ayles and\u000a      Godfrey-Faussett (in\u000a      Zambia and South Africa, 2006), and occupational health surveys in mines\u000a      and factories by\u000a      Corbett (in South Africa 2001-2003 and Zimbabwe, 2004-2006), found\u000a      significant numbers of\u000a      undiagnosed TB cases, demonstrating that DOTS (the global control strategy\u000a      aimed at controlling\u000a      TB transmission through prompt diagnosis of symptomatic smear-positive\u000a      disease developed in\u000a      the 1990s) had failed to prevent rising TB incidence rates in Africa\u000a      brought about by the HIV\u000a      epidemic. The researchers concluded that new approaches were needed in\u000a      order to reach\u000a      international targets for reducing TB, and that epidemiological studies\u000a      could inform screening\u000a      algorithms for both detection and prevention of active TB.3.2-3.4\u000a    For case-finding strategies, LSHTM researchers administered two\u000a      large-scale community\u000a      randomised trials: DetecTB (in Harare, 2006-2009) and ZAMSTAR (in Zambia\u000a      and the Western\u000a      Cape Province, 2006-2010). DetecTB demonstrated that wide implementation\u000a      of active case-finding,\u000a      particularly with a mobile van approach, could have rapid effects on TB\u000a      transmission and\u000a      disease.3.5 In ZAMSTAR, two interventions (community-level\u000a      enhanced TB case-finding and\u000a      household level TB-HIV care) were implemented.

This included\u000a      working closely with Professor Sir Mike Richards, the government's first\u000a      National Cancer Director, mainly through policy-influencing initiatives\u000a      such as the National Cancer Action Team (2008-2013), the National Cancer\u000a      Policy Team, the Cancer Reform Strategy Advisory Board (April 2010) and\u000a      the National Cancer Intelligence Network (Scientific Advisory Panel\u000a      2010-2013).5.1\u000a    The CSG has also been responsible for producing the UK's annual official\u000a      national statistics on cancer survival since 1999, both nationally,\u000a      for various NHS geographies,5.2 and for the UK.5.3\u000a      Since 2008, this has included close collaboration with the Office for\u000a      National Statistics (ONS) analysing and publishing trends and\u000a      sociodemographic patterns in cancer survival for major cancers by age, sex\u000a      and socioeconomic status in England. These statistics and research are\u000a      used by policy-makers and key stakeholders at national and local levels to\u000a      evaluate and update cancer policy.\u000a    CSG research estimating the number of avoidable premature deaths arising\u000a      from the UK cancer survival deficit relative to Europe featured heavily in\u000a      the evidence underpinning the DH's National Awareness and Early\u000a        Diagnosis Initiative (NAEDI), launched in November 2008. Established\u000a      as part of the government's strategy to improve cancer outcomes, NAEDI\u000a      draws on CSG findings to support its key hypothesis that delays in cancer\u000a      diagnosis are linked to poor survival and avoidable deaths in the UK. As a\u000a      result, the government has focused its entire cancer strategy around\u000a      `halving the gap' in avoidable premature cancer deaths identified in LSHTM\u000a      research.5.4 In its 2011 assessment of NAEDI's impact on NHS\u000a      costs and public benefits, the DH found that `earlier diagnosis is\u000a      generally cost-effective, but not cost-saving. If people are diagnosed\u000a      earlier ... the benefit is a substantial improvement in health outcomes'.\u000a    Building on NAEDI, in 2010, the DH commissioned the CSG to design and\u000a      execute survival comparisons for the International Cancer Benchmarking\u000a        Partnership, a global partnership aimed at improving cancer survival\u000a      outcomes by optimising cancer polices and services, intended to feed\u000a      directly into England's national cancer strategy for 2011. The results of\u000a      CSG research were considered so important by the DH that publication of\u000a      the government's plans to reform health and care services, Improving\u000a          Outcomes: a Strategy for Cancer5.5 was delayed\u000a      until the LSHTM-authored article in The Lancet3.4 was\u000a      accepted for publication and could be cited in the new strategy. This\u000a      article is the first one listed under `New evidence supporting the\u000a      development of this strategy', where it is described thus: `We now have\u000a      internationally comparable data which is more robust and up-to-date than\u000a      has been possible before'.\u000a    The 2010 Beral\/Peto criticism of the international survival comparisons,\u000a      upon which the government's cancer strategy is based, threatened to\u000a      undermine both official and public confidence. The CSG's independently\u000a      initiated research, published in rebuttal in 2011, provided policy-makers\u000a      with evidence of the robustness of comparisons derived from the national\u000a      cancer registration data for England.3.3 The DH initiated its\u000a      own review of the cancer registration scheme, but considered the CSG's\u000a      peer-reviewed research as the strongest plank of evidence for the\u000a      strategic utility of cancer registration in cancer control policy.5.1\u000a    In January 2013, the CSG was commissioned by the DH to develop interim\u000a      metrics to evaluate progress toward the central target in national cancer\u000a      control policy (i.e. to `save 5,000 lives' a year by 2014-2015.) CSG\u000a      researchers developed several such metrics, and wrote Annex C of the\u000a      second annual report of the DH's 2012 report, Improving Outcomes: A\u000a          Strategy for Cancer.5.6 The DH then commissioned\u000a      the CSG to update these estimates with the results of the EUROCARE-5 study\u000a      in 2013, to assess progress in reducing the survival deficit.\u000a    Additional commissions from the DH during the REF's impact period include\u000a      the production of the indicators of cancer survival specified for the NHS\u000a      Outcomes Framework5.7 and the indicators of cancer survival for\u000a      the Clinical Commissioning Groups Outcome Indicator Set;5.8\u000a      both in January 2013.\u000a    Such has been the relevance of CSG's cancer survival research that during\u000a      the REF's impact period, Coleman has delivered invited presentations or\u000a      keynote lectures at more than 50 major national and international\u000a      conferences and meetings for policy-makers and stakeholders at the highest\u000a      levels.5.9 He has also been regularly called upon by national\u000a      and international media to provide expert information based on the CSG's\u000a      research.5.10\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    The core target in the government's national strategy for cancer control\u000a      in England is to `save 5,000 lives a year by 2015'.

LSHTM's Cancer Survival Group (CSG),\u000a      led by Michel Coleman (Professor of Epidemiology and Vital Statistics at\u000a      LSHTM since 1995) and Bernard Rachet (Clinical Reader in Cancer\u000a      Epidemiology, at LSHTM since 2002, then Clinical Lecturer), and employing\u000a      three Research Fellows, was formed in 2005 (grants 1, 2, 4). Its goal has\u000a      been to identify, quantify and explain inequalities in survival,\u000a      specifically to inform health policy for improved cancer control. The\u000a      Cancer Survival Group now has more than 20 scientific staff, with\u000a      worldwide collaborations in cancer survival research and methodological\u000a      development.\u000a    Early work involved the evaluation of the effectiveness of the NHS Cancer\u000a      Plan (2000) in improving one-year survival in England, by explicitly\u000a      seeking acceleration in the underlying trends before (1995-1999), during\u000a      (2000-2003) and after (2004-2006) implementation of the Plan. The Group\u000a      took advantage of a natural experiment in that, despite NHS similarities\u000a      in England and Wales, Wales did not have a formal cancer plan until 2006.\u000a      They found that survival increased more quickly during 2004-2006 in\u000a      England than in Wales for about half the cancers examined. 3.1\u000a    The research underpinning the core target in the current national cancer\u000a      strategy in England (Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for Cancer, 2011)\u000a      was initiated by the Group in 2008, in collaboration with Professor Timo\u000a      Hakulinen (University of Helsinki) and Dr Manar Abdel-Rahman (University\u000a      of Khartoum). The Group developed a method to estimate the annual number\u000a      of cancer-related deaths within five years of diagnosis in Britain that\u000a      would not be expected to occur if relative survival were as high as the\u000a      highest levels observed in Europe.3.2 International comparisons\u000a      of survival from the EUROCARE programme were used to estimate trends in\u000a      `avoidable premature mortality' over the previous 15 years. This was done\u000a      as the product of the number of five-year survivors expected from life\u000a      tables and the difference in relative survival between each country in\u000a      Britain and the highest survival in Europe, summed across age group, sex,\u000a      type of cancer and country.\u000a    In August 2010, in a BMJ editorial, two eminent cancer\u000a      specialists, Valerie Beral and Richard Peto, dismissed international\u000a      comparisons of cancer survival involving the UK as `unreliable', on the\u000a      basis of two proposed errors in national cancer registry data. In\u000a      response, the Cancer Survival Group rapidly performed a full-scale\u000a      simulation of the proposed errors. This provided firm evidence to refute\u000a      the critique.3.3\u000a    In 2010, the Department of Health (DH) commissioned the Group to perform\u000a      a major international comparison of cancer survival involving six\u000a      high-income countries as part of the International Cancer Benchmarking\u000a      Partnership (ICBP). It showed that UK survival up to 2007 improved faster\u000a      than comparator countries for breast cancer, but not for cancers of the\u000a      bowel, lung or ovary.3.4 Subsequent analyses indicated that the\u000a      UK survival deficits are partly explained by later diagnosis and partly by\u000a      lower stage-specific survival.3.5, 3.6\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43532","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"149590","Name":"Tanzania"},{"GeoNamesId":"2245662","Name":"Senegal"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    To address the problem of overdiagnosis of malaria and convince\u000d\u000a      practitioners, national and\u000d\u000a      international policy-makers and aid donors of the value of change required\u000d\u000a      a multidisciplinary\u000d\u000a      approach of coordinated research, which LSHTM helped to provide as\u000d\u000a      summarised above.

Many countries have rapidly changed\u000d\u000a      policy &#8212; for example, in\u000d\u000a      Tanzania, roll-out of RDTs nationwide was completed by end 20115.6\u000d\u000a      (see also 5.1 who is the\u000d\u000a      person giving the presentation in 5.6).\u000d\u000a    LSHTM researchers have also engaged with other funders beyond the GFATM.\u000d\u000a      For example, their\u000d\u000a      advice is acknowledged in a recent National Audit Office report in the UK\u000d\u000a      which concentrated\u000d\u000a      heavily on the potential waste of resources if antimalarial drugs financed\u000d\u000a      by UK aid go to children\u000d\u000a      without malaria.5.7 The report acknowledged progress in\u000d\u000a      introducing testing for malaria but argued\u000d\u000a      this should go further, recommending on p. 12: `Specify milestones and\u000d\u000a      targets to reduce\u000d\u000a      unnecessary treatment by focusing drug consumption on positively tested\u000d\u000a      cases, in public and\u000d\u000a      private sectors,' reflecting the key message of LSHTM research.\u000d\u000a    Other LSHTM malaria experts have helped to spread the findings of the\u000d\u000a      research by Reyburn and\u000d\u000a      Whitty through their engagement activities with relevant stakeholders. For\u000d\u000a      example, Schellenberg\u000d\u000a      (Professor of Malaria and International Health, since 2005) included the\u000d\u000a      role of RDTs in reports\u000d\u000a      authored for the UK All Party Parliamentary Group on Malaria in 2011, 2012\u000d\u000a      and 2013.5.8 School\u000d\u000a      staff have also worked with the media to raise awareness and understanding\u000d\u000a      of the importance of\u000d\u000a      RDTs, for example Schellenberg's interview with the BBC World Service's Focus\u000d\u000a        on Africa\u000d\u000a      programme (September 2011), where he stated that testing is\u000d\u000a      `revolutionising malaria control'. This\u000d\u000a      interview attracted 10m listeners in Africa.5.9\u000d\u000a    The impact of the WHO policy change and subsequent national programme\u000d\u000a      changes has already\u000d\u000a      been considerable. A study in Senegal (which cited LSHTM work) found that\u000d\u000a      the change to pre-treatment\u000d\u000a      parasitological confirmation reduced ACT prescriptions from 72.9% of\u000d\u000a      malaria-like febrile\u000d\u000a      illness to 31.5%, reaching close equivalence to confirmed malaria (29.9%\u000d\u000a      of 584,873 suspect fever\u000d\u000a      cases). An estimated 516,576 courses of inappropriate ACT prescription\u000d\u000a      were averted, worth in\u000d\u000a      excess of $1m.5.10\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Malaria in Africa, traditionally diagnosed from fever symptoms, has been\u000d\u000a      massively overdiagnosed,\u000d\u000a      and other causes of fever missed.

Until 2010, it\u000d\u000a      was WHO policy to treat all children with fever in sub-Saharan Africa as\u000d\u000a      malaria, unless there was\u000d\u000a      an obvious alternative cause, leading to both unnecessary expenditure on\u000d\u000a      antimalarials and health\u000d\u000a      consequences for children with other causes of fever.\u000d\u000a    The scale of the problem of overdiagnosis of malaria was demonstrated by\u000d\u000a      a widely cited study in\u000d\u000a      2004 of over 17,000 patients in 13 Tanzanian hospitals led by Hugh Reyburn\u000d\u000a      (Senior Lecturer,\u000d\u000a      LSHTM since 2001) and Professor Chris Whitty (LSHTM since 2001, then\u000d\u000a      Senior Lecturer).3.1 This\u000d\u000a      showed that only 46% of the 2,062 people treated for severe malaria had Plasmodium\u000d\u000a        falciparum\u000d\u000a      parasites. Among patients aged &#8805; 5 years in medium transmission areas,\u000d\u000a      only 31.1% treated for\u000d\u000a      malaria had malaria. Of the patients with severe febrile illness\u000d\u000a      incorrectly treated for malaria, 66%\u000d\u000a      were given no antibiotics and 7.6% died. This paper alerted the public\u000d\u000a      health community to a major\u000d\u000a      preventable problem.\u000d\u000a    Reyburn and Whitty followed this with collaborative studies in East\u000d\u000a      (2004) and West (2009, 2010)\u000d\u000a      Africa showing that overdiagnosis of malaria in febrile patients was even\u000d\u000a      greater in outpatient\u000d\u000a      settings, where malaria is the commonest diagnosis and fever the commonest\u000d\u000a      presenting\u000d\u000a      syndrome. To address this they undertook trials of the effect of providing\u000d\u000a      rapid diagnostic tests\u000d\u000a      (RDTs) for malaria in outpatients in East Africa3.2 and\u000d\u000a      outpatients and peripheral clinics in West\u000d\u000a      Africa (several settings).3.3 In outpatients in both settings,\u000d\u000a      RDTs were sensitive and specific under\u000d\u000a      operational conditions, but clinicians ignored negative test results and\u000d\u000a      prescribed antimalarial\u000d\u000a      drugs in about half the cases. Where microscopic diagnosis of malaria was\u000d\u000a      present, RDTs had no\u000d\u000a      significant impact.\u000d\u000a    Economic analyses of the cost effectiveness and cost benefit of\u000d\u000a      introducing RDTs in a variety of\u000d\u000a      epidemiological settings, including modelling the reality that clinicians\u000d\u000a      often ignore test results,3.4\u000d\u000a      showed that except at the extremes of epidemiological malaria\u000d\u000a      transmission, introducing RDTs is\u000d\u000a      cost effective, but that this is very sensitive to assumptions on changes\u000d\u000a      in prescriber behaviour.\u000d\u000a      These analyses were done by PhD student Yoel Lubell, supervised by\u000d\u000a      Professor Anne Mills\u000d\u000a      (LSHTM since 1979), Whitty and Reyburn.\u000d\u000a    To understand clinician behaviour and its drivers, Clare Chandler (then\u000d\u000a      Research Fellow, LSHTM\u000d\u000a      since 2008) undertook a series of anthropological studies (2008-2013) on\u000d\u000a      clinicians' diagnostic\u000d\u000a      behaviour with respect to fever in East and West Africa.3.5\u000d\u000a      These showed that prescriber behaviour\u000d\u000a      was influenced by multiple factors, including peer opinion, and provided\u000d\u000a      the formative research\u000d\u000a      behind behavioural interventions. A barrier to clinicians reducing\u000d\u000a      overprescribing of antimalarials is\u000d\u000a      lack of alternative diagnoses. There is also a need to ensure\u000d\u000a      overtreatment with antibiotics does\u000d\u000a      not substitute for overprescribing antimalarials. Reyburn and Whitty\u000d\u000a      therefore undertook clinical\u000d\u000a      and microbiological studies of febrile children and adults who tested\u000d\u000a      negative for malaria. These\u000d\u000a      demonstrated a significant burden of bacterial diseases in severe cases,\u000d\u000a      but much lower in\u000d\u000a      outpatient cases, providing the data for guidelines on what to do when\u000d\u000a      patients were malaria-negative.3.6\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43612","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":["Medical Research Council","Royal Society"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    Two decades of research at LSHTM have made a vital contribution to\u000a      successful efforts to reduce\u000a      the number of deaths from malaria. Using WHO methods of estimation, it can\u000a      be estimated that\u000a      approximately 1m malaria-related deaths were prevented by LLINs between\u000a      2008 and 2013,\u000a      mostly among African children.5.1, 5.2 Although it is clearly\u000a      impossible to quantify the contribution of\u000a      LSHTM research to this development with precision, the leading role LSHTM\u000a      has played in this\u000a      field gives an indication of its key role in achieving this impact.\u000a    LSHTM research involving experimental huts has made a direct impact on\u000a      the WHO Pesticide\u000a      Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) whose authority in terms of the standardisation\u000a      and quality control\u000a      of ITNs is accepted by industry and donors. The experimental hut\u000a        methods and methods of ITN\u000a      field evaluation developed by LSHTM are described in WHO's Guidelines\u000a        for Laboratory and Field\u000a        Testing of Long-lasting Insecticidal Nets (2013).5.3, 5.4\u000a      On account of his research expertise,\u000a      Rowland played a leading role in drafting these guidelines5.4\u000a      and most of the techniques are now\u000a      too standardised for this second version to cite their origins. LSHTM's\u000a      influence is still visible\u000a      however, in the guidelines' use of Curtis' diagram of an experimental hut\u000a      (p.17) and LSHTM's\u000a      washing, field testing and quality control methodologies.\u000a    Much of WHOPES's work on ITNs prior to producing these guidelines\u000a      involved evaluating a large\u000a      number of datasets from field research in Africa, most of them produced by\u000a      LSHTM and\/or the\u000a      French IRD (Institut de recherche pour le d&#233;veloppement). Overall, LSHTM\u000a      contributed to the data\u000a      portfolio of 9 out of 11 LLIN products evaluated by WHOPES.5.3\u000a      The key role of the WHOPES\u000a      process is that it provides donors with a guarantee of product quality and\u000a      reliability; without this\u000a      guarantee, the very rapid scaling-up of LLIN procurement in the 2007&#8212;2010\u000a      period (&gt;140m nets\u000a      procured in 2010) would not have been possible. The importance of this\u000a      guarantee is illustrated by\u000a      the fact that the Global Fund will not allow its funds to be used to buy\u000a      nets not recommended by\u000a      WHOPES.\u000a    The risk assessment carried out by Lines and collaborators3.3\u000a      highlighted the fact that WHO was\u000a      still lacking a formal and documented position on the safety of ITNs. The\u000a      LSHTM work prompted\u000a      WHO to publish a general review of safety aspects and then to employ the\u000a      same team of\u000a      toxicologists who had worked with Lines to develop an extended generic set\u000a      of risk assessment\u000a      methods (revised edition 2012), using the same approach and format as in\u000a      the published paper.\u000a      This document (which also cites the original 2001 paper) gives\u000a      manufacturers of ITNs a protocol to\u000a      follow with regard to toxicology and safety.5.5\u000a    WHO's Global Plan for Insecticide Resistance Management in Malaria\u000a        Vectors (GPIRM), published\u000a      in 2012,5.6 represents a radical shift in technical strategies\u000a      for malaria vector control, and its\u000a      implications will take many years to implement. The plan quotes very\u000a      little actual data, but in\u000a      arguing that resistance can reduce effectiveness of vector\u000a      control, it relies heavily on 3.4, and\u000a      reproduces a figure from that article.\u000a    WHO's technical recommendations for insecticide resistance management\u000a        strategies, which\u000a      form the technical basis of the GPIRM implementation plan, were agreed by\u000a      a group of experts\u000a      convened by WHO in 2010, including Lines and Rowland. The meeting report5.7\u000a      quotes 3.4 as a\u000a      basic source. The meeting concluded that the use of mixtures of dissimilar\u000a      insecticides was one\u000a      of the most promising possible methods of resistance management, as had\u000a      been shown to be the\u000a      case by LSHTM research, and that manufacturers should be encouraged to\u000a      develop such\u000a      products. This recommendation was then included in the GPIRM plan5.7\u000a      and several manufacturers\u000a      have since started developing such `mixture' products, for example\u000a      Japan-based Sumitomo\u000a      Chemical5.8 and Swiss-headquartered Vestergaard Frandsen,\u000a      makers of Permanet 3.0.5.9 In 2010,\u000a      German chemical giant BASF announced an agreement with LSHTM and the\u000a      Innovative Vector\u000a      Control Consortium to develop a new generation of malaria prevention\u000a      products based on the\u000a      BASF insecticide chlorfenapyr, including a new LLIN;5.10 this\u000a      decision drew on formative work by\u000a      Rowland's group since 2003. Although these products are not yet in public\u000a      health use, they have\u000a      entered the WHOPES evaluation process and this manufacturers' investment\u000a      represents a\u000a      substantial commercial impact in itself, and clearly indicates that\u000a      manufacturers expect these to\u000a      gain significant market share in the next generation of vector control\u000a      products.\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Twenty years of comprehensive research into long-lasting insecticidal\u000a      nets (LLINs) by LSHTM\u000a      have contributed substantially to the prevention of around 1m deaths from\u000a      malaria between 2008\u000a      and 2013.

This case study describes LSHTM research into the\u000a      technical characteristics\u000a      required to make nets as effective as possible. Lead researchers were Dr\u000a      Jo Lines, Reader in\u000a      Malaria Control and Vector Biology, at LSHTM since 1984 (seconded to WHO\u000a      2008&#8212;2011); Mark\u000a      Rowland, Professor of Medical Entomology, at LSHTM since 2000; and Chris\u000a      Curtis, Professor of\u000a      Medical Entomology, at LSHTM from 1976 until his death in 2008. As so many\u000a      LSHTM\u000a      researchers made a contribution to research in this field, work\u000a      contributing to introducing and\u000a      distributing ITNs is described in a separate case study.\u000a    By 1993, LSHTM was already established as a leading player in developing\u000a      LLINs and work in this\u000a      area continued throughout the research assessment period.\u000a    LSHTM made numerous contributions to methods currently used for product\u000a      development testing,\u000a      epidemiological research and standardisation and quality control of ITNs\u000a      and LLINs. One major\u000a      contribution was the development and modernisation of experimental hut\u000a        methods. Experimental\u000a      huts were first used to evaluate insecticide treatments in the 1960s, but\u000a      LSHTM work introduced\u000a      more rigorous and innovative methods including Latin Square designs and\u000a      the genotyping of wild\u000a      mosquitoes after capture to measure the impact of insecticide resistance,3.1\u000a      carried out in 1999.\u000a    In 2001-2004, LSHTM researchers undertook a multicentre study that\u000a      compared various methods\u000a      of washing LLINs and testing their performance in three contrasting\u000a      settings.3.2 Other studies\u000a      investigated various non-pyrethroid insecticides, and found some to be\u000a      promising alternative\u000a      insecticides for bed nets.\u000a    During 1994-1996, when LSHTM was developing the first home treatment kits\u000a      for bed nets\u000a      (enabling users to re-treat nets with insecticide during washing) WHO\u000a      stated that ITNs were\u000a      considered safe, but did not provide supporting evidence. In 1999, LSHTM\u000a      employed two external\u000a      consultant toxicologists to carry out and publish a formal risk\u000a        assessment, together with Lines;3.3\u000a      the findings confirmed that the benefits of using ITNs in reducing\u000a      morbidity and mortality from\u000a      malaria were considerable and that the risk-benefit ratio was very\u000a      favourable.\u000a    In 2007\/2008, Rowland's group carried out further experimental hut\u000a      research in West Africa, in\u000a      response to the discovery that insecticide resistance genes in\u000a        mosquito vectors were\u000a      spreading rapidly. This research was the first to provide clear and\u000a      conclusive evidence that\u000a      resistance does reduce the effectiveness of ITNs.3.4\u000a    In 1993-1997, Curtis had studied methods of responding to or preventing\u000a        the emergence of\u000a        pyrethroid resistance in Anopheles vectors. He concluded\u000a      that there was no easy solution to the\u000a      problem of resistance management,3.5 but that deploying\u000a      mixtures of dissimilar insecticides was\u000a      among the most promising strategies. Investigation of various\u000a      non-pyrethroid insecticides found\u000a      some to be promising alternatives for bed nets.3.1\u000a    Recognising the grave threat that resistance presented to the future of\u000a      pyrethroid LLIN and the\u000a      long lead time required to develop new safe and effective alternatives,\u000a      LSHTM joined in strategic\u000a      partnership with WHOPES and pesticide and textile industry from 2002 to\u000a      identify and test new\u000a      active ingredients. Thus when WHO called in 2008 for the development\u000a        of products containing\u000a        new active ingredients, insecticide mixtures and combinations,\u000a      studies evaluating several\u000a      new products were already well advanced, including one formulation using a\u000a      synergist which has\u000a      since been marketed (as Permanet 3.0) and another more effective and\u000a      soon-to-be launched\u000a      product using the insecticide chlorfenapyr, which is new in public health\u000a      but has a long history of\u000a      use in agriculture.3.6\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43698","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"226074","Name":"Uganda"},{"GeoNamesId":"149590","Name":"Tanzania"},{"GeoNamesId":"1168579","Name":"Pakistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2300660","Name":"Ghana"},{"GeoNamesId":"1149361","Name":"Afghanistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"192950","Name":"Kenya"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research carried out by LSHTM has made an important contribution\u000a      towards reducing the number of deaths from malaria. Using WHO methods of\u000a      estimation, it can be estimated that approximately 1m malaria-related\u000a      deaths were prevented by LLINs between 2008 and 2013, mostly among African\u000a      children.5.1 This impact was brought about by net distribution\u000a      operations and investment decisions during the impact assessment period\u000a      (mostly in 2009-2010). The WHO policy that led to these operations, which\u000a      explicitly cites LSHTM research as supporting evidence, was first drafted\u000a      and announced shortly before the impact assessment period (in 2007).\u000a      Nevertheless, it is clear that the operations putting this policy into\u000a      practice did take place during the assessment period, and were equally\u000a      influenced and justified by the same research, as were the subsequent WHO\u000a      statements repeating and amplifying the initial policy announcement.\u000a    Following a very limited emphasis on vector control by WHO and leading\u000a      agencies in the 1990s, the late 2000s marked a strategic sea change. Since\u000a      2006, and supported by the evidence accumulated through the research, WHO\u000a      has been recommending ITNs\/LLINs as the default vector control\u000a        intervention for Africa, with indoor residual spraying (IRS) as a\u000a      possible alternative that might be preferable in some settings. The\u000a      relevant WHO report, Malaria Vector Control and Personal Protection5.2\u000a      acknowledges Curtis' work on the Study Group that produced it, as well as\u000a      Rowland's written contribution. It also cites numerous relevant LSHTM\u000a      outputs. This document set the scene for further strategic emphasis on\u000a      malaria prevention through ITNs\/LLINs.\u000a    In 2008, The Roll Back Malaria partnership (RBM) &#8212; the global framework\u000a      for coordinated action against malaria &#8212; made ITNs and LLINs the lead\u000a        intervention in its Global Malaria Action Plan.5.3 The\u000a      plan acknowledges the contributions of no fewer than six LSHTM researchers\u000a      and quotes a December 2007 briefing produced by Lines and colleagues for\u000a      the Department for International Development (DFID), which was based on\u000a      3.1 and 3.3 and itself highlighted LLINs as a central plank in the quest\u000a      to eradicate malaria.5.4 As part of the 2008 Global Malaria\u000a      Action Plan, `SUFI' (Scaling-Up For Impact) was proclaimed as a goal &#8212;\u000a      aiming to rapidly reach universal coverage for all populations at risk\u000a      with locally appropriate malaria control interventions, with 730m\u000a        LLINs to be distributed globally (about 350m in Africa) (5.3, p.\u000a      14). The impact paper in Pakistan and the implementation research that\u000a      followed led to the LLIN strategy adopted by the Global Fund for South\u000a      Asia (e.g. Pakistan and Afghanistan) 5.3 and by WHO for\u000a      conflict induced emergencies 5.5.\u000a    In 2008, following a series of publications arguing that the impact of\u000a      ITNs would be maximised only if they were given free to everyone in the\u000a      community (because of the `mass effect' demonstrated by Lines et al.3.3,\u000a        3.4), the UN Secretary-General announced a vision of universal\u000a        coverage to end malaria deaths.5.6 His message was that\u000a      LLINs, along with indoor residual spraying, would be made available to all\u000a      people at risk, especially women and children in Africa. It was based on a\u000a      WHO position statement on Insecticide-Treated Mosquito Nets which\u000a      was first published in 2007 and remained the standard WHO policy position\u000a      throughout the 2008-2013 period.5.7 The position statement\u000a      explains the reasons for this shift to universal coverage through the use\u000a      of ITNs, citing several LSHTM outputs as well as Lengeler's Cochrane\u000a      review of the earlier mortality trials. Subsequently, and following these\u000a      WHO recommendations, ITN distribution campaigns have mostly been\u000a      standalone and designed to provide nets for entire populations, with one\u000a      net provided for every two people (eg Uganda). The contributions of LSHTM\u000a      research and staff are acknowledged by the WHO unit responsible for global\u000a      WHO policy on this topic.5.8\u000a    Largely as a result of the strategic initiatives described, expenditure\u000a      on malaria control as a whole is expected to exceed $1bn throughout\u000a      2008-20135.1, 5.2 with some 40% to 60% of this being spent on\u000a      vector control (mostly nets).\u000a    Not all countries wish to rely on externally funded and free distribution\u000a      of all nets, and some prefer to develop approaches more readily\u000a      sustainable over the longer term. LSHTM research findings on the public\u000a      health value of commercial markets as a distribution mechanism for\u000a      ITNs, and their importance in achieving overall coverage levels,\u000a      encouraged several countries to promote a diverse and complementary\u000a      mixture of distribution channels.

Lead researchers\u000a      included Jo Lines, Reader in Malaria Control and Vector Biology, at LSHTM\u000a      since 1984 (seconded to WHO 2008-2011); Christian Lengeler, LSHTM Trial\u000a      Coordinator and Research Fellow 1992-1995; Peter Smith, Professor of\u000a      Tropical Epidemiology, at LSHTM since 1979; Chris Curtis, Professor of\u000a      Medical Entomology, at LSHTM from 1976 until his death in 2008; Mark\u000a      Rowland, Professor of Medical Entomology, at LSHTM since 2000, and Anne\u000a      Mills and Kara Hanson, Professors of Health Economics, at LSHTM since 1979\u000a      and 1990. Due to the number of LSHTM researchers contributing to research\u000a      into ITNs, work contributing to the technological development of LLINs is\u000a      described in a separate case study.\u000a    By 1993, the first major field trial of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs)\u000a      in Africa (in The Gambia) had shown a remarkably large reduction in\u000a      all-cause child mortality. However, to justify large-scale roll-out of\u000a      nets, replication across the range of eco-epidemiological conditions in\u000a      the region was needed. Lengeler, Smith and country researchers carried out\u000a      a series of field trials (in Burkina Faso, Kenya, The Gambia and Ghana)\u000a      between 1993 and 1996. The Ghana findings &#8212; similar to those in the other\u000a      countries &#8212; showed a reduction in all-cause child mortality of 17%.3.1\u000a      Supporting evidence on cost-effectiveness gathered by Mills and country\u000a      economists showed that ITNs were extremely cost-effective.3.2\u000a    A subsequent influential 2004 Cochrane review and meta-analysis by\u000a      Lengeler concluded that ITN coverage for a cohort of 1,000 children will\u000a      on average prevent 5.5 deaths per year across a wide range of\u000a      epidemiological settings in rural Africa. Further LSHTM epidemiological\u000a      trials conducted between 1995 and 2005 and included in the Cochrane review\u000a      confirmed that ITNs are effective against both falciparum and vivax\u000a      malaria in regions where the vector mosquito species are different (e.g.\u000a      the Amazon Basin and South Asia) but where mortality rates are lower, and\u000a      when deployed through other methods of implementation.\u000a    Also during 1993 and 1998, small-scale Tanzanian trials by Lines and\u000a      Curtis confirmed the entomological mode of action of ITNs, by recording\u000a      reductions in sporozoite rates in mosquitoes. This confirmed the\u000a      underlying mechanism of the `mass effect',3.3 which occurs when\u000a      the insecticide kills so many of the mosquitoes trying to feed through the\u000a      net that the transmission capacity of the local mosquito population as a\u000a      whole is reduced, protecting the whole community rather than just the\u000a      individual sleeper. The researchers argued that in order to obtain the\u000a      necessary levels of coverage, nets should be distributed free of charge to\u000a      everyone.3.4\u000a    In 2001-2005, LSHTM researchers conducted a series of detailed studies to\u000a      examine the role of local commercial markets in delivering mosquito nets\u000a      to end users, and showed that the coverage achieved by commercial markets\u000a      in nets is more equitable than that achieved by the sale of subsidised\u000a      nets by public health systems and projects.3.5 Further work in\u000a      2010-2011 demonstrated the epidemiological advantages of free distribution\u000a      of nets directly to pregnant women and infants through routine antenatal\u000a      and immunisation services.3.6\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43699","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1733045","Name":"Malaysia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1643084","Name":"Indonesia"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"298795","Name":"Turkey"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"1168579","Name":"Pakistan"},{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"},{"GeoNamesId":"1562822","Name":"Vietnam"},{"GeoNamesId":"453733","Name":"Estonia"},{"GeoNamesId":"1605651","Name":"Thailand"},{"GeoNamesId":"1210997","Name":"Bangladesh"},{"GeoNamesId":"1820814","Name":"Brunei"},{"GeoNamesId":"1668284","Name":"Taiwan"},{"GeoNamesId":"1269750","Name":"India"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The research directly resulted in a new smoking cessation support service\u000a      in England delivered by\u000a      text message, with tens of thousands of smokers signing up, as well as\u000a      considerable national and\u000a      international public interest in the txt2stop trial findings.

The trial was\u000a      undertaken between October 2007 and October 2010. The academic\u000a      co-investigators included\u000a      Professor Ian Roberts (LSHTM), Professor John Cairns (LSHTM), Dr Robyn\u000a      Whittaker (University\u000a      of Auckland), Professor Anthony Rodgers (The George Institute, Sydney,\u000a      Australia), Dr Phil\u000a      Edwards (LSHTM) and Professor Mike Kenward (LSHTM). The LSHTM team were\u000a      all based at the\u000a      School throughout the trial. A previous New Zealand based trial (the STOMP\u000a      trial) had suggested\u000a      that smoking cessation support delivered by text messaging was effective\u000a      in the short term; Free\u000a      and her team modified and developed STOMP's approach and were the first to\u000a      reliably report the\u000a      long-term effects of the intervention.\u000a    As part of the research, smoking cessation counsellors, cognitive\u000a      behavioural therapists and 62\u000a      potential participants reviewed all text messages from STOMP in a series\u000a      of focus groups, and\u000a      modifications were made based on their input. The LSHTM team added\u000a      additional content to the\u000a      intervention, employing a wider range of behaviour change techniques\u000a      including feedback\u000a      regarding the physical benefits achieved, advice and support in using\u000a      nicotine replacement therapy\u000a      and specific content designed to reduce relapse.3.1, 3.2\u000a    5,800 smokers who were willing to make an attempt to quit were randomly\u000a      allocated to txt2stop,\u000a      comprising motivational messages and behavioural change support, or to a\u000a      control group that\u000a      received text messages unrelated to quitting.3.3 Outcome\u000a      assessors were masked to treatment\u000a      allocation. The primary outcome was self-reported continuous abstinence\u000a      biochemically verified at\u000a      six months. All analyses were by intention to treat.\u000a    Biochemically verified continuous abstinence at six months was\u000a      significantly increased in the\u000a      txt2stop group, with txt2stop proving successful in 10.7% of cases versus\u000a      4.9% in the control\u000a      group. The study found that txt2stop worked well for all ages and across\u000a      all social groups.3.3\u000a    Free and colleagues thus demonstrated that the txt2stop mobile phone text\u000a      messaging smoking\u000a      cessation programme substantially increased quit rates at six months.3.3\u000a    The cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrated that the intervention was\u000a      cost-effective and cost-saving\u000a      when the future NHS costs saved (as a result of reduced smoking) are\u000a      included.3.4 Free\u000a      and colleagues also conducted a carbon footprint analysis of the smoking\u000a      cessation support\u000a      delivered by text message and demonstrated that carbon emissions were low\u000a      in comparison with\u000a      the health gains produced.3.5\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"43730","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2510769","Name":"Spain"},{"GeoNamesId":"3175395","Name":"Italy"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2802361","Name":"Belgium"},{"GeoNamesId":"2661886","Name":"Sweden"},{"GeoNamesId":"2782113","Name":"Austria"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"3190538","Name":"Slovenia"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The research was highly influential in informing the consultations and\u000d\u000a      legislative process leading to the adoption of the EU Directive on\u000d\u000a      Patients' Rights to Healthcare in Other European Countries.

In 2013 he commented that McKee's\u000d\u000a      work had `been particularly influential ... His analysis has helped to\u000d\u000a      shape the debate on issues such as cross-border health care and the\u000d\u000a      emerging debate on a European health care policy ... and has been a\u000d\u000a      reference point during legislative processes including the adoption of\u000d\u000a      directive 2011\/24\/EU'. 5.4 Bernard Merkel, former head of the\u000d\u000a      Commission's health strategy and health systems unit, responsible for the\u000d\u000a      proposals for the Directive, added that McKee's work had made an\u000d\u000a      `invaluable contribution' to providing answers to complex questions: `It\u000d\u000a      was regarded by policy-makers as an authoritative source and thus had a\u000d\u000a      significant influence both on the Commission's proposals as they evolved\u000d\u000a      and on the political process of consideration by the European Parliament\u000d\u000a      and the EU member states.'5.5 Isabel de la Mata, Principal\u000d\u000a      Advisor to the Directorate-General for Health and Consumers of the\u000d\u000a      European Commission, stated that, `This work has been very important and\u000d\u000a      influential to help us to develop the initial proposal for a Directive ...\u000d\u000a      LSHTM work has always been a basic tool to support our actions.'5.6\u000d\u000a      Throughout the impact assessment period, McKee held meetings with European\u000d\u000a      Commission staff every six months and maintained fortnightly contact.\u000d\u000a    Between 2008 and July 2013, McKee advised individual governments on\u000d\u000a      cross-border patient mobility, including those of Slovenia, Belgium,\u000d\u000a      Sweden, the Netherlands, Spain, Ireland and Austria &#8212; in most cases at\u000d\u000a      regular intervals. Regional governments in Italy also sought his advice &#8212;\u000d\u000a      and a former EU health policy advisor for the Veneto Regional Government,\u000d\u000a      Ilaria Passarani, praised the fact that, `he successfully reached the very\u000d\u000a      difficult goal of bridging the gap between research and policy'.5.7\u000d\u000a      In the UK, McKee's work was used by stakeholders preparing submissions to\u000d\u000a      the consultation on the adoption of the Directive, including for the\u000d\u000a      Scottish government (2008)5.8 and the Northern Ireland\u000d\u000a      Assembly.\u000d\u000a    At UK and international level, McKee also communicated his findings to\u000d\u000a      health care stakeholders. In January 2009, he gave a presentation at the\u000d\u000a      Royal College of Physicians (RCP) to an audience of RCP experts,\u000d\u000a      government representatives and UK and EU stakeholder organisations. A\u000d\u000a      similar audience was reached by his editorial in the BMJ\u000d\u000a      (co-authored with Paul Belcher of the RCP) in July 2008.5.9\u000d\u000a      Belcher, in his role as senior EU advisor to the RCP and board member of\u000d\u000a      the European Public Health Alliance, commented that McKee's work had\u000d\u000a      proved `invaluable ... Without this evidence base, our ability to\u000d\u000a      influence political developments in Brussels would have been greatly\u000d\u000a      weakened'.5.10\u000d\u000a    McKee and Legido-Quigley advised the General Medical Council on patient\u000d\u000a      mobility and the Directive throughout the impact assessment period,\u000d\u000a      feeding into the Council's thinking on ways to respond to concerns about\u000d\u000a      the mobility of medical professionals. At international level, McKee\u000d\u000a      advised the European Union of Medical Specialists, a professional\u000d\u000a      organisation of EU doctors. For the European Health Forum based in\u000d\u000a      Gastein, Austria, McKee presented insights into the effects of the\u000d\u000a      economic crisis on European health policy in May 2013.\u000d\u000a    EU countries have until 25 October 2013 to implement the Directive.

Together with Legido-Quigley, he contributed a study\u000d\u000a      on Ireland, using interviews with health officials on both sides of the\u000d\u000a      border, which found that although there was a general presumption that\u000d\u000a      people on both sides suffered from an unmet need for hospital services,\u000d\u000a      mortality and utilisation data failed to confirm this.3.2\u000d\u000a    A subsequent study (2012) found that the special needs of people retiring\u000d\u000a      to other European countries were not being adequately met.3.3\u000d\u000a      It and other work by the team concluded that a compromise was needed to\u000d\u000a      ensure access to care without damaging the sustainability and integrity of\u000d\u000a      national health systems.3.4 A further European Observatory\u000d\u000a      output (2008)3.5 using a variety of methods including\u000d\u000a      literature reviews, patient surveys and interviews, highlighted the need\u000d\u000a      for national and European commitment to patient safety.\u000d\u000a    Drawing on evidence collected from two major projects, in 2008\u000d\u000a      Legido-Quigley and colleagues examined how quality of health care can be\u000d\u000a      safeguarded across the EU.3.6 They found that given the\u000d\u000a      enormous diversity of health systems in member states, Europe-wide\u000d\u000a      legislation to mandate a single approach was not realistic, and that the\u000d\u000a      proposed Directive was likely to leave details of possible mechanisms to\u000d\u000a      national governments.\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44153","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    UK antibiotic prescribing rose progressively until 1997 then fell\u000a      markedly until 2000 since when it has risen slowly. There is a link\u000a      between the use of delayed prescriptions and the fall in prescriptions\u000a      that can be traced to the first Southampton study (1997) of delayed\u000a      prescribing for acute infections. Sharland et al reported (in 2005) an 18%\u000a      reduction in national antibiotic prescribing for children in the five\u000a      years after 1997 due to a progressive divergence between antibiotics\u000a      prescribed and antibiotics used. The authors concluded that GPs were\u000a      adopting delayed prescribing, \"introduced after widespread dissemination\u000a      of trial results supporting this practice\". This impact continued through\u000a      the REF assessment period, demonstrated by an Ipsos MORI household\u000a      questionnaire survey in January 2011 which showed that 14.2% of adults in\u000a      England had been offered a delayed prescription for antibiotics [5.1],\u000a      and the recent national MRC-funded DESCARTE study - that showed delayed\u000a      prescribing was used in 18% of sore throat consultations, reducing\u000a      complications and reconsultations as effectively as immediate antibiotics.\u000a    The rise in antibiotic prescribing highlights the importance of\u000a      guidelines for primary care that, influenced by our research, discourage\u000a      the immediate prescription of antibiotics and advocate delayed\u000a      prescribing. The long-term impact is in reducing the risk of antibiotic\u000a      resistance and saving NHS resources due to fewer antibiotic prescriptions\u000a      and repeat consultations.\u000a    The wealth of research, and recognition of antibiotic resistance as a\u000a      public health priority, spurred NICE to commission guidance for managing\u000a      RTIs focusing on novel prescribing strategies. The recognition of\u000a      Southampton's central role in generating the evidence led to Little being\u000a      invited to chair the NICE guideline group [5.2]. Integral to the\u000a      formulation of this guidance - and referenced in it - were the Southampton\u000a      trials for sore throat, chest infection and otitis media. The guidance\u000a      (CG69, 2008) endorsed delayed prescribing or no offer of antibiotics for\u000a      all acute RTIs by GPs, emergency departments and walk-in centres. NICE\u000a      made conservative assumptions that the guidance would save &#163;3.7 million\u000a      annually [5.2].\u000a    Building on the NICE guidance, the Health Protection Agency published its\u000a      Management of Infection Guidance for Primary Care in the UK (2010) [5.3].\u000a      Referencing the Southampton trials, the guidance advises delayed\u000a      prescription for otitis media, sinusitis and bronchitis and also uses and\u000a      references Southampton's UTI diagnostic work. Williamson and Everitt, on\u000a      the strength of their research, were asked to draft two Drug and\u000a      Therapeutics Bulletins (DTB) for sinusitis (2009) [5.4] and\u000a      conjunctivitis (2011) [5.5]. DTB is owned by BMJ Group, provides\u000a      independent advice for doctors, pharmacists and healthcare professionals,\u000a      and is described as essential reading for practising doctors by the House\u000a      of Commons Health Select Committee.\u000a    The research also informed Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network\u000a      (SIGN) guidance on sore throats (guideline 117, 2010) for the NHS in\u000a      Scotland [5.6], and has been central to guidance bulletins\u000a      published by the Medicine Resource Centre, which is attached to the\u000a      National Prescribing Centre, and read by GPs across the UK. It is also\u000a      forming the basis of online training for existing and future GPs. The\u000a      Royal College of General Practitioners appointed Moore as its Antibiotic\u000a      Resistance champion in 2011, and has developed online modules on treatment\u000a      of RTIs and UTIs (with input from Little and Moore), with one module based\u000a      on delayed prescribing [5.7].\u000a    The impact is felt internationally with guidelines that remain in force.\u000a      Southampton studies laid the foundations for a change in policy of the\u000a      American Academy of Paediatrics which updated its Guideline for the\u000a      Diagnosis and Management of Acute Otitis Media in 2013 [5.8]. It\u000a      generated controversy in the United States, representing the first time a\u000a      US health organisation had advised a wait-and-see approach in the form of\u000a      delayed prescription.\u000a    The European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases\u000a      issued guidance on the management of sore throats (2012), referencing the\u000a      Southampton trials and the University's research on sore throats [5.9].\u000a      The guidelines are read by GPs and doctors in emergency departments around\u000a      the EU. The research on delayed prescribing has also been used as the\u000a      central recommendation in Israeli guidance on managing otitis media in\u000a      Israel, in force throughout the REF assessment period [5.10].\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Research by the University of Southampton has contributed significantly\u000a      to reducing the global threat of antibiotic resistance.

A\u000a      recent major effort to raise awareness of antibiotic resistance commenced\u000a      with a 1998 report The Path of Least Resistance by the Standing\u000a      Medical Advisory Committee, which advised DH. Highlighting that 80% of UK\u000a      human prescribing occurs in primary care, the report recommended the\u000a      National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) develop new\u000a      guidelines on antibiotic prescribing by medical practitioners. In 2008\u000a      NICE reported that 25% of the UK population visited their GP with RTIs\u000a      each year, costing &#163;24.3 million and accounting for 60% of GP antibiotic\u000a      prescribing.\u000a    Starting in the mid-1990s, and continuing currently, a research group at\u000a      the University of Southampton's Faculty of Medicine embarked on a series\u000a      of trials to assess the effectiveness of different antibiotic prescribing\u000a      strategies for acute infections. The key team members are Paul Little,\u000a      Professor of Primary Care Research (employed at Southampton since 1993),\u000a      Ian Williamson, Senior Lecturer in Primary Care (since 1987), Michael\u000a      Moore, Reader in Primary Care Research (since 2004), and Hazel Everitt,\u000a      Clinical Lecturer in General Practice (since 1999).\u000a    In the first trial, funded by DH and published in the British Medical\u000a        Journal in 1997 [3.1], 700 patients with sore throats\u000a      received one of three antibiotic prescribing strategies: immediate\u000a      prescription, no prescription and, if symptoms did not settle after three\u000a      days, delayed prescription. The research represented a novel approach in\u000a      developing open designs, allowing them to assess not only the\u000a      effectiveness of the different strategies but, crucially, the\u000a      `medicalisation' of illness - that is, the effect of prescription on\u000a      patients' belief in the power of antibiotics and their intention to\u000a      reconsult their GP.\u000a    The research found that prescribing antibiotics for sore throats - one of\u000a      the most common respiratory illnesses for which people consult GPs - does\u000a      not reduce the extent and duration of symptoms. However, the strategies of\u000a      offering no antibiotics or delayed prescribing significantly reduce\u000a      patients' use of antibiotics, their belief in antibiotics and their\u000a      intention to consult and reconsult their GP in future.\u000a    Similar findings of the limited benefit and medicalising effect of\u000a      immediate prescriptions followed in DH-funded studies of antibiotic\u000a      prescribing strategies for acute otitis media (2001) and sinusitis (2007)\u000a      and Medical Research Council-funded studies of lower respiratory tract\u000a      infections (RTIs) (2005) and conjunctivitis (2006) [3.2-3.5].This\u000a      led to substantial further funding to the group for RTI research,\u000a      including the NIHR-funded PRIME Programme (2008-13, &#163;1,999,000) and the\u000a      MRC PRIMIT trial (2007-2013, &#163;1,282,000).\u000a    In the case of lower RTIs, the academics showed a delayed prescribing\u000a      strategy is preferable to no offer of a prescription in limiting\u000a      reconsultations [3.3]. In further DH-funded research, similar\u000a      trials involving urinary tract infection (UTI) concluded antibiotic use\u000a      can be reduced by either a 48-hour delayed prescription or by offering\u000a      delayed prescription if results of diagnostic dipsticks are negative [3.6].\u000a      All the trials resulted in the same key recommendation to GPs: avoid or\u000a      delay prescribing antibiotics as part of a national strategy to reduce the\u000a      risk of antibiotic resistance.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44154","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"}],"Funders":["Medical Research Council"],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    Southampton research into depression assessment has had significant\u000d\u000a      impacts on UK healthcare\u000d\u000a      guidelines, on GP practice, and &#8212; the trial evidence suggests &#8212; on patient\u000d\u000a      well-being.\u000d\u000a    The 2009 NICE depression guideline CG90 made direct reference to\u000d\u000a      Thompson, Kinmonth and\u000d\u000a      Kendrick's findings that attempts to improve the rate of recognition of\u000d\u000a      depression by GPs using\u000d\u000a      education had not improved recognition or outcomes [5.1]. It also\u000d\u000a      referred to Kendrick's (2005)\u000d\u000a      finding that, while the probability of prescribing antidepressants was\u000d\u000a      associated with GPs' ratings\u000d\u000a      of severity of depression, almost half of the people offered\u000d\u000a      antidepressants were not depressed\u000d\u000a      according to a validated measure [3.3]. Following Kendrick, the\u000d\u000a      guideline recommended (page\u000d\u000a      118): \"When assessing a person with suspected depression, consider\u000d\u000a        using a validated measure\u000d\u000a        (for example, for symptoms, functions and\/or disability) to inform and\u000d\u000a        evaluate treatment\"\u000d\u000a      (Recommendation 5.2.13.4) [5.1]. The subsequent NICE quality\u000d\u000a      standard on the assessment of\u000d\u000a      depression issued in March 2011 recommended the use of a formal rating\u000d\u000a      scale for symptom\u000d\u000a      severity, and was endorsed by the British Association for\u000d\u000a      Psychopharmacology, the British\u000d\u000a      Psychological Society, the College of Mental Health Pharmacy, the College\u000d\u000a      of Occupational\u000d\u000a      Therapists, Depression Alliance, MIND, the Royal College of Nursing, and\u000d\u000a      the Royal College of\u000d\u000a      Psychiatrists [5.2].\u000d\u000a    A performance indicator for assessment of depression was introduced into\u000d\u000a      the QOF in April 2006\u000d\u000a      which had a sustained impact on care through to 2013. This made direct\u000d\u000a      reference to the findings\u000d\u000a      of Kendrick and colleagues, stating (page 141): \"GP global assessment\u000d\u000a        of severity does not accord\u000d\u000a        closely with more structured assessment of symptoms (Kendrick et al.\u000d\u000a        British Journal of General\u000d\u000a        Practice 2005; 55:280-286). Assessment of severity is essential to\u000d\u000a        decide on appropriate\u000d\u000a        interventions and improve the quality of care\" [5.3]. Thus,\u000d\u000a      QOF points (giving increased funding)\u000d\u000a      were awarded for the assessment of depression at diagnosis using validated\u000d\u000a      symptom\u000d\u000a      questionnaires. Other researchers, including David Goldberg (at the\u000d\u000a      Institute of Psychiatry), Linda\u000d\u000a      Gask (University of Manchester) and Christopher Dowrick (University of\u000d\u000a      Liverpool) had shown that\u000d\u000a      global GP assessment was inaccurate, but it was Kendrick and colleagues\u000d\u000a      who demonstrated that\u000d\u000a      GP treatment with antidepressants was poorly targeted as a result.\u000d\u000a      Kendrick, Gask and Dowrick\u000d\u000a      were members of the mental health expert advisory group for the QOF.\u000d\u000a    The impact was immediate, widespread and sustained throughout the REF\u000d\u000a      assessment period.\u000d\u000a      NHS data from all UK general practices show that a total of 2,402,400 new\u000d\u000a      episodes of depression\u000d\u000a      were diagnosed and recorded by GPs between April 2008 and March 2013\u000d\u000a      inclusively, of which\u000d\u000a      2,213,485 (92.1%) were assessed using symptom questionnaires [5.4].\u000d\u000a    In 2009 another indicator was added to the QOF, promoting follow-up\u000d\u000a      assessment of depression\u000d\u000a      with symptom questionnaires 5 to 12 weeks after diagnosis. The QOF\u000d\u000a      guidance reminded\u000d\u000a      practitioners of the importance of follow-up [5.5], citing the\u000d\u000a      Southampton analysis of the GP\u000d\u000a      research database [3.5] (on page 110): \"Analysis of the GPRD\u000d\u000a        from 1993 to 2005 found that more\u000d\u000a        than half of patients treated with antidepressants only received\u000d\u000a        prescriptions for one or two months\u000d\u000a        of treatment\" [5.5].\u000d\u000a    Between April 2009 and March 2013, UK GPs reported completing a total of\u000d\u000a      1,109,284 follow-up\u000d\u000a      assessments using validated severity measures (74.0% of 1,497,914 eligible\u000d\u000a      cases) [5.4].\u000d\u000a    The Southampton group's observational research indicates that\u000d\u000a      questionnaire assessment has\u000d\u000a      improved the targeting of treatment for patients compared to the situation\u000d\u000a      prior to its introduction in\u000d\u000a      the QOF [3.4, 3.6]. GPs' decisions to start or change treatment,\u000d\u000a      or refer patients, became much\u000d\u000a      more in line with NICE guidance than before the introduction of the\u000d\u000a      indicators. There is also trial\u000d\u000a      evidence of benefit on patient outcomes of symptom questionnaire\u000d\u000a      assessment and monitoring. A\u000d\u000a      2012 primary care trial in the USA found that questionnaire feedback led\u000d\u000a      to increased remission\u000d\u000a      and response rates among patients with depression [5.6]. This is\u000d\u000a      consistent with systematic review\u000d\u000a      evidence of clear benefit of monitoring in terms of patient outcomes from\u000d\u000a      research in psychological\u000d\u000a      and psychiatric practice [5.7].\u000d\u000a    Patient experience of the use of questionnaires has been positive, as was\u000d\u000a      shown by qualitative\u000d\u000a      interviews in 2007-8 led by Geraldine Leydon (Reader, at Southampton since\u000d\u000a      2005) in\u000d\u000a      collaboration with Dowrick (Liverpool) and Amanda Howe (East Anglia).\u000d\u000a      Patients said they saw the\u000d\u000a      questionnaires as helpful adjuncts to medical judgment, and their use as\u000d\u000a      an indication that their\u000d\u000a      depressive symptoms were taken seriously [5.8]. The requirement to\u000d\u000a      use symptom questionnaires\u000d\u000a      has been somewhat controversial, however. Some GPs complained that\u000d\u000a      questionnaires cannot be\u000d\u000a      used with patients with language or literacy difficulties, are sometimes\u000d\u000a      inaccurate, and may be\u000d\u000a      intrusive in sensitive consultations. Research led by Leydon showed some\u000d\u000a      GPs considered their\u000d\u000a      clinical judgment more important than questionnaires, and were concerned\u000d\u000a      that questionnaires\u000d\u000a      reduced the human element of the consultation and were a threat to their\u000d\u000a      professionalism [5.9].\u000d\u000a      Symptom questionnaires are now an optional component, rather than a\u000d\u000a      requirement, of the\u000d\u000a      structured assessment of depression promoted by indicators in the QOF\u000d\u000a      (2013) [5.5]. However, an\u000d\u000a      email survey in October 2013 of Hampshire general practices asking about\u000d\u000a      their use of depression\u000d\u000a      symptom questionnaires since these became optional showed that more than\u000d\u000a      half of practices\u000d\u000a      were still using questionnaires to aid the assessment of selected patients\u000d\u000a      [5.10].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    Southampton's research into the management of depression highlighted\u000d\u000a      deficits in the way GPs\u000d\u000a      were assessing and treating depression, and demonstrated failure to\u000d\u000a      improve their performance\u000d\u000a      through education alone.

More than 80% of cases are\u000d\u000a      managed in primary\u000d\u000a      care, so effective management in primary care is crucial. However, in the\u000d\u000a      1990s management of\u000d\u000a      depression by GPs was found to be poor. GPs failed to recognise around\u000d\u000a      one-third of cases, and\u000d\u000a      most patients received either no treatment, or their treatment was\u000d\u000a      inadequate.\u000d\u000a    A study on the Swedish island of Gotland suggested education was the way\u000d\u000a      to improve GP\u000d\u000a      management of depression, so Southampton researchers tested that\u000d\u000a      proposition in the UK. The\u000d\u000a      Hampshire Depression Project (HDP) was a randomised controlled trial\u000d\u000a      (RCT), carried out\u000d\u000a      between 1994 and 1998, funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC) and\u000d\u000a      led by Chris\u000d\u000a      Thompson (Professor of Psychiatry, left 2003) and Ann Louise Kinmonth\u000d\u000a      (Professor of Primary\u000d\u000a      Care, left 1996). This trial (21,409 patients, 60 practices) was\u000d\u000a      ground-breaking in showing that\u000d\u000a      guideline-based education of GPs alone did not improve recognition of\u000d\u000a      depression or patient\u000d\u000a      outcomes [3.1]. From 1998 to 1999, Tony Kendrick (Professor of\u000d\u000a      Primary Care from April 1998 to\u000d\u000a      August 2010 and again since May 2013) led a new analysis of the trial's\u000d\u000a      findings, showing a lack of\u000d\u000a      impact on appropriate targeting of treatment. Only 15% of those with\u000d\u000a      possible, and 26% of those\u000d\u000a      with probable, major depression were prescribed the doses and duration of\u000d\u000a      antidepressants\u000d\u000a      recommended by guidelines [3.2].\u000d\u000a    Subsequent research led by Kendrick (694 patients, seven practices,\u000d\u000a      between 1999 and 2003)\u000d\u000a      showed that this poor targeting was due to inaccurate GP assessment. GPs\u000d\u000a      tried to follow\u000d\u000a      guidance to offer antidepressants to patients with more severe depression,\u000d\u000a      but their ratings of\u000d\u000a      severity were inaccurate when compared with the Hospital Anxiety and\u000d\u000a      Depression Scale validated\u000d\u000a      severity measure, and almost half of the patients offered antidepressants\u000d\u000a      did not have major\u000d\u000a      depression according to that measure [3.3].\u000d\u000a    Subsequently, NICE depression guidelines (2004) recommended symptom\u000d\u000a      questionnaires be\u000d\u000a      considered to aid assessment at diagnosis, and an indicator was introduced\u000d\u000a      into the GP contract\u000d\u000a      QOF (2006) to promote their use. Following this, Kendrick led further\u000d\u000a      research (2,294 patients, 38\u000d\u000a      practices in 2007-8) with Dowrick (Liverpool) and Howe (East Anglia),\u000d\u000a      which showed that decisions\u000d\u000a      to prescribe antidepressants, or refer for therapy, were significantly\u000d\u000a      associated with higher severity\u000d\u000a      scores on symptom questionnaires at diagnosis (p&lt;0.001) [3.4].\u000d\u000a    In 2007-8, Michael Moore (Reader, at Southampton since 2005) led an\u000d\u000a      analysis of the General\u000d\u000a      Practice Research Database (153,931 patients, 170 practices) showing that\u000d\u000a      more than half of\u000d\u000a      patients treated with antidepressants between 1993 and 2005 received\u000d\u000a      prescriptions for only one\u000d\u000a      or two months [3.5]. This contributed to the introduction of a\u000d\u000a      second indicator in the QOF (2009)\u000d\u000a      promoting follow-up questionnaire assessments 5-12 weeks after diagnosis.\u000d\u000a    Following the introduction of the follow-up indicator, Moore led further\u000d\u000a      research (604 patients, 13\u000d\u000a      practices, in 2010-11) showing that follow-up scores appeared to influence\u000d\u000a      decisions to change\u000d\u000a      treatment. After controlling for confounders, patients who showed an\u000d\u000a      inadequate response in\u000d\u000a      questionnaire score change at follow-up were nearly five times more likely\u000d\u000a      to experience a\u000d\u000a      subsequent change in treatment compared to those with an adequate response\u000d\u000a      (odds ratio 4.72,\u000d\u000a      95% confidence interval 2.83 to 7.86) [3.6].\u000d\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44466","Continent":[{"GeoNamesId":"6255146","Name":"Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255148","Name":"Europe"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255149","Name":"North America"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255147","Name":"Asia"},{"GeoNamesId":"6255151","Name":"Oceania"}],"Country":[{"GeoNamesId":"1668284","Name":"Taiwan"},{"GeoNamesId":"2750405","Name":"Netherlands"},{"GeoNamesId":"6252001","Name":"United States"},{"GeoNamesId":"290291","Name":"Bahrain"},{"GeoNamesId":"146669","Name":"Cyprus"},{"GeoNamesId":"953987","Name":"South Africa"},{"GeoNamesId":"934292","Name":"Mauritius"},{"GeoNamesId":"2077456","Name":"Australia"},{"GeoNamesId":"290557","Name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"GeoNamesId":"2963597","Name":"Ireland"},{"GeoNamesId":"2635167","Name":"United Kingdom"},{"GeoNamesId":"660013","Name":"Finland"},{"GeoNamesId":"6251999","Name":"Canada"},{"GeoNamesId":"294640","Name":"Israel"}],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000a    The evidence we published in 1997-1999 was reported to the UK Department\u000a      of Health's Standing Committee on Tobacco and Health (SCOTH) and\u000a      contributed, with similar evidence from studies of adults, to the growing\u000a      prominence of environmental tobacco smoke (or secondhand smoke) in health\u000a      policy during the past decade. The Thorax reviews were cited (on\u000a      screen) as the principal source of evidence underlying the UK Department\u000a      of Health's \"smoking babies\" TV advertisement campaign in 2003 (evaluated\u000a      in reference [A]). Before this campaign, 48% of adults spontaneously\u000a      mentioned second-hand smoke as an environmental risk to children's health\u000a      and this increased to 54% after the advertisements were broadcast.\u000a    The US Surgeon-General's 2006 report [B] and particularly our chapter\u000a      within it (chapter 6, reference 5 above) has been influential in\u000a      development of public campaigns to reduce exposure of children to parental\u000a      smoking, particularly in the United States. The US Environmental\u000a      Protection Agency's initiative on smoke-free homes and cars [C] refers\u000a      specifically to the Surgeon-General's report as evidence of adverse health\u000a      effects [D] and has prepared a multilingual brochure, available in\u000a      hardcopy and online [E], explaining the effects of secondhand smoke on the\u000a      health of young families.\u000a    Since 2008, legislation to ban smoking in private vehicles when children\u000a      are passengers has been introduced in several states of the USA: Arkansas,\u000a      California, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Utah and most recently\u000a      (June 2013) in Oregon. Similar bans exist in Australia, Bahrain, Canada,\u000a      Cyprus, Mauritius, South Africa, and United Arab Emirates. Legislation is\u000a      under consideration in Finland, Ireland, Israel, the Netherlands and\u000a      Taiwan [F].\u000a    The UK has been slower to develop similar initiatives, but the Action on\u000a      Smoking and Health (ASH) policy briefing in 2009 [G] built upon our\u000a      1997-1999 publications. Following the publication of the Royal College of\u000a      Physicians (RCP) Report in 2010 [H] (which was based in part on our\u000a      updated review of health effects in younger children [reference 6 above]),\u000a      a revised ASH briefing paper cited both the Surgeon-General's and Royal\u000a      College of Physicians' reports as evidence on parental smoking and\u000a      ill-health among children [I], and a January 2012 ASH factsheet on smoking\u000a      in cars refers to both the SCOTH and RCP reports as evidence of risks to\u000a      children [J]. At the time of writing (July 2013), political pressure is\u000a      building within the UK, particularly in Scotland [K], for legislation to\u000a      outlaw smoking in cars when children are present.\u000a    Online NHS guidance [L] specifically refers to the adverse effects of\u000a      parental smoking on the health of young children and advises: \"One of\u000a        the best things you can do to protect other people and children is to\u000a        keep your home and car smoke-free by smoking outside, as smoke can\u000a        linger for up to two-and-a-half-hours.\"\u000a    Thus, our work has had demonstrable impact on the direction of public\u000a      policy and publicity campaigns, both in the UK and overseas. We also note,\u000a      with amusement, that in 2012 a new Canadian version of Clement C Moore's\u000a      classic poem Twas the Night Before Christmas was published with\u000a      two lines (referring to Santa Claus's pipe) removed in an attempt to limit\u000a      children's exposure to images of smoking [M]. This must be a rare example\u000a      of epidemiological research having a cultural impact on the fictional\u000a      literature, but we hesitate to suggest that there will be any resulting\u000a      health benefits, except, perhaps, north of the Arctic Circle..!\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000a    Systematic quantitative reviews of epidemiological evidence linking\u000a      parental smoking with adverse respiratory health effects in childhood were\u000a      published in 1997-1999 in Thorax.

Anderson and Strachan were professors of epidemiology\u000a      throughout. All three have been in continuous employment at St George's\u000a      since 1993.\u000a    Although there had been a number of previous narrative reviews, our\u000a      papers were the first attempt at a quantitative meta-analysis of this\u000a      rapidly expanding evidence base. For this work, Cook and Strachan were\u000a      jointly awarded the 1999 European Respiratory Society \/ Astra Zeneca Prize\u000a      for Paediatric Respiratory Research in Europe.\u000a    The findings were summarised in a final review of the Thorax\u000a      series [4]. This described a consistent pattern for respiratory illnesses\u000a      and symptoms and middle ear disease with odds ratios of between 1.2 and\u000a      1.6 for either parent smoking, the risks usually being higher in\u000a      pre-school than in school aged children. For sudden infant death syndrome\u000a      the odds ratio for maternal smoking was higher at about 2.0. The results\u000a      appeared robust to adjustment for a range of potential confounding\u000a      variables. Significant adverse effects from paternal smoking even in\u000a      countries where few mothers smoked suggested a causal role for postnatal\u000a      exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, independent of any prenatal\u000a      effects of maternal smoking in pregnancy.\u000a    These meta-analyses were updated as a contribution to the US\u000a      Surgeon-General's report on Secondhand Smoking, published in 2006 [5], and\u000a      updated again in 2010 [6], as preparation for the UK Royal College of\u000a      Physicians' report on Passive Smoking and Children. The latest review [6],\u000a      focussing on respiratory illness in infancy, included 60 studies: twice as\u000a      many as had been considered in the original 1997 review of these outcomes\u000a      [1]. Despite this expanded evidence base, the conclusions of the original\u000a      reviews were sustained.\u000a    The original review series concluded [4] that \"substantial benefits\u000a        to children would arise if parents stopped smoking after birth, even if\u000a        the mother smoked during pregnancy. Policies need to be developed which\u000a        reduce smoking amongst parents and protect infants and young children\u000a        from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.\"\u000a    This was endorsed 12 years later [6]: \"Passive smoking in the family\u000a        home is a major influence on the risk of lower respiratory\u000a        illness in infants, and ... is particularly strong in relation to\u000a        post-natal maternal smoking. Strategies to prevent passive smoke\u000a        exposure in young children are an urgent public and child health\u000a        priority.\"\u000a    Over the intervening period, the adverse health effects of environmental\u000a      tobacco smoke achieved prominence in public health policy, through the\u000a      successful campaigns for smoke-free workplaces (including pubs and\u000a      restaurants) in many countries. Currently, the evidence that we assembled\u000a      in relation to risks to young children is being used to argue the case\u000a      against parental smoking in the presence of children, both in cars and in\u000a      the home.\u000a    "},{"CaseStudyId":"44467","Continent":[],"Country":[],"Funders":[],"ImpactDetails":"\u000d\u000a    The European Union (EU) has designated 2013 to be the \"Year of Air\"\u000d\u000a      during which a comprehensive review of the air quality policies has been\u000d\u000a      undertaken. To inform this review, the REVIHAAP (Review of Evidence on\u000d\u000a      Health Aspects of Air Pollution) project was co-funded by the EU DG\u000d\u000a      ENVIRONMENT and WHO Regional Office for Europe, to answer 24\u000d\u000a      policy-related questions about air pollution and health.

Anderson is a member of the Scientific Advisory\u000d\u000a      Committee and Atkinson is an advisor and contributor of evidence to\u000d\u000a      HRAPIE. Coefficients from time-series studies provide the key evidence\u000d\u000a      base for estimating response functions and cost-benefit analyses for all\u000d\u000a      gaseous pollutants.\u000d\u000a    Also, the observation that time-series analyses show similar effects of\u000d\u000a      short-term fluctuations in PM on health outcomes worldwide [D] buttresses\u000d\u000a      the argument that there is a causal association between respirable\u000d\u000a      particulate exposures and diverse health outcomes, including\u000d\u000a      non-respiratory mortality. This conclusion, linking time-series work with\u000d\u000a      chronic effects of PM, was also reached by the UK Department of Health\u000d\u000a      COMEAP in 2010 [E].\u000d\u000a    Results from time-series studies also underpin the 2011 COMEAP subgroup\u000d\u000a      report on UK Air Quality Standards, on which Anderson was a committee\u000d\u000a      member [F]. This used APED to update the WHO 2005 Air Quality Guidelines\u000d\u000a      [A] from which was developed a Daily Air Quality Index (DAQI) with\u000d\u000a      bandings indicating likely short-term health effects. The DAQI is now\u000d\u000a      implemented as a public information system online [G] and during periods\u000d\u000a      of high air pollutant levels, health warnings are incorporated into\u000d\u000a      national weather forecasts for the UK.\u000d\u000a    Time-series methods have been extended to studies of the effects of heat\u000d\u000a      waves and climate change. Although sulphate is a cooling agent, black\u000d\u000a      carbon and ozone could together exert nearly half as much global warming\u000d\u000a      as carbon dioxide. The complexity of these health and climate effects of\u000d\u000a      shorter-lived greenhouse pollutants needs to be recognised in mitigation\u000d\u000a      policies. Links between strategies to reduce greenhouse gases and public\u000d\u000a      health outcomes were reviewed in 2009 by a consortium in which Anderson\u000d\u000a      and Atkinson were involved [H].\u000d\u000a    Assessment of the relative importance of 67 risk factors, worldwide and\u000d\u000a      by region, formed part of the Global Burden of Disease 2010 project (GBD).\u000d\u000a      Anderson co-chaired the GBD subgroup assessing health effects of outdoor\u000d\u000a      air pollution, which evaluated both ambient particulate pollution and\u000d\u000a      ambient ozone [I]. An analysis of burden of disease due to air pollution\u000d\u000a      in the UK found that this had fallen by over 50% between 1990 and 2010,\u000d\u000a      reflecting mainly improvements in air quality over this time resulting\u000d\u000a      from effective environmental policies [J].\u000d\u000a    ","ImpactSummary":"\u000d\u000a    A sustained programme of epidemiological research at St George's,\u000d\u000a      spanning 20 years, has informed air pollution control policies in the UK\u000d\u000a      and internationally.

Three epidemiologists from St George's (Anderson, Atkinson and\u000d\u000a      Strachan) have served at length on COMEAP and associated committees over\u000d\u000a      the past two decades, a period which has seen outdoor air pollution\u000d\u000a      re-emerge as a public health concern.\u000d\u000a    All three have been in continuous employment at St George's since 1993.\u000d\u000a      Anderson has been professor of epidemiology and public health throughout.\u000d\u000a      Atkinson was initially a research fellow working with Anderson and was\u000d\u000a      promoted to senior lecturer in epidemiology in 2009. Strachan was\u000d\u000a      initially senior lecturer in epidemiology and was promoted to professor in\u000d\u000a      1997.\u000d\u000a    An early stimulus to this renewed interest in air pollution was the\u000d\u000a      observation that daily fluctuations in ambient levels of several\u000d\u000a      pollutants were associated with short-term variations in both fatal and\u000d\u000a      non-fatal health events at concentrations well below air quality standards\u000d\u000a      of the time. Our studies of daily mortality in London during 1987-1992 [1]\u000d\u000a      showed that ozone levels were associated with a significant increase in\u000d\u000a      all cause mortality on the same day; black smoke concentrations on the\u000d\u000a      previous day were significantly associated with all cause mortality; and\u000d\u000a      significant but smaller adverse effects were observed for fluctuations in\u000d\u000a      nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide.\u000d\u000a    Embellishment of this approach and its extension to 12 European cities as\u000d\u000a      part of the APHEA collaboration confirmed that, even at historically low\u000d\u000a      ambient levels, airborne particles had detectable short term effects on\u000d\u000a      mortality [2] and respiratory hospital admissions [3]. The consistency of\u000d\u000a      the results across cities with wide differences in climate and\u000d\u000a      environmental conditions suggested that these associations may be causal.\u000d\u000a      As published evidence accumulated to support short-term associations\u000d\u000a      between air pollution levels and adverse health effects, three\u000d\u000a      methodological issues required investigation:\u000d\u000a    Firstly, whether developments of the time-series methodology through the\u000d\u000a      1990s could explain differences in the results obtained from various\u000d\u000a      studies. This was addressed by the APHENA project which re-analysed, using\u000d\u000a      a standardized methodology, the largest time-series studies of mortality\u000d\u000a      from Europe and North America [4]. The findings obtained with the new\u000d\u000a      standardized analysis were generally comparable to those obtained in the\u000d\u000a      earlier studies, and were relatively robust to the data analysis method\u000d\u000a      used. This led to greater confidence in their relevance to public policy\u000d\u000a      on both sides of the Atlantic.\u000d\u000a    A second issue was whether selective publication and citation of\u000d\u000a      \"positive\" results, or undue focus on the most statistically significant\u000d\u000a      lag period between pollution measurement and health outcome, could have\u000d\u000a      overstated the epidemiological evidence. Our review of time series\u000d\u000a      analyses published up to 2002 [5] concluded that publication bias is\u000d\u000a      present in single-city time-series studies of ambient particles, and that\u000d\u000a      differential selection of positive lags may also inflate estimates.\u000d\u000a      However, short-term associations between particles and adverse health\u000d\u000a      effects remained positive and significant after correcting statistically\u000d\u000a      for publication bias.\u000d\u000a    A third issue of policy relevance was which components of the particulate\u000d\u000a      mixture (size, number, source, toxicity) are most relevant to health. We\u000d\u000a      investigated associations of a range of particle metrics with daily deaths\u000d\u000a      and hospital admissions in London [6]. This is one of few studies to\u000d\u000a      investigate particle numbers, rather than mass concentration, and found\u000d\u000a      that particle numbers were associated with daily mortality and admissions,\u000d\u000a      particularly for cardiovascular diseases whereas fluctuations in secondary\u000d\u000a      particles (nitrate and sulphate) were more important for respiratory\u000d\u000a      outcomes.\u000d\u000a    "}]
